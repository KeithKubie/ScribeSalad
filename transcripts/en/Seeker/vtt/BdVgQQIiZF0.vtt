00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:06.240
Magic mushrooms: we know what they do - but
do we know how they work?

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.380
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and you know
what fascinates me the most about science?

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.869
The fact that we're still learning new information
on things that have been around for thousands

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:18.869
of years.

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.119
Take psychedelic mushrooms, or Psilocybin
mushrooms.

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.189
These have been around since the prehistoric
times.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.279
There's even a theory, called the Stoned Ape
Theory, which proposes that humans evolved

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.780
from early primates through the use of psychedelic
mushrooms.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.100
They've been used in religious ceremonies
all over the world for centuries, and it's

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.100
suggested that the use of mushrooms and other
psychedelic drugs, are what formed the basis

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.180
of modern religion.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.660
Today, people use them mostly recreationally
- and while the effects of mushrooms are pretty

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.400
well-known, what's NOT well-known - is how
they actually work.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.640
Until now.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.920
A new study, published in Human Brain Mapping,
finds that psilocybin - the active chemical

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.540
in psychedelic mushrooms - is closely tied
to the parts of our brains that help us dream.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.090
Now logically, this makes sense.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.229
Psychedelic drugs are notorious for transporting
users into a heightened state of consciousness

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.210
- which explains why they're often used in
a spiritual context.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.170
The part of our brains that get activated
during dream sleep - are tied to the brain's

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.710
ancient emotion system.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.270
And when someone takes psychedelic drugs,
that area of the brain becomes uninhibited

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.510
- so their emotions seem to get "louder."

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.680
What's interesting, is that the ego system
- the part of brain that gives us our sense

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.700
of self - actually gets quieter and more disjointed,
under the effects of psychedelics.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.880
So it's believed that the "quieting" of that
ego system - is what allows our emotional

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.570
system to become louder.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.360
According to the author of the study, Dr.
Robin Carhart-Harris, psychedelics cause "ego

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.729
dissolution" - meaning they temporarily diminish
one's sense of having a firm and enduring

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:49.880
personality.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.190
At the same time, they widen the breadth of
associations made throughout the brain - which

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.850
is what enhances our creativity, and causes
that state of "expanded" consciousness.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.580
That also explains why they're sometimes used
in psychotherapy.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.060
Because they help patients facilitate an emotional
release.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.019
Speaking of emotional releases, I'm sure many
of you heard the news this week - about Hobby

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.540
Lobby and the Supreme Court Ruling allowing
them to deny contraception coverage for their

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.540
employees.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.670
At the risk of alienating half of our audience,
I will keep my opinions to myself on this

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.310
one - BUT I wanna remind everyone that we
have a new show called Test Tube - hosted

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.909
by Trace and myself - that's a lot like Dnews,
but focused more on current events.

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.579
We've got a new episode up, where Trace talks
all about the Hobby Lobby ruling - and what

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:33.579
it means for America.

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.680
So if you're looking to learn more about that
situation, we'd love it if you checked out

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.680
the show.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.000
You can find that episode - and many more
- over at youtube.com/TestTubeNetwork.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.610
In the meantime, if you've got any questions,
comments, anything you wanna say about this

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.319
episode - or psychedelic drugs in general
- leave em in the comments below.

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.189
Otherwise, thanks for watching!
