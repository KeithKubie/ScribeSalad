Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 15 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. I looked around at the men.

Speaker 2:          00:00:19       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:19       I was the only one looking around. All the other heads were bowed down. All of them praying. These men were going into battle. Real battle. We could literally hear machine gun fire in the distance where the battle would take place. These men had suffered an incredible number of casualties. They had every reason to pray.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       I was with Charlie company from one of the most hallowed units in the u s military. The first of the five oh six the band of brothers made famous by their unbelievable performance in World War II, which was documented in the book band of brothers, which became an HBO mini series of the same name. The first of the five oh six in Ramadi held the line on that tradition of glory and service and courage. There's nothing I can say that will do justice to the end, to the, to the admiration and the respect that I had for the first of the five oh six and that all of us seals had for the first of the five oh six the seals that I sent to work directly with the five oh six they became adopted by the five oh six red Currahee. That's one of the nicknames for the five Oh six and the seals that were directly, they're working with them absolutely loved the five oh six the Bible six represented everything good. I can imagine in a military team or any team, professional and disciplined and motivated and creative. The leadership in the battalion was absolutely outstanding.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       The battalion commander, he was the very essence of leadership. He was calm and direct and friendly and open minded and respectful and respected and his staff and the company commanders in the senior NCO, they had this unified thread between them, this bond, this connection, and it was that tradition in that sense, purpose and that standard of excellence and professionalism. It's hard to describe, but it was absolutely there and it was as real as the sand and the bullets and the guns. And so there I was, and this was early in my deployment to Ramadi with task unit bruiser and I was about to go out into the [inaudible] district with Charlie Company and their company commander was just an outstanding guy.

Speaker 1:          00:03:36       And I knew that this unit in this company, in this battalion, I knew it was something special and I knew that that term, the band of brothers, I knew that that's what they truly were. And we hear it and I know it's a book in, it's uh, it's a, it's an HBO series, but where does it come from now most people have heard that simple quote, we few, we happy few. We band of brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother. And I knew what that quote was. I knew where it came from. I was an English major in college and I knew that that was Shakespeare. And I knew that that was Henry the fifth.

Speaker 1:          00:04:35       And I knew how powerful that quote was. Now when you start talking about Shakespeare and you start talking about Henry the fifth, there's all kinds of different directions you can go because you can go back and you can look at what Henry the fifth was like in real life. And if he was like the leader that Shakespeare made him into into play. And you could talk about Shakespeare himself and the rumors and the, and the myths and the lay, the legends that circulate his life and his legacy. Because there's all kinds of questions about Shakespeare. I mean, did he actually write all of his place? Was He more than one person? Was he a soldier at some point? How did he know all this stuff about the military and what it was like to be a soldier? Was his vocabulary 10 times what a normal person is? There's all kinds of, like I said, rumor and myth about Shakespeare, but instead of talking about all that and, and the conjecture and the hypothetical questions, I would rather talk about something that is known, something that we have today.

Speaker 1:          00:05:56       And those are the words, words from the play. Henry the fifth, which yes was written by Shakespeare, and I'm going to tell you, don't be scared and don't be intimidated by that. I mean don't be scared and don't be intimidated by Shakespeare because you don't understand it because you can't. Then the fact of the matter is no one can, at least at first, it's not possible to understand Shakespeare out of the gate. It doesn't work. It's a nother language. It's, it's, it is a another language. You can't be expected to understand it. It's written in something called early modern English. You don't we speak English. This is early modern English, which is just a transition from something called middle English, and if you go on youtube and you look up middle English and you have somebody read, a real common one is, if you look at the Lord's prayer in middle English, you can barely understand it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       Parts of it, you can't understand parts of the world you recognize, but when you get to early modern English now with a step closer, but it still is. There's, there's, it's different. It's a different type of language and there's archaic words and there's obsolete words and there's words that Shakespeare just made up. He would make up words factually. And the patterns of speech are different in the idioms are different and the references are all historical. And so if you don't have a grasp on those mythological references and historical references and biblical references than it doesn't have the meaning that it's supposed to have. So you can't expect just to open up Shakespeare and be able to understand it. Now this is actually the opposite of what I often say because to me, you know, you hear me say all the time that what makes English show important is that you can make things very simple and very understandable by everybody. So then why is it important? Why should we read it? Why should we try and understand it?

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       And the answer that question is actually very simple. Shakespeare had something, he had something, he had some understanding, some knowledge, some, some insight into the human mind that is not normal. It's not normal. He understood people deeply. You understood relationships, he understood leadership, he understood love. And he understood war, and I don't know how he did this and I'm going to why he did, but he did. And on top of that, he had this talent. He had this gift to translate that knowledge into words. And this is important because in the late 15 hundreds in the early 16 hundreds this is a whole nother deal. There's no special effects. There's no close up shots of an actor. There's no stunt man, there's no CGI. Everything has to be contained in the words, all the emotion and all the feeling and all they action and all the nature of human beings. It all has to be captured in the words. And the words that Shakespeare uses are heavy

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       and they're also, they're power regnant their power regnant with so much more meaning than what's on the surface. They're filled with depth and knowledge that you have to scrape away and uncover to figure out what they're even talking about. But let's, let's take a look at this, this famous speech in Henry, the fifth, the play, the same name and I'm going to lead into it a little bit just to kind of at least set the context of what's happening. And as I did, as I went into my notes, just the opening, when you've got this guy that kind of comes out and describes to you what's going to happen in the play in the end, he kind of introduces Henry, they call him Harry and he introduces him with this line.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       Then should the war like Harry, like himself assume the port of Mars and at his heels leached in like hounds should famine, sword and fire crouch forward employment. So if you break that down, first of all he's coming out of the great out of the gate he's saying Harry is warlike, which means he's fond of war and skilled in it and equipped for it and in a more literal meaning, it's saying Henry is like war himself, which means he has complexities and the and the youth and the mayhem and the chaos inside himself. And then it goes on to say that he should assume the port of Mars, which means he should take on the bearing of Mars, which is the Roman God of war and at his heels. So, so down now by his feet. Leashed in hounds. So you've got dogs, angry dogs on leashes, and those dogs are famine, sword and fire. And in those days that was war because when you did siege warfare on somebody, you locked down their castle, you starve them. And once they were weekend, you burned their castle and then use the sword to finish him off. So he had those dogs of war at his side and they were crouched for employment. If you could imagine a pit bull just tents and coiled like a spring ready to pounce.

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       That's the opening to describe Henry.

Speaker 1:          00:13:01       So they're at war with France and they go to take down this town of horror fleur. And at this point, this is one of the other really famous speeches from Henry the fifth and at this point they've broken through the walls and there's a, there's a breach in the wall. So there's a, there's a hole in the wall, but the French are still defending it. The French are still defending it pretty well. And so Henry has a little chat with his troopers. And this is a pretty famous speech. And he says once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more or close the wall up with our English dead. So he's saying that hole in the wall, charge it charge at and either get through it or fill up the wall with our dead. And then he says in peace there's nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility. So when things are, when things are peaceful, being calm and being humble is a good thing. But when the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger. So when war comes, nevermind peace and calm, it's time to be like a tiger. And he says, stiff in the sinews. Summon up the blood, disguise fair nature with hard favored rage. So tense your body and summing up your rage.

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       Then lend the I a terrible aspect. Let pry through the portage of the head, like the brass cannon. Let the brow overwhelm it. So what he's saying there is furrow your brow and let your eye poke through your brow. Like a cannon, like a brass cannon sticking out of a porthole as fearfully as Dothan Gollad rock overhang. And Judie is confounded based swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean. So he's saying, make your brow over, hang your eyes like a rock that Drudge's out over the wild ocean. And then now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide. Hold hard the breadth and bend up every spirit to its full height. So you know what that one is? Bite down. Grit your teeth, flair your nostrils. Take a deep breath and hold it in and bring every emotion you have to its utmost and like, like a, like a tension on a bow on, on, you know, balist English, whose blood is Fed from fathers of war proof fathers. Like so many Alexander's having these parts from morning till even fought and she their swords for lack of argument. So he's saying, listen, you gotta fight, you gotta fight you. You Englishman whose blood is from combat tested warriors like Alexander the Great and those men have fought on this soil from morning until night forever. And they only she their swords when there was no one else to fight.

Speaker 1:          00:16:55       Do not dishonor your mothers. Now a test that whom you called fathers did beget you don't dishonor your mom. Prove that your father with his warrior blood is really your father. Be Copy now to men of grocer blood and teach them how to war. And that means being an example to the lesser man, to the weaker man and show them how to war and you good yeoman who's limbs were made in England? Show us here the metal of your pasture. So yeoman, we're basically like the troopers that foot soldiers in the archers and he's saying show us how you were born in England and the pasture. That's where you were raised like a cow was raised on a pasture. Show us what the metal of that pasture is. Let us swear that you are worth for your breeding, which I doubt not for there is none of you. So mean and base that half not know baluster in your eyes. So no matter where these guys are from, no matter what level of society they're they they came from, he sees the noble luster in the righteous gleam in their eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:18:24       I see you stand like grey hounds in the slips, straining upon the start now grey hounds, you know, now we use them for racing. They used to be used to have to run down animals and a slip is, and this is one of those things, you've got to look this up. I didn't know this, I looked it up today. A slip is an old kind of leash that they used for hunting dogs that when you, it was very, you could, you could basically hit a switch and it would let the dog go. So here are these pictures of these greyhounds that are in these quick release leashes, but they're straining on them weeding to go on the hunt to go in and chase down their prey. And the next line is the game's afoot. Follow your spirit and upon this charge, cry God for Harry England and St George. So he says the game's afoot, meaning that the animal that you're hunting, it's out there. Follow your spirit and then go and get after it. And as you get after it, Yell God for Harry England and St George and St Georges, St George's, the patron saint of England, the dragon slayer, who was an executed Christian martyr.

Speaker 1:          00:19:52       So you can see that there's so much insight, these words, and he captures some of the brutality of war. And so what happens now is they, they get the village that they're trying to take down and they've, you know, put a lot of pressure on. They've gone through the breach, they've gotten fight back, but now they've got them on the lockdown and he's telling them, he tells the governor, Henry tells the governor that he needs to surrender before Henry loses control of his own men. This is a scary thing. This is like, you know, hey, if you don't surrender now, I'm not gonna have control anymore. Right? Over these guys, these barbarians at the gate, they're going to come and I'm not going to have control over them anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:20:53       He says, yes,

Speaker 1:          00:20:55       the gates of mercy shall be all shut up and the flesh should soldier rough and hard of heart. And by the way flesh. It is an old word. It means excited by the taste of flesh. So he's saying these soldiers who are excited by the taste of flesh in liberty of bloody hand sell shall range with conscience wide as hell. So in liberty of bloody hand, you know what that means? It means our hands already covered in blood. I'm good. I'm just going to go forward. I don't care anymore. I don't care anymore with conscious wide as hell. Mowing like grass, your fresh fare virgins and your flowering infants. So we are going to come and we are going to mow like grass. Your virgin is and your children. That's that.

Speaker 3:          00:21:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:59       He goes on trying to convince them again, this is his key point is like, listen, I have control of these guys right now and he goes on, therefore you men of horror, fleur, take pity on your town and have your people. Whilst yet my soldiers are in my command wiles yet the cool and to wind of grace or blows the fill fee and contain just clouds of heady murder, spoil and villainy. So he's saying like right now there's, there's a cool breeze of peace and grace with my guys, but some contagious clouds are coming of murder and spoil and villainy and, and the word to use this heady is it means intoxicating, meaning these kinds are going to lose their minds if not, why in a moment, look to see the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand desire the locks of your shrill shrieking daughters. Your father's taken by the silver beards and their most river reverend heads dash to the walls, blind and bloody show to get. It's like blind with rage and blind with murder and foul hands. He's telling them this, you're naked infants. Spitted upon pikes

Speaker 3:          00:23:38       in spitted by the way, is a

Speaker 1:          00:23:43       methodology used in this time period for cooking small game, small animals. And it means you put the animal on a pole from mouth to rectum and he's saying they're going to do this to their children

Speaker 1:          00:23:58       walls. The madd, mothers with their howls, confused, do break the clouds, as did the wives of jewelry at how at Harrods bloody hunting slaughterman so break the clouds. That means cries to the Madd. Mothers are going to go mad with tiers like they did in the Bible in Matthew Two 16. That's what this is referring to. When King Herod ordered the slaughter of all boys under the age of two in Bethlehem, this is like a threat that they're going to kill all the children. So Henry the fifth is bringing it home. What say you, will you yield and of this avoid or guilty in defense be thus destroyed.

Speaker 1:          00:24:52       So the French hearing these pretty valid threats coming, uh, they surrender. They Henry and the troops take that village and then the next thing they do is march in. And again, I'm moving rapidly through a real war that took place and they end up settling on the opposing ends of a field, which is now what's becomes the, the famous battle of it. Some people call it as in court or Agincourt and the French, they, they got more people. I mean, it's in France. So they've got more people, substantially more people. And there's a bunch of different, you are on the books, I've read, there's varying numbers, but they definitely had substantially more people. And Henry, he's talking to some of his leadership, his subordinate commanders, and then they all kind of walk off the stage and he's left there and he starts talking a little bit about the burden of command and, and some thoughts on leadership, which I was, I found very familiar. So he says upon the king, let us our lives, our souls, our debts are careful wives, our children and our sins lay on the king. We must bear all. So he knows that the king is responsible for everything. Got To take ownership of everything.

Speaker 4:          00:26:37       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:26:41       And he, he kind of talks about this idea that the king is, it's, you know, it's, it's the expression of it's lonely at the top. He's about to get into that in whatever it was, 1599 oh ceremony show me. But I worth, what is the soul of adoration? Art, thou ought else but place, degree and form. So he's saying like, what is all this junk besides just social rank and etiquette? What real meaning does it have creating all in fear in other men wearing in vow art, less happy being feared than they inferior. So he's saying, look like these people are scared of me. [inaudible] I'm actually less happy than they are. They're, they're afraid of me, but I'm less happy because I'm the guy that's scaring them.

Speaker 1:          00:27:38       I am a king that find the, and I know tis not the bomb, the sector and the ball, the sword that may face the crown imperial, the Inter tissued robe of Golden Pearl, the Farsad title, running for the king, the throne he sits on nor the tide of pump that beats upon the high shore of this world. So he go through all of the kind of stereotypical things that make you a king, you know the clothes, the Septor, the crown, all those things. No, not all these thrice gorgeous ceremony. Not all these laid in bed majestical so not any of those beautiful things. Expensive things can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave. So it's the slave who with a body filled and vacant mind gets him to rest, crammed with distressful bread. So he's talking about this fact that the king doesn't get to rest.

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       He doesn't get to sleep when the slave goes home at night. Yeah, he's gonna eat the Fed with and distressful basically. That means that they made it themselves. They made with their own hands, they actually get some satisfaction of making their food and eating it. He didn't even get that satisfaction. His mind is constantly churning about the fate of the kingdom. And you know this actually, interestingly, when I was in a, I know we did a podcast here about Sri Lanka and I talked about me being in Sri Lanka and I, I tried to drag is because again, I'd never been in combat. This is the mid ninety's. And I tried to drag as much knowledge as I could out of the Sri Lankan guys, the Shawangunk and military in this trunk and Special Boat Service in this special forces guys that we were working with. And they were unbelievably, uh, combat experienced veterans.

Speaker 1:          00:29:37       But one of the guys that I befriended who is an army captain and you know his, he, he was one of those guys who's a guy that was a good leader. But man, he felt exactly what this got what, what Henry the fifth is talking about here. And I remember him saying, you know, he's kind of just having a late night conversation with me. Cause like I said, I was constantly trying to garner information from these guys and learn from them. And you know, he gets this guy had been at, this guy, had been a regular soldier and then he had been promoted. He'd gone up the ranks and he said, you know, Jocko, when I was a soldier, meaning when he was just a grunt soldier and you know, lower enlisted guy, he said, I knew I could survive anything and I knew I could take care of myself. And it was actually kind of fun.

Speaker 1:          00:30:30       And he said, now that Omar Company commander, cause now we use actually a pretty senior guy. He said, it is the most stress in it is the most harrowing thing because I am not worried about myself anymore, but I'm so worried about all these other guys. That's what the worry is. And Yeah, I uh, I actually got to know that feeling myself. Hmm. The leader gets no rest in the end. And what Henry's talking about is that burden of command. That's the same thing that Sri Lankan guy was talking about. And you hear me talking about it as well. You know, that burden of command is heavy.

Speaker 1:          00:31:13       And now, so now, you know, again, I've kind of gone very quickly through what this, to get to this point where we're Henry the fifth makes this famous speech. And as I said, the English on one side of the battlefield in the French or the other. Again, this really happened, this is, this is factual information and they can hear each other and they can not at night they see each other's campfires burning in any English. Like I said, they know they're outnumbered. And finally one of the leaders, you know, as they're, as they're getting ready to go into combat, one of the leaders from the British side, he calls out kind of like wishing that they had more men. And it's interesting and it's pretty important to know that, I mean, obviously Shakespeare fictionalized this in many ways, but that speech is actually rooted in a real account.

Speaker 1:          00:32:06       It's rooted in a real account of something that was said. And, and, and the account was written by an anonymous chaplain that was like on tour with these guys. And he just wrote down what he saw. And in his report it was the, uh, a guy named Sir Walter Hungerford that suggested to the king that it would be nice if they had another 10,000 orchards from England that we're not doing anything, you know, that are sitting back doing, you know, back in England, sitting in peace. And it'd be nice if they had in there. And now in the play, it's a character named Westmoreland, who's one of, you know, this, the, the lieutenants or the, one of the, uh, subordinate leadership of Henry the fifth. And he says, oh, that we now had here, but one 10,000 of those men in England that do no work today. So he's saying that same thing. He's like, listen, here we are about to go to battle. We're completely outnumbered

Speaker 3:          00:33:05       and

Speaker 1:          00:33:09       be nice if we had some of those other guys that are in England right now that are sitting in bed, they're doing nothing. And so, so now King Henry Responds and, and again this is, this is in the same vein that was documented by this anonymous chaplain. And of course Shakespeare wrote it. So it's gotta be, it's a lot more impactful, but the message is the same. And I'm going to go through this once and kind of break it down. So, so that we can understand what the meaning of these different words are before I just roll through it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:42       So when he see her, this guy says, you know, if only we had more guys and King Henry says, what's he that wishes? So meaning who just set that said, my cousin Westmoreland. No, my fair cousin, if we are marked to die, we are enough to do our country loss and if to live, the fewer men, the greater share of honor. So he's saying, no, listen, if we're going to die, we've got plenty of guys here to die for our country. But if we're going to live and if we're going to win, the fewer men we have, the better because that's more honor for us.

Speaker 3:          00:34:25       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:34:27       God's will. I pray thee wish not one more man. He doesn't want anybody else by jove. I am not covetous for gold nor care I who doth feed upon my cost. So he doesn't care about gold. He doesn't care who he feeds and who, who eats off of his check that he is cashing. It earns me not if my men, my garments wear meaning isn't people. He didn't care if people are either taking his clothes or if they're wearing his world colors. It doesn't care. Doesn't care about any of that. Such outward things dwell not in my desires. Those things don't matter to him. But if it, if it be a sin to covet honor, I am the most offending soul alive.

Speaker 1:          00:35:21       So if it's about honor and if it's a sin to want honor and want glory, that he's the guiltiest person of a mall. No faith my Coz wish, not a man from England, God's peace. I would not so great an honor as a one more man me thinks would share from me for the best hope I have. Oh, do not waste one more. So he's just going off like, no, we don't want anyone else. I don't want to share my honor with anyone else. Rather proclaim it Westmoreland through my host that he, which hath no stomach to this fight. Let him depart his passport shall be made and crowns for convoy put into his purse. So is it okay? You know what, Westmoreland, as a matter of fact, tell everyone that anybody that doesn't have the guts or the stomach to stand here with us and fight, tell him I'll give him a passport and I'll give them money to pay for their trip home.

Speaker 1:          00:36:34       We would not die in that man's company that fears his fellowship to die with us. He doesn't want to die with anybody that fears that duty. That's what they mean by fellowship. The duty to die with us this day is called the feast of Crispian Crispian. This is actually alleged twin brothers. Interestingly, Crispin Crispian twin brothers, they help the poor and they preach Christianity and they were tortured by the Roman governor and they were thrown into the river with millstones, tied around their necks and they survived and when they survive that, they pulled him out of the water and they beheaded them.

Speaker 2:          00:37:24       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:37:25       They were venerated and they became saints on October 25th and that's called Saint Crispin's Day. Sometimes it's called sync crispy ins day, but that's what it is. So this day, this is October 25th when they're about to fight, he says, this day is called the feast of Crispian. He that outlives this day and comes home safe. We'll stand a tiptoe when the day is named and rouse him at the name of Crispian. Is there anybody that anybody that lives through this day and comes home safe when it's going to be Saint Crispin's Day, they're going to get on their toes. They're going to be so excited about it. He that she'll see this day and live old age, will yearly on the vigil feast, his neighbors and say, tomorrow is Saint Crispian. So again, anybody that lives through this is going to be going to their neighbors and say, hey, tomorrow Saint Crispin's Day,

Speaker 2:          00:38:22       then

Speaker 1:          00:38:24       will he strip his sleeve and show his scars and say these wounds I had on Crispin's Day, so he's gonna be at their feet. He's going to roll up his sleeves and he's going to say, you see these scars? These are what I got on Crispin's Day old men forget yet all shall be forgot. But he'll remember with advantages what feats he did that day. So he's saying everything gets forgotten, right? But the old man will remember the glory days of that battle and what he did, it will be the highlight of his life. Then our names familiar in his mouth as household words. Harry, the King Bedford and Exeter, Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester be in their flowing cups, freshly remembered. So all their names are going to be remembered. This story shall the good man teach his son and Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by from this day to the ending of the world. But we in it shall be remembered. We say, look, this is a story that good men are going to tell their sons and their gonna forever. Remember on this day till the ending of the world, what we did, we few, we happy few. We band of brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother. And that one doesn't really need an explanation,

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       but we just shared. You hear about Brotherhood a lot.

Speaker 4:          00:40:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:22       Be He ne'er so vile this day shall gentle his condition. So no matter where you're from, no matter what you were like, no matter what kind of a person you were today, when he says gentle his condition that today we'll make you a gentleman today we'll make you a man and gentlemen in England. Now we're bed. So guys that are back in England right now sleeping shall think themselves or curse it. They were not here and hold their manhoods cheap whilst any speaks that fought with us upon Saint Crispin's Day. So like I said, anyone that's home in England and that word a bed, it's like implies being lazy and sleeping. They're going to curse that they weren't there and they'll know that they weren't real men. And Emma, he used the word manhood, which implies, you know, testicular fortitude [inaudible] they didn't have the testicular fortitude to fight. And that's, that's

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       the speech with the understanding. And I haven't even gone all the way. I mean, I didn't go to break down each and every word and the depth and meaning behind them because they are so impactful.

Speaker 1:          00:41:53       And if you go and you read, you can get like a translated modern version, um, that kind of dumbs down the language and that's okay. But I'm telling you, having done both, when you do that, that's like compared to actually doing the work and studying and figuring out what it all actually means. If you just take a dumbed down version, it's like Diet Shakespeare or Shakespeare, right? It's, it's actually worse than that. It's like that. It's like firing a cap gun versus firing a real gun. It kind of looks the same. And it might even sound a little bit the same, but one of them will kill you. Yeah. And the other one just goes bang. You know, it's not as heavy. And what's really bizarre, and this is, I think actually this is really strange. If you go on Youtube and you look up Henry the fifth St Crispin's Day speech, right? If you look it up, you'll get these classically trained actors famous. I mean, famous actors doing this speech and in my mind, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:43:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:14       They don't get it. They don't get it. Right. And I bet you know what, I know I'm a nobody. I know I'm just some guy in these people are people that studied Shakespeare and did it on stage and all of a sudden I'm just an ignorant, uh, you know, Rach from the trenches and I don't understand I am the pentameter and all the other little details, but I'm telling you, I don't think they get it. And when I watch the professionals do this, I don't think they get the emotion. I don't think they understand the leadership. I don't think they get the fear and the blood and the death. And I don't think they understand war. And when these actors

Speaker 1:          00:44:04       take these great words better crafted brilliantly, and they try and say them like leaders to me, they still sound like actors. They don't sound like men that have fought. They don't sound like men that had seen battle. They definitely don't sound like men that have seen war. I think Henry, the fifth would have sounded different. This is what I think would be closer to what Henry the fifth a combat leader would have sounded like as he, as he answered some one of his subordinate leaders out there in the crowd saying that we need more people. We need more men. I think this is what he would have sounded like.

Speaker 1:          00:45:05       What's he that wishes? So my cousin Westmoreland, no, my fair cousin, if we are marked to die, we are enough to do our country loss and if to live the fewer men, the greater share of honor, God's will. I pray thee wish. Not One more man by jove. I am not covetous for gold nor care I who doth feed upon my cost. It earns me not if men, my garments wear such outward things dwell not in my desires, but if it be a sin to covet honor, I am the most offending soul alive. No faith, my Coz wish, not a man from England. God's peace. I would not lose so great an honor as one man more me thinks would share from me for the best hope I have. O do not wish one more. Rather proclaim it Westmoreland through my host that he which hath no stomach to this fight. Let him depart his passport shall be made and crowns for convoy shall be put into his purse. We would not die in that man's company that fears his fellowship to die with us.

Speaker 1:          00:46:44       This Day is called the feast of Crispian. He that outlives this day and comes home safe. We'll stand a tiptoe when the day is named and rouse him at the name of Crispian. He that shall see this day and live old age will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors and say, tomorrow is Saint Crispian. Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars and say these wounds I had on Crispin's Day old men forget yet all shall be forgot, but he'll remember with advantages what feats he did that day. Then shall our names familiar in his mouth as household words. Harry, the King Bedford and Exeter, Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester be in their flowing cups, freshly remembered this story shall the good man teach his son and Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by from this day to the ending of the world. But we in it shall be. Remember it, we few, we happy few. We band of brothers for cook for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother. Be Ne'er so vile this day shall gentle his condition and gentlemen in England now a bed shall think themselves or curse it. They were not here and hold their manhoods cheap was any speaks that fought with us upon Saint Crispin's Day.

Speaker 1:          00:48:55       Now that is a speech and that is, like I said, there's a lot more to it then what I covered, there's so much depth there and that's why it's lasted the ages and that's why you hear people talking about brotherhood and this is what they refer to. And as far as Shakespeare goes, and I talk all the time about getting stronger and faster and getting smarter and stronger and faster.

Speaker 4:          00:49:35       That's okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       I mean that's pretty straightforward. How do you get stronger and faster? You lose weight, you workout, you do your calisthenics, you do physical activity to get stronger and faster. But how do you get smarter? Well, this is one way to get smarter. You go out and you find something that you do not understand and you gain understanding of it. Words you don't know and phrases you don't know and concepts that you don't know. You find them and you learn them. You teach yourself. The resources are there, and by the way, you know what? It's free. There's no gym fees, there's no equipment to,

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       you can get all of Shakespeare, his entire cannon on the Internet for free. It's at the library for free. The only thing it does take in, the only thing it does cost is just a little something that we call discipline, right? To get in there, to open that book, to challenge your brain in order to free your mind. So that's Shakespeare. That's Henry the fifth and very impactful and definitely a classic representation of the band of brothers that I had the honor to work with

Speaker 5:          00:51:20       in Ramadi, Iraq in 2006 the first of the five oh six. And I guess it is time for questions from the Inter webs and uh, speaking of the interwebs, little something from Ana. Yes. Yeah. We are in fact sponsored by [inaudible] dot com boom. Which is where Jack, we'll get to this krill oil to keep, we'll say what? Aging joints. No, we'll just say joints did not deteriorating. We'll just say aging joints to keep his joints together. Um, sorry. I get some Alpha brain. That's why I'm so smart and my memory's so good. I'm actually encouraging you to take more Alpha brain. Yeah, it's up the game a little bit. What? It's good. Um, yeah. So on it.com and get some and you can get some, uh, get some kettle bells and some club bells and go and toss those things around and get yourself a little bit stronger.

Speaker 5:          00:52:28       Get them in on it. That myself. I've, I have a few Zombie bells at the house and you probably used Allen. I have them. I have them. They're my, they're my kind of go to when I have them sitting around because they, they do. They kind of draw you in because I see, what do I think when I see Zombie, when I see zombies, I think Zombie apocalypse. I think I've been rewriting something like, oh, it hit a couple of kettlebell snatches real quick while I got a little the little two minutes spare. Boom. Hold up there. And they're dope though. And apparently they're balanced just like regular ones. Yeah. No, they feel they feel not all it. You know when you can get them@onit.com o n n I t.com/jocko and you get 10% off. Boom. Get some shroom tech sport while you're the shroom texts.

Speaker 5:          00:53:16       I think lever as a public service. Yeah. If you're doing something that's high output, like a crossfit situations, that's a public telling you night and day anyway. Shroom tech sport. That's the one I'm going to go on the shirt to explore it, I think. I don't think. See what's up. Thank you. Shit it then what about the amazon.com yes. If you would like to support this podcast in a painless way, we'd call it painless, seamless, seamless, and painless squads. I seamless, instead of going straight to amazon.com go to Jocko store.com or Jocko podcast, buy a TV flat screen, plasma TV for $800. Right, and you could do it through, you do it through, you click through Jocko, podcast.com or Jocko store.com. Sure. Then in the podcast, get supported financially. Yeah. I get to like, you know a little little Samsung. That's cool. It's better than nothing.

Speaker 5:          00:54:13       Yeah, and it's, yeah, an actually Amazon pages because, because, yeah. That's cool because it takes time to do the podcast, right? It takes preparation. Do the podcast. Yeah, and you know what? I'm going to be honest, bro. I do it anyway. Obviously I think you would do, but we did it, but people ask though, they're like, hey, this is great. Let's to people, they'll, they'll sign up somebody, I guess other podcasts, they'll have situations where you can sign up and just enter your credit card and it'll take out like a dollar a month or something as like a thing. This guy, um, I for totally forget his name, such a cool way. Anyway, emailed me and told me that I was like, Dang, that's solid. But nonetheless we do that. It's necessary, but I dunno, I think we're just, maybe we'll research that because I deal with people would always say, hey, how can we support?

Speaker 5:          00:54:58       Because people are getting value and when they get value they want to give value. They want to give you something back, which is awesome. Yeah. I appreciate that. Yeah. Very cool. Very cool. Yeah. I mean the prep notes today, we're 17 pages long working on for the past few days. Yeah. Getting Ready. You know, that's like a term paper in college, you know those grinders total gut check. Yeah. It's like a 400 level term paper. My term papers or one page. Yeah, one paid college athlete over there and uh, oh yeah. One more thing about about Amazon. Somebody hit me up on Twitter and said, hey, you need to say on your podcast that you have your, your book extreme ownership is an audio book. Yeah. And what, what I think is cool about it is leaf who wrote the book with me? He's another seal. He worked with me in Ramadi and he and I are the ones that read it. So we each wrote chapters. We wrote half the chapters and we reread it. So you know if you're used to the Jocko podcast voice. Yeah. And annual life was on the podcast, obviously podcast number 11 so we get, you can get the audio book and you got another, it's eight hours long. It's no joke. If you got a long drive, eight hour drive. Yeah. Get she got an eight hour drive. Francisco from San Diego. Yeah. Yeah. That's one of those drives. It's good. Okay. Yeah. So Dzongkha store.com Jocko,

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       podcast.com all right. In on it. Oh in in it.com. Thanks. [inaudible] Bronco. Thank you. Alright, Internet questions. First question, kind of a paragraph with a question. You ever got some long questions Jocko. I'm just curious about your opinions on the regular army infantry. It seems like nowadays the regular infantry is almost looked down upon from the regular public in every prior military public speaker. I almost feel like we're looked at like we were just bodies that held ground and absorbed attacks. It may no real impact on the war. I'm almost hesitant to ask because I'm not sure if I can or I'm not sure if I'm in denial or if it's just pride. I served with some fantastic warriors and I don't want those heroes to be looked over in history because they were regular grunts. So I enjoy your opinions on this matter. And if you could enlighten me on how infantry divisions are looked at from other groups and organizations.

Speaker 1:          00:57:30       Yeah. Um, the, I'm this question, you know, it, it bothers me. It bothers me because if you couldn't tell from the opening that I did tonight talking about the first of five oh six I would tell you the same thing about so many other units that we have the utmost respect and admiration for what we used to call conventional for forces with an alcohol general purpose forces. But it's the marine corps, the the US Marine Corps, the U S Army there, they're regular infantry to ground pattern there grunts and we, like I said, the guys in my task and at the guys that own the seal teams, we have nothing but respect and admiration for the ground pounders for the grunts and for my position, you know, haven't been in Ramadi with the two to eight which was a reserve unit for Pennsylvania, that iron soldiers, those guys were outstanding, outstanding. And then they turned over with the 180 and you've heard me talk about them and the battalions that were attached to them, those guys were just the, all of them. I mean, they were just so professional, so brave. And of course special forces and seals and Rangers in Marsoc and af soc for whatever reason.

Speaker 4:          00:58:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:52       Special operations gets attention, right? I mean, the name is special operations, so it gets this attention. I'm not 100% sure where it comes from or where it started or whatever, but there's something about that that the public and the media,

Speaker 4:          00:59:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:09       And I don't know, the media feeds the public in the foot. The public feeds the media and the media feeds the public. So like the public wants to see stories. So the media produces stories about the special operations and then it goes into a vicious circle, a vicious circle, and they just make a bunch of new stories about it. And so, you know, it's like this little mystique or whatever of special operations probably that's, that's, that's having that impact. But let me tell you, or just for everybody, for anyone that's on, that's not been in the military that has that, you know, things. Oh, the special operations guys must be more, you know, elite or do more dangerous stuff. Wrong, wrong. Do they do dangerous stuff? Yes. But you know, I've been all in, when I was in Iraq, my first deployment to Iraq, when all over Iraq is SPEC, second deployment stayed in Ramadi.

Speaker 1:          01:00:02       But I during that time saw the conventional units, the general purpose forces that ground pounders are grunts, the Marine Corps. And not just them, but I talked about this last time, the, the logistics folks, I mean, so it's everybody, they're out there, they're living in forward operating basis. They're living in combat outposts in the middle of cities, you know, small groups out there eating Mras just living in really tough conditions, doing daytime patrols and horrible areas, working with Iraqi soldiers. Uh, you know, like I just said to doing these logistics runs, you know, these where you get blown up with an Iud, these are where you get ambushed. I mean, this is what they did all the time. Everyday. This was their job. Even like the mind clearance operations, you know, mind you going out and you're going out to go and get blown up or try and look for things that are going to blow you up.

Speaker 1:          01:00:51       And, and you know, you first, sure you got some guys that are in the big mind protected vehicles. But when we were in Ramadi, there was a Marine Corp unit that would follow behind those guys, sometimes in army or they would fall behind this. There's sniper infantry guys just out there getting after it. And so what do we think of that? I mean I have just admiration, respect and just utmost the utmost. I hold those guys in the highest esteem, um, because they held the line. So to, to that guy, the out there that asked that question, um, believe me, anybody that's been in combat and knows what you guys do and I spread that word all the time. You listen to any, even if you read, if you read life, and I was book, I mean we talk about that in great detail about the respect and admiration we had for, for the general purpose forces, the grunts, the ground pounders, the bravest, the most professional, the most dedicated people that I could ever imagine. And I was absolutely honored and everyone in my seal task unit was honored and humbled to have served with such brave warriors. So that's how I feel about our US military.

Speaker 4:          01:02:09       Next question.

Speaker 1:          01:02:13       So Jocko posted a Twitter posts, Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter and Instagram posts of a picture, black and white strangely and sort of my gig. Yeah, you're thinking of just the mats and I think there was some ambiguous figures of, he was dean, right? Teaching somebody. Anyway, he said talked about he learned the lesson or something like that. Anyways, so the question is, Jocko, what lesson did you learn for the thousandth time? Cause he said, he said that it was in training with dean the other day. So what was that last lesson? Was rules are rules must sometimes be broken. So let me, let me give you the quick story. For those of you that are Jujitsu players will indulge you a little bit with some Jujitsu. So Friday night training and deny usually train hard on Friday nights. And we had, uh, we had a war, we had a little death match on Friday and it started off.

Speaker 1:          01:03:10       We would have probably, I don't know, five, six, maybe seven minutes. And he got me, got me a little, uh, got me in a little situation that forced me to submit. And then we, I was like, all right, let's go again. And so we went again and I, and I warmed down and I got the better of him. And actually the deeper water I take them into, the better things get for me. Right. And, uh, so I warmed down and I got ahold of his arm and I had him in a, I had him in a compromised position for probably five minutes and you know, he, and he added the last moments, good to great timing. And he just got out Armbar uh, it was a straight arm locking. And uh, so he got out and we got out. He was done. He was like, yeah, I'm done.

Speaker 1:          01:04:04       I mean, he got out of it, but he was done. So Jocko got a little moral victory, right. And then I kind of antagonized him a little bit, which is what Dean and I do. We, we instigate and we antagonize each other. And so I antagonized him a little bit about, you know, oh you don't want to train anymore. Oh cause you're too, you're too broken down. You know, I'm going to stay here and train more. You can go home and you know, have a glass of warm milk or water or you know, just giving him a hard time. So, so, you know, inside and I failed to recognize this inside. Psychologically he was, he was not happy about that. And so Saturday is like, Hey, you know, let's train. And so I, I missed that. I missed that. It's a cute, that's a red flag.

Speaker 1:          01:04:45       So when I showed up, you know, he says, all, you know, let's just work some moves. And we went over some stuff and work some other people and you know, we're just kind of were very relaxed, laid back. There's no classical and we're just just relaxing. And I said, hey man, I've got to leave at such and such a time. I can go pick one of my kids up. He goes, yeah, yeah, no problem. He goes, I got to leave too. So now I think he's got to leave. Sorry. I'm actually thinking we might get a light roll and that'll be it. You know, maybe like two, five minute rounds. So, and he's got the, you know, have a nice guy face and all that stuff that he's given me. So anyways, I said, all right, you know, we worked on some stuff that he says, all right, let's roll real quick.

Speaker 1:          01:05:24       He even threw that out there. Like it was just going to be a quick, real quick. Yeah, just a quick role. So I'm thinking, I'm thinking two or three minute, I'm literally, I'm thinking two or three minutes he'd like to go over maybe to try some of the stuff. We were just, we were just drilling a little bit. No, he comes full on, I mean, any, any, and it was disguised full on. So he didn't, you know, get up. But he just went very sternly and, and pass my guard really quick. And then an actually, you know, you and I worked at, had discussed this mountain escape that I had done to the other day and I was actually like on, I don't really care if you're balanced right now. I've got this new escape and I'll just use that. And he aggressively mounted and eve aggressively went for this move that we call the snow angel, which is when you get the person's arms up, like a snow angel, like up above their head from the mouth and it's just horror and pin there.

Speaker 1:          01:06:16       Yeah. And they're in their way above. You have no leverage. You can't move. And so not only to me in snowy, it's you got me a double snowing. So both my arms are stuck up there. Now what was bad about this was there was a moment, okay. And this was, this is the rule that I learned because after we broke it down, so dean kept me there for, you know, probably seven minutes in, in double snow angel, which is just a nightmare because he's not just holding me there. He's like saying things and you know, he's antagonizing me and I'm sitting there just wanting to kill him and uh, I forget he, I actually forget how it ended. I don't remember if he went for an arm lock and he got it or if he went and I got out, I forget how it ended because it's kind of a big blur, which most of my rules are.

Speaker 1:          01:07:00       But anyways, the rule is, and I don't want to go into too much detail, be could just cause it's, it'll get too technical and too hard to do through an audio podcast. But you know, basically I don't let my elbow cross the other person sternum. I don't let it go across their storm because if it does, you can get pinned there, you can stuck there. So there was a moment where when Dean was trying to move me into snow angel, where I should have sacrificed and done like a drastic movement that's a major breaking of that rule and turned to my side really hard and put my elbow across his sternum and it would've gotten me out. And as we, as we looked at it, you know, because once I was out, then we went over it for a few minutes just to just try and analyze what happened. And I realized that, you know, that I had held on to this rule of mine, even though part of me was like, you know, what should I try it? And I didn't, I didn't try it. And so then I got a worse position or worse position or worse position. So the lesson learned is that sometimes you've got to break your rules. Now the thing is, it's not just Jujitsu, right? It's not just Jujitsu, it's about business, it's about life, it's about relationships. It's about not getting stuck in a Rut. And it's being

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       able, because it's another thing is I, I was in my own head, I didn't detach from the situation. I didn't look at it from another position and say, okay, you know, this is getting worse right now. I just was stuck there mentally. So you gotta think you gotta you gotta think about your rules objectively. And I didn't do that. And it's a rule that has, has, has saved me many times, but this time it, it cost me nearly dearly. So don't let your rules rule you. You gotta keep ruling your rules, don't let you rules rule you. Yeah. You, um, another way to kind of look at that as like a black and white mind, you know, like don't stick it in your mind is more or less black and white for sure. Well, as far as how you think, generally speaking, but don't neglect the gray is so much gray in there. And of course, you know, if you ever rules in their solid rules, man, yes, stick to those rules. But like I said, don't neglect the gray. You know how you say you got to break rule every once in a while. Don't be just, hey, ruler meant to be broken. Let's just break it. Not, don't do that. People can use that as a, uh, some people use that as a, uh, excuse just to do whatever they yeah, exactly. They're wrong too. They lack the discipline.

Speaker 3:          01:09:34       Next question. Let's do it. I'm glad you used that amount of skip by the way, check.

Speaker 6:          01:09:44       Do you have any advice on consoling a member of your team that you're leading? Who knows they're to blame for the project? Failing or falling through the person in question is a great worker, but just made an honest mistake that cost that caused the failure of the project. They feel extremely guilty for putting my job at risk and I can't convey to them enough that I understand it was an honest mistake and then I personally failed to communicate enough with them. I think it's a great thing this person is so passionate at their job, but is there any way I can get them to distance themselves and show them that this one failure is not that big of a deal?

Speaker 3:          01:10:30       So,

Speaker 5:          01:10:32       um, yeah, like, like the, the question says it's cool that you got somebody that's passionate. Right. That's great. And it sounds like they want to take ownership and that's great too. It sounds like they are having trouble moving on. So in this case, no, no major complications. Is it not that big of a deal? You just got to talk them through it. And for me, I would use probably some kind of sub, you know, some stories are real simple. One is like about parachuting and if you're parachuting, one of the main training points when you're parachuting and something goes wrong is you don't get focused on just trying to fix the bad shoot because that's what gets people killed. They're looking up, they maybe they can

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       save the shoot, they think they can make an open somehow. And the next thing you know, they hit the ground right and they die. So what they do is they, they teach you that, hey, you got a bad shoot. You know, you pull your main parachute and it doesn't open correctly. You take a look at it, you go, okay, is this thing gonna open or not? You make a decision and then you cut it away and it's gone and you focus on the next thing, which is getting your reserve fair. She'd come out to save your life. The one that didn't open, it doesn't matter anymore. So move on. You can think about it like a, uh, like a shooting competition too. Cause it's the same thing. You, when you're shooting, you don't want to shoot. You didn't want to think about the last shot that you just missed and you don't want to think about the next shot that's a hard shot or a far shot or you don't want to think about those other shots.

Speaker 1:          01:11:59       You want to think about the shot that you're taking. That's the one that you want to think about. And if you're getting caught in the past, it's going to ruin what you're trying to do in the present. So you, you know, you have to move on. This is something that this, you know, you got to explain to your employee that's good. You'd look, listen, I understand that you, that you had a rough time. If you can't let that go, it's going to screw up the project we're working on now. So let's let that go. Let's move on. So that's what I'd say to them. Say, listen, look buddy, I know this one went bad. I get it. You feel bad. Appreciate it. It's over. It's in the past. Let's take the lessons learned and we got to move on. Let's not dwell on yesterday. If we dwell on yesterday, it takes our focus off of today and tomorrow, which are the things we can actually control. We can actually control what we're doing today. We can actually control what we're going to do tomorrow. We don't have any control over what happened yesterday that's gone. So what I need you to do is focus on this mission now and making sure we executed 100%

Speaker 6:          01:13:00       that that sense of or that access to control over over a situation. That's so critical to to know when you're in that position because to know what to know that that you, you drove it to have it on the phone. You can and cannot do what you can control yet. Like I said, have access to that cause it feels, it's horse feelings though. It feels like use the parachute analogy, it feels like Dang, there's the problem. The parachute, that's the problem. So of all my attention and all my emotional energy is, is, is on that, that's the problem. But like you said, if you just honored to focus on the fact that hey, I can't control that bad shoe, that pet food is gone and cutting away and yeah, focusing on the thing. But like I said, man, that's the, that's the key right there to understand that men, you don't, you don't have control over that anymore. We're done with that. We're not doing that anymore. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:13:54       Yeah. And you know, I should have said that on the last one about talking about breaking rules. I said business, I said life, I forgot to say combat, but combat's the same way. If you get stuck in a standard operating procedure and you won't see your way out of it, you're gonna, you're gonna pay and to, same thing in combat. If you make one bad decision on the battlefield and now you start dwelling on that bad decision, you've got to forget about that. You got to move on, you got to move forward. So, you know, the only reason you look back, it's just assessed the lessons learned. You're going to take away from it and then turn back around and look forward. Don't get sucked into the past and get drowned and pulled back there cause you can't control it. You can't change what happened. Yeah. Move on buddy. That other question, the black and white mine one or are you breaking your own rules? You're one rule kind of like, um, on, on Ghostbusters one. Don't cross the streams you ever watch goes with, yeah. Same thing man. But then they had to eventually write, they had to cross the streams streams to kill that. The daemon. Yeah. You're leading shit man. I think you actually intentionally tried to do this. That was a little reach outs. A little regional. Those are understandable terms. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:05       Juggle.

Speaker 4:          01:15:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:09       What's the best advice heading into the military? Straight from high school. And this, this question is actually from, uh, my brothers from down under Cain, Dover and Nicholas Bennet. And they've been, uh, they've been down there in Australia, getting there, getting there 4:00 AM wake up challenge on for about, I don't know, 35 or 40 days there at this point. And what's cool, what's been cool is hearing their feedback as they've kind of turned their lives around and they're getting all this stuff done. And actually, you know, it was hilarious. He sent, uh, one of them said a tweet with a picture of a text conversation with some company that they were trying to work with and he said something like, the time on the tweet was f, you know, five oh one in the morning or something like that. And you know, he said, hey, are you still offering blank or some program or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:15:57       And then the response was, yes, we are still offering that. And then, and then the, you know, the reply was, okay, I'm really interested in accessing that program or whatever. And the response was, okay, but don't text people at 5:00 AM. And then the response to that was, okay, wake up earlier. Yeah. Which I thought that was classic. So those guys are rocking. It's very cool to see. Uh, so, and it's actually one of the, and I forget which one of them, one of those brothers is going in the military, which is awesome. Very cool. To See Australian military work with them a little bit, actually work with them on a small level a lot. Meaning that I work with a couple of their soldiers a lot over the years, but I never worked with them in a big unit, but they were great guys. Uh, here's a couple real simple things and I'm assuming that he's going into some kind of army or some kind of ground force.

Speaker 1:          01:16:45       He's going to be a trooper on the ground, obviously be in shape, do runs, do pushups, do sit ups, do pull ups. I would say be ready to march in boots. That's one of the things that you do in any infantry unit that is shocking to civilians, is putting on boots and putting on rucksacks and walking long distances. Why did, do your feet get like you're faking trashed? It's, it's just a different kind of exercise. You know, we talked about before humper rock man, you gotta just put on a rock and hump a rock and you got to wear whatever foot where they're going to supply you. Try and get the closest thing to that and get your feet ready for it so that you, so that you don't get your feet destroyed. Be comfortable in the water. So most military has some kind of water testing, you know, where they're going to throw you in the pool, whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:17:33       Uh, you know, going with a normal haircut, it's not going to make that big of a deal because you know they're going to shave your head within moments of showing up. So that's not that big of a deal, but a detached, okay, you're going to get these crappy situations. Worse. People knew yelling at you, they're making you much stuff. Just detach. Just, just detach and watch it. Cause the drill instructors are hilarious. And if you're, if you're getting, if they're in your face, you can be like, damn, this is harsh. But if they're in your face, but you're watching it from a free place of mind, it's so awesome to watch and it's so fun. It's so easy to understand what they're doing. You know, you got to remember they're not going to kill you in training, uh, and, and enjoy it. I had fun, I had fun in all my indoctrination courses, which is, you know, you're all your courses where you're getting treated like a recruit.

Speaker 1:          01:18:22       So for me it was bootcamp, it was bud's, it was airborne school and, and really an ocs to officer candidate school. All those things. I had a great time. I had had a blast at those schools. I had fun getting indoctrinated, I embraced the little rules that they throw on outside of on, and I take them to the extreme and I, that's, that's how I ended up having fun, fun with it. And then the last thing I would say, and, and I actually, I almost missed this, but this is, this might be the most important thing. Okay. So you're 18 years old, you just got done with high school. You show up in the military and guess what? You start getting a paycheck. All of a sudden you're the richest guy in the world because it Mickey D's, you were making seven 50 an hour and all of a sudden now you're getting a fat paycheck.

Speaker 1:          01:19:10       Have, you know, $2,200 a month. But you don't have any expenses cause you're in the barracks or whatever. You've got all your food coming to you. So what are you going to do with that money? Well, a lot of guys in the military, what they do with that money is they blow it, they blow it on women and whiskey and they get the big toys, right? They get the massive toys, they get the massive trucks and motorcycles and Harley's and, and everything like got, I'm not, I got nothing against those things. But what you need to do is save your money and you know, they throw figures around 15% of your paycheck, 20% of your paycheck, 10% of your paycheck, but put that money somewhere longterm where you're going to grow it. And then I would tell you, you know, just buy a house, buy a house and then rent out the rooms to three guys and you sleep on the couch and have them be paying your mortgage. And when you get them all stabilized

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       in that mortgage is kind of covered. Go buy another house and do that every few years. And there's no reason to retire from the military and not be completely set. Well, you'd ever have to work again if you just don't blow all your money on stuff that you don't need. And I'm not saying you got to live like a monk, right? But just don't blow all of it. Blow some of it. Don't blow all of it. And that's a, that's a real important to all the, all the folks joined the military or nude in the military. You, you can, uh, you can make that happen. Financial discipline equals financial freedom. There you go. That's good. Next question. I'm a firefighter. Slash. Paramedic. Historically, my profession has always been composed of Alpha men and all he had to worry about with teaching the skill and not the aggressive side of a person that is key within this job.

Speaker 5:          01:21:08       We now face the new generation where they're hiring, thought they're hiring softer men, quote unquote softer men due to upper management and human resources criteria. So when you, when you get these guys that drive that is needed to do the job, it's not there. I truly, I truly believe that our profession is a calling. Uh, that goes for all public servants in military alike. So my question to you is, how do you instill aggression or passion? How do you instill it? How do you turn a soft man into an Alpha male skill can be taught, but aggression and passion is where I come up short, intend to get frustrated because some people don't love this job the way I do. Those soft men will potentially be put in a position where they may have to pull me out of a fire or even save someone's life.

Speaker 5:          01:21:56       And aggression will be key. Call me crazy. But I'd rather have the Alpha male they gets after it on a daily basis to pull me out. Yeah, no doubt about that. You want to have the guy that's going to be aggressive and make things happen at the moment of truth. So how do you do that? How do you instill that? Well, number one, hard training. You know, you got to set up training for your people. That is tough, that challenges them. And at first there'll be some, you know, complaining about it and whatever else. But eventually people start to embrace that heart draining and it starts to make them feel proud. And that's what you want them to do. You want to push them mentally and physically and you want to have them understand a very important premise because if you take the fact that these guys are, let's call them softer, well that means they, they want to have like, you know, they want to be safe, right? Well, you need to teach these guys that the best way to mitigate risk is to be aggressive, right? If you want to mitigate risk, the best way to mitigate risk is to be aggressive.

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       So example, if you think of fights going to happen, what's the best way to, you know, control that situation is to be aggressive, if to aggressively attack the enemy. If you're in a gun fighting situation and someone's attacking you, what's the best thing to do? It's flank them and attack them. You want to be aggressive in a firefight. If you're fighting a fire, you want to fight the fire, right? You don't want to let the fire burn and get out of control. You want to aggressively get the fire under control. So aggression is the best way to mitigate risks. So get these guys in that mentality of where they recognize that the aggression is an important facet of what they're doing. And you want to put them in training scenarios where the aggression wins and passivity loses. You know, you want to put them in situation where, Oh, guess what?

Speaker 1:          01:23:50       You sat back and waited and now we've got the whole building on fire. Or you sat back and waited and now the people that we could rescue three minutes ago are going to die because you hesitated at the moment of truth. So you gotta teach them that aggressiveness over and over and over again. And I think that's, that's, that's what you gotta do. Um, I know that I want one at once. You'll officer that I was working with, we are going through land warfare training and land warfare training is you got machine guns firing, you got rockets going off, you've got smoke grenades, it's mayhem. And if you're gonna, you have to grab control of the situation. So you're doing what we call immediate action drills and everyone's shooting live fire and they're maneuvering and you've got to grab control of the situation and you've got to make things happen aggressively through force of will.

Speaker 1:          01:24:51       And so this once you officer who I thought was great guy, he, he, he like wasn't making it happen. He wasn't being aggressive enough. And I said to him, I said, hey man, you got to be more aggressive. You've got to get you going to get fired up with your guys. And he said, I literally said to me, I remember it like it was yesterday. He goes, I don't know if I can get any more fired up. And I said, okay, hang with me. And I just, just, just follow me. And I took command of his squad of eight guys and I said, just follow me. So we went, we got into contact drill and the shooting started and boom, I showed him what aggression look like. Hey [inaudible] jokes that upon us corner right there, you get up there and started laying down, fire you over here start getting head count that you yelling, placing guys, making it happen through force of will.

Speaker 1:          01:25:46       It's being aggressive. And it was, that was all it took was like he just didn't understand the difference. He didn't understand what aggression look like and he didn't understand how it impacted the situation. When you're not being aggressive out on the battlefield, the you have no control, things will, things will just, things will just happen and you will have no control over them. So, and guess what? It's the same thing in life. If you're not aggressively pursuing your goals again, that doesn't mean you're aggressively confronting people at every turn. No, it means you're aggressively pursuing your goals through any means necessary. It does. Again, people get confused and think that I'm in someone's place. Hey, we're doing this my way. No, no, no. You're aggressively pursuing your goals. You're not aggressively pursuing people. You're not aggressively pursuing personalities. You're not aggressively confronting people. You're confronting the challenge, not the people.

Speaker 1:          01:26:46       Do you have to confront people? Sometimes? Yes, of course you do, but you're aggressively confronting and attacking the challenge, the mission, not the people, but he, but anyways, this guy didn't quite understand, so I had to show him. I had to let him see what that looked like, what it looked like to say, you know, hey, take it out right here. Grab a guy and say stat a corner right here. Start moving guys. And, and have them see that. And guess what? Then you get at the other people in the, in the squad start seeing it and they start acting, acting aggressively to make things happen. And that's, that's when you do it. That's, that's, that's what you do. And, and obviously what that means is you as a leader, you have to lead. You have to show these guys the way w how important aggression is and how to do it.

Speaker 6:          01:27:37       Yeah. In kind of in life, I think you can, because again, it's one of those things that, that sounds pretty simple. It's either be aggressive or you're not being aggressive kind of thing. But it's so hard because like for example, if you're in life, a lot of people they sit back and wait for things to kind of happen. Like while I'm waiting, you know, you hear people say and he just hasn't happened for me yet and I'm waiting for my big break kind of thing. No wrong attitude. Yeah, exactly. But when you're in that situation it kind of seems like that's how the world works. So it doesn't and a lot of it maybe how people are raised, I don't know. Um, where if, if you don't know what that is, that if you don't have access to that feeling of being an aggressive person, it's hard to get there until like how you said if someone shows you like in the exact situation that you're in and in your case it was that one specific Gulf training situation you showed them how so it probably clicked right away. But in life there's all these situations. So just to be an aggressive person might be kind of hard for someone to access unless they had like a mentor or something or someone who demonstrated it.

Speaker 1:          01:28:43       Definitely is. It definitely is hard in life. It's hard to show people all the different situations and because then you also can end up with people that are overly aggressive, right? Or aggressive on the wrong thing, aggressive in the wrong direction. You know? I said, this is something that someone, the other day they were talking about being there, talking about like, I'm super passionate about this, and I said, don't aim. You're passionate the people. Yeah, because people find that offensive. Yeah. You got to aim your passion at the mission and let live. I mean, there'll be some collateral encouragement when people see someone that's fired up. When people see someone that's passionate, it makes people excited about the mission as well. But if I hit you with my passion, if I aim my passion at you, all of a sudden you're intimidated by it. You're turned off by it, you're deaf, made defensive by it.

Speaker 1:          01:29:30       And so that's what you have to be careful. If you want to aim your passion, aim your aggression at the mission, not at the people. What you want to do with people that you want to influence them. You want to steer them, you want to pull them along, you want to make them give them the idea. So they think that they're moving in that direction on their own. You actually want them to be, nevermind. Thank you. Want them to move in that direction on their own. That's leadership. And so that's what you got to do with this aggressive thing. It's uh, it's definitely a really good question. I would also say, you know what, what music are they listening to? What, what, what TV shows are they watching? What movies are they watching? Are they watching UFC straight up? Are they watching people fight? Are you doing any training? Are you hitting bags? Are you throwing some Moy Thai kicks? Are you grappling, you know, do those things raise aggression levels? Are they working out hard? You know, like no kidding. Squatting heavy weights increases your testosterone period. It really does. So get on the squat rack and start getting that testosterone flowing through your system.

Speaker 1:          01:30:45       Let's go to the next question. Okay. Be Aggressive on that one. Just be aggressive and lead aggressively. Yeah. Funny how you mentioned UFC, cause you can kind of in that regard you can learn a little bit cause you can hear like you always hear the coach or whatever yelling thing be first, be first, be first, I'll count and stuff like that. Yeah. You definitely don't hear him say hey sit back and wait to get attached. Yeah, exactly. Then you don't really ever say, okay, be defensive. Yeah. Or be passing. Yeah, exactly. It doesn't happen. Next question. Um, some Jujitsu talk. What type of style do you play? Aggressive, passive, reactive or smashing paths, et Cetera, et cetera. Well, I mean I've trained with you. You probably, you know, have an assessment, your assessment of my game, which will be a limited assessment by the way, because the game that I show you is the, is the, is built to contend with what you bring to the table. If you brought something else, you'd see something else. Yeah. And I have a little bit beyond that because I witness you and dean all the time. More so before that nowadays. But yeah, I

Speaker 6:          01:32:00       would say my assessment. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So you watch me other people and you can see. So you do see that I trained different ways with other people. Yeah. And really that's really the core of the evaluation is that you, you, when you roll with people, you, it's like you're real. Um, it's like variable style, you know, it changes. So, and it depends on your mood too. Like if you're just messing around with me or whatever, you're like, you know, this is kind of weird, but you do this thing that no one really does. And you look like you look me in the eye, like while you're rolling, it's weird because I know you're just messing with me. Like, oh, like everything I do, you're like, oh, that was cute. Kind of private, kind of an attitude. And then, you know, if I talked too much, um, you know, whatever, then you'll, you'll smash and pass. So in regards to these, these choices, um, all, all, all of the above, right? So, so passive when you're kind of taunting and maybe even learning or not learning style of Jujitsu. Yes. Yes it is. It's your style.

Speaker 6:          01:33:05       And so you'll be passive kind of waiting for me to do something. And then if it doesn't work, then you taught some more. And then so that's passive and reactive is obviously, you know, reacting to anything that I try to do aggressive is when either time runs is running short or I talk too much and smash and pass is the result of that aggressive stuff in really in replace of smash and pass. Oh, I mean, I think the alternative for me is, is a little something that we like to call the disrespect, disrespect. We just wouldn't, it just completely disrespect the person's guard and just pass and smash them. Yeah, yeah. The disrespect for sure. Yeah. And I think, I think, I think the

Speaker 1:          01:33:44       key point for this for me is that I, I know like I, I agree with you. Like I have a decent guard. Um, I have a good top position, pretty good at card passing, whatever. I'm not, I'm not great at Jujitsu, but I'm decent at some areas and I'm pre, one thing I am is, I'm pretty comfortable, like in just about any situation, there's no situation where I'm, there's no situation where I'm freaked out. Like I don't mind being in half guard. I don't mind being on a half guard, top bottom. I don't mind being guard, closed, open, whatever. I don't mind being mounted. I can pretty much handle any situation, you know? And again, when you're training with dean, it's did, you know, you get, you get very comfortable with people because you have a guy that's just a savage. And um, but, but what's, what's interesting about this is for me, and I, and I talked about this, I mean I talk about this, there's a dichotomy here, right? Like if being aggressive is not working, then you have to try that other game. You know, I always say if you're, if you're trying to pass someone's guard really close and you can't do it back away because there's an opening there and it's the same again, it's the same thing with life, right? If you're beating your head against the wall, try different route. When there's

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       one door that's closed or heavily defended in combat, go find another door, go breach a window, go find another way. There is an opening somewhere else. And I think that's what my game is. I think that's what my game is, is it's like you said variable. Yeah. Based on a variety of influences both in my world and in my opponent's world. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:35:30       And surprisingly, and I think that people, a lot of people wouldn't really assume this right away. Is that your um, yeah, sure. You're going to smash and you're aggressive and kind of rough. I'll let you know a lot of times, but you're like, um, like a playful Jujitsu guy. You know,

Speaker 5:          01:35:47       I was going to say this and this is, I think this is important. I had a guy ask me, how hard do you go? Right? And the answer's very easy. I go just hard enough that I'm staying ahead of the other person now with you. So those of you that are listening on audio echoes making a face because there are times when I have to step up my game a little bit and, and put the wood on times where it's straight up. That's not true. Okay. Okay. Yeah. But there might be some, oh, you know why that's because you come in with you. We sometimes you come in with a, you know, with an attitude of, yeah, I can see it in your eyes. You're like, today's the day you come in there and you got the series look on your face now. Okay, cool. It's going to be like that right on and see that. Yeah. I have to bring in the eat a little bit.

Speaker 6:          01:36:37       Yeah, yeah. Fully. Yeah. But that same, and this is the part where I think is kind of kind of interesting is that you do, it doesn't seem like a war. Like it seems like a war, but all within the confines of some silly, not silly, but some game. Well game. Yeah. But, but it's, it's obvious though, you know, like I, I think that someone who may be maybe

Speaker 5:          01:37:00       never seen your role or never had that experience with you specifically, they would assume that you're this like, hey [inaudible] I'm going to smash it. And that meant in that I am taking this really seriously. You know, some guys are like that. Yeah, that's true. It's not that I don't take Jujitsu seriously, but did you too? It's fun to me. So fun to me. Yeah. And I think that the better you get, the more fun it gets and the less you have to be like that, you know, in, I don't mind when people come at me like that cause I still get to do the same thing. You know? I still get to have fun and yeah know Jujitsu should be fun. You really should be fun, have fun or it is for you. The longer you're going to do it for now. Part of the fun can be submitting people and you get people that that's the only fund that they have in Jujitsu is when they submit people.

Speaker 5:          01:37:45       And that's not what I'm talking about. Yeah. I think that's kind of the transitions and the, the, the flowing and the utilizations of moves and the cool things that, and you don't, sometimes I'll be rolling with whoever and it's like something, just something like someone will do something really cool and you start laughing like the hand, that was awesome. That's Jujitsu. That's right. You did two should be fun. It shouldn't be this. Uh, it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be. The Fun shouldn't come from just submitting people. Right. That's just bullying, right? Yeah. In a way. Yeah. And you know, you shouldn't get, you should a certain point, you go, you know what? Okay, cool. I can tap people out, but let's, let's, let's do this for the reason of the Dysport itself, the, the game itself, which is a fun game. Yeah. I know guys who told me straight up that when they're driving up to the gym, they have anxiety.

Speaker 5:          01:38:37       Yeah. Anxiety. Like, Oh God, am I going to do, or if they get tapped out, it ruins their day or their week or whatever. But no, I have none of that heads. Yeah, I'm rolling at the John Jim just in totally, totally happy to be, to be getting there and get and get to do something that's so fun. Yeah. Yeah. I rolled with the Chris Martin today for, and it was all like, you can make jokes, you can talk trash and you can do all this stuff while you're rolling and doing that in this playful, I mean, don't be a Dick, you know, but, but you know, yeah, you can't, he can push being a dick sometimes it makes it more fun for sure. Like you can, you know, you can call a move and then do it on the guy if you're better than him or whatever. Cold blooded. But it makes it fun though, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:39:22       And me and Chris, we were doing that the whole time. I'm like, oh Ooh, how's that feel kind of thing. And of course that's taken to an extreme because I know Chris for a long time, but talk a little bit of that makes it more fun. Just like if you're playing a video game, just like if you're playing any other games, just talk to them. Friends, you know, it's, it's part of the fun. And like I said, my original point is I think people wouldn't assume that about you, given how you may come off sometimes, but you're really like that. Hmm. No, I do do to phone to me, no doubt on splurge for sure. Believe you're not Jujitsu in a way, like when you're surfing in California, there's, uh, there's a much harder vibe surfing in California. There isn't the mats for sure. Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:40:08       You know, when, you know, when we're surfing, where I serve, like it's, it's a gang mentality type situation, you know? And so on the mats, it's just so fun to be in a situation and surfing, you know, leads to fighting often oil and so, but in Jujitsu, the fighting is already happening, right? So, so it's, you know, you can, you're kind of over it and now, now we're just, we're already fighting, so now we can just chill, right? Yeah, yeah. Sorry. It's crazy. I'll surfing's like that. Right. Seems to be this kind of zen thing. No, no, no, you're supposed to, but it's not, it's an aggressive, it's a very aggressive environment. Like a territorial thing. It's a very territorial thing. Yeah. Yeah. I bet it's kind of cool. I like it. Like that

Speaker 1:          01:40:57       next question. I understand and agree with all your thoughts and principles. However, however I interpret your concepts for leaders leading men were mostly driven or other leaders who have, um, a desire to make themselves better in maintaining the status. Yep. So common misperception, right? Is that, you know, the military and the seals, I see this all time. Everyone thinks that the military in the seals, I think that we're leading terminator robots, right? And everyone is just driven and they're going to get up and going to do everything. And it's, I just talked about this on the last podcast. It is a bell curve. It is a bell curve and there's a great bunch of guys at the top of the bell curve that are go getters. There's a solid bunch of guys in the middle and then there's the lower guys that are bumps. And so this interpretation that the concepts that I talk about are just for leading these front, running a personalities that just make everything happen.

Speaker 1:          01:41:59       N Not correct. You know there are seals that don't want to work. There are seals that want to take shortcuts. There are seals that want to skate by. Then you get outside, then you're working with Iraqi soldiers that are unmotivated, untrained, poorly equipped. We got to work with these guys. We got bosses. I mean I got bosses in the seal teams that are either an egomaniac or that are old term risk averse. You could have any of this stuff going on. You can have your guys that are risk averse. You can have guys that are too crazy. You got all, you know what they are. They're humans, they're individuals. They're human beings. And because they're human beings, even in special operations and sometimes it is, especially in in special operations cause when you get in special operations you get guys that have huge egos and attitudes and so, oh you think that they just want to do whatever you tell them to do.

Speaker 1:          01:42:52       No, they got their own idea. They got to go their own method. They got their own plan, they got their own, what they think they are. Tactical genius. So you got to get around that. So what does it mean? It means you have to lead them and it's the common theme that I'm talking about all the time and it was, I mean you got to build relationships, you got to build the trust, you've got to make sure they understand why they're doing what they're doing. You've got to make sure they understand the strategic and back. You got to empower them. You got to set a good example. You got to listen to them, you got to take input, you got to give them responsibility. And, and when I say responsibility, I mean real responsibility. You've got to build them up. You've got to make them better.

Speaker 1:          01:43:31       You got to show them and let them see. Not In a, not in a, in your face way, but you've got to subtly let them see what self improvement means them and how they can better their position and what drive we'll get them. He got to them ownership of stuff. And you got to let that ownership grow into extreme ownership where they really want to own things and you got to teach them to lead and you got to put them in leadership positions and you gotta show your trust by actually following them sometimes and again, people ask me these questions. You know how I'm a new leader? How do I lead? I got a new person. How do I lead them? It's the same answers. It's the same answers all the time. That principles of leadership now the nuances are there. Yes, the nuances are there and I, I have to nuance for echo that I got a nuance for this guy over here and I got a nuance for this group over here.

Speaker 1:          01:44:27       The the nuances are there, but the basic principles are the same. Am I never, am I going to? Who am I going to be in charge of that? I'm not going to try and build a relationship of trust with them. Who's that dancers? Nobody. You know? Who is it that I don't want to set? A good example for the answer is nobody. Who is it that I'm not going to listen to? If you don't listen to people, you alienate them and you don't want to be part of the team. I mean it's, it's the things are universal and again, there's nuances because you might have to make adaptations. And you know, when we, when we did battle leadership with, uh, with, uh, eight off von Shell and he talks about distinctly these three different types of commanders and how the boss gave them each their own little adjusted order because he was dealing with their personalities. So yes, you've got to deal with the personalities, but that doesn't mean you're doing something different from the principals.

Speaker 4:          01:45:19       So

Speaker 1:          01:45:22       when you get, sure, when you get to the bottom of the bell curve, it, you might see some people that might need to be replaced, they might need to be removed, but I'll tell you what, most likely they just need to be led.

Speaker 4:          01:45:36       Mm.

Speaker 1:          01:45:40       The reason that our, I think one of the reasons why it, the perception is that all your guys are robots and you know, I'm going to give you an order. They follow it. No questions that is is like movies, right? Like a few good men membered Jack Nicholson. He's like, people will follow orders or people die. Yeah. That was his thing. And they say that kind of stuff. Yeah. And but they do, they do capture in some Hollywood movies where they show how mute knees take place and how things go wrong and how, you know, the, the new lieutenant Vietnam is going to get fragged by his own people. That stuff's real. Yeah. You know, that stuff's real. So it's just, it, it's a misperception. The other thing, the other misperception is because of bootcamp, a lot of military movies are, they show up, they show a significant amount of time in bootcamp, but bootcamp is a matter of weeks in a career.

Speaker 1:          01:46:34       You know, I think Marine Corps bootcamp is 13 weeks. I think the army bootcamp is 10 weeks. Bootcamp is a very short period of time in your four year, six year, eight year, 10 year, 20 year career bootcamp is, you know, I talked about the indoctrinational times in the military. They are very short periods of time compared to your whole career. And in bootcamp when you're Joan instructor says dropdown and do pushups, you dropped down a few pushups in boot bootcamp when you're Joan instructor says pickup that, you know, make your bed, you make your bed when these, and if you don't, they yell at you and they yell at you until you do make your bed. So people get that idea that that's the way the military is run. Yeah. Yup. And that is like, you know, a great example is full metal jacket, the movie, which is a great movie, but the boot camp scene is half the movie.

Speaker 1:          01:47:21       But in reality, even if you are a guy in, in Vietnam, you know, boot campus 13 weeks and then you went onto, into Vietnam for a year. So it's a fraction of what your real career is like. And so people get that impression that you're just going to be able to bark orders and everyone's gonna listen to you. It just doesn't work that way. Yeah. And there's actually, there's a great, there's a great video. Um, it's called Charlie Company and V, uh, anyways, I forget the name of the video, but it's about a company in Vietnam, Charlie Company. And maybe if you remind me, I'll put it on the, on the website. Um, it shows two company commanders. But anyways, to make a long story short, these guys, they don't like their new company commander. And at first they're resistant to him and you know, he says, listen, these guys could got to learn that there's going to have to do.

Speaker 1:          01:48:14       And I tell him, and then it fast forwards a couple months and they interview him again and he goes, hey, you know, how's everything going? He goes, you know, they get it now and they realize that they just had to listen to me and do what I told them. And then they go out in the field with the guys and the guys in the fueled, they're supposed to be doing things and they're just not doing it. They're just, they're literally calling back like, yeah, where did we did, yeah, we did a patrol, you know, they didn't do it. Yeah, we moved positions. They didn't move positions. Yeah, we're gonna do another, you know, another foot patrol tonight. They're not doing it. So he was under the impression that everyone had like buckled to his will. They were just completely snowing him and he had no idea. So that's what happens in the military.

Speaker 1:          01:48:57       If you're don't lead your people and you just order them around and you think that everyone's just this, this, uh, this, uh, how would they describe it here? Men who are mostly driven or leaders who have a desire to make themselves better. I mean, if anybody in a position with guys like that, it's going to the leadership job, it's going to be very easy. You just tell him what to do and they do it. I mean, I could give you example upon example upon example of stuff in the seal teams were what I had to do to get people convinced that this was the right thing to deal. You know, I mean, it is like, you know, a classic example is telling guys, okay, we're going take Iraqi soldiers on every operation. You know. So these guys were saying, are you kidding me? Well, they just didn't go, hey, cool Jocko. We'll do exactly what you tell us. No, they look, what are you talking about raw taking these guys out, why would we do that? It's going to be risky. These guys aren't trustworthy. They don't, they're not trained. Right. They had a million reasons why not to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:49:54       But how do you get them to do it? You explain to them why you explained to them the strategic importance. You have built trust with them. You tell them that they're going to take ownership of the Iraqis. I mean it's everything that I just said. That's what you do. That's a classic example. So yes, once again, you have, if you're in a leadership position, you have to lead.

Speaker 6:          01:50:19       You ever seen the movie saving Private Ryan? Yes. Yeah. There was a part in then and that movie that um, that they, they weren't down for the orders. I remember that one. It was kind of like a little pivotal part where they were going to go take a, a machine gun nests and they were like, man, we don't have to do this. So they all kind of got together and said, hey, you know, seems like unnecessary risks. And he's like, he kind of tripped out a little bit and kind of forced them to do it and they were like, all right, whatever. Kind of reluctantly then one of the guys died and stuff. But anyway, that's an example of where they, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:50:51       And, and especially, you know, when you were just doing a talking about world war one, that one portion of the book where he says, you know what, we got ordered to do this thing. I didn't feel good about it, but it was an order, we're going to do it. So there's examples from the past, especially where, you know, it's definitely was more like that in the past and more one, obviously it was like that obviously it was like that unfortunately it was like that. Yeah. Because it caused people to continue, you know, to execute these operations that we're just going to get people killed. And you know, actually Lafe and I were talking about that last week. Pickett's charge tickets, charge Gettysburg, they sent the troops up and they got slaughtered and they know they're survivors came back in. Uh, Lee was, you know, basically in tears like, Hey, I'm sorry this happened.

Speaker 1:          01:51:40       I, this was my fault. He took ownership of it and I hope I'm getting the story right. Um, but, but that's the, that's the general, uh, the general gist of the story. But then they eat, you know, the big story was that the guys were like, hey, we'll go again if you, you know, cause you're such a great leader will go again. And Life, you know, it was kind of like, you know, that's what world war, you know, that's what, that's what happened, that that shows you that guys were willing. And I said, yeah, but the differences in world war one, they sent them again, they sent them over and over. You know, Lee was regretting and I'm sorry, and I did something that got you got, you know, a bunch of guys killed. It's horrible in World War One. And like, yeah, it happened going again.

Speaker 1:          01:52:25       Oh yeah. And that happens again. We're doing it again and again and again and it's just, uh, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll always just be horrified by that and hopefully, um, man progress's beyond that. And again, part of that is as a person you have to question, you have to be a rebel. You have to question what people are telling you and why they're telling it to you. If my boss doesn't tell me why I'm doing my operation, it's and I continue to execute it, that's my fault. I need to raise my hand and say, boss, what are we doing? Why are we doing this? I don't understand. You got to take that initiative because if you're just blindly following orders, I don't want somebody that's blindly following orders. I never want people that blindly follow my orders. I want people that say, oh, get boss, wait, why are we doing this?

Speaker 1:          01:53:17       Why is this happening? Because I want people, I want think, I want leaders underneath me that know how to lead. And you know what? When you build the trust and you build the relationships, those guys will do anything for you and my guys and my task. They do anything. I mean, I know it, they did over and over again did operations that were crazy and hard and dangerous and risky. Never did anyone say, oh, you know, we're not doing this. They said, okay, we understand what, what's the mission? All right. So you got to build that road. It's against the same basic principles of leading human beings. Yeah. And that's what you gotta do. But to think that you're just going to order people to do things not happening. Mm. Long answer to a, to a good question. That was actually interesting perspective. And I know it's a perspective that a lot of people have. People always think, well, you know, you led seals and they really, yeah. So that was easy. Yeah. But before you said, before you told me, that's Kinda what I figured. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:54:24       Last question.

Speaker 1:          01:54:29       Jacko any tips for Breaking Habits of Laziness and procrastination? Maybe some good reads on the subject. And this is a question I wish you'd answered for me like 10 years ago. So, yeah. Any tips? You know, this is definitely been a pretty common question when people want to know how to stop the laziness and they want to know how to stop the procrastination and they have some idea in their head, you know, some kind of a, a vision for what they want to do, but they don't know where to start. They don't know where to start it, you know, they don't know where to start. And so they say, hey, where do I start and, and when's the best time to start? And I have a very simple answer for that.

Speaker 4:          01:55:25       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:55:25       here and now. That's it. You want to improve, you want to get better. You want to get on a workout program or a clean diet. You want to start a business, you want

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       to write a book or make a movie or build a house or a computer or put together some mobile application.

Speaker 1:          01:55:53       Where do you start? You start right here and when do you start? You start right now. You initiate the action aggressively. You

Speaker 4:          01:56:06       go

Speaker 1:          01:56:09       because the idea isn't going to execute itself and the book isn't going to write itself and the weights out in the gym, they're not going to move themselves. You have to do it and you have to do it now. And that means you got to stop thinking about it and stopped dreaming about it and stop researching every aspect of it and reading all about it and debating the pros and cons of it. Just start doing it. Take that first step and make it happen. Get after it, get after it here and now. And I think, uh, I think that's all we've got for tonight.

Speaker 4:          01:57:11       So
