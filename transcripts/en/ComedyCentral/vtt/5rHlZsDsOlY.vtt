It's time for our next game,
Thugs Not Hugs.

00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:05.572
Thugs Not Hugs.

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:06.907
Oh, boy.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.010
This is one of my
favorite games.

This is a shiny new 2016 edition
of Thugs Not Hugs.

If you're not familiar
with the game,

WOMAN:
Say hello to the camera.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.088
Hello, (bleep).

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.695
Starts off all cute and huggy

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:32.099
and reveals that he will not
take (bleep) from anybody.

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:33.901
So comedians,
we're gonna show you an image

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.602
of a cute child
and for 250 points

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:37.704
you're gonna tell us
if they're living a hug life

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:39.072
or a thug life.

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:41.975
First up, this
buckled little buddy.

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:43.310
-Koechner.
-Thug.

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.179
All right, let's find out.

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:47.114

-Catch it.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:49.149
WOMAN:
Got it. Love you.

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:51.752
Oh, (bleep) in your mouth.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:54.788
♪ (bleep) the police, comin'
straight from the underground ♪

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:03.597
He should know
that's a thing you can do

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.566
for at least another 13 years.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:11.238
Next up, this child
let down by her best friend.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.573
Thug life or hug life?

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.141
Hayes.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:16.443
Hug, 'cause I have to believe
in the innocence of children.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.346
All right, let's find out.
Let's find out.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:22.816
(babbles)

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.586
VERMUELEN:
Aw.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.955
-KOECHNER: Wait...
-And then the dog eats her face.

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.489
HARDWICK:
Then the dog eats her face.

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:32.426
Next up, this pint-sized driver.
This pint-sized driver.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.528
Thug life or hug life?
Drée.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.763
-Thug life.
-Yeah, let's find out.

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:38.732
Batman! Batman!

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.071
Oh!

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:49.743
Oh, no!

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.712
Oh.

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:54.248
He...

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.749
He ran over Batman.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.951
I know, he was very happy.

00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:00.988
Look at that sadistic,
deranged face.

00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:03.957
Possibly the prequel
to <i>Batman v Superman?</i>

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:05.759
Could be, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.895
That's little Kal-El.
That's little Kal-El

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:07.995
right there,
running down little Batman.
