00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.020
Users often decide whether
to install an app based

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.704
on its Play Store
listing, so you

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:06.870
need to make sure you have
the best possible listing

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.370
for your app.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.156
I'm Kobi, from the
Google Play team,

00:00:10.156 --> 00:00:11.530
and I'm going to
tell you how you

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.190
can experiment with the text and
graphics of your app's listing

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.610
on Google Play, with our new
Store Listing Experiments

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.980
feature.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.120
You can use data,
instead of intuition,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.110
to optimize your store
listing, increasing

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.760
the number of visitors to
your page who actually convert

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.650
and install your app.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.070
There's no coding required.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.890
All you need is someone who can
create graphics and write text.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.950
For example,
Kongregate, creators

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.040
of the popular
game "Epic Skater,"

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.470
created four versions of
the app icon for their game.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.930
They tested the icon with
Store Listing Experiments,

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.820
and found that the
best icon is improving

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.690
install rates by more than 39%.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.200
Starting today, you too
can run your own test

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.440
to see what changes
drive the most installs.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.790
First, log into the Google
Play Developer Console.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.290
Under Store Listing, go to
the new Experiments page.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.210
There, you can
create an experiment

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.860
with up to three variants of
your app's text and graphics.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.770
You can decide how
many users will

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.769
see each of these variants.

00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:14.060
You may want to start your
experiments on a small group

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.820
of users, such as 10%.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.820
You can run two
types of experiments.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.330
Global, which will
pertain to all users.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.380
And localized, which
will pertain to users

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.286
of a specific language.

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:29.340
In global experiments, you
can only change the graphics,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.070
while in localized
experiments you

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.480
can change the graphics or
text for a particular language.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.340
Go to the Developer Console
to track your experiments.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.200
Once we've gathered enough data,
you will see the conclusion,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.030
and you can apply the winning
variant as your store listing.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.980
So how do you optimize
your Store Listing?

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.240
We found that store
listing pages perform best

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.140
when they clearly
highlight value to users.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.300
An app description should
be clear and to the point.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.180
For example, an app
description like,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.740
photo editor producing
professional results,

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.710
works better than,
an awesome app

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.370
where you have fun with photos.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.210
You can also use Store
Listing Experiments

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.630
to gain insight into users, and
how they think about your app.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.340
For example, do users prefer
to think of your game as one

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.360
with beautiful and
realistic graphics, or one

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.610
with exciting action game play?

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.700
As you've seen
before, icons matter,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.300
so make sure they're of
high quality and beautiful.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.990
Choose the app screenshots
carefully, and experiment

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.170
with their order,
we found it matters.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.230
Be bold, try things.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.780
Don't assume your store
listing is good enough.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.150
But at the same time, remember
that not all experiments

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.500
will increase your
app's install rate.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.870
The developers of
the app EverythingMe

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.520
wanted to test two hypothesises.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.980
That their app icon
should be more colorful,

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.380
and that the letters "me"
do not work well globally.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.030
Take a look at their
experiment, which

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.010
confirmed both
hypothesis, and allowed

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.510
them to change their
icon, improving

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.500
install rates by more than 33%.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.750
Optimizing your Store
listing is perhaps

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.880
the most important thing you
can do for your app acquisition,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.070
because it affects traffic
coming from all sources.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.940
It amplifies organic
user acquisition

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.050
in Google Play, as well as
your own marketing efforts.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.290
Well, good luck, and
we hope you enjoy

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.660
optimizing your Store listing.
