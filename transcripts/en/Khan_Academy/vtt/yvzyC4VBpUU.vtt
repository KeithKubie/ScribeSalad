00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.330
I have the complex
number 3 minus 4i.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.140
I've plotted it on
the complex plane.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.450
We see that the real part
is 3, so we've gone 3

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.100
along the horizontal
axis, or the real axis.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.740
And the imaginary
part is negative 4,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.120
so we've gone down 4
along the vertical axis.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.595
So this right here is
the point 3 minus 4i.

00:00:19.595 --> 00:00:20.970
Now what I want
to think about is

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.760
what the absolute
value of 3 minus 4i is.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.760
And just as a reminder,
absolute value literally

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.926
means-- whether we're talking
about a complex number

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:31.620
or a real number, it literally
just means distance away

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.190
from 0.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.420
So the absolute
value of 3 minus 4i

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.520
is going to be the
distance between 0,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.310
between the origin on the
complex plane, and that point,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.652
and the point 3 minus 4i.

00:00:44.652 --> 00:00:46.110
So this distance
right over here is

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.030
going to be the absolute
value of 3 minus 4i.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.900
So how can we think about that?

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.050
Well, we could literally
just set up a right triangle

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.480
and then use the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.540
So let's think about it.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:09.160
If we wanted to set up a right
triangle, the height here,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.330
the distance between 0
and negative 4, well,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.360
that distance is going to be 4.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.240
And then the base
of this triangle,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.760
the distance between 0 and
3, is just going to be 3.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.460
And this is definitely
a right angle.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.740
This is a horizontal line.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.060
This is a vertical line.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.720
We can now use the Pythagorean
theorem to figure out

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.720
the absolute value
of 3 minus 4i.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.440
The distance between
this point and 0--

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.825
it's the hypotenuse of
this right triangle.

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:36.450
So we just use the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.280
This side squared, 3 squared,
plus this side squared,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.670
plus 4 squared, is going to
be equal to the absolute value

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:56.750
of 3 minus 4i squared, the
absolute value squared.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.740
So 3 squared plus 4 squared,
that's 9 plus 16, which is 25.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.683
So you get 25 is equal to the
absolute value of 3 minus 4i

00:02:08.683 --> 00:02:09.183
squared.

00:02:13.157 --> 00:02:15.490
And we know if you take the
absolute value of something,

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.520
this is just a distance.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.657
It's going to be positive.

00:02:17.657 --> 00:02:19.490
So we want to take the
positive square root,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.980
the principal square root,
of both sides of this.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.730
And so we're going to
be left with-- well,

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.320
the principal square root, the
positive square root of 25,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.510
is 5, is equal to the
absolute value of 3 minus 4i.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.840
So another way of saying it,
this thing right over here

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.250
is going to be equal to 5.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.440
This distance right
over here is equal to 5.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.070
Now, without having
to draw it, one way

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.486
you could just think about
this is I'll have my real part.

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:49.170
I have my imaginary part.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.390
I could literally take
each of those parts,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.962
square them, take the sum,
and take the square root.

00:02:53.962 --> 00:02:55.420
So another way of
taking it, if you

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.253
didn't want to visualize
all this-- but this

00:02:57.253 --> 00:02:58.466
is really what we're doing.

00:02:58.466 --> 00:02:59.840
You could say,
well, this is just

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.085
going to be equal to take
the real part squared.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.870
Take the imaginary part
squared-- so let me write this.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.480
Add them together, and
then take the square root,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.370
or the principal root.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.670
The principal root's just
the positive square root.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.390
So that's going to be
the square root of 9

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.868
plus 16, which, once
again, is equal to 5.
