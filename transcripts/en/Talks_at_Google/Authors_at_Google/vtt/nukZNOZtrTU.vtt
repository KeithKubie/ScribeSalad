Thank you, guys.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.980
Born in Chicago, Illinois,

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.910
promoting his highly anticipated
release of "Super Troopers 2,"

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.530
set to launch later this year.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.618
Please welcome me
in introducing Jay.

00:00:48.618 --> 00:00:50.112
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.250
Welcome to Google.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.940
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR:
Thank you very much.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.189
ALLAN WEINBERGER: How are you?

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.040
So before the movies and before
your comedy troupe Broken

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.820
Lizard, you were actually born
and raised here in Chicago.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.090
Did you grow up with
a comedic upbringing?

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.770
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR:
I mean, you know, I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.400
grew up in the suburbs
of Chicago in Hinsdale.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.050
And my friend's
brothers introduced us

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.500
to "Monty Python
and the Holy Grail"

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.060
and also introduced
us to The Beatles.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.040
And so that was sort
of the beginning

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.255
of thinking about what a
comedy group was all about.

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:48.660
I remember listening to
the Steve Martin album

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.090
"Let's Get Small."

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.340
And then I saw the Richard
Pryor concert film "Live."

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.340
It's Richard Pryor live.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.464
It's the one in Long Beach.

00:01:57.464 --> 00:02:01.320
And that is I think the best
recorded stand-up that's

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.680
ever been put on film.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.530
When I was 15, my dad took
me to the Chicago Theatre

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.584
to see Eddie Murphy in concert.

00:02:12.584 --> 00:02:13.500
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Wow.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.200
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: It was the
"Delirious" tour, and it was--

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.620
we sat in the very back
row of the Chicago Theatre.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.780
And I was like, that's a job?

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.120
I mean, wow.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.960
So that's sort of the
beginnings for me.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.790
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
And then you were

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.630
a traditional-- you went to
Colgate and started up comedy.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.610
But when did you
say, like, you know

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.340
what, I'm going to really push
this comedy thing full-time?

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.890
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR:
Well, I was at Colgate

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.030
and I had been a writer and--

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.530
I'm sorry.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.150
I had been an actor in
high school and college.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.980
I had been in a lot of plays.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.880
Am I supposed to
talk to them or you?

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.330
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
You know what--

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.540
to all of us, to everybody.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.870
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: OK.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.240
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Sure.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.820
To them.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:58.840
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: I've been
talking to you all afternoon.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.330
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.163
We've been together.

00:03:00.163 --> 00:03:02.370
He did a Reddit
AMA earlier today

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.410
and I was able to
sit in on that.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.390
I kind of felt like a
voyeur-- kind of weird--

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.500
but it was fun to
watch from that side.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.972
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: Thank you.

00:03:10.972 --> 00:03:13.390
It was fun to have
you watching me.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.515
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Yeah.

00:03:14.515 --> 00:03:15.140
Thank you, Jay.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.650
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: I can't
remember the question.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.730
Oh, yeah, I remember now.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.350
I was a writer and--

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.400
shit, I wasn't a writer.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.730
I was an actor in high
school and college.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.320
And I was in a lot of plays,
like "Death of a Salesman."

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.070
I was Tony in "West Side Story."

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.660
You know, because
in the theater,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.760
it's all race-blind casting.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.150
But when I looked at
the movie screens,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.627
I noticed that there
were no Indians on them

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:48.960
and there were no Indians in TV.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.709
I mean, Ben Kingsley
had won for "Gandhi,"

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.390
but I didn't think they were
going to take a "Gandhi 2."

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.910
and they weren't going to cast
me in it, that's for sure.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.370
So I was not sure
about showbusiness.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.710
It seemed like a really
stupid idea for an Indian guy.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.560
Also, you know, I had gotten
a lot of laughs in plays

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.730
that I had done in school, but
your friends laughing at you

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.400
is one thing.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.000
But I decided I'd give
myself a test, which

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.420
was to find out if I could
make strangers laugh.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.610
And so at Colgate,
juniors, a lot of them

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.290
go off to Europe or China
or somewhere and study.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.440
I went and took a semester at
Loyola University in Chicago,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.569
and I joined up with the
Improv Olympic, which is--

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:40.610
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Now iO.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.818
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: iO, right.

00:04:41.818 --> 00:04:45.620
And I got into a beginning--

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.490
well, it was like
an improv class

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.060
taught by this guy
Del Close, who's

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.090
sort of the father of improv.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.010
Chris Farley was in
that class at the time.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.810
He was in the highest
group and his shows

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.590
with guys like Dave Koechner
and that were poetic.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.720
I mean, they were amazing.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.930
My shows, which were with
the beginning improvisers who

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.200
had just signed up,
were a grinding,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.250
awful 45 minutes of silence.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.440
I was not making strangers
laugh in this improv.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.960
I mean, our group, it was awful.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.110
And so I said, well, I'm
not passing my test here.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.615
So I thought about--

00:05:27.615 --> 00:05:30.980
I'm like, OK, I'm going to
write some stand-up jokes.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.910
So I wrote 10 minutes
of stand-up jokes.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.020
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
That's a lot of minutes.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.020
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: Yeah.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.540
I mean, they said
you had to do 10.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.555
So I signed up for an open mic.

00:05:38.555 --> 00:05:40.680
And I went to a place called
the Match Stick, which

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.150
I think was in Lincoln Park.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.530
And I went up on
a Tuesday night.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.870
I drank like four Tom Collins,
which was inexplicably

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.860
my drink at the time.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:06:00.791
I went into the awful
bathroom of that place

00:06:00.791 --> 00:06:02.040
and had a nerve shit, frankly.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.500
And then they called
my name, and I went up

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.000
and I did my 10 minutes of
stand-up in about five minutes.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.140
I just raced through it.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.760
I'm like, I got to
get off the stage.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.890
But I got laughs.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.780
Strangers were laughing.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.510
And I'm like, OK, OK.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.700
And so over the next
semester, I did--

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.320
another 20 times, I went up.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.150
And sometimes I would kill,
and sometimes I would bomb,

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.260
and it was the same exact jokes.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.010
And I found out that the more--

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:40.130
if I memorized every single
line, every breath, every look,

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.630
I would bomb.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.552
Sometimes they'd be like,
OK, you're going up sixth,

00:06:47.552 --> 00:06:48.760
and they'd call me up second.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.610
And I'm like ah.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.693
And they'd already called
you up, you're like, ah.

00:06:51.693 --> 00:06:53.335
And you go up,
usually I would kill.

00:06:53.335 --> 00:06:54.960
And I talked to my
mom, and she's like,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.582
you know, you're telling
these jokes and they need to--

00:06:58.582 --> 00:07:00.540
it should be like you're
in a bar telling jokes

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.206
to your friends.

00:07:01.206 --> 00:07:03.390
It needs to feel spontaneous.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.630
It's probably too canned
when you memorize.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.880
I mean, it's one of those
few jobs where the more you

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.045
prepare, the worse you are.

00:07:11.045 --> 00:07:12.420
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
I felt that way

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.820
with trying to pronounce
your name today.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.910
I said it in the mirror
probably 100 times,

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.770
and the only time it
mattered, I fumbled.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:20.480
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR:
Yeah, you botched it.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.386
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:21.386 --> 00:07:22.470
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR:
You really botched it.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.886
ALLAN WEINBERGER: I should've
just walked up and tried it.

00:07:24.886 --> 00:07:26.550
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: Yeah.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.430
ALLAN WEINBERGER: So your
book "Mustache Shenanigans"--

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.930
which it is available here.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.320
Google has subsidized the rate.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.600
So if anyone would like them,
you can get them signed.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.020
I think there's an
audiobook as well.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.830
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: Yeah.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:38.790
ALLAN WEINBERGER: We don't
sell the audiobook here,

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.460
but you can get that online.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.870
In the book, you talk a
lot about "Super Troopers"

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.070
and the making of it.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.110
And one part that I
found really interesting

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.410
is that you actually
had access--

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.670
with the original script--

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.850
to a lot of these production
houses and Miramax.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.370
And Harvey Weinstein
gave it a read,

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.110
and ultimately turned it down--

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.360
and a series of turndowns.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.159
How did you guys
feel with this--

00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:05.700
you know, you knew
you had something,

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.620
but it was getting
rejected all the time.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.578
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: Bad.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.530
We made a film called
"Puddle Cruiser" first.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:18.690
And we went to Sundance and
we had amazing screenings--

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.630
like packed houses, huge laughs.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.490
People were like,
who are these guys?

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.380
And yet the film didn't sell.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.430
And eventually it did sell, but
it didn't sell out of Sundance.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.690
And we were like, now what?

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.220
So we wrote the script--

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.647
I mean, what happened was
Miramax flirted with buying it.

00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:34.730
He flirted with buying it.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.370
And Harvey just was
never in the room

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.614
when we had a big screening.

00:08:40.614 --> 00:08:42.530
His staff is like, you
have to buy this movie.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.570
And he goes, yeah,
set up a screening.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.000
We'd set up a huge screening,
it'd get huge laughs,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.050
he wouldn't show up.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.020
And finally, he saw
it alone in his office

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.550
and he really liked it.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:58.502
So he called me and he said,
this is a really good movie.

00:08:58.502 --> 00:08:59.960
I want to make a
TV show out of it.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.640
And I'm like, why don't
we just set up a screening

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.930
and you can watch it,
and you can buy it?

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.760
And he goes, OK, we'll
set up a screening.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.700
So we set up a screening
and we did the screening

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.100
on 3rd Street and
11th Avenue, which

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.350
is right next to
NYU, where there

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.660
are a lot of film students.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.130
And so we had this
big screening.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.530
And, of course, Harvey
doesn't show up.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.430
And the screening kills.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.590
It's just great laughter.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.881
His executives are like, it's
killing, you got to come.

00:09:23.881 --> 00:09:25.520
So he comes and
arrives at the end

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.811
of the screening, which is
when the question and answer

00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:28.850
with the audiences.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.260
The audience is
loving the movie.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.760
They're like, this
is a great movie.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.860
It's about people
our age and da da da.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.310
Then Harvey walks in, and one
by one these film students

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.100
look back and see the
king of independent film

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.110
and they all turn into
basically Pauline Kael.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:46.370
And they're like, the framing
wasn't great on that one shot.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.310
And they all start
trashing the movie.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.730
They're like, we didn't
buy the characters.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.563
And you're like, uh.

00:09:50.563 --> 00:09:52.370
And he's like, sorry, kid.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.510
He goes, but let's try
again on a new one.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.830
And so he goes, bring me
the next script, I'll buy it

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.720
and we'll make that movie.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.070
We wrote "Super Troopers."

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.530
And we wrote, like, 10
drafts of this thing,

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.380
and it got pretty damn good.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.880
And his executives are like,
we're going to make this movie.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.620
We gave it to Harvey.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.930
He read it, and
he said, you know,

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.370
I don't know if it's funny.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.710
And he goes, but don't feel
bad because I usually can't

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.800
tell when something's funny.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.050
And I'm like, OK.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.850
So he goes, but I'm
going to let you

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.810
have it back if you want to
go make it somewhere else.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:26.900
He didn't have to do that.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.580
He could have--

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:27.940
ALLAN WEINBERGER: They
can table it, right?

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.170
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: Most
presidents of studios

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.280
just sit on it.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.394
They're like, I'm
not going to make it,

00:10:33.394 --> 00:10:35.060
but I don't want
someone else to make it

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.380
because then I'll look bad.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.480
So they usually just sit on it
and just stick it in a vault.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.340
But he let me have it
back because he liked me.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.130
And then we went
around to everybody--

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.960
Warner Brothers,
Paramount, Universal.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.297
They said, we'll make it.

00:10:53.297 --> 00:10:55.130
They were going to make
it for $5.5 million,

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.094
but the producer then
couldn't work out his pay

00:10:58.094 --> 00:10:58.760
and it was over.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.420
It was out.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.460
We were green lit,
and then we were not.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.019
So then the Farrelly
brothers called.

00:11:03.019 --> 00:11:03.560
They read it.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.320
They said, this movie would
work if it was set in the '70s.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.730
And we're like, OK.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.340
So we wrote the
'70s version, and it

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.110
was called "Super Trooper '76."

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.360
Then Fox read it.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.421
They're like, yeah,
it's good, but you guys

00:11:16.421 --> 00:11:17.420
are going to star in it?

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.740
I don't think so.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.850
And we're like, OK.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.330
So then nobody would finance it.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.824
Then we went to all the
independent financers

00:11:24.824 --> 00:11:26.240
and we met with a
bunch of people.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.430
One guy was like, I'll
give you the money

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.470
if Ben Affleck can play Thorny.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.450
And I'm like, I'm
playing Thorny.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.690
He goes, not in this
movie, you're not.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.010
And I'm like--

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.840
So we really struck out.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.660
Nobody would finance
the movie, basically

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.570
because we weren't stars.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.210
Broken Lizard was basically
about to break up.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:48.440
We packed up our office.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.350
I was packing up my office and
I was going to move out to LA

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.900
and just try to audition
and see what happens.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:58.190
And I was packing my
office and the phone rang,

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.530
and it was my friend Cricket
who I went to college with.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:04.880
And she said, I hate to ask
you, but my dad's a banker,

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.330
and he's retiring and he
wants to write movie scripts.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.180
And you're the only guy
who's sort of making movies,

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.665
so I told him about you and
he wants to talk to you.

00:12:13.665 --> 00:12:14.540
And I said, OK, sure.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.590
So I talked to him and he
goes, I wrote this script,

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:22.550
and it's like a girl
comedy road movie

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.629
and I'm wondering if
you could take a read.

00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:26.420
And I'm like, yeah,
sure, I'll take a read.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.961
And he goes, actually, before
I send it to you, why don't you

00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:30.650
send me a sample of
your stuff so I just

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.710
know what your style is.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.210
And I'm like, oh,
you're auditioning

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.010
me to read your script.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.970
OK, got it.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:40.830
So I sent him "Super
Troopers" and I'm like,

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.538
I hope he doesn't like
it because I don't

00:12:42.538 --> 00:12:43.940
want to read his damn script.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.510
And he calls me a week later.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:50.052
And he's like, this
thing's pretty funny.

00:12:50.052 --> 00:12:51.260
And I said, oh, yeah, thanks.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.635
He goes, what's
going on with it?

00:12:52.635 --> 00:12:56.315
And I'm like, well, nothing.

00:12:56.315 --> 00:12:57.440
Nothing's going on with it.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.670
We can't get any
money to make it.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.860
And he goes, can you make
it for a million dollars?

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.417
And I said, yeah.

00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:05.750
And he said, all right, I'll
give you a million dollars.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:09.140
And I said, oh, OK.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.920
And three weeks later we
were casting the movie.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:20.330
And the movie sold for about
$3.25 million at Sundance.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.750
I mean, he's made nine times
his investment on that movie.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:28.320
Nobody in showbusiness
thought it was a good bet.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.647
And this guy's like, OK,
and then there he goes.

00:13:32.647 --> 00:13:34.230
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
So the movie went on

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.650
to make about $80 million--

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.790
well worth the investment there.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.500
So "Super Troopers 2" is
coming out later this year.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.010
Is that--

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.060
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: In
the next six months.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.935
ALLAN WEINBERGER: In
the next six months, OK.

00:13:46.935 --> 00:13:48.570
And you guys did
something unique.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.084
You went the route
of crowdfunding it.

00:13:51.084 --> 00:13:52.500
Now, with such a
successful movie,

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.990
you'd think these movie houses
would be banging down your door

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.031
to get in on this action.

00:13:56.031 --> 00:13:58.102
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR:
You would think.

00:13:58.102 --> 00:13:59.310
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Fill me in.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.140
Why'd you go the route
of crowdsourcing--

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.850
or crowdfunding?

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.100
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: I mean,
the first film was a shock,

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.640
I think, to the studio, and
it continues to be a shock.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.470
I mean, they listed it--

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.940
this was a number of years ago.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.324
It was probably
five, six years--

00:14:14.324 --> 00:14:15.240
maybe eight years ago.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.990
They listed it on why Fox
had had such a good year.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.869
It was "Star Wars,"
"Super Troopers."

00:14:21.869 --> 00:14:23.910
I mean, this was like 10
years after it came out.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.520
It was still just
churning money for them.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.700
And so we were like, OK.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.810
But there was so much
money made that we had--

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.330
and they, of course, were
like, oh, it didn't really

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.780
make that much.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.825
And of course that's
the dance in Hollywood.

00:14:39.825 --> 00:14:41.580
The studio's like,
oh, where's the money?

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.540
We don't know.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.296
And then you audit them, and
then someone says, OK, this

00:14:45.296 --> 00:14:46.420
is how much it really made.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.711
You have to write them a check.

00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:49.110
That's how it works.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.302
And we all know it, and
we're all fine with it.

00:14:51.302 --> 00:14:52.260
That's just what we do.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:56.700
There was a debate--

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.040
there was an argument about
how much the profit was.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.930
And so it was locked up
in a legal issue that

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.330
went on for four or five years.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.290
And so it took a while.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:10.320
And out of the settlement--

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.930
part of it was, OK,
you can make the movie.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:18.600
But while that was happening,
the entire film business

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.760
became a business
that only wanted

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.760
to make movies where the main
characters were in tights

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.590
and wore capes.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.650
That was the only kind of movie
they wanted to make at all.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:34.860
And so when we went to ask them
to make it, they were like--

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.310
they said, look, we know
the sequel will make money,

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.680
we just don't know if
it'll make enough money.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.330
And I'll give you an
example, a story here.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.670
I had a deal at Warner Brothers.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.410
And I went into the
president of Warner Brothers,

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:54.680
and he said, what kind of
movies are we going to make?

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.140
He goes, I want to make
$100 million comedies

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.820
with any of these two stars--

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:08.970
Johnny Depp, Ben Stiller,
Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.290
That's the whole list.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:15.300
And I was like, OK, what
if instead we make five

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.450
$20-million movies and we'll
put some up-and-comers in it,

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.720
like Broken Lizard?

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:26.040
And you know, whatever, we'll
make some cheaper movies

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.440
and we'll be able
to make more of them

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.990
and we'll make
them more quickly.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.820
And he goes, what's the most one
of those $20-million movies can

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:33.320
make?

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.910
And I said, $100 million.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.440
That's a $80-million profit.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.350
And he goes, that's a double.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.810
He goes, we need
movies that will

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.740
gross $250 to $400 million.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.770
We need grand slams.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.554
We need movies that will
move the stock price.

00:16:49.554 --> 00:16:50.220
And I was like--

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.420
ALLAN WEINBERGER: That sounds
like working at Google.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.850
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: Well,
that's the problem,

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.880
is that corporations
bought movie companies

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.610
because they wanted a
fun little media piece.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.010
And then they saw
what "Iron Man" did

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:05.579
and they saw what these
really great superhero movies

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:09.339
are doing is making so much
money that the whole industry

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:12.000
has turned towards them only.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.255
But to the exclusion of--

00:17:14.255 --> 00:17:15.630
And I'll tell you,
the reason why

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.940
is because you
can take an action

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:22.650
film with a guy in tights and a
cape, and it can play in China,

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.960
it can play in India, it
can play all over the world.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.130
The Chinese don't get
what meow versus--

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:29.880
they don't get it.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.020
They're like, what?

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.340
What's funny about that?

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.930
And so the movies don't
travel well there,

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.770
and so there's a ceiling
on what comedies can make.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.280
And as a result, they
don't to make them.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.050
So it's the same with--

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:46.050
they don't make movies
like "Kramer vs. Kramer,"

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:49.380
they don't make movies
like "Breaking Away,"

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.050
these smaller $20 to
$50-million movies.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.900
They're like, no, no, put
them in a cape and the tights,

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.280
or we're out.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.220
And so with "Super Troopers
2," I know they probably

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.290
had a conversation
where they're like,

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.140
do you think we could put
the "Super Troopers" in capes

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.210
and make them "Super" Troopers?

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.360
I mean, I'm sure they
had that conversation.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.646
So they said, guys, go raise
the money and make the movie

00:18:13.646 --> 00:18:14.520
and we'll release it.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.270
Which, by the way, is a huge
gift to give us a release slot.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.310
It's amazing.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.300
So we did that.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.960
And we decided to go to
a crowdfunding site--

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.060
Indiegogo-- and see if
we could raise money.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.010
And the risk was if the audience
was like, nah, who cares,

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.560
we don't want to see a
sequel, it's been too long,

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.020
or whatever, then the
movie would have died

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.530
because the studio would
have been like, god,

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.480
nobody wants to see this.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.100
But we raised $2 million in
24 hours and $4.7 million

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.030
over 30 days.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:51.390
And after that, we were able
to raise a bunch more money

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.130
to make the film.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.450
ALLAN WEINBERGER: So it's done?

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:55.324
It's ready to launch?

00:18:55.324 --> 00:18:57.117
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: It's done.

00:18:57.117 --> 00:18:57.950
The editing is done.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.930
We're now-- the Eagles of
Death Metal are my buddies

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.060
and they're recording
the soundtrack.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.020
There's the score.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.120
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Gotcha.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.620
Well, in the book,
you go through a lot

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.920
of behind the scenes,
a lot of the anecdotes

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.519
from each part of the movie.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:15.060
What we thought
would be a lot of fun

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.970
here is if we show
some clips of the movie

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.240
and you give us a little behind
the scenes what was going on,

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.910
what people can expect from the
book, and it'll be a lot of fun

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:24.409
here.

00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:27.340
Following this, we'll
have a live Q&amp;A.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.220
So if anyone has any
questions, there'll

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.345
be a microphone over there.

00:19:30.345 --> 00:19:34.200
But Nick, if you can
play the first clip.

00:19:37.357 --> 00:19:38.260
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.650
- One, two, three, do it.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.680
Aw, go girlfriend.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.347
I'm your mother.

00:19:45.347 --> 00:19:47.221
Come on, Thorny, you're
losing to the rookie.

00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:47.990
It's embarrassing.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.360
Come on, Rabbit, you can do it.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.115
Oh, Rabbit, he's killing you.

00:19:52.115 --> 00:19:53.700
I got Thorny in front by a lot.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.450
What's the matter?

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.486
Your mama didn't
teach you how to chug?

00:19:56.486 --> 00:19:57.110
Come on, Thorn.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.234
Come on, Thorn.

00:19:59.234 --> 00:20:00.070
Oh!

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.588
Oh.

00:20:01.588 --> 00:20:03.880
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.070
- I am all that is man.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.670
- Every time.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:08.340
- Finish it up.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.850
See, there you have it.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.120
You're doing it all wrong.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.000
You got to open your
throat, relax the jaw.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.662
- Don't forget to cup the balls.

00:20:18.662 --> 00:20:20.870
You're never going to win
with those thin little bird

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:21.662
lips you got there.

00:20:21.662 --> 00:20:23.661
See, this guy's got these
big old powerful lips.

00:20:23.661 --> 00:20:24.640
Am I correct, Thorn?

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.290
- So much of my authority is
derived from the power right

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.976
here.

00:20:28.976 --> 00:20:29.860
- Hey, guys.

00:20:36.204 --> 00:20:37.180
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.480
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: That was
a real reaction, that "wow."

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.420
He was in trouble.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.890
If you look at
that scene, there's

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:49.090
one shot in there where there's
a profile of us drinking,

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.580
and you can see that
the liquid in my bottle

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:56.320
is moving very quickly, because
that is very thick iced tea.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.390
And so we shot that--
that was the master.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.140
That was the wide.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.660
And we shot that first.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.220
And we looked at it, we're
like, it doesn't look right.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.652
It looks like iced tea.

00:21:05.652 --> 00:21:07.360
And so we sent a
production assistant out

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.920
to buy real maple syrup.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.230
And he came back
with eight bottles.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.680
I drank two full bottles.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.612
I made Eric drink about three
bottles because I was like,

00:21:17.612 --> 00:21:18.820
I don't think we have it yet.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.830
You better go again, buddy.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:27.880
And it was something
I will never do again.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.560
I mean, after we did it
and we finished the scene,

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.580
we immediately went to the
bathroom to try to throw it up,

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.080
but it was too thick.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.010
So then we went into--

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.200
It was lunch, and we
went into my trailer

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.840
because we were
not feeling good.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.630
And we turned the light out
and we lay on the ground

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.960
and just shivered
for about 45 minutes.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.660
And I really
thought I might die.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.145
You're like, I might die.

00:22:00.725 --> 00:22:02.140
He had the rest of the day off.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.807
I had to shoot a love
scene, which didn't even

00:22:05.807 --> 00:22:06.640
make into the movie.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.030
And then afterwards I went--

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.740
we were staying in a
motel near Poughkeepsie,

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.590
and I went back to the motel.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.040
I went to his room.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.399
And he came out of his room and
he goes, have you pooped yet?

00:22:22.399 --> 00:22:23.440
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Oh, no.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.960
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: And I said,
no, but I'm headed there now.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.940
And he goes, there's
a reason maple syrup

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.070
is part of the Master Cleanse.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.920
And I'll spare you
the gory details,

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.210
but things came out of me that
I don't remember ever going in.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:42.350
Like, I shat a
fossilized bird, like,

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:45.520
a stick with a fully
intact leaf on it.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.380
I was like, oh, OK, I
don't remember that.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:52.930
But it's not good.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.360
Never again.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.476
Never again.

00:22:55.476 --> 00:22:57.017
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
All right, we don't

00:22:57.017 --> 00:23:00.010
need to bring the maple
syrup out that I had planned.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.390
Let's play the second clip.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.400
- Sorry about that.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.660
- All right, meow, hand over
your license and registration.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.377
Your registration.

00:23:17.377 --> 00:23:18.870
- Oh.

- Hurry up meow.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.622
- Sorry.

00:23:23.622 --> 00:23:26.330
- Is there something
funny here, boy?

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:26.830
No.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.130
No, no.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:31.040
- Well, then why are you
laughing, Mr. Larry Johnson?

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.240
All right, meow, where were we?

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.870
- I'm sorry, are
you saying meow?

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:38.880
- Am I saying meow?

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:42.049
- I thought--

00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:42.840
- Don't think, boy.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.589
Meow, do you know how
fast you were going?

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.250
Meow, what is so damn funny?

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.380
- I could've swore
you said meow.

- Do I look like
a cat to you, boy?

00:23:54.046 --> 00:23:57.110
Am I jumping around all
nimbly-bimbly from tree

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.790
to tree?

00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:58.460
- No, no.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.836
- Am I drinking
milk from a saucer?

00:24:00.836 --> 00:24:01.810
- No.

- Well, do you see
me eating mice?

00:24:04.975 --> 00:24:08.410
Now you stop laughing right now.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:09.130
- Yes, sir.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:12.060
- Meow, I'm going to have to
give you a ticket on this one.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:12.560
- But--

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.230
- No buts meow.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:15.920
That's the law.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.320
Not so funny meow, is it?

00:24:22.688 --> 00:24:23.188
Meow!

00:24:27.589 --> 00:24:28.424
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:28.424 --> 00:24:29.715
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: That scene--

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:39.110
we were writing "Super
Troopers" and we were in--

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:44.480
the five of us were sleeping
in a motel in Burbank

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.800
because we didn't
have much cash.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.250
And we were up
smoking and joking

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.110
and it was about
4:30 in the morning.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:54.221
And I have a bad left ear from
like ear infections as a kid

00:24:54.221 --> 00:24:54.720
from--

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.845
I used to swim in this lake
that was kind of dirty.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.770
And so the ear's not that great.

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.600
And I heard somebody say
something now and I say,

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.980
did you say meow?

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.190
And then for the next hour
we riffed on sentences

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.220
with meow replacing now.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.750
And then we just went to bed.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:19.580
And somebody wrote on a
napkin now equals meow.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.490
And three weeks later, we
were in a writing meeting

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.221
and someone's like-- we were
trying to think of a pullover.

00:25:25.221 --> 00:25:25.970
What could you do?

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:27.595
And someone's like,
remember that thing

00:25:27.595 --> 00:25:29.280
we did where the
meow is the now?

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.810
And we're like, oh, yeah.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.800
And so we wrote up
that little scene.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.050
And we were reading it.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.330
Once we finished the
movie, we were reading it.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:45.400
And at one point I was
going to be the meow guy.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.910
I was going to be in that scene.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:51.470
But the movie takes
place in Vermont.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:54.440
And you're like, OK.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.240
The problem with the
scene was we read it

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:01.280
without a Southern accent
and it wasn't that funny.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.216
It just didn't land.

00:26:03.216 --> 00:26:05.090
And then when we put a
Southern accent on it,

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.990
it was really funny.

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:12.500
And I'm like, I said I could buy
a white Southerner in Vermont,

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.220
I could buy that.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.640
But like an Indian guy with
a southern accent in Vermont,

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.680
I was like, I just don't buy it.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.882
So I had Paul do it,
and, you know, lucky him.

00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:25.340
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
So a lot of times

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:30.350
these, jokes, they just
take off on their own.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.230
I went to see Dave Chapelle
once and someone yelled out,

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.590
I'm Rick James, bitch, and I
could see him die a little.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:40.100
Do you ever get approached
and yelled like, meow,

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.070
or, can I go on a mustache ride?

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:44.570
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR:
Every 10 minutes.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.870
And because of my left
ear, I often miss it.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:54.050
But, yeah, people come
up to me and they slip it

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:54.800
in all the time.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.510
And usually I really do miss it.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.820
And then I'm like, I got it.

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.590
I got it.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:03.740
And the mustache rides--
yeah, yeah, a lot of women

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.310
ask me to give them
mustache rides.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.810
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:10.350
ALLAN WEINBERGER: I've never
had that happen yet, but--

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.350
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: You've
never had that happen?

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.475
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Not once.

00:27:13.475 --> 00:27:14.367
Not once.

00:27:14.367 --> 00:27:15.450
Let's play the third clip.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:20.400
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.307
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: Oh, yeah.

00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:23.140
- Welcome to Dimpus.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:24.550
Can I take your order?

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:28.075
- Give me a double
bacon cheeseburger.

00:27:28.075 --> 00:27:29.480
- Double baco cheeseburger.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.839
It's for a cop.

00:27:31.839 --> 00:27:33.255
- What the hell
is that all about?

00:27:33.255 --> 00:27:34.720
He going to spit in it now?

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.520
- No, I was just telling him
that so he makes it good.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.975
Don't spit in that cop's burger.

00:27:40.975 --> 00:27:41.950
- Yeah, thanks.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:42.450
- Roger.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.890
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.750
- Give me a pie.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:47.425
Apple.

00:27:47.425 --> 00:27:49.450
- Do you want me
to hold the spit?

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:51.830
Just kidding, Officer Farva.

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:55.175
So do you want to dimpusize
your meal for a quarter more?

00:27:55.175 --> 00:27:57.940
FARVA: You want me to
punchicize your face for free?

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.140
- Some male figure?

00:27:59.140 --> 00:27:59.950
I'm his dad.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.020
And stop with the
whole transfer thing.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.804
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:03.804 --> 00:28:04.470
- You know what?

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.990
I got to go.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:06.700
Let's talk about this later, OK?

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.830
OK, bye.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.846
- Now, don't give me any lip.

00:28:10.846 --> 00:28:12.130
- It's just a quarter.

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:13.810
And look how much more you get.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:15.140
- I said, no.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.290
- It's just $0.25.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.760
- Hey, listen, guy,
he doesn't want it.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.260
- I can handle this, Rama Thorn.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.500
I don't want it.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.570
- Right.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.670
Beverage?

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:27.450
- Give me a liter of cola.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:28.600
- A what?

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.920
- A liter of cola.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.080
- Liter of cola.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.950
Do we make liter of cola?

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:36.280
- Will you just
order a large, Farva?

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.810
- I don't want a "Large Farva."

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:39.820
I want a goddamn liter of cola.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.570
- I don't know what that is.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.544
- Liter is French for give
me some fucking cola before I

00:28:44.544 --> 00:28:45.964
break those fucking lips!

00:28:45.964 --> 00:28:47.495
- All right, all right, relax!

00:28:50.712 --> 00:28:51.640
[END PLAYBACK]

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.270
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: I have a
lot to say about that scene.

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:58.180
The kid who played the
Dimpus Burger Guy is a guy

00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.950
named Charlie Finn.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:06.010
And I discovered him on
the streets of Hollywood.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:08.440
I went to the Improv
Olympic in Hollywood

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:13.300
looking for guys that age to put
into a pilot we were shooting.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.630
And I didn't really see
anybody perform that day.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.620
But then I went outside
and I saw this guy

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.800
smoking a cigarette, and
he's like meh, meh, meh.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.289
He was just talking real funny.

00:29:22.289 --> 00:29:24.580
And I went up to him, and I
was like, are you an actor?

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.160
And he goes, I guess.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.060
And I was like, you want to
audition for an NBC pilot?

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.590
He goes, OK.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.900
And he'd never been
on an audition.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.460
He was just a funny guy
who moved out to Hollywood.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.460
He was in the Improv Olympic.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.880
And we got him onto this NBC
show and he was hilarious.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.480
And so we cast him in this role.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.700
And it's probably my favorite
performance in the movie.

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:49.600
I love this guy.

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.970
So the origin of
this scene was--

00:29:55.970 --> 00:30:00.816
we used to go to
Burger King in our--

00:30:00.816 --> 00:30:01.440
Let me go back.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.815
Let me talk about
something else.

00:30:02.815 --> 00:30:07.350
So McDonald's invented
the notion of supersizing.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.027
I think it was while
we were in college.

00:30:09.027 --> 00:30:10.860
They used to have just
small, medium, large.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.680
Then they invented
the supersized.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.330
And their employees
were instructed

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:21.380
to badger the customers
until they upsold this thing.

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.420
And so you'd go in, you're
like, I'll have a large.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.790
They're like, you
want to supersize it

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:27.630
for a quarter more?

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:28.374
And I'm like, no.

00:30:28.374 --> 00:30:29.790
They're like, it's
just a quarter.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:30.750
I'm like, no.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:32.249
They're like, it's
just a quarter.

00:30:32.249 --> 00:30:33.540
I mean, really, just a quarter?

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.660
And I became so
frustrated by it that we

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.570
wrote that scene into that.

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:43.230
And then the liter--

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:46.470
the Burger King in
our town was managed

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:51.390
by a guy who I'm certain
was a Canadian because he

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:53.760
had small, medium, and liter.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.260
He did not have a large.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.370
And we would roll in, hungover
on a Saturday afternoon,

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.500
and buy liters of iced tea.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.430
But I'm an American.

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:04.700
I want a large iced tea.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.330
I do not want a liter.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.570
I do not go metric.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.620
And so we'd go in and we'd say--

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.920
I'd say, give me a large
iced tea or a large Coke.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.100
And he instructed his workers
to say, we don't have larges,

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.510
we only have liters.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:22.530
And so I'd sit there at
the speaker and be like,

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:23.459
give me a large.

00:31:23.459 --> 00:31:25.500
And he's like, we don't
have large, just a liter.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.150
And we would go at it.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.160
And finally I'm like,
fine, give me a liter.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.710
And this Canadian
bastard just won this--

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:33.210
he won.

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:33.810
He won.

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.520
And we got him back.

00:31:39.334 --> 00:31:40.500
ALLAN WEINBERGER: All right.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.708
Thank you very much for that.

00:31:41.708 --> 00:31:43.609
We're going to
open it up to Q&amp;A.

00:31:43.609 --> 00:31:45.150
So if anyone has
any questions, there

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:49.410
is a microphone over there.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:50.985
Not all at once, guys.

00:31:50.985 --> 00:31:51.860
AUDIENCE: Hey, there.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:54.420
So first off, go 'Gate.

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.310
So fellow Colgate alum.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:57.960
And I've always
wondered this and been

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.850
asked this a lot-- because
coming from Chicago,

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:01.474
people used to ask
why you would end up

00:32:01.474 --> 00:32:03.180
in Upstate New York to me.

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.010
And I'm wondering,
for you-- who I

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:06.551
would assume at the
time you probably

00:32:06.551 --> 00:32:09.190
had a sense of the dramatic
arts is where you wanted to go--

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:12.540
and obviously New York and
NYU or Northwestern or USC

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.891
might have seemed like more
logical solutions for that.

00:32:15.891 --> 00:32:17.640
How did you end up at
a small liberal arts

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.400
school in Upstate New
York versus a more

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.950
traditional dramatic program?

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:25.110
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: How
I ended up at Colgate,

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:28.570
which ended up
shaping my whole life,

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:34.110
is one of the great
flukes in my story.

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:35.860
Colgate, for those of
you that don't know,

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.030
it's got 2,750 students.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:42.230
It's 3 and 1/2 hours
north of New York City.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.690
It's a beautiful--
it's a great school.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:46.970
It's like number
19 in the country.

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.790
And it's surrounded
by farmland basically,

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:51.050
but it's a beautiful place.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.960
It wins the most beautiful
campus in the country

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.890
almost every year.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:33:02.120
And so I, in high school, had
a very high opinion of myself.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:07.790
I really-- while I didn't have
the grades to get into the Ivy

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:12.050
League, I thought, they're
going to let me in anyway.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:16.460
And so I applied to Harvard,
Yale, Stanford, Dartmouth,

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:21.800
I applied to Northwestern,
and Brown, and that's it.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:28.490
And I was like, yeah and my
grade point average was B-plus.

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:33.320
And I'm like, OK, but they're
going to love my personality

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.000
and they're going to love my--

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:35.930
I'm going to get in.

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:42.790
And so I started to second-guess
myself late in January.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.480
I'm like, I'm a little worried.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.410
What happens if I
don't get in anywhere?

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.170
And I'm walking down
the hallway and I

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:50.991
happen to run into my
girlfriend at the time.

00:33:50.991 --> 00:33:53.240
And I said, you know, I'm a
little nervous about where

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.114
I applied to schools.

00:33:54.114 --> 00:33:56.540
I said, do you have any
applications in your locker?

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.040
And she goes,
yeah, I think I do.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.960
And so we go to her
locker and she pulls out

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.039
one for Boston College, Boston
University, and Colgate.

00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:04.580
And I look at them,
and I'm like, OK,

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.280
my essay can fit these.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.584
So I ran around to my teachers.

00:34:07.584 --> 00:34:09.209
I'm like, you got to
send it out today.

00:34:09.209 --> 00:34:11.276
They send out recommendations.

00:34:11.276 --> 00:34:12.650
The three schools
that I got into

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:16.810
were Boston College, Boston
University, and Colgate.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:23.739
And with all of
the A-plus Indians

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:25.989
that these schools
had to sift through,

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:28.760
they certainly didn't want
this junky old B-plus Indian.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:34.730
I mean, they're like, why would
we take you, B-plus Indian?

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:39.590
And so I looked at
the rankings and I'm

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:42.770
like, OK, Colgate's higher than
these other two, I'll go there.

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.690
And so that's why
I went to Colgate.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:48.230
And it's the greatest
place on earth.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.325
I mean, I loved that
place more than--

00:34:51.325 --> 00:34:54.108
I only cry about once a decade.

00:34:54.108 --> 00:34:54.649
I don't know.

00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:58.010
I have very dry tear ducts.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:03.495
And I wept at the
bar on the last night

00:35:03.495 --> 00:35:05.370
when I had to leave
there because I loved it.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:06.980
It's still my favorite place.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.600
AUDIENCE: Can I ask which bar?

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.080
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: The Jug.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:09.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah, there we go.

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:10.790
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: There
are two bars in town--

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:11.870
The Jug and The [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.490
AUDIENCE: I was like, it's
that or The [? Bacon, ?] yeah.

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.700
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: Yeah.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.577
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:14.577 --> 00:35:15.410
AUDIENCE: Hey there.

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:17.540
I'm curious what
kind of response

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.872
you got from patrolmen and
women and the police community.

00:35:21.872 --> 00:35:22.580
Did they like it?

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.500
Did you capture it?

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.440
Were they offended?

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.120
What were some of
the best responses?

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.870
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: We thought
we would be frequently arrested

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.110
after we made that film.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:38.450
And it was sort of-- we didn't
really hear about anything much

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:40.490
until we made "Beerfest."

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:44.120
And we were down in Albuquerque
and we were making "Beerfest."

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.670
And to try to get in
character, we basically

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:50.030
had a beer pong
party every night.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:53.840
We were playing a lot of
beer pong, and we were loud.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.610
So we had these huge parties.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:36:00.260
And on like a Tuesday night,
there was a noise complaint.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.480
And there was a
knock on the door.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.550
I open the door,
and it's two cops.

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:06.750
And I was like--

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:10.200
look, I've always been
very polite to cops.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:13.620
And so I'm like,
hey, guys, so sorry.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.390
My apologies.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:18.250
And the cop looks at me and
then he looks at his partner

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:22.370
and he goes, you have
a good evening, sir.

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:24.500
And they turn around
and walk away.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.460
And I'm like, OK.

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.979
And so I close the door and
I'm like, I don't know what--

00:36:28.979 --> 00:36:30.020
they didn't say anything.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.330
I said, they just left.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.380
And I'm like, OK.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.170
10 minutes later, I open the
door again, another knock, it's

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:36.890
seven cops.

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:42.560
And the same guy
goes, can we come in

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.071
and party with you, sir?

00:36:45.071 --> 00:36:47.470
And I was like, yeah.

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:52.100
And I'm leading the pack,
I'm like, hide the bongs.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.490
And they stayed for
like a half an hour.

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:58.640
And we just drank and
raged and had a great time.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:02.300
And it was then that I realized
that what they like about this

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.920
movie is that they're--

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:09.890
mostly in Hollywood, we have
crooked cops and evil cops

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:13.700
or really good cops who
are just super nice.

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.370
We made human cops,
I think, to them.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:18.885
They feel human in our
film and they feel like--

00:37:18.885 --> 00:37:21.260
they are bored sometimes, they
do mess around with people

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:21.759
sometimes.

00:37:21.759 --> 00:37:27.740
I mean, it has become
hard to get a ticket.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:31.820
We speed, they pull us over,
they walk up, they're like,

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:32.889
oh, I'm sorry, sir.

00:37:32.889 --> 00:37:33.680
Are you in a hurry?

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.630
Do you need an escort somewhere?

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:38.090
Kevin Heffernan,
he played Farva.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:40.670
We were throwing out the first
pitch in San Diego Qualcomm

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:42.440
Stadium and he was late.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:46.280
So he was driving 90 down
the 405, gets pulled over.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.680
The cop says, oh my god, Farva!

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.230
And he goes, I'm throwing
out the first pitch.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.550
He goes, follow me.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:58.010
They drive 105 down
to the stadium.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:59.960
Kevin doesn't know
where to park.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.430
The cop's like, just
stick it right there.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.960
And he gets out, and each
cop is like, I got him.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.920
And they're walking him
all the way into the mound.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.130
It's amazing, right?

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:11.990
It's amazing.

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:13.115
AUDIENCE: That's fantastic.

00:38:13.115 --> 00:38:14.450
Thank you.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:17.270
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
there are any actual plans

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:20.630
to release "Potfest," or
was that just a fun trailer

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:21.890
with Willie Nelson?

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:24.223
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: They don't
have a drug testing policy

00:38:24.223 --> 00:38:25.790
here?

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:29.035
Because test this guy.

00:38:29.035 --> 00:38:31.517
AUDIENCE: We actually don't
have a very strict drug testing

00:38:31.517 --> 00:38:32.792
policy.

00:38:32.792 --> 00:38:34.250
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR:
Well, at the end

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:37.400
of "Beerfest," there's
a joke about "Potfest,"

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.420
which was a real joke.

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.105
I mean, we were really kidding.

00:38:40.105 --> 00:38:41.480
But then there
are so many people

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.690
who keep asking us
about making "Potfest."

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:47.015
And then I've got to know a
lot of the famous stoners.

00:38:47.015 --> 00:38:49.250
I've gotten to know--

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:50.720
Willie, of course,
wants to do it.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.530
I met Snoop.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:52.940
He wants to do it.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:56.690
Cheech and Chong
both want to do it.

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:59.420
Doug Benson wants to do it.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:02.070
We've written about
40 or 50 pages of it,

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:07.790
but then we just get high
and lose our [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:11.952
If we can ever focus and
get it done, we'll do it.

00:39:11.952 --> 00:39:14.750
We'll do it.

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:16.750
AUDIENCE: So I thought
it was really interesting

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:19.450
how you talked about Hollywood
wanting to do superhero movies.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:21.580
And I think those tend
to lend themselves

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.980
to sequels that are all right.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.810
And I'm a huge
"Super Troopers" fan.

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:27.580
Have you got a lot of flak
about that-- of like, all right,

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.320
we're going to do
a sequel and I hope

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.930
it doesn't ruin the first
one or anything like that?

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:34.150
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR:
Yeah, from ourselves,

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:36.760
because we have
the same feelings

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.650
you do about certain sequels.

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:42.920
We're like, should
we risk ruining it?

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.550
Yeah, we will.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:50.270
But ultimately what
we decided was--

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:53.270
I told everybody--
it's been a while,

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:56.000
so I said I'll only shoot
the movie if we're exactly

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.090
the same weight.

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.310
So people will be able
to say, you look older,

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:03.170
but you don't look
fatter and older.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.900
I didn't want people to be able
to say you look fatter, too.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:10.700
So everybody got down to weight.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:15.140
And I also thought, let's
make the mustaches bigger.

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:15.890
That'll help, too.

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.630
So my mustache is
like twice the size.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:26.810
Ultimately, we really wanted
to just make another one.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:29.000
"NYPD Blue" made 200 episodes.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.985
We can make two of these
damn things, right?

00:40:31.985 --> 00:40:36.090
I feel like the key is just
to keep the tone the same.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:38.510
And I know that tone.

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.850
I rewatched the movie
before I shot it.

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:45.980
And I'm like, OK, tough,
funny, try to make it smart,

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:48.860
make all the jokes make
sense, and keep all the jokes

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.260
within a certain bandwidth.

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:54.330
Everything has to feel
like it's possible.

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:56.810
Everything has to
feel like it's real.

00:40:56.810 --> 00:41:01.220
And cast good actors who
know their way around a joke.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.980
And I was worried about it.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.950
But I mean, we've now shown
it to about 500 people

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:11.180
in California at three or
four 200-person screenings,

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:14.720
and the response has
been incredibly good.

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.790
So is it better than this one?

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:17.630
Probably not.

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:21.620
I mean, I think this movie
caught a certain wave that you

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.720
can't necessarily recreate.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:27.450
But it has a ton of jokes in it.

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:29.130
We wrote 30 drafts.

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:30.800
We really worked hard on it.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.860
And I think you'll be able to
play the movies back to back

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.049
and be like, yeah,
they're both good.

00:41:36.049 --> 00:41:37.090
AUDIENCE: That's awesome.

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:40.575
And did you get pushed for any
cameos, speaking of casting

00:41:40.575 --> 00:41:41.450
and things like that?

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.540
Or were people desperate
to get their hands on it?

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.540
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: Yeah.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:49.220
I mean, I was making a TV
show with Rob Lowe called

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:53.480
"The Grinder" and we
got along really well.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.130
He's a really funny guy.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:57.920
He's like a comic trapped
in a leading man's body.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.620
He's just a funny, funny guy.

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.940
And so I shot,
like, four of those.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.750
And then the last one,
we were in his trailer--

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:09.380
whatever, he smokes cigars.

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.020
And I got a part for him.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:15.590
And I just said, hey,
any chance you'd consider

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:16.730
being in "Super Troopers."

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:17.960
He goes, I'm in.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.300
I don't even have to
read the script, I'm in.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.720
And I was like, OK, great.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.470
Everybody we asked said yes.

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:29.930
And so we've got some
fun people in it--

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:33.230
people that fit
the roles, though.

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:35.540
We don't just stick famous
people in movies because--

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:43.110
The reason that movie is what it
is is because we picked a tone

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:45.450
and we stuck to the tone.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:48.030
We don't just put any joke in.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:49.530
It has to fit the tone.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:50.970
And the second
movie is the same.

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:53.833
Every actor fits a tone,
every joke fits a tone.

00:42:53.833 --> 00:42:54.666
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:59.690
ALLAN WEINBERGER: So
Jay, thank you very

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:00.990
much for coming in to Google.

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:03.230
We really appreciate
you coming here.

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:06.110
For everyone else, the
book is available outside--

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:07.501
"Mustache Shenanigans."

00:43:07.501 --> 00:43:09.500
And he'll be sticking
around to take some photos

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.280
and some autographs.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:10.920
Thanks again, Jay.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:11.220
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR: Thanks.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:11.520
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
Appreciate the time.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.895
JAY CHANDRASEKHAR:
Appreciate it.

00:43:12.895 --> 00:43:14.270
