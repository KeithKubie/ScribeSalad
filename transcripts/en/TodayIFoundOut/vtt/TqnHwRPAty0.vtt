00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.520
As the general rule goes, you should never
bring a knife to a gun fight… unless of

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.080
course that knife happens to be an NRS-2,
a knife that also just so happens to have

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.480
a gun built into the handle.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.050
Designed in early 1980s for Spetsnaz troops,
the NRS-2 is still used today by some members

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.099
of the Russian special forces.

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.470
The origins of this peculiar firearm can be
traced back to the 1970s when engineers working

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.239
at the Tula arms factory were tasked with
creating “a close combat weapon for army

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.920
reconnaissance units“. Under the oversight
of designer, R. D. Khlynin, an early precursor

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.510
to the NRS-2 known, interestingly enough,
as the NRS, was developed that made use of

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.949
the recently created SP-3 ammunition. These
are specialised “silenced” bullets that

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.699
had been developed during the Cold War period
especially for spies and special forces units

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.969
operating either covertly or behind enemy
lines.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.640
Although noticeably weaker than conventional
bullets, SP-3 ammunition was considered to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.320
be acceptably powerful for single shot weapons
like the MSP special compact pistol which

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.950
was also developed under the supervision of
Khlynin.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.920
But the NRS wasn’t just a knife with a gun
in the handle, it also doubled as a screwdriver,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.020
a saw and even had a tool built into the scabbard
that could cut through wires up to 5mm thick.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.170
The scabbard was also insulated so that the
knife could be used to cut through live electric

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.140
cables, so long as the line wasn’t transmitting
more than 380 volts.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.630
A few years later when SP-3 ammunition was
phased out in favour of the more powerful

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.130
and reliable SP-4 ammunition, the NRS was
redesigned by G. A. Savishcnev, I. P Shedlos,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.329
and V. Ya. Ovchinnikov to make use of it.
Along with providing greater killing range,

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.930
the NRS-2 included a number of other notable
improvements such as an attachment for crimping

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.119
primer caps and a sharper tip more suited
for stabbing through thick cloth and thinly

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.820
armoured targets. This new and improved gun
knife officially went into service in 1986.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.770
So how exactly does the NRS-2 work you ask?
Well, to put it simply, housed just inside

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.520
of the knife’s handle is a small gap, in
which an incredibly rudimentary firing mechanism

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.310
can be found. This mechanism can store one
round at a time and needs to be removed once

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.690
the round has been spent. The handle of the
knife also features a safety switch to prevent

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.750
accidental discharge and a set of iron sights
to help with aiming.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.750
What could go wrong?
What could go wrong?

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.410
Speaking of which, since the gun part of the
NRS-2 is house inside of the handle, to aim

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.850
and fire the NRS-2 you need to point the knife
end towards your own face. While this is looks

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.970
unthinkably stupid, firing the NRS-2 in this
fashion isn’t considered overly dangerous

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.100
because it has “almost nonexistent recoil“.
On top of this, the NRS-2 has virtually no

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.320
muzzle flash and the shot itself is relatively
silent, making it an incredibly covert and

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.420
deadly weapon in the right hands.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.540
In terms of range, while exact details are
hard to come by since the NRS-2 is generally

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.940
only used by Russian Special Forces and this
information isn’t widely available, it is

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.010
said to be deadly from up to 25 metres away.
In the event the user misses with his one

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.790
shot, the NRS-2 is also specially weighted
so that it can be used as a throwing knife.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.110
While the NRS-2 has the potential to be an
incredibly deadly weapon in the right hands,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.590
it’s noted that it’s mostly treated as
a curio by most of today’s Spetsnaz troops

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.540
who prefer to use the version without a gun
hidden in the handle. This version, known

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.130
simply as the NR-2, instead of a gun has a
number of survival implements like matches,

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.040
a compass and other goodies an enterprising
soldier may need.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.950
Nevertheless, the NRS-2 continues to stand
as a testament to man’s ingenuity when it

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.440
comes to coming up with new ways for killing
one another.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.070
A common misconception about the NRS-2 is
that the weapon actually shoots out the blade

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.460
of the knife instead of a bullet. While ballistic
knives are indeed a thing that exist, they

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.530
are generally inferior to the NRS-2 due to
the fact they’re only accurate and, perhaps

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.080
more importantly, deadly, at a fraction of
the range. While it is rumoured that ballistic

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.120
knives were at one point developed for the
Spetsnaz, there’s little proof they ever

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.771
used them outside of Tom Clancy novels and
Call of Duty games. Not that they’d need

00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:19.150
them anyway considering an integral part of
Spetsnaz training is learning to use throwing

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.900
knives. The training is so in depth that even
the standard issue shovel issued to all Russian

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.669
soldiers for digging trenches can be used
as an impromptu throwing device in the hands

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.139
of a trained Spetsnaz soldier. Spetsnaz troops
are so well trained at throwing objects with

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.990
deadly, unerring accuracy that when putting
on a show, you can see them hurling shovels,

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.009
knives and even hatchets at targets while
performing such acrobatics as backflipping

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:59.039
through 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:12.819
the air, as depicted above.
