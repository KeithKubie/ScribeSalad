00:00:00.278 --> 00:00:01.359
- [Voiceover] What I
want to do in this video

00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:03.135
is think about all of
all the different ways

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:06.118
that we can represent data.

00:00:06.118 --> 00:00:08.394
So right over here, we have a list

00:00:08.394 --> 00:00:10.935
of, and I'm just using this as one form

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:13.503
of data, a list of students' scores on,

00:00:13.503 --> 00:00:16.545
say, the last test, so
Amy got 90 percent right,

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:18.061
Bill got 95 percent right,

00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:19.401
Cam got 100 percent right,

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:21.623
Efra also got 100 percent right,

00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:23.761
and Farah got 80 percent right.

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:25.541
This is one way to show data.

00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:28.206
Remember, data is just
recorded information,

00:00:28.206 --> 00:00:30.005
and it could be numeric like this,

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:32.026
it could be quantitative,
so you're recording

00:00:32.026 --> 00:00:34.545
actual numbers, or it could even be things

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:36.658
you could record data on
how do they like the test,

00:00:36.658 --> 00:00:38.701
and they could have scored it based on,

00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:40.199
I really liked it, I kind of liked it,

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.049
I didn't like it, or they might have

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:44.317
rated it on a scale of zero to five,

00:00:44.317 --> 00:00:45.821
which would have been numbers,

00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:48.089
but it's numbers that are
measuring peoples' opinions,

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.537
as opposed to, here, we have numbers

00:00:50.537 --> 00:00:52.742
that are measuring their actual scores.

00:00:52.742 --> 00:00:54.344
So there's all different types of data,

00:00:54.344 --> 00:00:56.085
and I don't want to get into all of that,

00:00:56.085 --> 00:00:57.119
but let's just start thinking about

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.591
different ways to represent this data.

00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:00.961
So this is one way, you could view this

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:05.228
as a table where you have the name,

00:01:05.228 --> 00:01:07.443
and then you have the score.

00:01:07.443 --> 00:01:09.451
So you have your name column,

00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:10.844
and then you have your score column.

00:01:10.844 --> 00:01:12.725
And I can construct it as a table,

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:15.949
so clearly, it looks like a table.

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:17.882
Like that, that's one way,

00:01:17.882 --> 00:01:21.331
one very common way

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:25.414
of representing data,

00:01:25.414 --> 00:01:27.388
just like that.

00:01:27.388 --> 00:01:29.814
That's actually how most
traditional databases

00:01:29.814 --> 00:01:32.368
record data, in tables like this.

00:01:32.368 --> 00:01:34.610
But you could also do it in other ways.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.702
So you could record it as a...

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.407
Often times called a bar graph,

00:01:40.407 --> 00:01:43.006
or sometimes, a histogram,

00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:48.006
so you could put score on
the vertical axis here,

00:01:48.384 --> 00:01:51.957
and then you could have
your names over here.

00:01:51.957 --> 00:01:53.224
And let's see the scores,

00:01:53.224 --> 00:01:56.938
let's see, maybe we'll make this a 50.

00:01:56.938 --> 00:01:59.180
Actually, let me just mark them off.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.358
So this is 10, 20, 30, that's too big.

00:02:03.358 --> 00:02:06.922
10, 20, 30, 40, 50,

00:02:06.922 --> 00:02:10.928
60, 70, 80, 90, so that's...

00:02:10.928 --> 00:02:13.474
And then 100, so that's 100.

00:02:13.474 --> 00:02:15.284
One, two, three, four, five,

00:02:15.284 --> 00:02:17.652
that would be 50 right over there,

00:02:17.652 --> 00:02:19.371
and then you can go person by person.

00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:24.270
So Amy got a 90 on the exam,

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.207
so the bar will go up to 90.

00:02:27.207 --> 00:02:31.294
So that is Amy, and then you have Bill,

00:02:31.294 --> 00:02:33.533
got a 95, so it's going

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:35.695
to be between 90 and 100, so it's going

00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:37.608
to be right over there.

00:02:37.608 --> 00:02:40.834
Bill got a 95,

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:43.457
and so it'll look like this.

00:02:43.457 --> 00:02:46.558
Bill, so that is Bill.

00:02:46.558 --> 00:02:49.840
And then you have Cam,
who got 100, on the exam.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.194
So, make sure, you see
I'm hand drawing it,

00:02:53.194 --> 00:02:56.144
so it's not as precise as if I were

00:02:56.144 --> 00:02:58.286
to do it on a computer.

00:02:58.286 --> 00:03:01.746
So this right over there,
that is Cam's score.

00:03:01.746 --> 00:03:03.859
Efra got the same score as Cam,

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.063
so her score is going to be,

00:03:06.063 --> 00:03:09.245
let me do that in Efra's color,

00:03:09.245 --> 00:03:11.497
and that's Efra's score right there.

00:03:11.497 --> 00:03:13.901
She also got 100.

00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:17.568
So, Efra...

00:03:18.384 --> 00:03:20.941
Efra, and then finally, Farah got an 80,

00:03:20.941 --> 00:03:25.941
so 60, 70, 80, so Farah got an 80.

00:03:26.107 --> 00:03:28.758
So this is Farah's score right over here.

00:03:28.758 --> 00:03:33.007
So this is another way
of representing the data,

00:03:33.007 --> 00:03:34.853
and here we see it in visual form,

00:03:34.853 --> 00:03:36.574
but it has the same information.

00:03:36.574 --> 00:03:38.616
You can look up someone's name,

00:03:38.616 --> 00:03:39.777
and then figure out their score.

00:03:39.777 --> 00:03:43.515
Amy scored a 90, Bill scored a 95,

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:46.313
Cam scored 100, Efra also scored 100,

00:03:46.313 --> 00:03:48.449
Farah scored an 80.

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:49.807
And there's even other ways you can

00:03:49.807 --> 00:03:52.175
have some of this information.

00:03:52.175 --> 00:03:54.055
In fact sometimes, you might
not even know their names,

00:03:54.055 --> 00:03:55.665
and so then it would be less information

00:03:55.665 --> 00:03:57.407
but (mumbles) a list of scores.

00:03:57.407 --> 00:03:59.056
The professor might say,
"Hey, here are the five scores

00:03:59.056 --> 00:04:01.750
"that people got on the exam."

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.750
And they were listed 90, 95,

00:04:07.075 --> 00:04:09.394
100...

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.861
100, and 80, now,

00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:18.024
if it was listed, this
was all the data you got,

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:19.846
this is less information than the data

00:04:19.846 --> 00:04:23.190
that's in this bar
graph, or this histogram,

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.838
or the data that's given in this table

00:04:25.838 --> 00:04:27.754
right over here, because here, not only

00:04:27.754 --> 00:04:30.877
do we know the scores, but
we know who got what score.

00:04:30.877 --> 00:04:34.012
Here, we only know the list of scores,

00:04:34.012 --> 00:04:34.894
but there's even other ways,

00:04:34.894 --> 00:04:37.994
and this is not an exhaustive video of all

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:40.548
of the different ways
you can represent data.

00:04:40.548 --> 00:04:42.301
You can also represent data by looking

00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:44.936
at the frequency of scores.

00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:48.592
So, the frequency of
scores right over here,

00:04:48.592 --> 00:04:49.998
so instead of writing the people,

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:51.518
you could write the scores.

00:04:51.518 --> 00:04:55.280
So let's see, you could say this is 80,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.993
85, 90, 95,

00:04:59.993 --> 00:05:02.918
and 100, and then you could record

00:05:02.918 --> 00:05:04.950
the frequency that
people got these scores.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.690
So how many times do we
have a score of an 80?

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.443
Well, Farah is the only
person with a score

00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:12.240
of 80, so you put one data point there.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.664
No one got an 85, one person got a 90,

00:05:15.664 --> 00:05:18.022
so you put a data point there.

00:05:18.022 --> 00:05:20.448
One person got a 95, so you can put

00:05:20.448 --> 00:05:22.365
that data point right over there.

00:05:22.365 --> 00:05:24.361
And then two people got 100.

00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:28.563
So this is one and two.

00:05:28.563 --> 00:05:30.747
Let's see the other 100 is in this color,

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:31.697
so I'll just do it in the color.

00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:34.204
You wouldn't necessarily have
to color code it like this.

00:05:34.204 --> 00:05:36.307
So this is another way to represent,

00:05:36.307 --> 00:05:39.325
and this axis, you could
just view it as the number.

00:05:39.325 --> 00:05:41.558
So this tells you how many 80s there were,

00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:43.683
how many 90s there are,

00:05:43.683 --> 00:05:45.727
how many 95s, and how many 100s.

00:05:45.727 --> 00:05:47.781
So this right over here,

00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:50.522
has the same data as this list of numbers.

00:05:50.522 --> 00:05:52.819
It's just another way of looking at it.

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:54.143
And once you have your data arranged

00:05:54.143 --> 00:05:56.070
in any of these ways,

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.984
we can start to ask interesting questions.

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:01.364
We can ask ourselves things like,

00:06:01.364 --> 00:06:04.104
well, what is the range of data?

00:06:04.104 --> 00:06:08.027
What is the range in the data?

00:06:08.027 --> 00:06:09.548
And the range is just the spread

00:06:09.548 --> 00:06:12.844
between the lowest point
and the highest point.

00:06:12.844 --> 00:06:14.099
So the range in this data,

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:15.561
is going to be the difference between

00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:17.465
the highest score, and the highest scores

00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:19.718
are 100, and the lowest score,

00:06:19.718 --> 00:06:21.842
an 80, so the range is
going to be the difference

00:06:21.842 --> 00:06:25.383
between the max, minus the min.

00:06:25.383 --> 00:06:27.867
The maximum score minus the minimum score.

00:06:27.867 --> 00:06:30.398
So it's going to be 100 minus 80

00:06:30.398 --> 00:06:33.184
is equal to 20, so that
gives you a sense of things,

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:35.261
it kind of gives you a sense of spread.

00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:36.760
You could also ask yourself, well,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.776
how many people scored below 100?

00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:42.982
And these are just interesting questions.

00:06:42.982 --> 00:06:45.861
Below 100, and you can actually answer

00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:47.405
that question, well, actually,

00:06:47.405 --> 00:06:48.718
you could have answered
either of these questions

00:06:48.718 --> 00:06:51.401
with any of these different
ways of looking at the data.

00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:53.455
If you say, how many
people scored below 100?

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.306
Well, one, two, three?

00:06:55.306 --> 00:06:56.745
How many people scored below 100?

00:06:56.745 --> 00:06:58.046
Well, 100 is up here, so it's giong

00:06:58.046 --> 00:07:00.341
to be one, two, three.

00:07:00.341 --> 00:07:02.464
How many people scored below 100?

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.513
One, two, three.

00:07:04.513 --> 00:07:06.590
How many people scored below 100?

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.714
One, two, three.

00:07:09.714 --> 00:07:11.188
And so, any way you look at it,

00:07:11.188 --> 00:07:13.696
you would have gotten three.

00:07:13.696 --> 00:07:15.065
And you could also ask yourself,

00:07:15.065 --> 00:07:17.515
what is the most frequent score?

00:07:17.515 --> 00:07:20.672
So, most frequent.

00:07:22.727 --> 00:07:24.527
And once again, you could
answer that question

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:27.569
with any of these ways of
representing this data.

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:28.928
You could look at our original table

00:07:28.928 --> 00:07:30.309
and you say, look, there's only one 90,

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:32.828
one 95, one 80, there's two 100s.

00:07:32.828 --> 00:07:35.916
So you'd say look, the
most frequent score is 100.

00:07:35.916 --> 00:07:37.053
You'd see that over here too,

00:07:37.053 --> 00:07:38.945
you actually have two
100s, there's only one

00:07:38.945 --> 00:07:40.710
of each of the other scores.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.067
Here you also see the 200s,

00:07:43.067 --> 00:07:44.529
and here is probably the clearest

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:46.445
if you're looking at frequency.

00:07:46.445 --> 00:07:49.919
Sometimes this might be
called a frequency plot.

00:07:53.704 --> 00:07:55.657
It's often called a frequency plot.

00:07:55.657 --> 00:07:57.499
And you see here, the most frequent one

00:07:57.499 --> 00:07:58.828
is the one that has the most dots on it

00:07:58.828 --> 00:08:00.929
which is 100.

00:08:00.929 --> 00:08:02.950
So anyway, that's just a very, high level

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.110
overview of how you can look at data

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.210
in different ways to represent data,

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.091
but the one thing I really
want you to get from this,

00:08:09.091 --> 00:08:10.913
is that these are all different ways

00:08:10.913 --> 00:08:12.968
of representing the same data.

00:08:12.968 --> 00:08:15.291
And we could probably invent other ways

00:08:15.291 --> 00:08:17.229
of doing it as well.
