00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.490
&gt;&gt; GUNDOTRA: Well, good afternoon, everybody.
Uh, welcome to another Google Campfire One.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.900
My name is Vic Gundotra. I'm a Vice-President
of Engineering at Google. And on behalf of

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.099
Google, I'd like to extend a very warm welcome
to everybody that's here this evening, as

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:29.050
well as the much, much larger audience that
happens to be watching us live stream this

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.340
event in HD for the very first time. So thank
you for spending your evening with us. We

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.320
have some very exciting announcements to make
this evening, some new products. I think you'll

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.910
be as excited as we are. Today's event and
announcements really center around Google

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.460
Apps. And, as I'm sure most of you know, Google
Apps is really a collection of our most popular

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.780
products. Things like Gmail and Calendar and
Docs, all customized for your business, for

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.050
your domain. Now, while you know that, you
might not realize the degree of adoption,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.880
the momentum, that Google Apps has. In the
past several years, we've grown to now having

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:16.190
over 2 million businesses that have gone Google.
And just this weekend, we crossed our 25 millionth

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.350
user on Google Apps. And we're incredibly
humbled and excited to see this level of adoption.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.920
That adoption has occurred with all kinds
of businesses, business who've chosen to move

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.580
their apps to the cloud. That includes businesses
like startups, small and medium-sized businesses,

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.630
universities and schools, and even Fortune
500 companies. You know, if you look back

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.550
and you think back to when we first started
with Gmail, almost half a decade ago, you

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.770
know, we were one of a handful of vendors
who believed that you should run business

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.909
applications in the cloud. Um, and it's amazing
what's happened in those years. Today, virtually

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.479
all kinds of applications that a business
might need, from payroll to CRM to document

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.140
management--you name it--that kind of software
is now available as cloud-based software.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.660
And so we're very excited to see the world
moving that way, and the momentum towards

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.060
cloud-based businesses. But there is a challenge.
You know, for a minute, imagine that you're

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.060
a business that has to integrate multiple
vendors who are all providing you cloud-based

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.400
services. You know, there are some challenges.
Do your employees have to log in to each of

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.590
these applications separately? Do your employees
have to learn different navigation across

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.849
every one of these apps? Is that data in each
one of these cloud-based applications in silos?

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.880
Can you share across these things? Well, the
reality is, today, those are some of the challenges

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.349
in the feedback we've been hearing from our
customers. And tonight is about responding

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.630
to that feedback. Fact, let me tell you what
we're announcing. We're making available,

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.349
launching tonight, the Google Apps Marketplace.
Now, what is the Google Apps Marketplace?

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.690
Well, put very simply, it's a great way to
discover, to find, and install applications

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.380
into your business. But not just any applications.
Applications that are deeply integrated with

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.590
Google Apps, that solve the problems I just
mentioned; that enable a single sign-off;

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.260
that enable different kinds of cloud-based
software to share data. Applications that

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.710
integrate with the navigation, integrate with
the user interface of the tools that your

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.849
employees already know and love and use every
day. So that's what it means for employees

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.959
and what it means for IT professionals that
have gone Google. What does it mean for developers?

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.459
Well, for developers, we think it's an equally
exciting message. It's a great way for you

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.879
to build, integrate, and sell your application
to the same customers that have adopted Google

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:07.300
Apps. And, uh, that is an installed base of
more than 25 million users. And we think that's

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.690
very, very exciting. Tonight, you're gonna
hear details about what's required technically

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.129
to integrate into the Apps Marketplace. Let
me give you the headlines. Let me give you

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:23.270
the high-level bullets that you're gonna hear
about. Number one, the steps to integrate

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.380
for a developer is just simply build an App.
Now, we're not mandating that you have to

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.779
build on a particular platform. You don't
have to use App Engine, although we'd be delighted

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:37.020
to see that. You may already have an existing
app built on your own infrastructure, your

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:44.449
own tools, your own hosting environment. You're
gonna see tonight that it's very easy to integrate

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:51.830
even that existing app into Google Apps. Now,
the integration points we're gonna talk about

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.180
are over a dozen integration access points,
from the most obvious that enable single sign-on

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.120
to sharing of data to integration with the
user interface, and many, many APIs that will

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.830
allow you to integrate into those Google Apps.
And then finally, you can sell your app in

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.710
the App Marketplace. Selling to reach those
two million businesses and many millions,

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:24.279
25 million plus users. Now, what does Google
ask in return? Well, it's actually quite simple.

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:31.240
First, it's a one-time fee of $100, and that
covers as many apps as you want to submit

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.151
into the Apps Marketplace. And then a low
20% rev share. Remember, with that rev share,

00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:41.919
you not only get to reach the 25 million customers,
but you also get to take advantage of over

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.080
1,000 resellers who are not only gonna be
able to resell Google Apps, but may in fact

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.589
be able to drive business directly to you.
So we're very excited about this. And equally

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:58.589
as excited is--exciting is to see the number
of partners who joined us tonight who are

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:04.119
launching with us this evening. We have over
50 partners who've integrated with Google

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:08.169
Apps and who are going to be part of the app
store as it launches this evening. On behalf

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.969
of Google, we really want to express our deepest
appreciation for these partners who've helped

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:17.311
make Google Apps even more valuable and even
more exciting. And for those of you who are

00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:22.879
here tonight and watching online, you're gonna
see some of the fantastic integration that

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:26.610
these partners have been able to do. With
that, let me turn it over to David Glazer,

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.809
who's a director of engineering for this effort,
and have him walk you through exactly how

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:36.129
you implement this. David.
&gt;&gt; GLAZER: Thank you, Vic. Ahem. So Vic told

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:40.129
you what we're announcing tonight, and Vic
told you why we're excited about it. And what

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:44.369
I want to do over the next ten or so minutes
is walk you through the "how." Walk you through,

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:49.409
as a developer, what do you do to take part
in the Google Apps Marketplace. And, as Vic

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:53.849
said, there's three steps. Build your app,
which is up to you. Many of you here in the

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:58.639
audience are developers. You already have
built apps. Some of you may have new ideas

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.080
triggered by the opportunities that you see
tonight, and you can come up with an idea

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.210
and build your own app. Your idea, your app,
built your way. Number two is integrate, and

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.159
I'm gonna spend most of my time talking to
you about what it takes to integrate, what

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:15.189
some of the integration opportunities are.
And then number three is sell, and we'll walk

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:19.339
you through a demo of what you actually do
to take the application you've built and integrate

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:27.300
it with Google Apps and list it into the Google
Apps Marketplace. Let's start with integration.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.229
Google Apps now has a large and growing number
of extension points that are available for

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:37.219
you as developers to use to integrate your
application with the family of Google Apps.

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:41.529
We'll talk about a few of these now. You'll
see demos of how many of them work. This list

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:48.330
is growing. We'll be adding more over time.
The way that you tell us what your application

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.179
does and what point of integration you want
to do is you create a manifest file. It's

00:07:52.179 --> 00:07:57.379
a simple XML file, and we're going to walk
through adding a few snippets of XML into

00:07:57.379 --> 00:08:03.429
this file, one for each point of integration
that our sample app is going to use. So let's

00:08:03.429 --> 00:08:07.659
talk about one of the points of integration
that our users, our customers, have asked

00:08:07.659 --> 00:08:13.080
for. They say, "I have a Google Apps control
panel. I use that control panel to manage

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:18.370
my applications--to administer them, to set
them up, to configure them. As I add new apps

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.969
into my family of cloud apps that I'm running
my business on, I'd like the new applications

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:28.009
to be managed and administered and configured
through the same interface. So we have provided

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:33.500
hooks in the Apps Marketplace to let you as
developers include your app in the Google

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.931
Apps control panel. And the way you do that
is very simple. You put an entry in the manifest

00:08:37.931 --> 00:08:42.680
that says, "Hey, here's the name of my app,
and here's some of the connection points that

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.630
I want to make available for management. I
might have a support page, I might have a

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.950
config page, I might have an admin page."
Whatever it is that you want to expose, you

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:54.530
tell us about it in the manifest and then
your app becomes manageable through the central

00:08:54.530 --> 00:09:00.200
management console. Well, another point of
integration that Vic mentioned is universal

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.050
navigation. If you've ever used Google Apps,
you notice up at the top left of the screen,

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.520
right above your mail or your calendar, there's
a nav bar. That means you're a click or two

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.210
away from getting at any of the other apps
in the Google Apps suite. So, as a user, I

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:19.800
can always find my way to whatever other application
I want to use using that consistent navigation.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.020
Well, if you have an application, you probably
want it to be a part of the same navigation

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:28.810
model, part of the same nav bar, so your users
are a click or two away from not only the

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:34.120
built-in Google apps, but also from your app.
How do you do that? You put an entry in the

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.710
manifest. A few lines of XML, you tell us,
"Here's the string that I want to have show

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.370
up in the menu, and here's the link that it
should go to when somebody clicks on that

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:48.620
link." Pretty simple. Now, what happens after
they click on the link? Well, the most important

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.740
thing is what doesn't happen. They don't have
to deal with a new set of credentials. They

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.610
don't have to remember another user name and
password. They don't have to enter it again.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.510
They don't have the speed bump of dealing
with yet another authentication step. How

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.000
do we do that? Well, we use the...
