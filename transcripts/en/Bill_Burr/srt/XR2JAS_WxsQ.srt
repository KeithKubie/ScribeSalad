1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,460
Again. Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,970
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,280
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,590
and ahhh

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,940
just checking in on you, just
checking. Can I stop doing that people?

6
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:20,690
I don't have any new way of doing it.
Can I just say I'm just checking on you.

7
00:00:20,691 --> 00:00:23,960
I'm going to do that for awhile and
every once in awhile I'll screen. Okay.

8
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:28,520
It'll make it special. Um,
anyways, as you're heard, the, uh,

9
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:30,770
the laughter in the background, uh,

10
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:35,720
we're welcoming the lovely Nia to the
Thursday afternoon podcast just before

11
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:39,830
Friday. Um, um, and you wanted
to clear your name so to speak,

12
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:44,720
for drugging the man you
allegedly love. I didn't drug you.

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,470
You took it voluntarily. No, I
didn't get, yes, you're taught,

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,670
you're taught while you're talking to me.

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,640
You ain't doing nothing because I
didn't like flipping into your fucking

16
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:56,150
cornflakes or whatever. Okay. I asked
you if you wanted and you were like,

17
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,070
all right, you fucking,
you're just a lay liar.

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,260
I'm not alive. What do you mean liar?

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,870
How many times did you ask me to take
it before I actually took the fuck?

20
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:09,800
I don't remember. See that's the
magical powers of the pocket. No,

21
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,910
you'll be a pulling of Ronald Reagan
right now. I'm really magically erases.

22
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,860
I don't remember. Probably a
couple times now. It's like,

23
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,550
I don't want to do that. It's going to
get me all fucked up. And you said no,

24
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:23,360
no, no. This is mellow. Yes, I did say
that. Oh, this is coming back to you now.

25
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,470
Yeah. Yeah. And then like
flat grounds. It was a mellow,

26
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,450
but you're kind of a lightweight when it
comes to the we. Yeah. So, well, yeah.

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,390
One day if you didn't drink at
all, I wouldn't be like, hey,

28
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:39,140
have a couple of fucking Yeager's.
That's nothing. Tastes like syrup.

29
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:42,320
I wouldn't do that to you. I'd let
you sip on a beer or something.

30
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,680
Here is disgusting. Get your like
a wine cooler. Not for nothing.

31
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:50,600
Wine cooler as our wine coolers, I
used to drink those James puck cookies.

32
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:52,040
Don't, don't really taste sector do they?

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,290
They definitely taste more like
weed than cookie. All right.

34
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,840
And Yeager definitely tastes more
like Jaeger than licorice. Well,

35
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:05,750
I would just like to w which
is a gross too. Why do people,

36
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,960
is that what Yeager is
out there? Bass note,

37
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,760
I forgot to talk in like perfume terms
like you're talking in musical sense.

38
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,610
No, I've gotta be honest with
you. I don't even know what,

39
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,860
I don't even know what
it is. It's disgusting.

40
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:22,760
It's like what is it
considered a vomit? I never,

41
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:27,160
I never I liquor isn't it
now I all, I know the core,

42
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,340
it's just,

43
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,340
it's one of those things that like when
I was first living in New York and we'd

44
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:37,010
go hang out at this awful bars on the
upper east side with a bunch of like

45
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,210
banker kids and young stockbrokers
and Frat boys, I were like,

46
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,230
let's have heavy Yeager. And then
inevitably they'd put on, you know,

47
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:49,670
living on a prayer and everyone would
say it was the most horrifying experience

48
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:53,810
and I hate those kinds of bars and I
hate that kind of vibe for that reason.

49
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,980
And I feel like if I got talked
into doing a Yeager shot with Shane,

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,580
I'm trying to go along and have fun.

51
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,760
It would just be the thing that
put me over and to, to vomitorium.

52
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,110
So Yeager is not disco. It's for
people who don't know how to drink.

53
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,130
Well this is what it really
is though. What is it?

54
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,160
The people in around the world probably
drink it differently than we do. Okay.

55
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,320
Yeager meister is a German digestif so
this is like, you have like a big meal.

56
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,830
You said that that makes
sense in France. Yeah.

57
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,860
Made with 56 herbs and spices at a
strength of 35% alcohol by volume,

58
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:33,250
whatever the flow, whatever,
35%. I mean that's a lot.

59
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,340
No wonder people mainline
it like fucking white China.

60
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,560
But a couple of drag
references in there for you.

61
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,930
What's white shines that heroin think
I think, I don't know. Why are you,

62
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,630
um, oh, there you go. It's a
digestive so it's not supposed to. Uh,

63
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,350
you're not supposed to be doing what
people are doing with it. 35% alcohol too.

64
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,070
That it makes a lot of sense. I would
just also like to say in terms of the,

65
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,360
the edible does that a lot. By
the adjusted it is a lot. Um,

66
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,920
the edible that you ingested, it was
cut into fours as is recommended.

67
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,810
It's not like you ate the entire cookie.

68
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:15,811
So I want people to understand that it
wasn't like you got the whole entire

69
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:19,210
thing. Oh yeah, yeah. But still,

70
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,080
I mean a lightweight like me need
you. I was like fucking tripping.

71
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:29,350
He would 70 proof. That's what
Jaeger is. That's also insanely high.

72
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,360
Oh, this is not 70 proof. I mean it's
up there. It's a shot. We'll look,

73
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:39,130
let me just, let me just, I'm
like Jack Daniels let, let's see.

74
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,660
I'd like to know these old Jack. Oh my
buddy. Your Buddy Jack Daniel. My buddy.

75
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:45,480
I visited him the other night. I only,

76
00:04:45,481 --> 00:04:49,870
I only talked to him once so I usually
have a long conversation that slowly

77
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:54,520
dissolves into tears. You
know what I mean? Jack,

78
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:59,040
do you like Jamison? Uh,
yeah I do. It's all right.

79
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,730
I don't once, once your fancy and
I want you to become a snob. Yeah.

80
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,330
Jamie's like,

81
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,860
I go when I'm in the mood yet when I
want to get fucking hammered James,

82
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,350
you know, if I want to have like,

83
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:11,020
you know something nice and
pretend I actually am cultured,

84
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,690
I'll go with more of a scotch
or something like that.

85
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,050
For the fact that stuff that you have
that's in that like suitcase looking

86
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,180
thing. That coffin. Yeah. What does that,

87
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:21,070
that blue stuff is that
Johnny Walker blue?

88
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,220
It's like a half gallon of Johnny Walker
blue. They don't even, a lot of it,

89
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:26,290
I don't even sell that bottle.
When I went in and bought it,

90
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,500
they had it in their liquor store for
10 years and [inaudible] was coming out

91
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:32,290
here. So I was like, I gotta get
this thing. I'm just laughing.

92
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,180
Like the label's different. The thing,

93
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:38,710
it's the sickest fucking [inaudible]
suitcase. It's like, it's so pretty.

94
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:40,600
Like it's leather and it's like, really?

95
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:43,750
What's that other one that's really fancy
when you really have dedicated to damn

96
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:44,620
damaging your liver?

97
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,130
What's another one you have that's really
fancy that you haven't even drank yet?

98
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:51,660
You've had it here for like three
years. Pappy van Winkle. Right.

99
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,270
Did you break that up and when Paul
Versey was here? No, we did what I put,

100
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,880
I drank, I drank pappies with him in a,

101
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,590
what the hell are we?
Nashville. So it's here,

102
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:02,030
but you just haven't drank a yeah,

103
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:05,420
I'm just waiting for that right time
when all everybody's over, you know,

104
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:10,010
to break it open. And uh, when
would that be? I don't know.

105
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,830
In other words, you want a shot?
I'll, I'll open and try like,

106
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,840
I want to try that shot.
When we went to the,

107
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,610
what was at the Polo
Lounge and we had that,

108
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,450
that fancy shit that you were dying to
get, which stunk. Yeah. You were like,

109
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,530
Eh. What was that Lou? Louis the
14th 13th or something like that.

110
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:27,950
Nine zillion dollars in. It's
stunk. I've had better, I bet.

111
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:30,800
Better cognacs and that one
comes out. That one's a,

112
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:32,440
that one's like totally like a,

113
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,650
that's like the boy band
of cognacs. It's which one?

114
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,880
Cause everybody who doesn't know
anything about it like me fucking sees.

115
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,110
No though the Konya, there's a lot of
snobs that say pappies is for the prices.

116
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:48,560
Fucking overrated. But uh,
it's still delicious though.

117
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,410
The way to get all of those
is just to buy the shine.

118
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,230
If you go out and buy the bottle,
you're an asshole, which I am.

119
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,180
You know what I mean? They're
completely overpriced.

120
00:06:56,181 --> 00:07:00,590
But it's fun when you have people come
over and you break out the bottle,

121
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:03,230
it sits a nice thing to do as a
host. But if you just going to,

122
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,950
you shouldn't have a buy a bottle of
that just for yourself and then just sit

123
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:08,890
there. That's what I mean.
I guess you're saving money.

124
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,890
Sat there for like a few years now.
You gotta you gotta break it out.

125
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,920
You know the old me, when I, when this,

126
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,840
how ignorant I was with and I'm still
don't know much about this shit.

127
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,620
All right, so save you fucking
Cunty tweets. Can you just in a,

128
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:26,600
in a nice polite way, be like, actually
it's not 30% alcohol. How that fuck,

129
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,990
cause I know it's not 30% alcohol, it's
like 30% of something, Blah Blah Blah.

130
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,030
Some egg heads. We were Doris, you
know like just as a human being,

131
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:39,740
you're supposed to know everything, right?
You know you're into math and booze.

132
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:42,740
So you know the answer to that. You
know, I know the answer to other things.

133
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,770
I lovely bartender or mixologist perhaps
listening who actually really knows and

134
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:48,770
it's not going to just like,

135
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:53,560
I don't want to talk to a mixologist
cause I don't like that word. That was,

136
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,490
that's right up there with footie.
Right. I'm 40 which I've even said.

137
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:00,570
And then after a while it's
like, you know, I don't like E.

138
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,880
I don't like that at the end. Food
Lilly. I'm a foodie. I'm a mixologist.

139
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:07,420
So what about can
bartender, what about this

140
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,960
deal hard? It has to
be a bartender though.

141
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:14,460
Can you imagine switching
places with a bartender?

142
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:17,300
I went on a really busy
night. It's like, it looks,

143
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,050
I work on restaurant industry.
Yes. Were you a bartender? No.

144
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:22,790
But at one point I worked the,

145
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,820
I worked at grill with one of those tall
chef I was last and I was the busboy

146
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,280
and I washed dishes all at the same time.

147
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,980
It was like a fucking
Carol Burnett sketch.

148
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,690
The restaurant was going out of business
and initially I was just the bus boy

149
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,470
and a dishwasher. And then they had
this guy working the grill and a,

150
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:45,740
I remember he quit or got fired. He
used to just get hammered and dry.

151
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:48,620
He had a van and used to
just take restaurant panel,

152
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:50,600
the restaurant business
fucking nuts. Right.

153
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:55,380
And this guy used to drive this van and
he came in one day and just had this

154
00:08:55,381 --> 00:09:00,381
fucking like somebody just took a belt
and diagonally smacked him across his

155
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:00,871
forehead.

156
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:04,500
And what happened was he was driving
home to his parent's house and he pulled

157
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:08,730
any was so shit faced t they hit one of
their cars or the tree and when his head

158
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:10,650
went to slam against the windshield,

159
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,090
the visor was down a little
bit and he like bent it.

160
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,410
And that was one of those old school like
metal ones. He bent it with his head,

161
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:21,480
um, which was probably traveling a good
25 miles an hour when he hit it. And,

162
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,490
um, so anyway, he got
fired. So then they had me,

163
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,230
uh, flip the burgers. Yeah. Ashley
Brochette and that type of shit. No,

164
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:35,490
I think I became a dishwasher and the
bus boy yet it was just like a bacon

165
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:39,210
wrapped shrimp that was
seasoned. And uh, so I would,

166
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,470
I would fucking set up the tables
and the lunch rush would come in,

167
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:45,780
which wasn't much of a rush.
We were going out of business,

168
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,560
but I would be sitting there
cooking shit trying to look suave.

169
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:51,330
Like this was his fancy fucking place,

170
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:54,960
which it wasn't cause I was on the
grill and I was sort of eyeballing the

171
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,050
lunchroom, waiting for people to finish.
And as I saw people finishing up,

172
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:01,860
I would sort of casually duct down where
they couldn't see me like below the

173
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:05,190
grill. Like I was, uh, you know,
getting more food or something.

174
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,120
And I would pop up in, my apron
would be off. I had the bow tie,

175
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:11,100
the whole busboy thing
on underneath the apron.

176
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:14,730
And I take the hat off and I would
run out there plus the table,

177
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,430
bring the dishes back, rinse them,
set them up and then I would run back,

178
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,000
flip the fucking burger and then go back
out and set the table in case somebody

179
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:26,310
else came out. Oh my God. And
then I would go back. Yeah.

180
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:31,230
I ended up burning a guy's
hand. Cause from this stress,

181
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,500
I remember I made a burger.

182
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,660
I've told this story before I made this
fucking Burger. Knows this kid Jason,

183
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:40,410
this Metallica Fan. Jesus Christ. Clear.

184
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,550
Holy Shit. Woo. She been out today. Yeah,

185
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,230
I let her out. This letting her out.
She doesn't shit. She just peas.

186
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,880
She should go for a stroll. I think she's
farting cause she's dead ass asleep.

187
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,540
Yeah, but she doesn't care
if she shits in the house.

188
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:01,980
She doesn't have to clean it up.
Look at her though. She's passed out.

189
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,850
Woo Cleo. I put a bed right by the,

190
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:09,750
by the window where the sun comes in
and that's the, I have to go soon.

191
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:12,150
So can we talk about this Jamison thing,

192
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,580
how much or whatever Jack Daniels you are.

193
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,970
And I promise everyone I'll finish the
story about burning the guy's hand. Oh,

194
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,440
right. Sorry. Um, what was it you were
looking up? How much proof is, uh,

195
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:27,540
okay. Uh, oh Jesus Christ.

196
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,300
Come on man. I just asked the
question. Oh, Jack Daniels.

197
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:32,130
I just won't inject Daniels.
I should write proof.

198
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,310
That helps you go to the Wikipedia page.

199
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,070
Can we also talk about how your social
media game needs to step it up a little

200
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:45,720
bit? It's 80 proof. That
seems like a lot too. Well,

201
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,520
Jameson is only 70 proof.

202
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,450
Like what it is about Jamison is
it is you're drinking something.

203
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,710
You supposed to sip something
that you're drinking,

204
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,980
that you're fucking slamming and
then they do a bunch of them.

205
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,010
And it's really the, I mean,
I would think that the, the,

206
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,950
the sugar is just off the
fucking charts for them.

207
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,620
Remember the first time I ever
had Jamieson was when we were in,

208
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,950
when you did a show in Dublin, our
first time in Ireland. And you know,

209
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:12,380
I fucking love Ireland and I
love the people there that go.

210
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,560
And then you'd be shit. Oh
my God. It was, it was the,

211
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,500
that was the first time because
you know, I don't drink beer.

212
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,820
That was when that guy gave you shit,
right? Yeah. When we were leaving,

213
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,960
we stand on a street corner.
This Irish guy is on a bicycle,

214
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,390
riders every European seems
to be, and he came up,

215
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:29,710
got a little turned around trying to
find our hotel. And I went, I'm so am I,

216
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,640
so let me just ask this guy. And
I said, um, excuse me, Sarah,

217
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:35,140
do you know where at such and such is?

218
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,550
He just pauses and he looks
at me and he goes, I do.

219
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,250
And he's still staring at me and
I look at you and I'm like, um,

220
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,930
are you gonna tell me? I'm like,
yeah, I remember you laughed.

221
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,880
And he laughed, won me over and you were
like, well, you're going to tell me.

222
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,840
And he's like, I'm like a moist.

223
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,300
And then he told me and it was all going
to gave me like a big smile and I was

224
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:04,180
like, are you fucking Irish? But
you know you Irish men, you like,

225
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:07,180
you like black women. So I feel
like maybe that was part of it too.

226
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,100
I think we like women in general.

227
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,280
I feel like everybody likes
black women though. Like the,

228
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:17,260
like everybody likes me. Let's
just go off on a nice ego trip.

229
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,540
But [inaudible] your
social immediate like,

230
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:23,860
so I seeing me do Snapshat are
you not into doing snapchat?

231
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,090
Not at all. Why or Instagram?
You have an Instagram.

232
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:30,970
I'm not into Twitter. I'm not
into like going on Facebook.

233
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:33,870
I don't like any social. You go there.

234
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,320
Can we talk about you just go there
because you I have to do it or else you,

235
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,550
your career just dies. And
that's where everybody's at.

236
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,230
So you've gotta be there. Everybody's
at snapchat now. All are there. Yeah,

237
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:46,330
they are. Oh you horse. We'll be back.

238
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,430
You guys see your social media whores.
You just run it around the block.

239
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,040
It's true. It's like, it's fun. Those
fucking club kids. They go to this spot,

240
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,060
the spots, the spot.

241
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,450
Then everybody's there and then they
run across the street to the new spot.

242
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:06,400
And it's the same fucking people.
Just a different background. Um, okay.

243
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,120
Isn't that what it is? I haven't
got that new clubs. Speaker.

244
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,330
Oh grandpa. I never had. What
else? Don't you understand?

245
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,690
But how come you're not doing Instagram?
You take pictures all the time.

246
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,610
Why don't you ever cause they're nuts
for people there for me. Oh, I see.

247
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,760
Although there's a couple of killer ones
from how great were the pictures from

248
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:29,950
Dean Del Rey's 50th
birthday party. Amazing.

249
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,810
You fucking MSD. I missed
it. I missed it. That's true.

250
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,380
I'm sorry, Dean. Happy Birthday.
Dean del Ray. He's an entrepreneur,

251
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:40,750
was one of s, I don't
know how you taught this.

252
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:44,740
This fucking guy turns 50 years old.
He packs out the El Rey theater.

253
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:48,970
His name is Dean del Ray. So it
was Delray at the El Ray. Right.

254
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,040
So he goes out there. It

255
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,040
was Joe Barton x hosting wearing an ACDC
fucking one at like a Hawaiian shirt.

256
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:03,590
But it's an ACDC shirt. Right.
He brings up red bed, red bed,

257
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:04,610
fucking kills it.

258
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,270
Then it was Dee del Ray who
fucking murdered one of the
best sets I've ever seen

259
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:11,030
a map. Then Krista, Leah, then Joe Rogan.

260
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,210
And then I had to follow all
those fucking monsters. Right.

261
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,020
And then after that he had a live band
came out and he sang the entire highway

262
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:24,950
to hell album. He's such
a great fucking, yeah,

263
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,580
when I tell you he fucking crushed
it. Yeah. Like first of all,

264
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,610
the song that they opened with was
a live wire now for ACDC maniacs.

265
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,090
I didn't even know this. They all
went bond. Scott was still alive.

266
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,750
Their original singer, they always opened
with livewire on all their live shows.

267
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:44,060
And when he died in tribute to him,

268
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:47,300
they retired the song and they didn't
even play it in concert for like fucking

269
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:49,850
30 years until recently. They
started playing it again.

270
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:55,310
So because he was playing,
um, the highway to hell album,

271
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:56,810
which was the last bond Scott album.

272
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,590
He also has the sickest fucking tattoo
on his side of bond Scott's face,

273
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:03,890
which I know sounds cheesy, but if
you see it, it's fucking costumer.

274
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,930
If it's good, it's on
funding. Believable. Okay.

275
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,140
Cause otherwise it's unbelievable.

276
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,000
I haven't people's like famous people's
spaces on you unless that is a fun, no,

277
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,190
it's unreal. Amazing Tattoo. I remember
when Jim Florentine was down the store,

278
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:17,090
I had to show him like, dude,

279
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:20,120
you got to see this cause Florentines
obviously you know that metal show.

280
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,520
I was like, you gotta see this?
And he goes again, he's got a bond.

281
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,910
Scott Tattoo. And I saw it in his
face like out and then he saw it.

282
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:26,744
He was just like,

283
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,290
next thing you know they're off in a
corner talking about eighties metal.

284
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,440
Did they play this song when we went
to CAC ACDC all those years ago?

285
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,310
I don't remember if they played. Yeah.
So anyways, so here's the funny thing.

286
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,820
I go on last and what's his face
dean? So when you finish your set,

287
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,300
just go like, ah, you guys ready
for some rock, whatever. Right?

288
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,590
You ready for some rocks?

289
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,210
You got? Oh, you rating.
And then I fought.

290
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,110
So right then the [inaudible]

291
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:56,150
Bam was supposed to kick in and Rudy
Sarto from fucking a quiet ride.

292
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,100
Ozzy Osborne was this
company. I do do, do, do, do,

293
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,740
do they begin the fucking
song? I didn't realize that.

294
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:03,420
They didn't know that that's
what was gonna happen.

295
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,190
So nobody was on the stage and I
didn't know, turn around. It looks like

296
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,830
you said rock and roll. I was like, you
guys ready? Put some rock and roll. No,

297
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,620
I, yeah, I turned around. There
was nobody there and I was like,

298
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,910
it's going up for a few minutes.

299
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,770
Longest walk ever. And
I get off. So anyways,

300
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:28,950
they start off with fucking livewire
and Delray kind of sounds like Bon Scott

301
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:30,610
and he's fine. He's fucking murders.

302
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:34,030
And then they played the
whole highway to hell album.

303
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,820
[inaudible] um, then they
ended, uh, they brought out,

304
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,790
um, uh,

305
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,280
hang on a second. Sorry. I
almost knocked my computer off.

306
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,140
Then they bring up Dave Lombardo

307
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,590
from a,

308
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:55,200
I'm fucking going blank here. I'm
trying to name his new fucking band.

309
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,700
Dead Cross. Okay. Slayer.
Obviously he goes out,

310
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,210
he plays a let there be rock and then
they played, um, they played Motorhead,

311
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:07,140
ace of spades and fucking
Dean like channeled Lemmy.

312
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,920
It was fucking unbelievable. Can I
tell you like when you missed it,

313
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:14,120
I sat in on two songs. I played
get it hot and if you will,

314
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,080
what is so enjoyable about being with
you amongst other things but like with

315
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:23,370
being with the money, that's really
great tip when you leave. But um,

316
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,450
no it's like being with someone
who is so different from you.

317
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:29,970
Like obviously we're
an interracial couple,

318
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,030
there's a bit of an age
difference between, oh Jesus,

319
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:35,070
she just kicked me with
rights and left here. I know,

320
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:38,670
but the thing is like I learned so much
stuff about things I wouldn't normally

321
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:41,490
know. Like, I like rock music
and stuff, but like you know,

322
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:46,491
your dedication to it and like your
childhood or your like being a teenager,

323
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:52,050
the stuff that really moves you is like
nothing I ever would have considered

324
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:54,660
before. And people always
make fun of like hair,

325
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:57,660
metal and all those bands that
you like legitimately loves.

326
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:01,830
And when you talk about the musicianship
and the like the trace of guns was

327
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:04,020
there from, from La guns. Yeah,

328
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:08,080
like all that kind of stuff that I've
seen documentaries about like oh the

329
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:13,050
English noser the composer F is for family
music and from person and from velvet

330
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,860
revolver. Yes. All that kind of
stuff. Like since I've been with you,

331
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:21,270
I've seen Michael, Michael, Devin
from Whitesnake, I've seen ACDC,

332
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:26,070
we saw a velvet revolver, we
saw food fighters, we've seen,

333
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,410
um, I'm sure there's some further
volts them crooked vultures. Um,

334
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,910
what's, oh what the band that Josh is
in Queen of the Stone Age. Oh yeah.

335
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:36,630
Jesus Christ.

336
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,630
Like all these rock shows that I never
would have seen if I was not with you.

337
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:44,820
And I think that's really fucking cool
cause I already like all different kinds

338
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:48,390
of words now. I really, I saw
Erica Badu with the roots. Yup.

339
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:53,400
We saw Bruno and for hours I
wouldn't see that. Yeah, I wouldn't,

340
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,100
I wouldn't even go on scene.
Uh, speaking of white music,

341
00:19:56,101 --> 00:20:00,990
I want to go see a drink your
big black cow and get outta here.

342
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,110
Oh, steely Dan. Yeah, that's
right. I wouldn't have seen them.

343
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:06,470
And that was one of the
sickest fucking live shows.

344
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,190
It was so amazing at the Hollywood bowl.
And that's my dad. My Dad was into his,

345
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:15,510
into steely Dan. So uh, yeah,
no, we've gone to see some,

346
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,000
we got to see some live
music coming up this year.

347
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,600
That's one of the things we
like to do. I've seen so many.

348
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:22,350
I actually like seen
like the smaller ones.

349
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:26,150
I saw arrivals son and that was somebody
that Dean del Ray told me about.

350
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,970
I love them. They're great.
Really fucking great.

351
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:31,560
I saw him in his little ass club.

352
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,870
They gotta be in a bigger
place now cause I've heard,

353
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:36,240
I heard them on the radio recently. Um,

354
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,460
they'll plug in some big
show that they were doing,

355
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,420
but like the lead singers
just got to fucking force.

356
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,350
It's ridiculous in their drummers
and saying, who is the guy when we,

357
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,530
when you did that Rhonda as kiss
charity that Mark McGrath hosted.

358
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,570
Great guy by the way.

359
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,710
So the first time I ever had a
pickle back was with Mark McGrath,

360
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,820
a little shot of Jamison and a pickle
back. Disgusting. I'll never do it again.

361
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,870
But he swears by it, but okay. So it
was, he was there for two to somebody,

362
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:05,800
random person in the crowd. He
goes, he goes, what'd you say sir?

363
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,140
Sing it number one song that you wrote
in 1997. Absolutely. Then he signed that.

364
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:14,720
I just want to fly. I thought everybody
in there was singing like the,

365
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,750
all the lyrics to it. Um, but he
a very funny self deprecating go.

366
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,280
Yeah. Navarro was there.

367
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,200
Juliette Lewis Casha but there were other
bad deaf mckagan was there obviously,

368
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,840
um, guns and roses. And
then who else was there?

369
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:32,140
There was some other Gilby
cluck, I don't know who that is.

370
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,660
He was one of the guitars
to guns and roses.

371
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,850
Second generation of
guns commissioner was,

372
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:41,560
they had Billy idol showed up at
the ends. Even Billy idol. Steven,

373
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,040
Steve Stevens. Um, no, that
was Trump's by the way. Who?

374
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,440
You don't know him but you know him
cause he's played on for everything from

375
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:53,680
like devote in nine inch
nails. Oh really? Okay. Yeah,

376
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,050
probably with Menudo at
some point. You know,

377
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:58,690
we did some sort of fucking studio
thing with them. Like fuck it.

378
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,330
I'll make it sound good. He's like
one of those guys you could just,

379
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:05,410
no matter what it is. Yeah, he's
played with fucking everybody.

380
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,540
All right. I got to get going. Are
you getting at it going, oh Nia,

381
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,260
y'all gone to jail? Yeah,

382
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:14,860
I'm going to the gym now and right now
and then yoga tonight, but I won't,

383
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,580
I'm dedicated. I'm saying it on the
podcast now. I said on my snapchat,

384
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:22,630
I'm going to say it on my, on the Napa
chat on the podcast. I love snapchat.

385
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,010
I'm going to do yoga every day. This
month, 29 days. I'm kind of cheating,

386
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,080
but while you're kind of cheating,

387
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,950
well it's a full like 30 31 days.

388
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:36,940
So I feel like I'm kind of
cheating. But you know, it's a,

389
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:38,560
it's black history month. So

390
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,431
I mean,

391
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:47,431
I'm just saying years ago I wouldn't have
been allowed to go into a yoga studio.

392
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,520
You weren't alone. I wasn't allowed
so I gotta do and go back far enough.

393
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:54,280
You weren't allowed to even
read the word Yoga. Exactly.

394
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:58,960
So now I have to say this is by far and
away the widest Shit I've ever done is

395
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:03,760
to do yoga every day and talk about rock
music. Yeah. Yeah. Today is topping it.

396
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:09,520
But that's okay. I love it. I love
you. I feel so clear ethnic today,

397
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,950
like a loader, a Burrito or
something to try to balance it off.

398
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,390
I don't know if that's something that
you want to say that you're doing that,

399
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,320
but food, I guess it is, I guess is,

400
00:23:20,321 --> 00:23:23,650
there's so much though. How is
that not ethnic food? I guess.

401
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,220
You know what makes something ethnic food
isn't why I'm saying can you stop with

402
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:30,490
that? You just said something fucked
up. Tone Jesus Christ, and I tell him,

403
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:32,800
you fucking say anything. I just
said I'm going to get the Burrito.

404
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,900
Was it God damn joke?

405
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:37,840
Will I look because say that in during
election year told me that there is so

406
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:40,810
much Mexican food that they
don't really eat in Mexico,

407
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,650
that they are just sort of
developed for us. Gringos.

408
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:47,960
Although I don't think I'm a Gringo.
You're definitely doing, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

409
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:51,170
The same way that if we
fucking, if we moved down there,

410
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:54,680
we'd fucking weed lighten up the steak
or something. It's just the way it goes.

411
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,070
All right, burrito. We, we,
we'd have to adjust our shit.

412
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,240
We'd have to throw more spice into the
cornflakes so they wouldn't buy our sh

413
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,360
bland shit down there.

414
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,490
Our European underseas in food land. Fuck.

415
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,140
Most boring ass cereal
is cornflakes. Yeah,

416
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:15,810
but you know what this saw in
corn flag, the solid, the points,

417
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,190
the solid and you're like, okay. And
like 30 minutes later you're hungry.

418
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:23,510
All right. I've got a question for you.
Name is cereal with a point. Oatmeal.

419
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,170
It's not a cereal. It is the
hot cereal. No, it isn't. Yeah,

420
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:29,690
it's considered a cereal. Look it up.

421
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,500
What do you want to bet? I
don't know. It's a porridge

422
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:42,330
is I like that there's enough people
out there in the war. Ended many wheats.

423
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,080
Is oatmeal healthy? Let me see if
I'm anybody else? Who's dumb enough?

424
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,280
Is oatmeal a theory? A
carb, a grain, a starch,

425
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:54,600
a whole grain complex. Car.
Alkaline. A good source of fiber.

426
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,920
Acidic. It's harbor a
cereal. Way down the bottom.

427
00:24:58,921 --> 00:25:02,400
So someone did have this
question. See it pops up.

428
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,340
Do you consider oatmeal
is cereal is oatmeal?

429
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:11,740
See in cereal is same
thing. Wikipedia. Breakfast,

430
00:25:11,741 --> 00:25:14,470
cereal, health benefits. Breakfast cereal,

431
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,850
I guess it is is oatmeal
cereal. What is oatmeal?

432
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,300
All right. There's a lot of people
with a lot of questions here.

433
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:26,170
I don't have time to go through
all of this. If the growths,

434
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,630
we're going to get tweets. We're
going to pizzas, cereal and alcohol.

435
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,790
That's how, that's how very old meal can
be eaten. Raw with milk like a cereal.

436
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,920
Okay. Or heated and
eaten as porridge. Okay.

437
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,490
Okay. I never said it couldn't
be considered porridge.

438
00:25:45,491 --> 00:25:48,800
I would just say what you never did
say it couldn't be okay. All right.

439
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,730
Well can I get extra points
for knowing the word porridge?

440
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,630
Is that a word that people
have never heard of?

441
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,000
Is that something that's
new day you think?

442
00:25:58,001 --> 00:26:01,420
Or you've known me for 12
years and you think Shanie yes.

443
00:26:01,421 --> 00:26:05,570
When was the last time you ever
heard me use the word porridge?

444
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,200
I don't think I've ever heard
it. Oh my God. 12 years.

445
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,400
Our anniversary is coming up. Our
12 years. He is stay focused now.

446
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:17,930
I'm like you now I'm add. I still remember
the bird in the hand story. Oh good.

447
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,120
Go back to it. Cause I'm leaving a, no,

448
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:23,590
I've never heard you use the word
porridge. But um, you know what?

449
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:28,100
You're going to yoga and arts. Well,
our 12 year anniversary is this month.

450
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:31,610
How exciting is that? You
don't look very excited. No,

451
00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:34,280
cause I just realized you're going
to yoga for Hollywood purposes.

452
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,840
What do you mean for Hollywood PR?
I'm going, you're not me. Purpose.

453
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,100
It's like when I went to go,

454
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,260
then I went to a fucking boxing gym and
they started calling me billary swank

455
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,800
cause they, I was never,

456
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,390
I was never getting in the ring. You were
going to that boxing gym a lot though?

457
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,860
I was going to Gleason's gym. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. What happened to that?

458
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,550
Well we moved out here so the commute
got a little difficult. But my trainer,

459
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,430
my trainer does boxing. He Trans
guys all the time. Yes. Young guys,

460
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:06,900
young fellows who still got that
in. Oh come on. You can still do it.

461
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:10,920
You still do pull ups out here and I'll
skip rope and I'm not going down to some

462
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:15,090
stinky ass fucking gym but eh, pretending
like I'm going to get in the ring.

463
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,100
I'm not dumb enough. It is.

464
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:21,000
It is and I'm slow as shit so I know I'm
going to get knocked on my ass for yoga

465
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:24,390
purposes for Hollywood cause
I'm not trying to be like
a yoga instructor or some

466
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:26,520
kind of, what are you saying?

467
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,390
I think you go in there to somebody in
there like has his screenwriting class

468
00:27:30,391 --> 00:27:35,010
and you want to get like a discount.
Jesus. No Gigi. No, not at all.

469
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,890
All right, well I'm
going to go. All right.

470
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,690
Did they give you like a yoga name when
you go there? No, they do not. Okay.

471
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,870
They call me by my actual name and then
they remember my name and they're like,

472
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:49,540
thanks Nia for coming in. Good job
today. Do they call Uri Niacin Nini?

473
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,310
No mistake. Yo. Oh, I
like it though. Do you?

474
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,460
I though you're going to laugh
like those stupid stay. Alright.

475
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,910
I thought I was cute. Now I'm gonna
stay here now. I'm a stay here.

476
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,640
Stay in bed. You go to yoga,
Nama. Stay here. Oh Jesus.

477

By later. See you later.

478
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:11,550
I'm going to take fucking
stinky butt outside in a minute.

479
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,100
Then I'm throwing her right in the
fucking tub. You hear me? Anyways,

480
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,090
let me read some advertising and then
the Burnham's story and then we're going

481
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:24,900
to call it a fucking day here.
Oh, fucking day. Oh, all right.

482
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:30,160
Um, where the fuck am I? Oh,

483
00:28:30,161 --> 00:28:34,810
headspace. Man. New
advertiser, headspace. Man,

484
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,640
don't harsh the mellow.

485
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,940
Please talk about your
experience with the product.

486
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,200
I don't even know what it is.

487
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:45,730
Use the following introduction to
accompany your anecdote. Hey everybody.

488
00:28:45,731 --> 00:28:48,730
I don't know what the fuck
this is. Let's be honest.

489
00:28:48,731 --> 00:28:53,290
Most of your problems start with
your mind, man. Fear, anger,

490
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,920
stress, anxiety,
depression, sleeplessness.

491
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,710
Is this going to be one of these
products that like if you have suicidal

492
00:28:59,711 --> 00:29:04,300
thoughts, consult your doctor. What am I
pedal in here? They begin in your head,

493
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,220
but they can wreck your life.

494
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,340
Please include all of the following
points during your read. Well,

495
00:29:09,341 --> 00:29:12,070
if you send it to me, I'm
going to read it. All right?

496
00:29:12,071 --> 00:29:13,330
But it doesn't have to be that way.

497
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,720
You can make a major difference
in just 10 minutes a day.

498
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:21,870
The change comes through through guided
meditation with the new headspace app.

499
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,000
Oh, I like this. Okay.
This is some hippy shit.

500
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:29,980
My apologies to everybody
at headspace, man. Um,

501
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,600
headspace is a mess. Is meditation
made simple? You know something?

502
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:36,610
I gotta be honest with you. I
would actually download this.

503
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,890
I used to meditate to the second
side of Jane's addictions, a ritual,

504
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,840
however the fuck you say, the rest of it
I had. Space is meditation made simple.

505
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,310
It's guided meditation that you listen
to whenever you want, wherever you want,

506
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,710
right on your phone, computer or tablet.

507
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:57,760
Meditation is rooted in thousands of
years of tradition with thousands of

508
00:29:57,761 --> 00:30:00,970
scientific studies that
show its positive effects,

509
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,840
like improving focus and relationship
harmony, whatever that means,

510
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,380
and decreasing anxiety and stress. Jesus,

511
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,140
is there anybody in the world that
needs to meditate more than me?

572
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:43,920

573
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,180
whenever I want those groups sound
the same to me. That's how white I am.

574
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,800
I know she need to just
go say, ah. All right.

575
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,460
Well you tell me when you can tell the
difference between fucking white snake

576
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:58,040
and white lion and great white.

577
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,430
Can you yeah, I can't.

578
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,320
Great White and gray and a lion head.

579
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:07,610
Whatever the fuck I just said.

580
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:12,200
White Lion White Lion had the guy
who sounded like Eddie van Halen,

581
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,590
a great white.

582
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:20,150
Had the guy with the raspy voice and
Whitesnake is fucking Whitesnake. Okay.

583
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,640
If you don't know them
and it's still today,

584
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:22,923
Daddy, he happy.

585
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:28,210
Um, she's laughing at me. All right.

586
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,400
Oh, look at who's here about,
oh boop, boop me undies.

587
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,610
Me undies. Take 'em off in a stall.

588
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:42,060
Boudou do to me on these me
undies dry him on a fucking towel.

589
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,300
I'm trying to make a run with that.

590
00:34:43,301 --> 00:34:45,850
I don't know why you taking
them off in a truck stop.

591
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,860
Maybe you want to get banged in the ass.

592
00:34:47,861 --> 00:34:52,861
The truck all appreciate how dry your
undercarriages as you're reading all the

593
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:57,700
fucking graffiti. That's gross. All
right. Mandy's everybody this year,

594
00:34:57,701 --> 00:35:01,780
don't be predictable and show
up at your Valentine's date,

595
00:35:01,781 --> 00:35:06,580
date dinner with some last minute box
of chocolates or a bouquet of roses.

596
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,890
Oh, shots fired.

597
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,320
Shots fired by me undies. Oh,

598
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,720
I'll tell you right now. I am.

599
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,100
I'm waiting for the [inaudible]
for speaking of rap music.

600
00:35:18,101 --> 00:35:21,820
I think that they need an answer at
just like a, this is like when a,

601
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,540
that guy said the bridge was
over and the other guy said,

602
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,220
no it isn't right.

603
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:32,760
This is fucking Sherry's
berries and fucking, uh,

604
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:34,270
a flowers.com.

605
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:39,540
Wow saying they're saying that
the flowers are going to die.

606
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:43,590
The Roosevelt die in a week.
Anyways. I like me on these, man.

607
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:46,140
I like this 2016 they got a
little bit of an attitude.

608
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:49,590
Give the gift everyone is talking
about. Show you a special someone.

609
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:54,120
Just how much you care with a present.
You'll both love a gift that looks great.

610
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:56,940
It feels great. Something that
says you deserve the best.

611
00:35:56,941 --> 00:36:00,930
Treat yourself and your bu to
a magic pair of [inaudible],

612
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,270
the world's most comfortable
underwear. You know, it's hilarious.

613
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:06,840
I thought you were just going to get
them for yourself and be like t your

614
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:07,980
Valentine. A.

615
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,900
Treat yourself to a nice set of
dry balls with a swinging dick.

616
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,250
Happy Valentine's Day.

617
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:19,200
I think Mandy should send us a pair of
matching undies for Valentine's Day.

618
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:24,390
I don't think they should.
Well I do me on these.

619
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,293
All right.

620
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,290
I'm not going to be able to walk around
wearing underwear that matches yours

621
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,170
cause you know they're going to
make it more a feminine. You know,

622
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,840
they're going to have to
lean your fucking way. Uh,

623
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,110
I don't need any guy
underwear with lace on it.

624
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,373
Yeah.

625
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,760
Oh, there's a visual Jesus that
even disturb me. All right.

626
00:36:46,761 --> 00:36:49,760
Please include all of the following
points during your read note.

627
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,070
Modal is pronounced modal, modal.

628
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:57,550
This underwear is as comfy as it gets
for whoever fucking keeps writing MOH.

629
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:03,600
Dash D a. L you don't have any sort of
where I'm supposed to accent it, so,

630
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:04,550
so I know it's okay.

631
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:09,470
Modal, is it modal? Modal.

632
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:14,660
This underwear is the company as it
gets me undies are made of micro modal

633
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,360
mallow fabric meaning they're
twice as soft as cotton. You know,

634
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,670
someday I'm going to look that up to see
if to just not making that shit up and

635
00:37:22,671 --> 00:37:23,690
they just don't feel great.

636
00:37:23,691 --> 00:37:28,691
They look great to me on East Dot coms
com Mandy Mandy's comes in tuck tons of

637
00:37:29,061 --> 00:37:33,140
cool prints and styles and new
designs come out every month.

638
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:37,430
You won't want to miss February's
limited edition design from the legendary

639
00:37:37,431 --> 00:37:39,320
artists Keith Herring.

640
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:44,590
The retro design is inspired
by love making it the
perfect Valentine's Day gift.

641
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,590
This is when like the way black people
wear fucking pants with the the hanging

642
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:49,424
down off their,

643
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,480
their ass like this is the underwear for
them so they can be all you got them.

644
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:57,230
Limited edition joints. Say
sorry. That was, you know,

645
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:59,360
that was my idea of a black
guy, but it was all white guy.

646
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,640
Well you haven't pulled up.
Just study a fucking navel.

647
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:05,480
You just going to sit there sad and a
club knowing that nobody knows that you

648
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:07,550
have on this limited edition underwear.

649
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:11,300
And I think that that's why black people's
music is more uplifting than white

650
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:12,134
people.

651
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:16,280
That's why we have like the cure and all
that sad stuff is because nobody knows

652
00:38:16,281 --> 00:38:18,110
that we're wearing
limited edition underwear,

653
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,060
but black people getting their prompts,
right? Oh, Devin, them June joints,

654
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:26,210
right? I remember them from
fucking 2014 all right,

655
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,950

holiday sporty matching underwear with

657
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,740

you know where to get them.

661
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,700

00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:53,770
your company is only as
good as the people you hire.

663
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:57,070

enough to find quality candidates.

ziprecruiter.com/berm. See they
know how long to write an ad.

674
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,320
These other guys with their fucking
stories that make me go into a soliloquy

675
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:46,170
there. Um, oh, by the
way. So as I was stating,

676
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,130
uh, I've told this story
before, but I already started.

677
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,470
If you new to the podcast,
I'll tell it. You see. Anyways,

678
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,740
I'm working the sable cafe
in Cary, North Carolina.

679
00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:00,330
It's 1987 going into 88. Alright.

680
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,680
I probably just got done
seeing Tesla opening up for a,

681
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:10,810
it was either Eric Smith on the permanent
vacation tour or it was def leopard on

682
00:40:12,631 --> 00:40:13,680
the hysteria tour.

683
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,450
Remember Joe Elliot or those acid watch
rip pants the entire tour and through

684
00:40:18,451 --> 00:40:22,470
all of the videos, you know,
he went, Jim Morrison, what?

685
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,950
Jim Morrison wore the same leather
pants. He wore the same acid washed,

686
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,370
ripped fucking jeans. You know,
and I'll tell you this right now,

687
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:34,200
the man knows how to pack.
All right. Plowing ahead.

688
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:36,570
By the way, I always heard Jim
Florentine really knows how to pack,

689
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,670
drop it his name twice in this podcast.

690
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:40,820
I always heard he's one of those
guys goes away for three weeks.

691
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,420
It'll show up with like a fucking a
knapsack and like a cheese sandwich and a

692
00:40:45,421 --> 00:40:50,400
brown paper bag and he's just fucking
good. I'd like to be more like that there.

693
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:53,350
I can admit that I'm old enough now to
say I'd like to be more like Jim Flora.

694
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:59,480
Um, anyways, so I work in
the sable cafe. So, uh,

695
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,910
how it works is I'm glassed in, right?

696
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,120
And right behind me is that little window
and behind the window is the kitchen,

697
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,870
right? And there's the line. So
this order comes in, they're like,

698
00:41:08,871 --> 00:41:12,320
you know this guy, Jason's like, oh,
we're up for a burger. Right? So my guy,

699
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,150
what Barbara coming up, you know,

700
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:18,620
so I'm supposed to look at the order and
if there's a lot of shit on the line,

701
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,620
you know, if they've got a bump,
basically a bunch of entrees to make,

702
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,740
I hold off on the Burger so we can
time it all out. So it's already,

703
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,850
I wasn't thinking because
I'm busing tables and washing
dishes while not washing

704
00:41:28,851 --> 00:41:32,330
my hand. Total health code violation.
Right. I shouldn't have said that.

705
00:41:32,331 --> 00:41:35,720
Now that I said the name, the restaurant,
but it's all gone anyways. Um,

706
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,350
so I just start making
this burger. So, you know,

707
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,600
I'm cause I'm watching the tables,

708
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:43,220
like I gotta finish this Burger Cause
I got to go bust that fucking table and

709
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:46,400
throw some dishes into the
fucking dishwasher a, by the way,

710
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:49,580
I also mopped the whole fucking oyster
bar and clean out both bathrooms before I

711
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:53,030
fucking start. Brutal. Right. And, uh,

712
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,410
so I just start making the burger.
I put it on a plate and I'm like,

713
00:41:57,411 --> 00:41:58,610
Jason Burger up.

714
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,480
And he turns around and looks at me and
he's got his heavy metal hair shoved up

715
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:05,960
into a chef hat and he use one of those
guys that grew a mustache before he

716
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:08,930
could grow one. And he just looks at
me, he's like, dude, what the fuck?

717
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,350
And I like seven on trace
here. I'm like, God, I'm sorry.

718
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:15,590
So just fucking put it on the grill
to put it to the side of the grill.

719
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:19,520
So I grabbed it with tongs, it was a
glass plate and I just set it on the,

720
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:24,620
on basically on the grill, but underneath
the burner that was off, you know,

721
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:28,730
but just basically, you know, it's
a mesquite grill, so you know,

722
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:32,090
it's hot because the one, the burner
two three over is hot, you know,

723
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,380
it's all the same piece of metal. So
it's basically hot, but not piping hot.

724
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,130
Okay. But it's still
fucking pretty hot. Uh,

725
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,590
so I go out and I bus a
fucking table, right. And I,

726
00:42:41,591 --> 00:42:43,910
I wash them dishes and I come in and
all of a sudden I've got all these other

727
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:46,820
orders for chicken sandwiches
and [inaudible] and I
leave the burger in there.

728
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,930
I'm not even fucking thinking.

729
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:52,040
So Jason finally finishes two fucking
entrees and he looks, he goes,

730
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,930
he just goes, Bro, what's
up with that Burger?

731
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:58,880
And I just grabbed it with the tongs
and he has both his hands out to receive

732
00:42:58,881 --> 00:43:03,410
this thing and I just set it right down
on his hands and he just goes, hey.

733
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,830
And fucking spun around

734
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,330
and like basically threw
it down on the, on the,

735
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:16,331
on like the wood fucking shelf that he
had there and was immediately not in the

736
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:17,810
window.

737
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:22,810
So the whole fucking like dining room
heard this muffled screen and looked just

738
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,550
and then looked my way.
And by the time they look,

739
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:33,580
I was just standing there and I
tried to keep a straight face.

740
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:36,470
I fucking, I mean I
didn't really burn it bad.

741
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,110
He just made this face before he yelled.

742
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:43,820
It was like his brain was registering
what the fuck was happening and with his

743
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:47,150
fucking hair pushed up in his hat and
that stupid mustache that really wasn't a

744
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:47,840
mustache dude.

745
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,840
I fucking ducked down and for like
seven straight minutes was like crying,

746
00:43:52,971 --> 00:43:55,370
laughing. I was laughing so hard.

747
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:58,580
I remember he wasn't even mad at
me cause he was trying to be mad,

748
00:43:58,581 --> 00:44:02,590
but I was laughing so hard. He
started laughing and uh, you know,

749
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,580
then I had to run out and go
bus. All that stuff's there. Hey,

750
00:44:04,581 --> 00:44:06,320
how about a pat on the
back for myself? Rex,

751
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:09,530
you remembering to finish that story?
Cause I know that, uh, that I didn't.

752
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,281
Oh and by the way,

753
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:15,281
I got a lot of backlash from my
given Australia Shit for saying that.

754
00:44:16,311 --> 00:44:19,640
You know, you only had one one attack
and we had three people like, oh,

755
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,420
why don't you look at the population and
there's only like 23 million people or

756
00:44:23,421 --> 00:44:26,990
some shit and fucking Australia,
there's like 400 million here. Well,

757
00:44:26,991 --> 00:44:31,991
I will counter that point with the fact
that the top 10 fucking most poisonous

758
00:44:32,641 --> 00:44:33,091
snakes,

759
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:38,091
like nine of them all
reside in fucking Australia.

760
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,750
You know,

761
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:43,890
like rock stars living in Jamaica to
avoid the fucking taxes in England, right?

762
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:48,990
They're all fucking in Australia. All we
got is a couple of rattlers over here.

763
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:53,850
Okay. We're so dedicated to getting
killed by snakes. We fucking,

764
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:57,450
we had a guy die with by a Cobra
last year. They don't even live here.

765
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:01,980
The thing was just visiting
bit them in a car. Um,

766
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:06,150
they think it was suicide. Anyways,
that's the a podcast, 45 fucking minutes.

767
00:45:06,151 --> 00:45:08,910
It's not bad for just checking in
on you. It starts to everybody.

768
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,790
All you've got is one more day
to go and then it's fucking,

769
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,800
it's shit time at the fuck party,
right? Isn't that what Joi de Rosa says?

770
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:19,080
All right, I'll talk to
you later. See on Monday

771
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,640
[inaudible] [inaudible]

772
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,473
awesome.

773
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,680
I need you guys to come up with
a name for this phenomenon.

774
00:46:03,681 --> 00:46:07,290
You have a man standing in a,
in an airport terminal in this,

775
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:10,310
some douche talking really loud on
his cell phone. Of course you have.

776
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:14,810
We all have, right? She
big just giant dude.

777
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:19,240
There's a fat black dude from England,
so he sounds like he's in, you know,

778
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,630
lock stock in a smoking barrels,
whatever the fuck it's called.

779
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,950
And he's a tub of Shit,

780
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:26,470
which is making me laugh cause
everybody in Europe acts like that.

781
00:46:26,471 --> 00:46:30,220
Fucking smart and in shape. You
know, he looked like the fucking

782
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,770
dude on a, you know, you
know, what do you look like?

783
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,280
You know that show? The Cleveland
browns show, you know his son.

784
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:43,310
That's exactly what he looked
like. He didn't talk like him,

785
00:46:43,311 --> 00:46:45,890
but he had the fucking round
glasses, the whole God damn thing.

786
00:46:45,891 --> 00:46:49,040
That's what the fuck he looked like.
And he's talk and he's fucking,

787
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,420
he's Fi's American fat. He Chicago fat.

788
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:59,150
All right. But he's European, so he still
has to wear those tight fucking Janes.

789
00:46:59,210 --> 00:46:59,961
I don't know why.

790
00:46:59,961 --> 00:47:04,010
I don't know what it is about Europe
and fucking suffocate and your balls,

791
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,270
but Europeans just did. Jeans
cannot be fucking tight.

792
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:10,700
They just cannot be fucking
tight enough. They have,

793
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,840
they have to fucking frame their package.

794
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:19,020
That goddamn units look like fucking
hand Solo's face when he gets frozen in

795
00:47:19,101 --> 00:47:23,480
that little piece of fucking
carbon or whatever the fuck it was.

796
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:29,470
Um, anyways, so he's running
his stupid yet. Yeah.

797
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:33,490
Mike going over to Melbourne after they're
going to go back over to fucking who

798
00:47:33,491 --> 00:47:35,770
gives a fuck, right. Just
talk and talk and talk.

799
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:40,390
Talking big stupid Chicago
bare fucking gut, you know,

800
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:44,080
you know when you get the creases on
the side, you could stick mail in there.

801
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:49,270
He's got those on the side,
right. Or Offensive Lineman, fat.

802
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:51,350
You know, he's got great footwork though,

803
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:56,110
but look at his fucking belly and he's
just running his Goddamn Yap. You know,

804
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:58,720
so I walk away from the guy,

805
00:47:58,721 --> 00:48:01,450
but he's one of these guys that
takes a little stroll when he walked.

806
00:48:01,451 --> 00:48:06,310
So he keeps fucking walking over into
my little area. Right. So my guy,

807
00:48:06,311 --> 00:48:09,220
you know, Bill, come on,
just fucking, don't be this.

808
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:13,010
Don't be fucking screaming and
yelling. Just fucking relax. And uh,

809
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,180
what is the name of this phenomenon?
They start loading the fucking plane.

810
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:20,830
I get on the plane, here
comes that fucking Douche,

813
00:48:27,101 --> 00:48:29,110
England. Y'all sound
the same to me. Right?

814
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,480
So he comes walking up the alley.
He's still running his fucking yep.

815
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,990
And I'm just going out. Jesus
Christ. All right. Only off,

in my row. What are the odds?

818

You know, what are the fucking
odds? God Damn 70 fucking rose.

819
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:50,650
Not only is he in my row,

820
00:48:50,651 --> 00:48:54,760
he's sitting right next to me and he
stays on the phone the whole fucking time.

Why you swearing?

824
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:08,830
I'm not swearing the whole fucking time
sitting next to me running his God damn.

825
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:13,270
Yeah. But this fat fucking stomach

only props I will give this guys is,

827
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:24,340
you know, he never seen ever said
hello. We didn't speak the whole flight.

828
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:25,203
I loved it.

829
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:30,460
I loved that he was as
self-involved as I am. And uh,

830
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,680
the last thing I wanted to hear,
the last thing I want to do,

831
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,440
we started talking to him cause he
already annoyed the shit out of me.

832
00:49:35,441 --> 00:49:39,040
And I know from experience that if I'm
going to talk to somebody from another

833
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:39,874
country,

834
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:44,830
at some point they're going to shit on
the United States as something that they

835
00:49:44,831 --> 00:49:49,000
like to do while calling us the ignorant
Americans traveling around the world.

836
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,860
You know, all knees and elbows,

837
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,610
those motherfuckers come
over here and it's just,

838
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,480
you can't talk to them for more than
fucking five minutes before they, they,

839
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,570
they shit on America. I don't
want to fucking understand it.

840
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:03,443
Okay.

841
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,650
[inaudible] you know, I would
never do that. The only,

842
00:50:07,651 --> 00:50:10,440
the only way I would do that is if
I was on stage in another country.

843
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:14,220
Just just for the fucking ridiculousness
of it to start making fun of their

844
00:50:14,221 --> 00:50:17,590
fucking country. But if I was sitting
on a plane, I would just be telling her,

845
00:50:17,591 --> 00:50:20,520
you have a beautiful country, blah,
blah, blah. I be a decent fucking guy.

846
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,390
I don't fucking, AH, Jesus Christ

847
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,540
the was I just going to tigers?
You remembered something
in the middle of that,

848
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:34,260
the hell was it talking about, hang
on a second. Let me think about this.

849
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,150
Oh yeah, I remember what it was.

850
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,060
Did I tell this story like
fucking four months ago,

851
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,760
I pulled my big ass truck
into this small spot,

852
00:50:44,761 --> 00:50:46,860
but there was nobody on the
other side of me and I was fine.

853
00:50:46,861 --> 00:50:48,000
Right when I came out,

854
00:50:48,001 --> 00:50:51,210
somebody had pulled in and it was really
tight as far as like on either side of

855
00:50:51,211 --> 00:50:54,060
my truck. And then I didn't
have a lot of space to back out.

856
00:50:54,061 --> 00:50:57,180
So it was this fucking problem. I keep
trying to back, you know, back out,

857
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,190
come back in, back out,
like inching my way in.

858
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:01,410
So this fucking guy starts helping me out.

859
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:05,400
I think he was from England and
he's like, uh, you know, next time,

860
00:51:05,401 --> 00:51:10,240
why didn't you do the UNAMERICAN
thing and back in and I, I,

861
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,370
I fucking, I,

862
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,450
it's like you can't even help me out of
this spot without fucking nitpicking you

863
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:21,020
fucking cunt. You know what?
I'll listen to it from Australia.

864
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:22,220
But England though,

865
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,990
the amount of shit that is going on in
the world still because of those cons,

866
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:31,370
the fact that they actually fucking give
you have the balls to give the United

867
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:34,550
States shit the very least be
like, hey, welcome to the party.

868
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:35,750
Yeah,

869
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:36,440
welcome.

870
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,520
You guys just slowly catching up to
us historically as the biggest fucking

871
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:43,610
oppressive douchebags on the planet.
You want to come at me like that?

872
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:44,444
Absolutely.

873
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:47,810
But if you're going to fucking come at
me like you didn't do all this other

874
00:51:47,811 --> 00:51:52,280
bullshit out there, the fucking caste
system in India and all that fucking crap,

875
00:51:52,281 --> 00:51:54,980
the shit that happened
in Rwanda, you know?

876
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:56,650
Yeah.

877
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,720
That's all. I got. Two examples.
I don't know anything else.

878
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,350
The Falkland Islands at JCC
Igert, American strikes again,

879
00:52:05,351 --> 00:52:07,510
but you know what I'm
saying? If I actually read,

880
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,710
I could fucking bury you guys
in this argument. All right.

881
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:16,120
With your jolly rancher flag,
whatever the fuck you call it. Um,

882
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:17,983
all right.

883
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:22,360
Thank God I don't have a gig coming
up in England after that little thing,

884
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:23,223
you know.

885
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:49,803
[inaudible]

886
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:55,280
a dilemma. A bill, what
would you choose? Um,

887
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:59,950
to either have sex with any woman
in the world? Nia wouldn't mind.

888
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:03,130
I wouldn't care if she gave a shit if I,

889
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:06,350
my choice of any fucking woman in the
world just to do it one time. Yeah.

890
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:11,670
Uh, that wouldn't be worth it. It
wouldn't be worth it to lose Nia, but eh,

891
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:16,750
but my Dick would override
that wisdom in the moment.

892
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,620
Um, or to have access to the truth
about any government secret in history.

893
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:23,690
What would you do?

894
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,373
Okay.

895
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:28,560
All right. Well, how would I know
any government's secret in history?

896
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,620
What would they know that I knew it and
then they'd start tracking me down and

897
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:34,500
then I'd have to be like fucking
Jason Borne for the rest of my life.

898
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:40,170
Never getting to sleep more than
five seconds between concussions. Um,

899
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,920
all right. First of all, if I could
have sex with any woman in the world,

900
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:45,683
who would it be?

901
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,093
Okay.

902
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:53,490
Ah, let's see here. Well, you got UK,

903
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:58,500
you got, you got your major groups.
I think you've got four major groups.

904
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,800
You have famous, you have celebrity women.

905
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:08,630
Um, you have a young
celebrities like movie stars.

906
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:13,640
Then you have, you have a rock star,

907
00:54:13,641 --> 00:54:16,310
chicks, sports checks,

908
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,440
and then you got chicks
from your past. You know,

909
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,700
some teacher you always wanted
to bang any woman in the world,

910
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:29,910
you're going to go back. But she
has to be as hot as she was. Oh,

911
00:54:29,911 --> 00:54:33,200
this is a dilemma. Oh, by the way,

912
00:54:33,201 --> 00:54:37,970
the other day I was at a comedy club
in that, that, uh, pink was down,

913
00:54:37,971 --> 00:54:41,830
was actually in the crowd. And
uh, I didn't go up around anybody.

914
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:45,140
She walked by fucking absolutely

915
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:51,460
like slump against the wall.
Beautiful. Absolutely fucking gorgeous.

916
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,690
Um, I'm telling you some of the, like
those fucking like super famous people,

917
00:54:55,691 --> 00:54:59,890
like they don't even look real when
they walk by you. They just liked it.

918
00:54:59,891 --> 00:55:04,030
That genetics, like, I don't know
what happened, but I'm just like,

919
00:55:04,031 --> 00:55:08,230
Jesus fucking Christ. You know? I mean,
I knew she was good looking right.

920
00:55:08,231 --> 00:55:10,870
I've seen the videos, but everybody
looks good in videos, you know,

921
00:55:10,871 --> 00:55:12,850
and then half the time you
see him in fucking real life.

922
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,710
I'll tell you this right now. If you
ever see pink, she does not disappoint.

923
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:23,080
Fucking just write down the checklist.
Absolutely fucking gorgeous.

924
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,680
You know, beautiful fucking dress.
That was sexy but not slutty.

925
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:30,760
She had the fucking tattoos, but
not too many of them. Fucking,

926
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:35,200
just absolutely a fucking gorgeous.
I felt like I was in second grade.

927
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:40,050
Um, you know, like when a beautiful girl
walks by you like a big [inaudible],

928
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:44,260
you don't even know what to say. Um,
all right, so let's get back to it.

929
00:55:44,261 --> 00:55:49,100
So if I could beg any
woman in the fucking world,

930
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,370
well, there's two kinds of women.
There's the woman that you,

931
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:59,970
you're fucking is absolutely gorgeous
and makes you believe in an afterlife.

932
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,370
And then there's the other girl you
want to bang just to shutter the fuck.

933
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:05,923
Gotcha.

934
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,970
You know what I mean? Like,

935
00:56:11,971 --> 00:56:15,660
I bet there's a lot of liberals out
there that want to just bang and culture,

936
00:56:15,661 --> 00:56:19,620
just stick their dick right in her
fucking mouth. You know what I mean?

937
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,600
But not like a totally malicious way.

938
00:56:21,601 --> 00:56:25,720
Just really put one on her where she's
just fucking losing it and you know,

939
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:30,580
making noises in bed that she didn't
even know she could make and uh,

940
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:31,443
you know,

941
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:36,070
and make her be able to make those noises
even though she knows that you voted

942
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:39,190
for Obama. You know, there's
that kind of fucking right.

943
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:44,770
And then there's the other one
where you just wanna fuck in a,

944
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:48,970
you know, run down the beach,
hand in hand with something girl,

945
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:56,230
at least in my world, that's the only,
those are the only two. What would I do?

946
00:56:56,231 --> 00:56:58,600
You know what? I would choose a,

947
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:05,560
I would choose sex with any woman in
the world because I'm that government

948
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,090
learning a government secret.

949
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:10,660
I've actually done that on
a certain level and it just,

950
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:13,060
it's like being in show
business is when you're like,

951
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:15,760
wouldn't it be cool to meet this person?

952
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:19,630
And then you meet them and they're
like the biggest fucking asshole ever.

953
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:25,450
Or they, uh, I don't know. They just
like, they just do something that

954
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,800
just, it just blows your whole
fucking image. It's, it's,

955
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:31,860
it's the wizard of Oz thing.
We, you, you don't want it.

956
00:57:31,861 --> 00:57:34,110
You don't want to peek around
the corner. You don't want it.

957
00:57:34,111 --> 00:57:38,520
You don't want to peek around the
corners. So what I would do is, uh,

958
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:41,770
I would definitely, I
would, I would, I would,

959
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,990
I would have sex with some
[inaudible] and you know what?

960
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:49,440
I'm [inaudible] it would have
to be somebody famous. And, uh,

961
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:54,680
Dan, out of respect for
Nia, I would have to be a,

962
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:56,550
just to shut them the
fuck up kind of woman.

963
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:02,110
Although I would love to run down the
beach. You know, why can't I have that?

964
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:06,990
Why can't I have happiness?
All right, let's,

965
00:58:06,991 --> 00:58:11,750
let's pick one. One of each. Alright.

966
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:13,490
Okay.

967
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,310
Is there any girl I just want
to lose, shut the fuck up.

968
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:22,270
I would say back in the day it would've
been Madonna, but like, she would just,

969
00:58:22,271 --> 00:58:26,530
she was like beyond the noise. She
was so fucking annoying. She was like,

970
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,860
I would just want to get out of the room.

971
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,020
Okay.

972
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:31,853
You know what I mean?

973
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:35,930
They always watches that blonde ambition
tour and there's nothing more nauseated

974
00:58:35,931 --> 00:58:40,070
than watching somebody who's surrounded
by yes men. You know what I mean?

975
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,340
That just completely fucking
up noxious everything they say.

976
00:58:43,341 --> 00:58:46,460
Everyone's hanging all over every word
and they just laughing at everything.

977
00:58:46,461 --> 00:58:48,290
Like that's, you know something.

978
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,980
That's one thing that I have
learned in this business is, uh,

979
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:56,150
a major red flag is somebody who has
an entourage. If you have an entourage,

980
00:58:56,151 --> 00:59:00,470
like a, I dunno, I've already, I,

981
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:04,190
I automatically judge you as
like, all right, this person is a,

982
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:06,920
is not somebody I'm going to
want to fucking be around.

983
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,200
Cause the only way I'm going
to be able to exist is this.

984
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,910
I assimilate into your entourage and
when you tell the joke that isn't funny,

985
00:59:13,911 --> 00:59:16,550
I can't be like, I can't look
at you like that joke sucks.

986
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,850
I have to fucking do like
what they are doing, you know,

987
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:24,170
laugh my ass off cause paying for my
hotel room the fuck out of here. Right.

988
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:29,620
That and, and people who don't
hang out with peers, you know,

989
00:59:29,621 --> 00:59:30,890
maybe they don't have an entourage,

990
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:34,400
but everybody they hang out with is
fucking like 10 years behind them in this

991
00:59:34,401 --> 00:59:35,540
business. Then that's another,

992
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:38,930
that's another red flag because then
nobody's calling you out on your shit.

993
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:43,340
Right. That's, that's how I look at it.
How did I get to that with this shit?

994
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:48,260
You know what, I'm going to have to
get back to you on this one. You know,

995
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:51,740
I'm a fucking 44 year old guy,
so I don't really set, you know,

996
00:59:51,741 --> 00:59:56,030
when I was younger I had my, my, I'll
go back in the day, my list. Okay.

997
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,910
When I was a kid, uh, the bionic woman,

998
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:03,350
all three Charlie's angels, um,

999
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,360
Farah, I wanted to bang, I
had lust for her. Kay Jackson.

1000
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,470
I would marry and Jaclyn Smith get out,

1001
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,570
which your fault for stand
in between the two of them

1002
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:18,800
you're going down to. But you know,

1003
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:22,900
I didn't need Jacqueline Smith cause
I already had the Brunette with,

1004
01:00:22,901 --> 01:00:27,230
with fucking, uh, Kate Jackson. Um,

1005
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,700
then who else? Who else in the 80s?

1006
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:37,490
I like what's her face? The
replacement for Shelley long.

1007
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:41,030
Uh, who's in the look who's talking?

1008
01:00:41,031 --> 01:00:44,660
She came on at that horse smokey
foresee fucking smokey voice,

1009
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:45,740
whatever the fuck you supposed to say.

1010
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:48,550
It's supposed to sound way
more sexier than that. Uh,

1011
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:52,640
she had nice fucking curves. Got a little
out of control there after a while,

1012
01:00:52,641 --> 01:00:54,800
but uh, you know, um,

1013
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:00,140
she still has nice apps.
I got to tell you, uh,

1014
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:02,283
who else?

1015
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,130
You know, it's weird. Florence Henderson,
when she had the worst mullet haircut,

1016
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:11,090
always turned me on more than
when she had that awful fucking,

1017
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:16,900
oh, Marsha, Marsha Brady, when she
fucking had the little short skirts on

1018
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,600
fucking a Janet Jackson when
she was on a different strokes.

1019
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:26,763
Who else?

1020
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:31,660
I just, it goes on for fucking
ever. I just can't remember anymore.

1021
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,450
He's never Cyndi Lauper,
I could tell you that.

1022
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:41,100
Okay.

1023
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,980
She just seemed like some
spares. Little fucking boy to me.

1024
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:49,820
Yeah. Then that fucking
haircut that she had was,

1025
01:01:49,821 --> 01:01:52,730
she fucking had like a tic Tac
toe board on the side of her head.

1026
01:01:52,731 --> 01:01:53,940
That just really freaked me out.

1027
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,060
Um,

1028
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:59,050
not that I was totally against that here
cook cause I thought that chicken bow

1029
01:01:59,051 --> 01:02:00,230
wow. I thought she was hot.

1030
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:03,143
Um,

1031
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:06,533
okay.

1032
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:10,520
Who the fuck else did I like lead
a Ford. Oh my God. That I like her.

1033
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:14,150
I think I might've somebody back then.

1034
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:18,630
I can't fucking remember. [inaudible]

1035
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:10,841
I'm lonely.

1036
01:03:10,841 --> 01:03:14,650
I was just watching television by myself
speaking to it as if it was another

1037
01:03:14,651 --> 01:03:18,520
life human being. And I saw
this commercial for this, this,

1038
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:22,150
this new website called
farmers only. Dot Com.

1039
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:27,820
This is not a commercial people.
This is actually an observation. Um,

1040
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:31,360
it was basically showing a, you
know, some, a couple of ranchers,

1041
01:03:31,361 --> 01:03:36,070
a couple of farm girls and they just walk
in the fields by themselves, you know,

1042
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,730
playing with their face finger,
playing with each other. You know,

1043
01:03:39,731 --> 01:03:40,960
you do that when you were a little kid.

1044
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:43,870
You'd do that little thing where you
put your thumb and index finger together

1045
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,490
and both hands you need
kind of do the little,

1046
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,130
almost like there's an
invisible tiny screw.

1047
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:53,220
You know there's some poor woman walking
through like these a bunch of corn,

1048
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:56,920
you know when the cows are all concerned
to the point directionally speaking

1049
01:03:56,921 --> 01:04:00,730
English to one one another, you
know about each of them going,

1050
01:04:00,731 --> 01:04:02,080
how the hell are they
going to meet each other?

1051
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:06,420
And then all of a sudden this Whalen
whore comes over the top and just start

1052
01:04:06,421 --> 01:04:10,470
singing young. Never be
lonely. Add Pharma Zone,

1053
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:16,660
lit.com so it's basically their Facebook
and you should go and look at it on

1054
01:04:16,661 --> 01:04:20,110
Youtube. That's what you should
do. You shouldn't work, you know,

1055
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:25,060
where do you work? What are you doing?
Is it your dream or somebody else's?

1056
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,400
You just a cog in the wheel. You know,

1057
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:32,110
are they really going to notice if you
stop working, everybody else is working.

1058
01:04:32,111 --> 01:04:33,250
Why don't you just fucking, you know,

1059
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,460
Tour de France just sort of draft behind
a couple of people's today. You know,

1060
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:42,430
take a fucking Monday off, 20
weeks, check out this video.

1061
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,450
And you know,

1062
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:46,210
it's the funniest thing about it is the
comments underneath it is the amount of

1063
01:04:46,211 --> 01:04:50,440
people who shit on, you know, just
immediately thinking how dumb people are.

1064
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:54,790
It's like these people grow our
fucking food. Do you understand that?

1065
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:58,580
I'm sure they don't know where
the rave is. You know well,

1066
01:04:58,581 --> 01:05:02,890
who the most popular bands are or how
to get from fucking Brooklyn over to

1067
01:05:02,891 --> 01:05:06,850
Staten Island. Oh right. They
don't know how to do that shit.

1068
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,670
They don't know how to put on
a fucking shiny shirt. Right.

1069
01:05:12,671 --> 01:05:16,480
And go jump on the subway and go down
to Wall Street and make sure old people

1070
01:05:16,481 --> 01:05:20,270
eat dog for the rest of their fucking
lives. Yet they don't know how to do that.

1071
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:23,920
But you know, they know how to do, they
ought to make them, I make corn right,

1072
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,780
or planets or grows. They
don't make it. God makes it,

1073
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:32,800
and he makes that fertile
fucking country. You know?

1074
01:05:32,801 --> 01:05:36,580
It's got to be really hard to catch
herpes out there. You know what I mean?

1075
01:05:36,581 --> 01:05:39,220
I mean in much spread.
Really fucking slowly.

1076
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,520
Jesus Christ. I mean,

1077
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:45,580
you wonder why you must fucking
rub them at least two loads out.

1078
01:05:45,581 --> 01:05:49,660
By the time you get to her house to sit
in there driving and driving fucking

1079
01:05:49,661 --> 01:05:51,400
tornado, man, pull over.

1080
01:05:51,401 --> 01:05:54,580
Rub another one out by then you add or
you know what the fuck I'm going over

1081
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:59,140
there. Foreign ways. Shit. I got more
teeth in her. That's a deal breaker. Look,

1082
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:03,970
now I'll make fun of him
at farmer's only.com.

1083
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:06,670
That's going to be embarrassing.

1084
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,830
You and your fucking
neighbor are going to join.

1085
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:13,810
You can be the only ones on the site.
Hey, I thought you wanted to fuck me.

1086
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:16,930
I just was too long of a walk.
You know what I'm saying?

1087
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,410
Plus it's tornado season. You
never know what's going to happen.

1088
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:26,120
I lived there called the fly overstates
and no reason to go there. Yeah,

1089
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:29,790
no reason to check in
on the food supply. Uh,

1090
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,910
like you're gonna. That'd be a good
thing to fucking freak them out with.

1091
01:06:33,911 --> 01:06:38,530
Just show up with like a clipboard.
The fuck are you doing sit up boy.

1092
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:42,400
Or they actually, you know, something,
they make themselves kind of separatists.

1093
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,100
Cause at the end of, is
that even a word? Um,

1094
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:48,250
they actually say the city
folks don't understand.

1095
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,630
What don't we understand?
Loneliness. Is that what it is?

1096
01:06:52,631 --> 01:06:56,200
Come to New York and be alone
with everybody. You never
heard that. You fucking,

1097
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:01,210
you know what? Fuck them. Goddamn
farmers. Jesus Christ. What?

1098
01:07:01,211 --> 01:07:03,400
You don't have your cousin's
phone number. He said, well,

1099
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,220
you're sick of fucking your sisters and
now you gotta get your own Facebook and

1100
01:07:06,221 --> 01:07:09,280
see the jokes that just too
easy here, people, you know.

1101
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:13,993
That's good.

1102
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:57,650
[inaudible].
