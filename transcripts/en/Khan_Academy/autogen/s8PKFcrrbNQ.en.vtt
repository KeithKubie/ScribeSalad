00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
two videos ago I told you that when

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580
two videos ago I told you that when
 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.160
two videos ago I told you that when
you're dealing with an exponential

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170
you're dealing with an exponential
 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.160
you're dealing with an exponential
function that when you increase X by a

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170
function that when you increase X by a
 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.640
function that when you increase X by a
constant amount that the Y values will

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650
constant amount that the Y values will
 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.009
constant amount that the Y values will
increased by a constant factor when we

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019
increased by a constant factor when we
 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.379
increased by a constant factor when we
increased X from zero to one we

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
increased X from zero to one we
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.410
increased X from zero to one we
increased Y by a factor of 1.5 we

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420
increased Y by a factor of 1.5 we
 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.830
increased Y by a factor of 1.5 we
multiplied 1.5 times 120 to get 180 when

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
multiplied 1.5 times 120 to get 180 when
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.830
multiplied 1.5 times 120 to get 180 when
we increased X by 1 again once again y

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840
we increased X by 1 again once again y
 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.740
we increased X by 1 again once again y
increased by a factor of 1.5 we

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750
increased by a factor of 1.5 we
 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.830
increased by a factor of 1.5 we
multiplied 1.5 times 180 what I want to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
multiplied 1.5 times 180 what I want to
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.389
multiplied 1.5 times 180 what I want to
do in this video is to kind of quickly

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399
do in this video is to kind of quickly
 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.030
do in this video is to kind of quickly
show you I'm just going from the basic

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040
show you I'm just going from the basic
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.069
show you I'm just going from the basic
definition of an exponential function

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079
definition of an exponential function
 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.280
definition of an exponential function
why this is the case why this works for

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
why this is the case why this works for
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.250
why this is the case why this works for
exponential functions so let's just

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
exponential functions so let's just
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.709
exponential functions so let's just
start with the general exponential y is

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
start with the general exponential y is
 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.639
start with the general exponential y is
equal to a times R to the X and let's

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649
equal to a times R to the X and let's
 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.100
equal to a times R to the X and let's
look at some X values and then their

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110
look at some X values and then their
 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.389
look at some X values and then their
corresponding Y values so this is these

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
corresponding Y values so this is these
 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.680
corresponding Y values so this is these
are my X values those are my Y values

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
are my X values those are my Y values
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.939
are my X values those are my Y values
over there now let's say that X is equal

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
over there now let's say that X is equal
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.130
over there now let's say that X is equal
to let's say let me just pick an

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
to let's say let me just pick an
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.750
to let's say let me just pick an
arbitrary number let's say that X is

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
arbitrary number let's say that X is
 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.539
arbitrary number let's say that X is
equal to V I haven't used that variable

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549
equal to V I haven't used that variable
 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.789
equal to V I haven't used that variable
yet then what's Y going to be equal to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
yet then what's Y going to be equal to
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.359
yet then what's Y going to be equal to
it's going to be equal to a times R to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369
it's going to be equal to a times R to
 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.530
it's going to be equal to a times R to
the beeth power now let's increase X by

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
the beeth power now let's increase X by
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.780
the beeth power now let's increase X by
1 this would also work if you increase X

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790
1 this would also work if you increase X
 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.520
1 this would also work if you increase X
by really just a constant factor but

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
by really just a constant factor but
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.460
by really just a constant factor but
let's increase it by 1 so we're now

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470
let's increase it by 1 so we're now
 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.830
let's increase it by 1 so we're now
going to look at X is equal to B plus 1

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
going to look at X is equal to B plus 1
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.399
going to look at X is equal to B plus 1
then Y is going to be equal to a times R

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409
then Y is going to be equal to a times R
 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.120
then Y is going to be equal to a times R
to the B plus 1 power let's do it one

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
to the B plus 1 power let's do it one
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.819
to the B plus 1 power let's do it one
more time let's increase X by 1 you get

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
more time let's increase X by 1 you get
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.310
more time let's increase X by 1 you get
B plus 2 and now a X sorry now why would

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320
B plus 2 and now a X sorry now why would
 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.609
B plus 2 and now a X sorry now why would
be a times R to the B plus 2 power now

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
be a times R to the B plus 2 power now
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.469
be a times R to the B plus 2 power now
let's see what happens when you take the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
let's see what happens when you take the
 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.289
let's see what happens when you take the
ratio of each successive Y terms that

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299
ratio of each successive Y terms that
 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.359
ratio of each successive Y terms that
correspond to the X terms when they you

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
correspond to the X terms when they you
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.370
correspond to the X terms when they you
increase X by a constant factor notice

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380
increase X by a constant factor notice
 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.920
increase X by a constant factor notice
every time we increased X by exactly 1

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
every time we increased X by exactly 1
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.959
every time we increased X by exactly 1
if this was 0 this is 1 this is 2 if

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969
if this was 0 this is 1 this is 2 if
 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.399
if this was 0 this is 1 this is 2 if
this is negative 5 this would be

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409
this is negative 5 this would be
 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.919
this is negative 5 this would be
negative 4 this would be negative 3 so

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929
negative 4 this would be negative 3 so
 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.229
negative 4 this would be negative 3 so
let's see what happens with our Y so

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239
let's see what happens with our Y so
 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.670
let's see what happens with our Y so
over here

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
over here
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.069
over here
if we look at the factor that why

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079
if we look at the factor that why
 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.880
if we look at the factor that why
changed by we could just divide a R to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890
changed by we could just divide a R to
 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.210
changed by we could just divide a R to
the B plus one by a R to the B and what

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220
the B plus one by a R to the B and what
 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.869
the B plus one by a R to the B and what
do we get

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879
do we get
 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.970
do we get
well you might already recognize you

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980
well you might already recognize you
 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.860
well you might already recognize you
could use straight-up exponent rules

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
could use straight-up exponent rules
 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.110
could use straight-up exponent rules
right here the a is canceled out and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120
right here the a is canceled out and
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.440
right here the a is canceled out and
then this is going to be equal to R to

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450
then this is going to be equal to R to
 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.979
then this is going to be equal to R to
the b plus 1 minus b same base you're

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989
the b plus 1 minus b same base you're
 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.780
the b plus 1 minus b same base you're
taking the quotient you subtract the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790
taking the quotient you subtract the
 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.879
taking the quotient you subtract the
exponents so this is just going to be

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889
exponents so this is just going to be
 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.780
exponents so this is just going to be
equal to R that's just going to be equal

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790
equal to R that's just going to be equal
 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.460
equal to R that's just going to be equal
to R let's see what happens when we go

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470
to R let's see what happens when we go
 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.059
to R let's see what happens when we go
from let me go from here to here once

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069
from let me go from here to here once
 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.170
from let me go from here to here once
again take the Y value and when X is

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180
again take the Y value and when X is
 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.770
again take the Y value and when X is
equal to B plus 2 so a R to the B plus 2

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780
equal to B plus 2 so a R to the B plus 2
 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.099
equal to B plus 2 so a R to the B plus 2
divide it by the previous Y value

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109
divide it by the previous Y value
 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:11.839
divide it by the previous Y value
divided by a R to the B plus 1 these

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849
divided by a R to the B plus 1 these
 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.729
divided by a R to the B plus 1 these
cancel out and we're left with R to the

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739
cancel out and we're left with R to the
 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.970
cancel out and we're left with R to the
B plus 2 R to the B plus 2 minus B minus

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980
B plus 2 R to the B plus 2 minus B minus
 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.170
B plus 2 R to the B plus 2 minus B minus
B plus 1 which is equal to R to the B

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180
B plus 1 which is equal to R to the B
 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.399
B plus 1 which is equal to R to the B
plus 2 minus B minus 1 these cancel out

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409
plus 2 minus B minus 1 these cancel out
 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.210
plus 2 minus B minus 1 these cancel out
2 minus 1 once again you're just left

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220
2 minus 1 once again you're just left
 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.390
2 minus 1 once again you're just left
with R so hopefully that satisfies any

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400
with R so hopefully that satisfies any
 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.849
with R so hopefully that satisfies any
curiosity you might have had of why

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859
curiosity you might have had of why
 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.270
curiosity you might have had of why
you're able to use that as the way to

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280
you're able to use that as the way to
 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.159
you're able to use that as the way to
evaluate whether this data was

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169
evaluate whether this data was
 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.839
evaluate whether this data was
exponential why we're able to just say

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849
exponential why we're able to just say
 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.490
exponential why we're able to just say
hey let's take this term divided by the

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500
hey let's take this term divided by the
 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.729
hey let's take this term divided by the
previous term and see what number we get

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739
previous term and see what number we get
 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.349
previous term and see what number we get
this term divided by that term and if we

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359
this term divided by that term and if we
 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.270
this term divided by that term and if we
get the same number every time we're

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280
get the same number every time we're
 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.599
get the same number every time we're
dealing with an exponential function
