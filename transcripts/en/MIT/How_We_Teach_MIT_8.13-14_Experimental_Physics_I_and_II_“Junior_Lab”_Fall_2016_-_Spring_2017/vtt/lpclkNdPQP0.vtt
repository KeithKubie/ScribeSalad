ATISSA BANUAZIZI:
So I'd say that one

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.610
of the most important things for
communication instructors who

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.640
are partnering with
technical faculty

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.780
is for everybody to have
a shared understanding

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.110
of the assignment genres
that you're working with.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.240
So if students understand
who they're talking to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.760
and what the purpose
and the context

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.480
of the communicative act are,
rather than just saying, like,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.820
it's an oral presentation,
as though that's

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.460
some kind of descriptive
term in any way,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.640
the more they understand
that, the better off they're

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.890
going to be, because then
you can start to ask them

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.290
what, practically
speaking, is likely to work

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.989
for getting the message
across to that audience.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.030
But that involves that,
like, all the instructors

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.660
be on the same page.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.640
And so sort of sitting
down with the instructors

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.250
at the beginning of the
semester or beforehand,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.210
and just getting from them
a really clear understanding

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.280
of how they conceive
of the assignment

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.870
and how they
conceive of the genre

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.710
and how they conceive of who
the students are talking to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.407
and why, makes all
the difference.
