00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.660
Hello Internet,

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.089
Here we are: 500,000 subscribers -- well,
actually... by the time I finished this video

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.380
it's a bit more than that -- but who knew
that after I promised to do a Q&amp;A that the

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.340
pope would resign?

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.930
Anyway...

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.730
When I uploaded my first explanation video
just over two years ago now, I would never

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.380
have expented this: over half a million subscribers
and 16 videos with over a million views. Who

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.310
knew rapidly spoken educational videos could
be so popular?

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.390
Thank you, Internet.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.960
Now, as promised -- though slighly behind
schedule -- it's time to answer some of your

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.210
questions.

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.849
## "What's your educational background?" Rodrigo,
Campo Grande, Brazil

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.180
I went to school in New York where I earned
two college degrees, one in physics and one

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.770
in sociology. After that I moved to London
and earned a PGCE in Science Education, and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.830
became a qualified physics teacher in England.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.690
## "How long does it take to create a video?"
Tracey, Ohio

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.800
I've tracked my time to get an accurate answer
and every minute of final video you see takes

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.720
me between 10 and 20 hours of writing and
animating to make. So a typical 5 minute video

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.450
is 50 to 100 hours of work.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.870
While that's a lot, it doesn't include the
research phase which is difficult to quantify

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.929
-- some of the videos I've made I'd been collecting
notes on for more than a year before starting.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.680
## "What was you favourite video make?" Brittany
P, UK

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.810
The 2012 video was the most fun by far -- mainly
because I didn't have to do a lot of complicated

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.270
research and I got to complain about things
I don't like.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.560
## "What change would you make to the education
system?" Lumbajack Gangsta, Austin, TX

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.940
Instead of grouping kids by age, I'd group
try grouping them by ability instead.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.190
The idea that just because a kid is 14-years-old
they're ready for trigonometry is weird. No

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.550
other part of human society oranizes itself
this way and for good reason: it artificially

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.990
slows down the best and brightest.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.680
## "What is do you think should be in the
curriculum but isn't?" Jamaal, Arizona

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.570
Computer programming. I was kind of shocked
and horrified when I started teaching in the

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.799
UK to discover there were no real computer
programming lessons.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.909
Of course, there are only so many classes
in the day, and everyone wants their pet subject

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.470
taught in schools, so the equally important
question is what to get rid of to make room

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.990
for computer programming and, without the
slightest hesitation I'd ditch the foreign

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.170
languages classes -- after all, computer programming
is getting us closer and closer to a universal

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.159
translator anyway.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.990
## "What do you do when you receive pennies?"
johnjac, Owasso

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.020
I die a little inside thinking about how political
systems can distribute tiny costs across large

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.020
numbers of people to the benefit of a few.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.200
## "What's your favorite element?" Rasmus,
Denmark

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.560
I don't have a favorite but I'm irrationaly
fond of Tungsten mainly because my wedding

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.610
ring is made out of it.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.270
## "What's the story behind your logo?" Joshua
B.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.820
It's basically a personal flag for my love
of science and technology.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.830
When I first started this channel, I thought
that I would make videos mostly about those

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.610
two things, but for various reasons, that
hasn't happened yet.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.310
And besides, it's not like there's a shortage
of good science channels on YouTube.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.760
By the way, If you really like the logo, you
can get it on T-Shirts and now coffee mugs

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.620
-- which is particularly appropriate as coffee
is the fuel that without which these videos

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.600
could not be made.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.260
## "What do you do in your free time?" Sam
L, Higginsville, MO

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.830
I like to horseback ride through the mountains.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.480
Nah, it's mostly just reddit.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.310
Speaking of which...

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.630
## "Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized
horses or 1 horse-sized duck?" techtakular,

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.010
Alex, va

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.290
One horse-sized duck. The cube-squared law
means the legs of a horse-sized duck probably

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.459
wouldn't be structually sound. Easy fight.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.440
## "Are there going to be more "politics in
the animal kingdom" videos?" Oli

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.170
Yes, I'm sorry, I know this playlist is unfinished
and, if any of the videos videos I've ever

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.220
made can be said to be important, it's these.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.250
I promise at least one more about the single
transferable vote, but I don't make any promises

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.360
about when that will happen.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.459
## "Do you think third parties will ever gain
ground in the United States?" Kerl, Florida

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:56.730
No.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.849
The problem isn't politics or voter apathy,
it's the system that creates the politics

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:01.599
and voter apathy.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.520
The US election system is pretty much the
worst in the civilized world -- often voting

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.020
for a 3rd party isn't just a waste it's also
a vote *against* your own best interests.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.100
3rd parties really can't thrive under those
conditions.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.660
## "What's one technology you wish to see
before you die?" zigonick, MO, USA

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.489
Immortality technology.

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.510
## Where do you get your ideas?

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.510
It's been my experience that creative projects
are self-sustaining. The more you write, the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.950
more things you want to write about and the
more you program the more programming ideas

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.510
you have.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.129
For me each video spawns more videos. The
daylight saving one, for example, originally

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.269
contained spots for information about longitude
and time zones and the seasons that got cut

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.530
but will probably become their own videos
at some point.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.390
Also, I listen to a monstrous number of audiobooks
and podcasts. If you're interested, you can

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.790
see some of my favorites here. These help
me keep in touch with the wider world and

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.400
expose me to ideas and information that I
would not have come across on my own.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.890
## "If you could live at any time in history
when would it be?" Bonnie, Scotland

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.670
I wouldn't.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.690
Allow me to summarieze all of human existance
with this single graph.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.260
## "What's the best way be successful on YouTube?"
Joe Kowalski, 44074

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.930
Make videos people want to watch.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.440
I'm not trying to be glib here but when asked
this question I see many YouTubers talk about

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.959
the importance of upload schedules and managing
your social media and colloborations, and

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.430
my experience says that's completely backwards.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.129
If your videos aren't interesting, no one
will care that you upload them regularly.

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.830
And twitter followers don't get you views,
views get you twitter followers and people

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.380
who want to collaborate with you.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.900
I know it's not very helpful advice, but it's
the most truthful advice I can give.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.250
## "What is the most interesting fact you've
ever been told." Stu1278, England

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.750
It's difficult to pick just one from an entire
lifetime, but last year Veritasium visited

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.100
me in London and walked me thorugh the process
by which trees get water from their roots

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.060
to their leaves.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.680
That sounds really boring but it was one of
the most mind-blowing conversations I've had

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.340
in a long time.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.750
## "How often do you engage with profesionals
while you research?" theLarom, Washington,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.000
DC

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.630
For me, being confused and frustrated with
a topic is a vital part of figuring out how

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.570
to explain it to others so I'd say 95% of
research I do on my own.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.530
If I'm really out of my depth on a topic -- like
the debt video and the pope video -- I try

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.880
very hard to find an expert to look over the
final draft of my script but time constraints

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.590
and finding trustworthy experts is sometimes
a bit difficult.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.630
## "What is your favorite internal organ?"
trint99, DFW, TX

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.280
The Brain -- because it's the one that's me.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.020
## "Is there any part of science do you want
to be proven wrong?" Jrod N, Massacusetts

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.840
Yes, the current interpretations of the ultimate
fate of The Universe all make me sad.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.020
## "Can you answer 10 questions in under 30
seconds?" YouReadMeName

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.220
## 1: "What is your favorite scientific study
ever published?" Marie, Reno, NV

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.199
Unskilled Are Unaware: Further Explorations
of (Absent)

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.630
Self-Insight Among the Incompetent

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.370
Link in the description.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.810
## 2: "Hogwarts house?" Zeinoun Awad, Lebanon

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.530
Ravenclaw. (I'd hope)

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.729
## 3: "Celsius or Fahrenheit?" Kubez

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:18.979
Fahrenheit.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.750
##4: Kirk or Picard

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.000
Picard.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.470
## 5: "Do you wear glasses?" Spartacus McFancy
Pants

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.840
Uh, yeah.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.949
## 6: "Favorite empire?" Caleb Glickman, USA

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.310
The second one. Those monks were awesome.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.910
## 7: "How can a country be totally self sufficient
-- as in no imports or exports?" Amberjack1973

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.510
Simple, resort to a midevil level of technology.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.660
## 8: "Favourite sport?" soccernhlfan, Canada

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.910
No.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.720
## 9: "Should science play a bigger role in
politics?" Dip, London, UK

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.430
What, you mean the method by which we determine
truth? Yeah, I think it should.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.300
## 10: "Can you answer 10 questions in under
30 seconds?" YouReadMeName

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.759
Apparently.

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.669
Alright, thanks to everyone who submitted
questions -- it's been fun, Internet.
