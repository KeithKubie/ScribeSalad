00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.557
(cheerleaders talking over each other)

00:00:01.557 --> 00:00:04.871
- Jumps are the prettiest
thing that a cheerleader can do

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:08.110
and just one part can mess it up.

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.812
Once I throw her, I'm
just like, okay that's it.

00:00:10.812 --> 00:00:14.537
I'm not scared anymore, she's
already up there, I got it.

00:00:14.537 --> 00:00:17.966
Performing and taking a
test, it's all the same.

00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.474
I practice and practice and practice it,

00:00:20.474 --> 00:00:25.443
and I still don't feel as if
I got it, I practice more.

00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:28.186
I feel like there is no reason to go

00:00:28.186 --> 00:00:29.921
if you're not going to give it your all.

00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:31.648
I love it when the girls get so frustrated

00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:33.272
to the point where they're
mad at theirselves.

00:00:33.272 --> 00:00:36.008
Like I just want to walk
away, like it's all too much.

00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:37.195
But then it's like no, no, no, no,

00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:39.063
you can't quit, like I'm
not gonna let you give up

00:00:39.063 --> 00:00:40.809
because you didn't let me give up.

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.769
There's always more that you
can do, there's always better.

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:45.313
It's a rush at the same time,

00:00:45.313 --> 00:00:47.787
it's just like you got
it, you remember this,

00:00:47.787 --> 00:00:49.810
you've done this before.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.624
Once we get it set,

00:00:51.624 --> 00:00:54.203
then I'm like okay, it's go time.

00:00:54.203 --> 00:00:57.953
(energetic electronic music)
