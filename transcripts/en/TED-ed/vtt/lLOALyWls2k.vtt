00:00:07.692 --> 00:00:12.652
You are the cargo director on the maiden
voyage of the S.S. Buoyant,

00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:15.402
and you've agreed to transport
several tanks containing

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:19.451
the last specimens of a critically
endangered fish species

00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:22.122
to their new aquarium.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:25.941
Unfortunately, as you're passing
through shark-infested waters,

00:00:25.941 --> 00:00:32.732
the boat is battered by a fierce storm,
throwing your precious cargo overboard.

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:34.040
And to make matters worse,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.679
no one seems certain
just how many fish tanks are missing.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.901
Fortunately, you have a rescue sub
at your disposal,

00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:47.492
but only enough fuel for one trip
to the ocean floor.

00:00:47.492 --> 00:00:49.724
You need to know where the tanks are

00:00:49.724 --> 00:00:53.858
so you can gather them all
in one quick pass.

00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:57.012
Not a single fish can be lost.

00:00:57.012 --> 00:01:00.502
You decide to scan the three sectors
of the ocean floor

00:01:00.502 --> 00:01:03.369
where the cargo could have landed.

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.289
Thermal imaging shows 50 organisms
in the area,

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:11.240
and you quickly realize that that number
includes both your fish

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.982
and some ravenous sharks.

00:01:13.982 --> 00:01:17.520
You flip on the sonar 
to get a better look.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.840
The image for Sector Alpha shows
four tanks and two sharks,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.740
the image for Sector Beta shows
two tanks and four sharks,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.940
and the image for Sector Gamma
is blank.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.389
Your sonar has malfunctioned,

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:38.150
and you're going to have to go
with the info you have.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.560
You check the shipping notes,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.811
but all you learn is that each tank
had the same number of fish inside.

00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:50.982
The cargo hold had space for anywhere
from 1 to 13 total tanks.

00:01:50.982 --> 00:01:55.591
And finally, the old captain tells you
that this area has the odd property

00:01:55.591 --> 00:02:00.322
that no two sectors can have the same
number of sharks,

00:02:00.322 --> 00:02:03.233
but every sector will have at least one,

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:06.192
and no more than seven.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.723
There's no time to waste.

00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:12.132
The tanks won't withstand the pressure
much longer.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:16.012
As you descend in the sub,
you review everything you know.

00:02:16.012 --> 00:02:19.703
How many fish tanks do you need
to find in Sector Gamma?

00:02:19.703 --> 00:02:23.454
Hurry, the fate of an entire species
depends on you.

00:02:23.454 --> 00:02:26.975
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself.

00:02:26.975 --> 00:02:28.873
Answer in: 3

00:02:28.873 --> 00:02:30.322
Answer in: 2

00:02:30.322 --> 00:02:32.294
Answer in: 1

00:02:32.294 --> 00:02:36.585
At first, it seems like there are just
too many missing pieces of information.

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:40.664
After all, you don't know how many fish
or how many tanks there are,

00:02:40.664 --> 00:02:44.694
let alone how many fish are in each one.

00:02:44.694 --> 00:02:46.390
But then you remember the best way

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.775
to compare multiple pieces 
of partial information - a table.

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:54.536
Since we know there are thirteen
tanks at most,

00:02:54.536 --> 00:02:58.335
and we already see six tanks
in Sectors Alpha and Beta,

00:02:58.335 --> 00:03:03.716
we know the total number of tanks
must be between 6 and 13.

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:07.525
We also know that each sector has 
a different amount of sharks

00:03:07.525 --> 00:03:10.565
with no more than seven in each one.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:15.016
Since there are two in Sector Alpha
and four in Sector Beta,

00:03:15.016 --> 00:03:21.065
Sector Gamma can have 
1, 3, 5, 6, or 7 sharks.

00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:23.915
What about the number of endangered fish?

00:03:23.915 --> 00:03:27.687
Out of the 50 total organisms
in all three sectors,

00:03:27.687 --> 00:03:30.476
we know at least seven are sharks,

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:34.766
leaving a maximum of 43 fish
inside all the tanks.

00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:41.326
And the more sharks we find in Sector 3,
the fewer fish there are to save.

00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:45.876
Now, remember that the fish are
equally distributed across all the tanks.

00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:47.588
Why is that important?

00:03:47.588 --> 00:03:51.849
Because it means that one of the possible
values for the total amount of fish

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:58.188
must be divisible by one of the possible
values for the total amount of tanks.

00:03:58.188 --> 00:04:02.118
And looking at the table, we can see
that the only combination that works

00:04:02.118 --> 00:04:09.968
is 39 fish divided between 13 tanks
with three fish in each.

00:04:09.968 --> 00:04:11.968
With sharks swarming around,

00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:14.769
you quickly pilot the sub through
the first two sectors

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.179
before retrieving the remaining
seven tanks in Sector Gamma.

00:04:19.179 --> 00:04:23.022
You've saved the species
and taken an impromptu dive.

00:04:23.022 --> 00:04:27.480
All in all, not a bad day,
unless you happen to be a hungry shark.
