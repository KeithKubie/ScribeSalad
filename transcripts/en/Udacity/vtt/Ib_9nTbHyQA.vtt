#HOLOYOLO and #MaterialYOLO have
both been used to praise and

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.920
ridicule Android design.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.670
So, what's the deal with them?

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.310
Much like the New York City skyline,

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.900
design in Android didn't come out fully
formed, but slowly built over time.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.550
In the beginning, there were years of
desolation where Android users had to

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.450
wait a long time for first party apps.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.900
And when they finally did come,
in many cases,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.340
they were exact ports
of the iOS versions.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.450
This all changed with the release
of Android 3.0 Honeycomb and

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.810
its HOLO theme.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.910
The HOLO theme and
its refinements continued to flourish

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.295
in Ice Cream Sandwich,
Jelly Bean, and Kit Kat.

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:43.190
HOLOYOLO became a rallying call from
the users that expected the apps

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.480
they use to look like Android.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.380
Sometimes, before the next
version was out of beta.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.910
No longer could you say
that Android users and

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.500
developers don't care about design.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.145
With the release of
Android 5.0 Lollipop,

00:00:57.145 --> 00:01:00.140
#HOLOYOLO gave way to #MaterialYOLO.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.240
We learned in this course we really
shouldn't use the material theme if we

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.740
want to make our apps
backward compatible.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.854
If anything,
we should say #AppCompatYOLO.

00:01:08.854 --> 00:01:09.579
You know?
