actually kind of fits perfectly into the
 

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:27.400
actually kind of fits perfectly into the
PVC pipe so I didn't have to do anything

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:27.410
PVC pipe so I didn't have to do anything
 

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.139
PVC pipe so I didn't have to do anything
major to assemble it all of it is just

00:10:39.709 --> 00:10:43.269
place but other than that that's it you
know it's a it's a close enough mock-up

00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279
know it's a it's a close enough mock-up
