00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.170
&gt;&gt; So the question is whether India can become
a superpower.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:11.450
I think, and I do think, yes.
We have everything going for India, both in

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.529
terms of a strong mandate
with a strong government in the near term,

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:24.140
the demographics, the
democracy, the language skills sets, the innovation,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.970
the service
provider of most of the developed world.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.890
I think what will hold us back will be our
weakness in implementation,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:44.239
our deadlocked democracy, if not educated,
will turn back on us, which

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.890
is something we need to clearly focus on.
Education, health care, all these critical

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:58.190
if not dealt with and kept
to the last, will turn India into less of

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.410
a superpower than it can be.
Otherwise, I would say as far as I'm concerned,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.509
if things work out, and
the level of optimism can be kept to a [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.549
certainly, most
certainly.
