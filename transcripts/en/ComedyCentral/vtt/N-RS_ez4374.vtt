00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.402
I love when my mom has about
two drinks,

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:04.204
because she really--
it's the first time

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:09.009
I see her really acknowledge
that she's a cute lady.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.377
Yeah

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:13.247
She'll just have a little bit
more confidence

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.816
and its nice to see.
And I miss that.

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:17.484
Rayna loves it when I get drunk.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:18.719
She does?

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.120
Well, there was a time

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.889
where if I wasn't working
on a Friday night

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:23.690
I'd have a beer
and we'd play poker.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.792
And it was so fun to her
that she'd be like,

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.928
-"Are you having a beer are you
gonna drink a beer?"
 

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:29.630
-Oh my gosh
-"Are you going to have a beer?"

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:31.965
Rayna is how old?

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:33.333
She's 11.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:37.404
Yeah, so she's like, "What's
it going to do to you, Mom?"

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:38.739
Like it's going to change you.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.875
Well that's actually a really
good understanding of alcohol.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.777
It's not like just this beverage
you just drink

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.145
because you're thirsty.

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:48.081
But it's something that's going
to make you a different person.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.884
And so she's kind of
acknowledging, she's like,

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.986
"Mom are you
disassociating yet?"

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.593
When Rayna was really little
and I would take her to shows,

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:03.063
I would warn her about
the dangers of drunk women,

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:07.100
because she'd be like two years
old sort of standing there

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.802
at the end of the night
and they'd be like,

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.837
"Oh my God, you're so cute."

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:12.873
And want to pick her up
and you--

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:14.107
The dangers of drunk women.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:16.176
All teetery on their high
heeled shoes.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.578
So I told her,
"They could fall on you.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.080
You have to stay away
from them."

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.016
That is such a good metaphor
for what they do.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.318
They'll fall on you.

00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:26.320
They do, they fall on you.

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.725
I don't know how that turned
into me doing 'Drunk Mom.'

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:33.427
I started doing impressions
of Drunk Mom.

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:34.761
She'd always want to play it.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.730
She'd be like, "Do Drunk Mom.
Do Drunk Mom."

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.299
So I'd be like, "Get over here
little girl," and...

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:42.002
That's so fun.

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:44.638
And then, when she started
going to school, I was like,

00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:46.940
"Oh, shi--," one time,
a teacher told me, they go,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.276
"I know everything
that goes on in your house,"

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:52.579
because Rayna just babbles
I guess.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.515
So then I was like, "What if she
finds out about Drunk Mom?"

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:59.419
Like, "My mom and I play this
game where she's super drunk."

00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:01.355
So then I had--

00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:02.589
Even if she told the truth,

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:05.325
where she pretends to be drunk,
it's like,

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:08.328
"Oh, sounds like Mom's
covering up some abuse."

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:10.197
Yeah. Because moms are always

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:11.865
walking around
doing impressions.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:15.035
And so then I sat her down
and I was like,

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:18.105
"You can't tell anyone
about Drunk Mom."

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:19.906
Because I think
secrets are healthy.

00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:24.544
It was like a weird--

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:27.914
I'm surprised I have her
this long, to be honest.

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:31.218
Rayna is eleven. When did--
did she believe in Santa?

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:34.454
Well she-- oh my God.

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:36.256
What's happening with Santa?

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:39.226
I thought, I think this was
two years ago,

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:42.629
I thought that she was just
playing me with the Santa thing,

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.331
so--

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.634
As in she believes in Santa
and you thought

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:49.236
"Oh yeah, Santa."

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:51.071
I thought she was pretending
to believe in Santa

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:53.006
to get an extra present.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:59.780
And then, this is between
Thanksgiving and Christmas,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.683
her tooth fell out and I forgot
to put money under her pillow.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.986
So I just said to her--

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:08.055
she goes, "The Tooth Fairy
didn't leave money,"

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:09.389
and I was like,
"You know what,

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.625
I'm gonna tell you
two things right now."

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:13.860
I was just going to pull
the Band-Aid off.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.195
Right before Christmas?

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.197
Yeah. I was just gonna let it--
I just thought she knew already.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.465
And she just lost a tooth?

00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:19.699
That's the thing, yeah.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.001
She just lost a tooth.
It is, yeah.

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.470
That's when the Band-Aid
comes off for most kids I think,

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.139
is that their parent forgets
to put money under the thing,

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.908
and you're like,
"I'm toothless,

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:30.377
I just lost
two of my favorite people."

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.612
It's your first sense of death.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.981
It really is.

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:40.220
Well, by the way, the money
thing I was always forgetting

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.389
and just taking from
her piggy bank anyway.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.659
I'd be like, "I"m not gonna go
to the ATM tonight,"

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.295
hoping she didn't keep track.

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:52.065
"I just counted this yesterday,
and it's $2.50 short."

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:55.535
So I said, "The Tooth Fairy's
not real,"

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:59.706
and I could see that thing
go across her face

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.141
where she was like,

00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:03.743
"What?" and then,
"Oh, that makes perfect sense."

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:06.413
That kind of,
"Why didn't I know that sooner?"

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.715
And I go, "Wait did you know
that?" and she goes, "Yeah."

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:12.619
But you could tell
that she didn't know it.

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:13.954
So then I had to tell her,
she goes,

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:15.188
"What's the second thing?"

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:17.791
And I didn't-- I just said,
"I'm not your real mom."

00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:23.296
I was quick on my feet.

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:25.432
Oh man.
Tom, when did you realize?

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:26.766
Do you remember
when you found out?

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.001
I think it was a slow drip.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.237
But I do remember the
Tooth Fairy thing came first,

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:31.471
where I was like--

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.106
because you know,
my mom worked nights.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.475
She didn't have time think
about that shit.

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.612
So yeah, sometimes I would
wake up and I would be like,

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:41.114
"There's no--"
and I realized slowly

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.985
that I had to tell her my tooth
was lost for it to work.

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:49.055
And we were losing teeth
left and right, permanent ones.

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:53.293
So yeah, I just noticed.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:56.496
"I put fifteen teeth under
my pillow and I got nothing."

00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:02.135
Yeah, I think I remember
how old I was.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.804
I had an inkling
that he wasn't real,

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:07.107
but I just wanted to believe
it for my sister's sake.

00:05:07.107 --> 00:05:09.109
She's a year
and a half younger than me.

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:11.778
So I was in fifth grade,

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:15.916
and listen,
it was already very--

00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:17.784
I knew.
I was a smart kid.

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:22.255
I didn't want to have
that talk with my parents.

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:23.957
That was gonna be awkward.

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:26.560
So I was keeping it going,
and I also--

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.195
It's weird. It's confrontational
a little bit.

00:05:28.195 --> 00:05:29.596
Like, "Hey, look.
I know you've been fucking

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:30.797
lying to me.

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:32.065
Yes. That was it.

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:33.533
And I didn't want
to have that conversation.

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:37.103
Yet I remember one time
asking my dad,

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:39.439
"Is he real?
Just tell me, is he real?

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:40.640
Just be honest with me."

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.843
You got him by his collars,
shaking him. Tell me the truth.

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:44.077
Yeah, "You tell me, God dammit!"

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:45.679
Slapping him--

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:49.616
You're following some conspiracy
theory down a rabbit hole

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:50.984
You've got news clippings
on the wall

00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:52.786
Red yarn connecting

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:55.855
This is the thing that--
the movies,

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:57.724
I feel like
I was watching

00:05:57.724 --> 00:06:01.895
when Rayna was maybe
four or five, I was like,

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:03.630
"Is she not getting that
every single movie

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.365
is about the parents
not believing."

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.200
Like, "You've got to believe."

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.602
That's the propaganda.

00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:09.803
If he was real,
there wouldn't be any,

00:06:09.803 --> 00:06:12.706
"Hey, do you believe
or don't you believe?"

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:14.541
No, no, no, no, no. I disagree.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.977
I think that all those movies
are propaganda

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:19.179
to get you to believe again.
Because it's gonna say,

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:23.516
"Listen, adults don't believe,
but that's broken adults."

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:28.521
And most adults aren't broken.
And those who are good people,

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:31.958
and haven't been hardened
by the real world--

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.193
Maybe Santa is real.

00:06:33.193 --> 00:06:34.628
Santa could be real.

00:06:34.628 --> 00:06:35.862
I love how she's
got on her wall,

00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:38.365
that homeland wall,
with all of these--

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.668
No, my dad went
to such elaborate--

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:45.005
I remember one time, and I was
probably in third grade.

00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:46.406
He was watching
National Geographic

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:50.610
and there was some expedition
in the North Pole.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.679
Not even in the North Pole,
it was just in a tundra.

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:55.882
And there were people
I remember snow shoeing through.

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:57.317
And I remember
my dad was like,

00:06:57.317 --> 00:06:58.852
"Nikki, come here
and watch this."

00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:02.222
And I'm a kid. And he goes,
"They're looking for Santa.

00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:03.623
This is an expedition
to look--"

00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:06.359
and if I would've watched it
for more than five minutes,

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:07.961
I would've figured out
that he was lying

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:09.596
and I would've known
Santa wasn't real then,

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:12.165
but I just bought it.
So he sold me a lot of things.

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:15.101
There was National Geographic,
they were looking for Santa.

00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:18.405
Scientifically, it made sense
for me to believe.

00:07:18.405 --> 00:07:21.374
And my sister, the day I found
out Santa wasn't real,

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:23.777
my sister came home
from third grade.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.979
And my mom was at the sewing
machine in our living room,

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:27.681
and I was on the couch.
And my sister just came in

00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:29.449
and threw her backpack
down on the couch and was like,

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.785
"I know Santa isn't real.
Our teacher told us."

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:34.254
Yes. Mrs. Wright.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.825
Third grade teacher
couldn't believe

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:42.762
that the kids
she was teaching didn't know

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:45.465
Santa wasn't--
because half of the class knew.

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.634
So she had them
raise their hands like,

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:48.902
"Who doesn't
believe in Santa."

00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:50.603
And all the kids
raise their hand.

00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:53.840
Or she snapped at one kid
and was like,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.442
"You believe in Santa?"

00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:56.943
I just remember the quote

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:58.411
that all of the parents
called about was,

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:02.615
"Well I'm sorry to burst your
bubble, but Santa isn't real."

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:04.184
And I just remember
"burst your bubble."

00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:06.753
That was just the--
that's what it felt like.

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:08.855
It was like my bubble burst.

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:10.757
Because my sister walked in,
threw down her backpack,

00:08:10.757 --> 00:08:13.760
and said, "I knew Santa's real."
And my mom was like, "Okay.

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:17.097
Alright. Well.
Then now you know."

00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:18.331
Just took it.

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.800
And I was so mad because
I'm like, "That's all it took?"

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.336
Because I begged my dad.
I was like, "Is he real?"

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:26.005
And I remember my dad's foot
was shaking wildly.

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:28.041
Because he was just like--

00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.377
I could tell her right now
or I couldn't.

00:08:30.377 --> 00:08:32.579
He got this nervous
foot thing that I was like,

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:33.847
"I know he's lying."

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:36.182
And I believed for way too long.

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.818
I was just--
and I believed in UFOs.

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:40.253
And now I don't believe
in anything.

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:41.554
You don't believe in UFOs?

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:43.323
I don't believe in aliens.
I don't believe in ghosts.

00:08:43.323 --> 00:08:44.591
Me either.

00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:45.992
You don't believe in aliens?

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:47.227
No.

00:08:47.227 --> 00:08:50.563
If I did, I would be scared
all of the time.

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:52.632
So I can't believe in ghosts.

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:56.069
I think ghosts might be real,
but if I accept that they are,

00:08:56.069 --> 00:09:00.206
then I will be terrified
any time I'm alone in any room.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.242
So my body can't handle
the stress

00:09:02.242 --> 00:09:05.045
that there's a world
where there are ghosts.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.579
Haven't you been in alone
and scared of it.

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:09.716
Like, "Make yourself known.
Just do it."

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:11.851
I kind of like it. I don't know.
I like the idea.

00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:13.586
Sometimes I do feel lonely
and I'm like,

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:15.522
"I wish this hotel room
were haunted.

00:09:15.522 --> 00:09:17.290
It would be-- there have been
times in the room

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.560
where I legit feel lonely enough
that I would enjoy a haunting.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.930
Yeah. My family believes
it so hard.

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:25.765
They were telling me ghost stories

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.267
about my grandma's house
this week.

00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:30.236
They were like--
I never heard my brother say

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.771
That's the house
that's very haunted, right?

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:35.241
Yeah. There's a girl who died
of polio in the garage--

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.676
not the garage,
the attic or whatever.

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:38.244
Oh, polio does leave ghosts.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:39.846
That's the one thing.
That's the only one.

00:09:39.846 --> 00:09:41.514
That's why you don't see
as many anymore

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:43.383
is that they got rid of polio

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:44.684
Because the polio people
are rich.

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:47.821
They all ride on horses--

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:53.493
Now there's polo deaths, and you
haunt if you're a polo death.

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:54.894
Yeah.

00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:57.063
So tell me about what's going on
at your grandma's house now.

00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:58.698
What recent stories
have people told?

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:02.168
The story that I heard is that--
there's no recent--

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:04.304
that's why I have
trouble believing it.

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:06.639
We're going over ones that have
happened over the years.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:07.841
These are old.

00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:10.777
And my brother,
I saw my older brother this week

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.045
and I hadn't seen him
in a while,

00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:14.647
and he was confirming
all of these stories

00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:17.851
that my mom had told me before.
But also I remember as a kid,

00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:19.552
hearing stomping coming
from the ceiling.

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:20.787
But part of me is like,

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.789
"Maybe they just had
a guy living up there

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:25.492
because of the rent
to save money or something."

00:10:25.492 --> 00:10:28.061
Or you were being haunted
by a musical.

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:31.064
Like Stomp.

00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:33.666
I heard a garbage can being
played very beautifully.

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:37.070
It's very melodic.

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:40.206
Yeah, that is interesting.

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:43.176
There are things you perceive
as a child with your child brain

00:10:43.176 --> 00:10:45.378
that you can't make
sense of at the time,

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:47.947
so you project ghosts onto it.

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:50.650
Yeah.
I don't know, because--

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.585
Like my ghost uncle molested me.

00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:56.489
That is the thing
where it's like--

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.458
I had a memory of three men

00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:01.628
appearing in my other grandma's,
my stepdad's mom's room.

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:04.397
I feel weird since that's
usually such a trashy statement:

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:06.099
"my stepdad's mom."

00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:09.669
Saying, "Oh, my stepdad's mom."

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.739
My stepdad's mom's boyfriend
sounds weirder.

00:11:12.739 --> 00:11:14.374
Because my grandma
used to have a boyfriend.

00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:17.443
It was always so weird for me
to say "my grandma's boyfriend."

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:20.113
You just feel like,
what is that?

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:23.049
But I remember three men
appearing in a room.

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:25.785
And I think, maybe she just
got gang banged one night

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:29.455
and it was like,
"Oh those were ghosts.

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:31.391
That's why you heard
all that moaning."

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:37.196
Yeah. Bonnie, have you
ever seen a ghost?

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:38.431
No.

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:41.968
But I think some people
are more in tune with that.

00:11:41.968 --> 00:11:43.536
I don't think
I'm one of those people.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:47.040
I think I'm so grateful that
I'm not one of those people.

00:11:47.607 --> 00:11:52.045
But aliens, the threat
of being abducted as a child

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:57.984
was just always with me.
Every time it got dark.

00:11:57.984 --> 00:11:59.686
It means you were abducted.

00:11:59.686 --> 00:12:00.920
A beam of light.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.155
They probably have you.

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:04.390
You are probably
getting abducted

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.259
every six to eight months.

00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:08.094
They erase your brain.

00:12:08.094 --> 00:12:09.929
I would love to be abducted
right now.

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:11.464
Do you have little marks
on your body

00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:13.900
that you don't know
what they're from?

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.368
No, but I don't want them
to torture me.

00:12:15.368 --> 00:12:17.570
Like after a good night's sleep
and be still super tired?

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.871
Wait, yes.

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:20.106
Oh my God.

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:21.307
It explains it.

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:23.009
Is this all

00:12:23.009 --> 00:12:24.744
I was always scared
of the Men in Black.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.113
And I found out about them
before that movie

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:30.383
because I was obsessed with UFOs
and all this stuff

00:12:30.383 --> 00:12:32.485
and when they come
and get you to keep you

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:33.786
quiet about a photograph
that you took.

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:35.455
That's based on a real thing?

00:12:35.455 --> 00:12:37.523
Yeah. My aunt originally told me
the Men in Black

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:39.192
chased down her brother

00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:41.160
because he took
the closest picture of a UFO

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.096
ever taken in Indiana

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.797
with her little
Girl Scout camera.

00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:46.599
It was in the 70s.
And he took a picture

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.901
and the men in black
showed up at their door

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:51.170
to be like,
"Where's the photograph?"

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.039
And chased them down
on a highway,

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:54.874
and they looked inside the car
at one point

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:58.244
that was chasing them,
and there was nothing inside it.

00:12:59.412 --> 00:13:01.681
So these stories are family
stories that I heard--

00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:03.349
I heard these as a kid
and I'm like, "Oh my gosh.

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:05.184
There's men that will show up
and chase you

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:06.419
if you've seen a UFO?"

00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:08.955
So I didn't want to see one
because I don't want this--

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:11.357
I don't want a hit out on me.
I was terrified.

00:13:11.357 --> 00:13:12.625
Right. Man, that's crazy.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:15.228
It feels like aliens
are so obsessed with Indiana.

00:13:16.496 --> 00:13:18.197
There's all kinds
of sightings there.

00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:19.399
They must love basketball.

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:20.233
They do.
