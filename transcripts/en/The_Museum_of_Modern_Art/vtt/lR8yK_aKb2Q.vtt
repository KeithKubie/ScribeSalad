00:00:06.168 --> 00:00:10.179
Relief printmaking, the
first print process invented

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.453
had its origins in seals
in China around 255 B.C.

00:00:15.453 --> 00:00:18.567
If you think of relief
printmaking as a stamp,

00:00:18.567 --> 00:00:20.315
which is a very basic transfer of an image

00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:21.859
from one surface to another.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.817
That is the initial concept
of relief printmaking.

00:00:24.817 --> 00:00:27.095
The image area is raised,

00:00:27.095 --> 00:00:29.111
whereas the non-image area is lowered.

00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:31.651
So if you think of a plank of wood

00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:33.650
and you carve away the white areas,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.566
what is raised would
become the image area.

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:41.984
One of the modern inventions, linoleum,

00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:44.984
for what we call a
linocut or linoleum cut,

00:00:44.984 --> 00:00:46.902
provided artists with the opportunity

00:00:46.902 --> 00:00:51.726
of working on the material in
a way that was new and unique.

00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:54.901
Relief printmaking, as the
earliest form of printmaking,

00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:57.566
is still the most accessible
form of printmaking.

00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.738
Because a press is not
required to transfer the image

00:01:00.738 --> 00:01:03.984
from the block to paper, it allows artists

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:05.939
just about anywhere in the world

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.316
who have access to a
small amount of materials,

00:01:08.316 --> 00:01:10.008
whether they be wood or linoleum,

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:14.446
and a small amount of ink, to
be able to create an image.

00:01:14.446 --> 00:01:17.150
Artists like relief printmaking
because it affords them

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.736
the opportunity to have a
very direct low-tech way

00:01:20.736 --> 00:01:23.719
of working to produce bold graphic images

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.292
with strong blacks as well
as fine detailed lines.

00:01:27.292 --> 00:01:30.260
Its accessibility allows for a variety of

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.432
marks and sensibilities, both
abstract and representational,

00:01:33.432 --> 00:01:38.036
both things that involve
text as well as images.
