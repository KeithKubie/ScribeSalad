00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.870
Winter is coming - and we've all been told to put on a jacket outside, or you'll catch

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.090
a cold! Of course, the common response of today has become 'Don't be silly, being cold

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.930
can't give you a cold'. Or can it? Who wins in this battle of the beliefs?

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.689
The correlation between cold weather and sickness does stand out. Between 5-20% of Americans

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.359
catch a cold or flu every year around late fall and winter. Not to mention, it's called

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.679
a cold. But there are some important things to consider. First and foremost: colds and

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.140
the flu are caused by viruses. if there aren't any around, you won't catch a cold - no matter

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.520
how cold you get. It's as simple as that.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.859
So why the correlation with decreasing temperatures? Well for one, people tend to stay indoors

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.230
much more often during the winter, which in turn, puts them in contact with more people.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.109
More people, means more exposure opportunities for the pathogens to spread. On top of this,

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.340
humidity plays a role in the spread of some viruses. As the humidity decreases in the

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.179
winter, not only does the virus spread more readily, but the mucus in your nose dries

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:00.230
out. Mucus would otherwise act as a protective barrier to pathogens. Finnaly,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.759
the lack of Vitamin D which we get from the sun, can affect  our immune system adversely.

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.140
Both being inside more often, and the fact that winter has shorter days makes this a

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.740
big factor for your health.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.250
So you've proven your parents wrong... right? Not so fast!

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.930
While some past studies have shown no correlation to temperature, recent evidence suggest otherwise.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.020
One study which put test subjects feet into ice water found that they were, indeed, more

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.189
likely to develop common cold symptoms in the following days, than those who didn't.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.229
The developing hypothesis behind these results is that the cold temperatures cause blood vessel

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.180
constriction, which slows the white blood cells from reaching the virus, ultimately

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.590
inhibiting the immune response. Cortisol levels, which pressures the immune system, are also

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.670
increased with temperature induced stress. Furthermore, studies on both mice and human

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.939
airway cells found that immune reaction to the common cold virus, in fact, temperature

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.509
dependent. Warm infected cells are more likely to undergo programmed cell death, to limit

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.840
the spread of infection.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.450
Finally, studies of the virus itself have revealed a secret weapon of sorts. In winter temperature,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.130
the virus's outer layer or envelope becomes much harder and acts like a shield.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.450
This allows it to spread from person to person much more easily. But at warm temperatures,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.229
this layer is more of a gel, which is not quite tough enough to protect the virus against

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.599
the elements. As a result, its spreading ability is compromised.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.090
So, maybe your parents weren't so wrong after all. A happy compromise of going outside

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.870
more often, bundled up, is likely to get you through the winter unscathed.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.349
New to AsapSCIENCE? We've put together a couple playlists to make watching our videos a little

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.090
easier. The first is a mix of our favorite and most popular videos, and the other contains

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.760
every single AsapSCIENCE video in a row, because why not. Also make sure you're following us

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.790
on Facebook, Twitter, G+, Tumblr, Instagram, Vine and any other social media you can think of.
