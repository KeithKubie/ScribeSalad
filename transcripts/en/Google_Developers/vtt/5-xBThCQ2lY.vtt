00:00:01.535 --> 00:00:04.425
I'm IldikÃ³ Fekete, mother of two.

00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:07.435
I graduated as a literature teacher,
but I'm a coder now.

00:00:07.435 --> 00:00:10.115
I was expecting my first child
when complications arose

00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:13.155
and my doctor advised me

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.000
to stay at home for the rest of my pregnancy.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.400
I decided to quit my job,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.500
but I didn't want to sit at home doing nothing.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.300
Then, my husband and I had to move for his job.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We faced a lot of new challenges
during this time.

00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:33.000
That's when I realised I could never
go back to my old job.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.400
It was through an internet search
that I found this opportunity

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.200
to be sponsored by Google

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.000
to study via the Udacity website.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.000
It sounded perfect for me

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.000
and I signed up.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.300
We learned how to build apps
for Android devices,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.225
how to create the layout
and code in Java.

00:00:52.705 --> 00:00:57.300
I really enjoyed the support
provided through the Udacity online course.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.900
I have created the GreenFeet app 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.900
which can calculate our carbon footprints.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.000
After my children were born, I noticed how

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.400
much more rubbish we were producing.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.800
I didn't think I'd ever be able
to create my own app,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
one that's connected
to protecting the environment,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.025
one that really matters
and can impact other peoples' lives.

00:01:22.075 --> 00:01:27.000
I think programming
gives us the opportunity to be creative.

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:31.500
Being a "coding mum" is difficult but amazing.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I'm confident that getting certified
through Udacity's online courses

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.895
will make it easier for me to find work
that's compatible with my life as a mum.
