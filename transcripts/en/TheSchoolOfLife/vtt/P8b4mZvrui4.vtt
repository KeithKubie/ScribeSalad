00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:08.300
In our societies we use the word "success" a lot

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.620
and we think we know just what it means: money, status, fame, and power.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.820
But take a look in the dictionary and things start to look, thankfully, a lot more complicated.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:26.460
Because success is, in truth, rather more neutral and less value-laden then we tend to assume.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.700
It just means doing anything well,  excelling at something

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.900
and that might encompass a lot of different activity:

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.960
running 100 meters, for sure, selling your app for a lot of money, okay,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.360
but also stranger, less heralded things like: listening a lot, very attentively, to a child,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.300
or being extremely kind to strangers, or filling your mind with interesting ideas and associations,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.560
or knowing just when to put  an arm around someone when it's too much for them.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.520
People who triumph here are also big success stories.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.920
No one can be successful at everything, whatever they tell us,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.320
it's almost impossible to succeed with a career and a family,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.580
or with popularity and integrity,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.980
there are always sacrifices.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.180
It's great to be successful.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.700
It's even better to make sure you followed your own distinctive and, not necessarily, always obvious path

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.860
to the success that can truly fulfill you.
