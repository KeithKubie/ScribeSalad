00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
focusing on this one woman I think that
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.399 align:start position:0%
focusing on this one woman I think that
her<00:01:53.159><c> comments</c><00:01:53.640><c> do</c><00:01:53.909><c> reveal</c><00:01:54.299><c> a</c><00:01:54.360><c> lot</c><00:01:54.570><c> about</c><00:01:54.840><c> the</c>

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's worth talking about bit I don't
 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.870 align:start position:0%
that's worth talking about bit I don't
