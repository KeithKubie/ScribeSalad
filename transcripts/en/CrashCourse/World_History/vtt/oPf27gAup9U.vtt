00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.779
Hi, I’m John Green; this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to learn

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:08.410
about the Roman Empire, which of course began
when two totally nonfictional twins, Romulus

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.530
and Remus, who’d been raised by wolves,
founded a city on seven hills.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.200
Mr Green, Mr Green, what… what does SPQR
stand for?

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.190
It means shut pie hole quickly, rapscallion.
No, it means Senātus Populusque Rōmānus,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.280
one of the mottos of the Roman Republic.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.580
So today we’re going to do some old school
Great Man History and focus on Julius Caesar

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.680
while trying to answer a question: When, if
ever, is it OK to stab someone 23 times?

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:40.640
[Theme Music]

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.200
Shakespeare answers that question by saying
that Roman senators killed Caesar because

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.860
he was going to destroy the Roman republic, but
even if that’s true, we still have to answer whether:

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.840
a. The Roman Republic was worth preserving,
and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.340
b. whether Caesar actually destroyed it.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.399
One of the things that made the Roman republic
endure, both in reality and in imagination

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.879
was its balance. According to the Greek historian
Polybius, "THE THREE kinds of government,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.940
monarchy, aristocracy and democracy, were
all found united in Rome. And… it was no easy

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.760
thing to determine with assurance, whether the entire
state was an aristocracy, a democracy, or a monarchy.”

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.660
At the heart of this blended system was the
Senate, a body of legislators chosen from

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.820
a group of elite families. (Rome was divided
into two broad classes: the Patricians – the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.479
small group of aristocratic families and the
Plebeians, basically everybody else. The Senators

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.900
were drawn from the Patricians.) The Senate
was a sort of a mixture of legislature and

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.330
giant advisory council. Their main job was
to set the policy for the Consuls.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.920
Each year the Senate would choose from among
its ranks 2 co-Consuls to serve as sort of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.030
the chief executives of Rome. There needed
to be two so they could check each other’s

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.009
ambition, and also so that one could, you
know, take care of Rome domestically, while

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.470
the other was off fighting wars, and conquering
new territory.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.040
There were two additional checks on power:
First, the one-year term. I mean, how much

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.729
trouble could you really do in a year, right?
Unless you’re the CEO of Netflix, I mean

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.979
he destroyed that company in like two weeks.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.790
And secondly, once a senator had served as
consul, he was forbidden to serve as consul

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.520
again for at least 10 years. Although that
went a little bit like you say you’re only

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.649
going to eat one Chipotle burrito per week,
and then there are a few exceptions, and then

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.440
all of a sudden you’re there every day, and YES,
I know guacamole is more, JUST GIVE IT TO ME!

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.040
But right, we were talking about the Romans.
The Romans also had a position of dictator,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.569
a person who would who’d take over in the
event the Republic was in imminent danger.

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.520
The paradigm for this selfless Roman ruler
was Cincinnatus, a general who came out of

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.340
comfortable retirement at his plantation,
took command of an army, defeated whatever

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.480
enemy he was battling, and then laid down
his command and returned to his farm, safe

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.810
in the knowledge that one day the second largest
city in Ohio would be named for him.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.950
If that model of leadership sounds familiar
to Americans by the way, it’s because George

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.860
Washington was heavily influenced by Cincinnatus
when he invented the idea of a two term president.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.120
So along comes Caesar. Gaius Ju- Gay-us? No
it’s Gaius, I know from Battlestar Galactica.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.910
Gaius Julius Caesar was born around 100 BCE
to one of Rome’s leading families. His birth

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.569
was somewhat miraculous, requiring a surgical
procedure that we know as Caesarian section.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.590
Coming as he did from the senatorial class,
it was natural that Caesar would serve in

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.580
both the army and the Senate, which he did.
He rose through the ranks, and after some

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.709
top-notch generalling, and a gig as the governor
of Spain, he decided to run for consul.

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.810
In order to win, Caesar needed financial help,
which he got from Crassus, one of Rome’s

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.879
richest men. Crassus ran a private fire company
whose business model was essentially, “Hey,

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.950
I notice your house is on fire. Give me some
money and I’ll help you out with that.”

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.349
Caesar succeeded in becoming consul in 59
BCE and thereafter sought to dominate Roman

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.180
politics by allying himself with Crassus and
also with Rome’s other most powerful man,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.220
the general Pompey. You’ll no doubt remember
Pompey from his fascination with Alexander

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.530
the Great. Pompey, Crassus, and Caesar were
the so-called first triumvirate, and the alliance

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.280
worked out super well, for Caesar. Not so
well for the other two. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.020
After a year as consul that included getting
the senate to pass laws largely because of

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.049
intimidation by Pompey’s troops, Caesar
landed the governorship of Gaul, at least

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.200
the southern part of Gaul that Rome controlled.
He quickly conquered the rest of Gaul and

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.659
his four loyal armies — or legions, as the
Romans called them — became his source of

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:12.059
power. Caesar continued his conquests, invading Britain
and waging another successful war against the Gauls.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.780
While he was away, Crassus died in battle
with the Parthians and Pompey, who had become

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.359
Caesar’s rival and enemy, was elected Consul.
Pompey and the Senate decided to try to strip

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.409
Caesar of his command and recall him to Rome.
If he returned to Rome without an army, Caesar

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:30.529
would have been prosecuted for corrupt consuling
and also probably exceeding his authority

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:35.449
as governor, so instead he returned with the
13th Legion.

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.240
He crossed the Rubicon River, famously saying,
“The die is cast” or possibly, “Let

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:44.210
the die be cast.” Sorry, Thought Bubble,
sources disagree. Basically, Caesar was invading

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.610
his own hometown. Pompey was in charge of
Rome’s army but like a boss fled the city,

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.930
and by 48 BCE Caesar was in total command
of all of Rome’s holdings, having been named

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.469
both dictator and consul.

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:00.610
Caesar set out to Egypt to track down Pompey
only to learn that he’d already been assassinated

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.629
by agents of the Pharaoh Ptolemy. Egypt had
its own civil war at the time, between the

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:10.509
Pharaoh and his sister/wife Cleopatra. Ptolemy
was trying to curry favor with Caesar by killing

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:17.349
his enemy, but Caesar was mad in that the-only-person-who-gets-to-tease-my-little-brother-is-me
kind of way, except with murder instead of

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:22.240
teasing. So Caesar sided with — and skoodilypooped
with — Cleopatra. Thank you, Thought Bubble.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.029
Cleopatra went on to become the last Pharaoh
of Ancient Egypt and bet on Marc “I am the

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:32.099
Wrong Horse” Antony instead of Emperor “There
is a Baby Attached to My Leg” Augustus.

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.580
But before all that, Caesar made his way back
from Egypt to Rome, stopping off to defeat

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.729
a few kings in the east, and was declared
dictator again. That position that was later

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.740
extended for ten years, and then for life.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:48.409
He was elected consul in 46 BCE and then again
in 45 BCE, this last time without a co-consul.

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.899
By 45 BCE Caesar was the undisputed master
of Rome and he pursued reforms that strengthened

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:57.809
his own power. He provided land pensions for
his soldiers, restructured the debts of a

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:02.129
huge percentage of Rome’s debtors, and also
changed the calendar to make it look more

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:03.729
like the one we use today.

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.719
But by 44 BCE, many Senators had decided that
Caesar controlled too much of the power in

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:12.839
Rome, and so they stabbed him 23 times on
the floor of the Roman senate. Caesar was

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:16.289
duly surprised about this and everything,
but he never said, “Et Tu, Brute” when

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.319
he realized Brutus was one of the co-conspirators.
That was an invention of Shakespeare.

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.360
The conspirators thought that the death of
Caesar would bring about the restoration of

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.490
the Republic, and they were wrong. For one
thing, Caesar’s reforms were really popular

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.499
with the Rome’s people, who were quick to
hail his adopted son Octavian, as well as

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:36.909
his second-in-command Mark “I am the Wrong
Horse” Antony and a dude named Lepidus,

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:38.899
as a second triumvirate.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:43.849
This triumvirate was an awesome failure, degenerating
into a second civil war. Octavian and Antony

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:48.289
fought it out. Antony, being the wrong horse,
lost. Octavian won, changed his name to Caesar

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:52.719
Augustus, became sole ruler of Rome, attached
a baby to his leg, adopted the title Emperor,

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:58.279
and started printing coins identifying himself
as Divini Filius: The Son of God. More on that next week.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.999
Although Augustus tried to pretend that the
forms of the Roman republic were still intact,

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:05.379
the truth was that he made the laws and the
Senate had become nothing more than a rubber

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:11.789
stamp. Which reminds me, it’s time for the
open letter.

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.800
Movie magic! An open letter to the Roman Senate.
Oh, but first, let’s see what’s in the

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:21.059
secret compartment. Ah, it’s a harmonica!
Stan, do you want me to play some old, Roman

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:35.640
folk songs? Very well. Stan, I just want to thank
you for doing such a good job of overdubbing there.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.640
Dear Roman Senate, Whether you were rubber
stamping the laws of Emperor Augustus, or

00:07:39.649 --> 00:07:45.529
stabbing Caesar on the floor of your sacred
hall, you were always doing something! I don’t

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:49.610
want to sound nostalgic for a time when people
lived to be 30, a tiny minority of adults

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:55.320
could vote, and the best fashion choice was
bed-sheets, but oh my god, at least you did something!

00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:59.539
Your senate was chosen from among the Patrician
class. Our senate here in the United States

00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:03.759
is chosen from among the obstructionist class.
But don’t get me wrong, Roman senate, you

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:06.459
were terrible. Best wishes, John Green.

00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:10.539
So did Caesar destroy the Republic? Well,
he started a series of civil wars, he seized

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:14.429
power for himself, he subverted the ideas
of the republic, he changed the constitution,

00:08:14.429 --> 00:08:19.259
but he’s only really to blame if he was
the first one to do that. And he wasn’t.

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:22.949
Take the general Marius, for instance, who
rose to power on the strength of his generalship

00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:28.059
and on his willingness to open up the army
to the poor, who were loyal to him personally,

00:08:28.059 --> 00:08:33.250
and not to Rome, and whom he promised land
in exchange for their good service in the

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.319
army. This of course required the Romans to
keep conquering new land so they could keep

00:08:37.319 --> 00:08:43.499
giving it to new legionnaires. Marius also
was consul 5 times in a row, 60 years before Caesar.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.680
Or look at the general Sulla who, like Marius,
ensured that his armies would be more loyal

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:53.720
to him personally than to Rome, but who marched
against Rome itself, and then became its dictator,

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.759
executing thousands of people in 81 BCE, 30
years before Caesar entered the scene.

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:02.860
There is another way of looking at this question
altogether if we dispense with great man history.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:07.440
Maybe Rome became an empire before it had
an emperor. Like, remember the Persian Empire?

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.589
You’ll recall that empire had some characteristics
that made it, imperial. Like a unified system

00:09:12.589 --> 00:09:17.040
of government, continual military expansion,
and a diversity of subject peoples.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.959
The Roman empire had all three of those characteristics
long before it became The Roman Empire. Like

00:09:21.959 --> 00:09:27.629
Rome started out as a city, and then it became
a city state, then a kingdom, and then a Republic,

00:09:27.629 --> 00:09:32.519
but that entire time, it was basically comprised
of the area around Rome.

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:37.319
By the 4th century BCE, Rome started to incorporate
its neighbors like the Latins and the Etruscans,

00:09:37.319 --> 00:09:41.060
and pretty soon they had all of Italy under
their control, but that’s not really diversity

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.110
of subject peoples. I mean, nothing personal,
Italians, but you have a lot of things in

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:46.920
common, like the constant gesticulations.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.790
If you want to talk about real expansion and
diversity, you’ve got to talk about the

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:54.060
Punic Wars. These were the wars that I remember,
primarily because they involved Hannibal crossing the

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:59.100
Alps with freaking war-elephants, which was probably
the last time that the elephants could have risen

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:04.320
up, and formed their awesome secret elephant
society with elephant planes and elephant cars.

00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:07.860
In the First Punic War, Rome wanted Sicily,
which was controlled by the Carthaginians.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.259
Rome won, which made Carthage cranky, so they
started the second Punic war. In 219 BCE,

00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:16.350
Hannibal attacked a Roman town and then led
an army across Spain, and then crossed the

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.319
freaking Alps with elephants.

00:10:18.319 --> 00:10:22.810
Hannibal and his elephant army almost won,
but alas, they didn’t, and as a result the

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:27.600
Romans got Spain. People in Spain are definitely
NOT Romans (despite Russell Crowe’s character

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.870
in Gladiator), which means that by 201 BCE
Rome was definitely an empire.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.689
The third Punic War was a formality – Rome
found some excuse to attack Carthage and then

00:10:36.689 --> 00:10:40.769
destroyed it so completely that these days
you can’t even find it on a map. Eventually

00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:44.939
this whole area, and a lot more, would be
incorporated into a system of provinces and

00:10:44.939 --> 00:10:48.149
millions of people would be ruled by the Roman
Empire.

00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:52.269
And it’s ridiculous to say that Rome was
a Republic until Augustus became Rome’s

00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:55.899
first official emperor, because by the time
he did that, Rome had been an empire for almost

00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:59.779
200 years. There's a reason I'm arguing that
the death of the Republic came long before

00:10:59.779 --> 00:11:03.319
Caesar and probably around the time that Rome
became an Empire.

00:11:03.319 --> 00:11:07.019
If anything destroyed the idea of Republican
Rome, it was the concentration of power into

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:11.240
the hands of one man. And this man was always
a general. I mean, you can’t march on Rome

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.250
without an army, after all. Why were there
such powerful generals? Because Rome had decided

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:19.990
to become an Empire, and empires need to expand
militarily. Particularly, the Roman empire

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:25.000
needed to expand militarily because it always
needed new land to give its retired legionnaires.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.490
That expansion created the all-powerful general
and the incorporation of diverse peoples made

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:35.060
it easier for them to be loyal to him, rather
