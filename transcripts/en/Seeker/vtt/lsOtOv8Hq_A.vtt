00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.620
Millions of years after the Big Bang, some
stars formed.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.800
These could've been the first stars that brought
light into the universe.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.230
These stars formed right after the “DARK
AGES”- which by the way is the time AFTER

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.940
the Big Bang but BEFORE there was any light,
where the universe was filled with just dark

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.090
gas.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.380
Astronomers found these very first stars by
using a radio telescope out in Western Australia.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.250
Radio telescopes are cool because they are
able to detect radio waves, which are the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.619
longest wavelength known to exist in our universe,
meaning it can detect stuff that’s traveled

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.910
great distances to get to us.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.690
Based on changes detected in the Cosmic Microwave
Background Radiation, astronomers were able

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.160
to create models SUGGESTING that 180 million
years after the Big Bang, these first stars

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.230
formed.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.300
This adds to previous research, and now we
are lead to believe that these first stars

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.810
were probably BLUE stars, and based on the
spectral classifications of stars we know

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.960
that blue stars hot, young, short-lived stars, that die naturally by a

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.240
supernova explosion or a collapse of its core
into a black hole.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.700
By using instruments at the Murchison Radio
Astronomy Observatory, astronomers picked

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.890
up dips in the frequency received from the
early universe, and THIS represents the moment

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.799
that stars first formed and began interacting
with the matter around them.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.569
Not only can this lead us into a better understanding
of our early universe, and its evolutionary

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:26.569
stages…

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:31.639
But according to the scientists, this could
possibly be the work of cold dark matter particles

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:36.049
pulling energy away from the hydrogen gas
and cooling it down.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.990
This is all speculation of course, since we
still don't have confirmation of dark matter

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.509
existing, BUT this new info could help!

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.810
So let’s see what more research there is
to come out of this finding... because early

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.560
universe understandings means getting closer
to finding the meaning of life.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.639
Greetings peeps!

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:54.149
Like learning about star stuff?

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.179
Check out this video Trace did on starquakes!

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.369
One last thing...

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.619
The data collected from this research came
from giant radio telescope antennas that are

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:10.560
not much different than those on your FM radio.
