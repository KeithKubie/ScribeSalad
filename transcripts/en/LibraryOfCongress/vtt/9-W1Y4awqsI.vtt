00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.400
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: I
wanted to welcome all

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.900
of you today to today's event.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.880 position:56%
This is our second Hispanic
Heritage Month Program for the year.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.250
We have a wonderful
listing of events

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.470
for Hispanic Heritage Month
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.880 position:56%
So I wanted to announce that we have
our complete calendar of events here

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.880
in the entrance of our room.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.920
It's an honor for me to
introduce our featured speaker,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.340
who happens to be also
my compatriot, my friend,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.260
and an artist that I admire deeply.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.460
Juana Medina is an illustrator
and author of children's books,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.500
as well as a teacher at
George Washington University.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.080
She grew up in Bogata,
Columbia and studied

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.640
at the Rhode Island
School of Design.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.840
Medina has -- was the first winner

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.470
of the J. Kennedy Memorial
Scholarship, an award given yearly

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.350
by the National Cartoonist Society

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.400
to top college cartoonists
in North America.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.020 position:56%
She is also the recipient of a
Marion Vannett Ridgeway Honor Award,

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.960
and [inaudible] 100
Columbians, an honor granted

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.150
to 100 successful Colombians
living abroad.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.440
Her books for children
include One Big Salad,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.660
A Delicious Counting Book, and
Smick, her latest picture book,

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.980
and then Juana and
Lucas, who is actually --

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.540
which is actually soon to
be published and we managed

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.070
to bring some copies
here for the event,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.680 position:56%
and it's published Candlewick Press.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.390
Juana and Lucas tells the story

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.480
of a young girl's decision
to learn English.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.160
All of her books are on sale
here today at the event,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.990
and I'm also very excited to
announce that Juana Medina is one

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.120
of our featured authors
this Saturday

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.930
on our National Book Festival
in the convention center.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.250
So I encourage everyone to
go see her there as well.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.130
Her presentation, I
believe, is at two p.m.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.650
at the Children's Literature
Pavilion.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.210
Being an immigrant from Columbia
myself, and an aspiring artist,

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.910
I am very, very eager to hear --

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.200
to hear about this
wonderful person's journey.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.510
Please join me in welcoming
Juana Melina.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.260
[ Applause ]

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.560
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: Hello.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.990
Thank you very, Catalina, for
such a generous introduction.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.510
I really appreciate it.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.240
First, I want to say hello.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.470
It's absolutely wonderful
to be here.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.450
I really cannot believe it.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.080
Many years ago now when I first got
my reader ID here at the Library

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.820
of Congress, I felt elated.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.060
At last I felt like I could take
part in coming to the Library

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.770
and taking profit of
all the wonderful things

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.630 position:56%
that take place in this institution.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.770
Later on, a few years later while
working on Smick, I was contacted

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.420
by Penguin asking to send my
information so that I could be part

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.460
of a catalog, and I thought, great,
my work is now part of the catalog

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.920
at the Library of Congress,
a tiny piece of me there.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.070
And so today I'm short of words to
say how exciting it is to be here.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.570
I'm very humbled and
very appreciative,

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.550
thank you very much
for this invitation.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.020
Besides saying yes to this,
because of course how could I pass

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.410
on this opportunity, then I
realized, okay, what do I do?

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.150
What do I talk about?

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.480
It wasn't just that simple.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.450
And then after thinking about it

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.500
for a while I thought,
okay, I think I got it.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.050
I want to share what it's been
like to be in this journey.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.730
I hope not to put you
sleep by doing this.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.030
I promise I'll keep it brief and
hopefully entertaining enough.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.500 position:56%
I hope it will be inspiring, whether
you are an artist, or an immigrant,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.980
or Latino or Latina,
or queer, or a woman,

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.370
or simply a human being
here present for this talk.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.040
I hope there's something
here for you.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.890
I grew up in Bogota, Colombia,
as Catalina was saying.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.530
And here I am with my
grandfather as a teeny tiny baby.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.580
The Andes in the back
of the picture.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.090
I was very, very lucky to
grow up very close to him.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.940
He was one of the first brain
surgeons to go back to Columbia

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.340
after preparing here in the
U.S. There was such a need

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.610
for brain surgeons at that
time that apparently when he --

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.540
when the airplane landed there
was an ambulance waiting for him

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.250
to perform the first surgery.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.010
That was the need for
surgeons at the time.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.260
He was a wonderful human
being, and a wonderful doctor.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.720
He was also somebody who spoiled
me like nobody else in life.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.530 position:56%
My grandmother was also wonderfully
skilled and a fantastic human being.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.390
She was a wonderful carpenter,
and together they designed some

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.310
of the first equipment to
perform surgeries in Columbia

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.150
because there was no
equipment in order

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.660
for my grandfather
to do the surgery.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.320
So it was a collective effort.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.370
They were both very creative.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.180
Here's my grandma in her studio.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.190
So that was perhaps
genetic, I got lucky.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.380
Their house was actually
magical, not just by my standards,

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.640
but my family and my
friends and everybody

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.670
around them would just come
oftentimes to their house

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.980
and benefit from having a very
inspiring experience thanks

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.300
to their creativity
and their generosity.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:09.370
My parents were basketball players
and they were wonderful athletes.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.980
I did not inherit that
gene [laughter].

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.130
My mom at some point,
my atrocious career

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.640
in basketball didn't last long,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.340
and at some point we had a very
serious talk about it being okay

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.570
for me to quit the basketball team.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.130
So overall, it was a
very happy childhood

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.040
and I felt incredibly lucky.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.840
My father died when I was about
seven months old in an accident.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.520
So I must say the strength
and courage

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.540
from my mother has been something

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.820
that has kept me going
for a very long time.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.010
I'm very lucky to have
her here today.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.040
So that's me with my mom.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.590
One of the hardest things
about growing up in Columbia,

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.580
despite me saying I was
very lucky, was the war.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.010
This were the 1980's and
during the '80s the situation

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.270
in Columbia was far from peaceful.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.340
It was incredibly,
incredibly hard for very many.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:19.100
We were, again, lucky to first
be comfortable to live in Bogota,

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:24.770
which was a very extensive city
where people were a lot more

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.220
at peace than out in
the countryside.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.570
Still, this doesn't mean we
were not touched by the war.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:36.570
I still remember, you know,
blasting bombs and, you know,

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.690 position:56%
people being kidnapped around us,
and situations that were quite dire.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.540
But in the grand scheme of
things we were quite lucky

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:49.230
to not be touched directly
by the war.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:56.670
Bogota is a very diverse city, very
vibrant, very big, and it allowed

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.280
for me to have tremendous
inspiration just by hearing stories

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:06.070
from countless people,
who in a very generous

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.450
and passionate way do share
stories, very Colombian style just

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.490
by simply opening up
and saying hello.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.530
So we were very lucky.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.640
Besides that amazing environment

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.330
where storytelling was very
much alive, I happened to grew

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.050
up in a household that
was tremendously creative.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.540
These are my cousins.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.410
I'm standing with the red veil.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.370 position:56%
I have no idea what we were playing.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.590
But, you know, it must've
been quite exciting.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:41.650 position:56%
And we were encouraged to think that
way and to create things out of,

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.790
you know, whatever we found
around, like a little piece of rag,

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:48.850
and we played for hours and
we were very, very happy.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.510
The only thing I know for certain

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.740
in this picture is
Filipe [assumed spelling],

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.140
who's in the middle,
was an astronaut.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.350
That's -- that helmet --
that helmet says it all,

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.110
and that was his preference.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.390
I also happened to be very
lucky to go to a school

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.320
that valued arts tremendously,
and that was very,

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.100
very helpful in my upbringing.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.030
It was a wonderful environment

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:22.580
where everybody found
constant ways of expression.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:28.540
So art and creative expression
were from very early, just simply,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.570
you know, parts of my life.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.870
I didn't question it.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.250
I didn't think of it as art.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:39.220
I didn't think of it as, you
know, other than just expressing.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.380
And that changed as I
grew a little bit older

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.790
and I started meeting people
that didn't grow up in

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.700
such a fortunate household
and then they would say

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.490
to me, well, I can't draw.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.050
And it's like, what do
you mean you can't draw?

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.240
I'll give you my pen,
or you need paper,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:01.080
or how can we [inaudible] can draw,
but I couldn't really conceive

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.380
that people could not draw.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:10.210
During the 1980's, the late 1980's
also, things changed a little bit

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:14.770 position:56%
and we were touched by the financial
crisis taking place in Columbia.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.280
And this was quite hard
because we had lived comfortably

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.360
and we had had a safe life,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.180
and all of a sudden all
these conditions changed.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.740
So all of a sudden we
had close to nothing,

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:34.160
or we were very uncomfortable
and it was a difficult situation.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.160
And from realizing that there
were very few resources,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.950
or they were quite limited,
thank goodness I grew

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:44.330
up with a very creative
mother and I learned

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:49.210
that having nothing could be
translated into making something.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:53.770 position:56%
Everything was an opportunity to
make things and shift things around.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:57.000
That being creative ensured
that there was some sweetness

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.620 position:56%
in life no matter what, and a little
bit of humor took us a long way.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.070
By the year 2000 my
family ended up leaving

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.940
and they came to the United States.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.620
I stayed behind studying
physical therapy.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:20.450
And talk about being creative,
this was during a financial crisis,

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.650
working in very, very
poor hospitals,

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:28.280
and that's where you see most
creativity really at work.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.080
I think we often think of
creatives as entrepreneurs

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.430
or designers or craftsmen.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.030
Go to a hospital, go talk
to a physical therapist,

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.590
to an occupational therapist, to a
nurse, especially in Latin America

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:45.840
and you will see really
what creativity is at work,

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.400
and not necessarily for any
special award or anything,

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.250
but simply to improve
somebody's life.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.490
In the end, opportunities were
narrowing for me in Columbia,

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:02.010
and what made most sense
was for me to leave.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.700
This was not an easy goodbye.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.840
I was leaving behind
my grandparents.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:12.370
And, for some reason, I knew
I wouldn't see them again.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.240
This was incredibly hard.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:20.470
That goodbye I still can sense
it in me 15 years later almost.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.640
And it wasn't easy, and
I don't think I have

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.450
to go extensively about it.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.270 position:56%
For those of you who might have been
immigrants you all remember this

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.500
in some kind of way.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:38.560
Needless to say, I still remember
and miss those big mountains

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.380
and miss the smells of fresh fruit
and fresh flowers everywhere,

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:49.640
and Spanish being spoken loudly
everywhere, but life went on.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.950
I had in my pocket $220.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:58.570
Like many immigrants, many
had much less than that.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:04.820
And I also had my bags full of
books and very many expectations.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.120
I was lucky.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.420
I was lucky in many ways.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:12.490
One of them being I had my family
here, so they were receiving me

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.700
as soon as I got off that plane.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.010
I was coming to a city that
I was already familiar with.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.040
I knew the language.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.840
I had been able to receive
wonderful education,

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.640
and that made a huge
difference that I'm well aware.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.610 position:56%
Not every immigrant gets those
possibilities right off an airplane,

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.860
or right as they walk
past the frontier.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:39.530
But that doesn't take away
the amount of uncertainty

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.390
when you're an immigrant.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.310
And it's hard, it's
very difficult to figure

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.740
out how things will work
out, what is your role,

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.260
what are you supposed
to do with your life?

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.840
And that prompted questions for me.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.040
Who am I? What does it
mean to be an immigrant?

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.500
Because all of a sudden there
so many labels imposed on me.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.800
Where are you from?

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.100
When did you came?

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.400
What are you doing here?

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.700
Are you staying here for good?

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.840
It's like, I don't
know, I have no idea.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.520
Back in Columbia my
identity was very clear.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.420
I knew who I was, what I wanted
to do, and here everything shifted

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.230
and all I had was a blank slate.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.200
I felt very much like
one in a million.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.880
Nothing seemed to be the experience
that everybody was having.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.340
It seemed to be very
different and foreign to a lot

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.690
of people, and that was difficult.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.520
All of a sudden also, I
realized there was a label

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.820
that was imposed on me.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.120
I was brown.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.840
I had never been brown
in my life before.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.170 position:56%
All of a sudden I was -- I would
enter a shop and I would be followed

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.770
by the lady at the store, and
I would be stopped by police,

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:48.440
and all these situations that,
again, I'm one of the lucky ones.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.800
But it just seems so foreign to me,

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.880
and something I had
never encountered before.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.150
I was the other.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.470
And being the other is very scary.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:06.890
It's something that shuns us
away, that stops conversations,

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.320
that encourages fear,
and we're leaving it --

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.980
we're living at quite vividly right
now during this election season.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:19.870
While I was trying to figure out
what to do with my life I happened

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.850
to see that there would be --

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.490
that there was a class
going to Georgetown

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:29.850
as a continued education class
that was offered and it was

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.640
for drawing and painting critique.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.050
And so I joined this
class just as an effort

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:40.520
to think things differently and I
happened to have the great fortune

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.940
of meeting Bill Rock
[assumed spelling],

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.130
who was the instructor
of this class.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.510
And we had wonderful conversations,
and he learned a little bit more

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.930
about myself as I was
learning about art.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.610
I had never really
taken art seriously.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.970
As I was telling you, I
thought everybody could draw.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.720
And he finally said
to me, well listen,

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.880
it seems like things
are not working.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.020
You need to change your visa.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.790
Why do you insist on
physical therapy?

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:11.440
Why don't we make a bet and you
apply to art school and if you get

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.220
in you start art --
going to art school.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.100
And I think I was despondent enough
to say, okay, I'll give it a try.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:26.230
And I applied to the Corcoran and
received a scholarship and I said,

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.940
okay, I guess this is
the route I'll take.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:33.520
This had been after 2 1/2, almost
3 years, of being here in the U.S.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.430
So I started at the Corcoran
and I was incredibly happy

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.990
to encounter a whole
lot of opportunities

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.350
that I would've never
encountered otherwise.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.250
Also, it guaranteed a student
visa, which was a big relief.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.600
This would ensure that as
long as I was a student here

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.500
in the U.S. I would be okay.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:03.130
But while I was there I realized
that the graphic design program,

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:10.200
which is where I was, wasn't
necessarily what I had in mind.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:16.360
The program at the time
was very corporate driven.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.190
Things were done using
a lot of computers,

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:23.900
and things were all about, you
know, production of annual reports

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:28.090
and digital works, and I was like,
oh, I want something more tangible,

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:32.690
and I want to get my hands dirty,
and I want to explore more.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:36.250
And while this was going through
my mind I happened to sign

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.710
up for another drawing class,

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.790
in this case with the wonderful
artist, Bill Christenberry.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:47.620
And Bill, in a very gentle
way, almost cornered me one day

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.600 position:56%
and he said, young lady, you
realize this is not a place for you.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.480
And he said, you -- if the world
was perfect where would you go?

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.780
And I said to him, well,

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.160
if the world was perfect
I would go to RISD.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.910
He said, well just apply, I'll
write a letter of recommendation,

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:08.010
and then all of a sudden things
started working very easily.

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:11.400
And the next semester
I ended up at RISD.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.960
It's not as easy as it
sounds, but just for sake --

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:24.100
for sake of time, yeah, it was
-- it was still quite unexpected.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.100
RISD was like being back at my
grandmother's carpentry studio.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:32.820
It was just a shop that
extended throughout the city

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.570
where everybody was eager
to learn something new,

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.650
where everybody was
eager to explore,

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.270
where everybody was passionate
and curious about the arts,

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.450
and this offered a
wonderful platform for me

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:49.460
to reinvent myself in some way.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:53.450
Also, at the time, and if
any of you have gone to RISD,

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:58.030
there's a great amount of
self-portrait that you have to do.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:02.120
They insist on working on
self-portraits and family trees

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:07.810
and exploring who you are,
and that was a lot for me

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:11.880
to figure out at the time.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.170
To add to that, I lost
my grandparents.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.960
And they -- as I said
in the beginning,

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.650
they were incredible human beings.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.320
They have -- had been great
support network for me,

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.050 position:56%
and losing them was incredibly hard.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:33.750
One of the hardest things
about losing them was something

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.400
that some Latinos here
might have heard about,

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.590
and it's what some call
[speaking foreign language],

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:44.430
or the golden cage, which is
basically being in the U.S.,

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.260
being able to take profit
of so many opportunities,

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:51.900
and yet here we are
locked and stuck here.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:56.820
I could not leave the country
even though I was perfectly legal

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.530
because I had asked for a
visa while being in the U.S.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.310
So the moment I left the
United States I would have

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.730
to reapply for a visa.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:14.020
The chances for a mid-20's woman,
single, from Colombia, gay,

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.440
who happened to have
her family in the U.S.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.950
to get a visa to come back in, nil.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:23.920
When the lawyer handed me that visa
he said, if you go to Columbia,

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.110
or if you go out of the United
States, I will not represent you.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:31.300
So it was very clear for me
that I couldn't manage to get

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.020
out and come back in again.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:38.210
This was one of the hardest
things I had to do, and it was one

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.260
of the hardest decisions to make,

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:47.870
just keeping a very somewhat cold
mind and letting my grandparents go

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:53.370
without being there for
them in their last days.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.710
And all these questions between
self-portraits and family trees

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:58.620
and all the things
that were going on,

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.710
people started asking
me who are you?

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:05.040
Because I was clearly not the
traditional New England student

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.310
at the Rhode Island
School of Design.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.580
And that made me ask,
yeah, who am I?

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:18.420
Who am I? And I started
thinking of self as an artist.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.690
And I started thinking of self.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:28.540
And the more I thought the more I
realized the only way to solve this

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:33.140
or to find enlightenment in
some kind of way would be

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:38.660
through exploration, because I
clearly didn't have the answers.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:42.960
So there was a lot of observation
and exploration through the means

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.020
that were familiar to
me, and that was drawing.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.990
So I drew the things I missed about
Columbia, like fruits organized

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:56.530
in the grocery store, or cars
beeping horns, or fountains,

00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:01.510
or coffee shops, and
[inaudible], bus brakes screeching,

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.190
and the big windows, and the
sun hitting the mountains almost

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.760
as if they could be split open.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:17.480 position:56%
And this -- memories started
filling my journals and sketchbooks.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:23.540 position:56%
Then I moved on try to see the world
from a different interpretation,

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.550
and that would be through
Latin American literature.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:30.710
And perhaps in a crazy attempt
I decided to sign up for a class

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:36.400
that was called Magical
Realism and South.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.460
So it was the first time
in my life I would attempt

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:44.160
to read Garcia Marquez in
English surrounded by people

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.970
who knew very little about him,
and to learn not just to reminisce

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:52.860
and to capture the essence of
my culture from my perspective,

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.420
but also how others
were perceiving it.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.850
I remember an architecture
student during class saying,

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:00.260
well this book is ridiculous.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.110
I mean, they talk about
people licking the walls.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.410
Where would that happen?

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:07.050
And I would think, yeah,
that happens in my country.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:10.900
People do lick the walls
because they have salt deficiency

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.670
and there's cal on the wall
so they lick the walls.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.960
But it's the understanding of
a completely different world

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.670
and trying to find a way to
bridge those differences.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:27.680
So I started looking around me and
collecting objects through visuals.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.390
Everything was an opportunity
to draw.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.970
So my socks, a hat,
a pen, a paper --

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:37.420
a piece of paper, a
car that passed by,

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.910
absolutely everything would
be recorded in drawing form.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:43.750
I sometimes wonder,
if somebody saw these

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.720
without any explanation they would
think I'm the most OCD person

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.020
in the world.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.200
It's absolutely nuts to see this.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:56.130
But at the same time, that was my
possibility of exploring things

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:58.840
and observing objects
that were familiar

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.440
and were foreign at the time.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:07.810 position:56%
It was basically changing my entire
perspective on how to see the world,

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.690
or at least an attempt on doing so.

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:14.740
I tried to record the architecture
around me very different

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:20.680
from the houses that I
grew up seeing in Colombia.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.250
These are roofs on
Benefit [phonetic] Street

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.360
in Providence, Rhode Island.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.110
I started recording the
buildings that I walked past

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:34.760
and then reinterpreting
them in my own way.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.360
I would also record my dreams.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:40.480
This was a dream of a
crazy, big turnip that --

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:47.270 position:56%
I was in a farmer's community and in
my dream they needed help to take it

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:50.080
out of the earth because
it was so, so big,

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.890
and I still remember
vividly the colors.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.280
I don't think I was able to --

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:59.350
I can tell I wasn't able to portray
exactly what I saw in my dream,

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:04.330
which was absolutely surreal,
but still, this was my attempt.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.220
So it all took practice.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:10.580
It took a lot of practice just
drawing, playing with humor.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.880
This is a sneeze.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:19.980
Doing more serious things
in the classroom and studio.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:25.180
Recording buildings, rerecording
them using different media

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:29.110
and trying to explore
what this meant for me.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.530
What is the influence
of this over me?

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:37.420
Or how can I possibly influence
it by drawing it somehow.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.510
Of course failure was also a great
part of this, and it's something

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:46.770
that in the arts and being
creative there's no way to escape.

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:51.480
But one thing was very clear, and
it was that drama should stay away

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.950
from all these explorations.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:55.460
It was simply failing
and starting again

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.440
but not letting myself
just lose my mind simply

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.600
because I couldn't register
things how I intended to.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.240
And this also was filtering
into my life obviously.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.550
It was not just about a very
serious exploration on drawing,

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:13.090
but instead just trying to
externalize all the questions

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:17.210
and all the anguish
that was going inside.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:21.680
And then the other essential
part for me became iterations.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:27.580
This is a big bad wolf on a
retake on Little Red Riding Hood,

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:32.900 position:56%
and I decided to tell the story from
-- with a little bit of a spinoff.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.470
I don't know if you can
see clearly from there,

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:40.420
but Red Riding Hood is walking,
she's all of a sudden attacked

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:45.390
by the wolf, but not to eat her
or eat her treats or anything,

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.430
but all he wanted was the cape.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.480
And so he's dancing and prancing
and then at the end he flies.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.550
So that's one interpretation.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:59.330
Then I drew another interpretation
where the -- instead of --

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:03.750
instead of the, you know,
story that we had before,

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:08.780
or with the super flying
wolf, I just decided

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:12.790
to have little red riding hood
say, okay, enough of this.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:17.270
I need my cape back
and then on they went.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:21.600
The other great factor
besides observation,

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.700
iteration, failing, was process.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.590
And I just have one single
example of process here,

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:35.360
and it's just documenting the
buildup of an illustration

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.130
that was later used for a
documentary through PBS.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:45.130
It was about a -- the story
of two Colombian women,

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.140
two very brave Colombian women.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.930
One of them, the mother, who
was kidnapped for seven years.

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.840
The other, the daughter,
who happened to be

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.240
in D.C. while her mother
was kidnapped in the jungle

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:59.470
of Columbia for a number of years.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:03.600
So I wanted to have both
worlds come together somehow.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.200
So you can see to the -- to
the left Washington, D.C.,

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.810
and you might find some of those
buildings a little bit familiar.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.800
And then towards the
right the jungle.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.850
So here's a close-up of Washington,

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:24.550 position:56%
D.C. And in the animation I made
the, you know, the little red lights

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:29.490
at the top of the George Washington
Monument flicker and the lights

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:33.850 position:56%
in the -- in the Kennedy Center
move around a little bit, and so on.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:38.020
So detail was, of course,
imperative.

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:42.010
The other thing I decided to
take on was to take great leaps,

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:46.990
and these were unexpected leaps,
but in a way it was just learning

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:51.860
to say yes to projects
that came my way.

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:56.410
And I applied all of these things,
as I was saying, observation,

00:28:56.410 --> 00:29:00.770
exploration, iteration,
failure, process,

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:05.950
and not only to work
or life, but to play.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:11.000
And this allowed for me to have a
much easier platform to navigate.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.770
And whenever I was asked
by then, who are you?

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:17.770
At least I could, you know, come
up with an answer just based

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:19.330
on what I had been working on.

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.470
Not everything was done on my own.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:25.000
I was also very lucky to
find wonderful mentors

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.150
who offered extraordinary
examples to follow.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:34.880
And they also made sure to point
out examples not to follow,

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:37.670
and for that I'm tremendously
grateful.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:41.470
As I noticed through their
work, and the work I was doing,

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:43.500
and how I was encountering
the world,

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:48.520
I recognized that one very
important thing was to be kind,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.440
that kindness goes a
really, really long way.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:58.490
The other thing I realized is
that working hard does help a lot.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:03.080
And being an immigrant, it's
not just hard, it's hard.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:07.260
And because of that hard work
and to keep a balance in life

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.000
and to not go bitter about all
the work that was being done,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.940
it was important to have fun.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:18.190 position:56%
And so I decided to keep these three
rules for whatever I was doing,

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:20.170
and I still try to keep them.

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:27.470
Now following rules is not
easy, but I certainly try.

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:31.360
Being an immigrant makes
things even harder.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.430
The level of uncertainty
makes it very difficult,

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:39.460
so as graduation got
closer and closer,

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:42.330
there I was hunting
again for a visa.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:43.630
So what next?

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:47.410 position:56%
What could I do after all the effort
that I had been putting into my work

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:51.750
and considering myself
a creative person?

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:55.910
I noticed that many of my
characteristics were considered

00:30:55.910 --> 00:31:00.730
by society as disadvantages, and
I realized that I couldn't put it

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:04.480
in their shoulders to turn those
disadvantages into advantages,

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.180
that it was completely up to me.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:10.180
And I thought if it is up
to me I won't turn them only

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:14.460
into advantages, but big
advantages and make sure

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.940
that I would become indispensable.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.830
I don't know how to do
absolutely extraordinary things

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:25.240
that will save humanity, that is
not the way I become indispensable,

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.970
but in the work I do and how I
do it, that's how I could keep

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:34.300
on working hard, being kind, and
having fun, and making things

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.050
as seemingly indispensable
as possible.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:42.690
In one of those efforts I
became a VIP guide for RISD.

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:46.890
And what this meant was I was
touring all the VIP visitors

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:51.040
that came to RISD,
showing them the buildings

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.220
and what was going
on around the school.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:58.160
And this allowed for absolutely
fantastic conversations,

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.060
and most of them would say to
me, what do you want to do?

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.000
What is it that you want to do?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.350
And I would say, I just
want to tell stories.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:15.420 position:56%
And these incredible men and women
would be very kind until I would say

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.850
that and then they would
say, you can't do that,

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.280
you have to do something
more than just tell stories.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.790
It's not -- I mean, are
you going to tell stories?

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:24.090
Are you going to write books?

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:25.390
Are you going to make movies?

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:26.690
What are you going to do?

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:30.570
And I would say, stories,
that's what I really want to do.

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:32.740
No, not a possibility.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.600
So I just said, okay,
I'll do it on my own.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.110
I kept on working hard
and harder and harder.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:45.160
And I got, again, very
lucky and while I was trying

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.680
to figure [inaudible] visa would
come after being a student,

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.260
I happened to meet Eileen Morrison.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:56.670
Eileen Morrison is not only a
fantastic immigration lawyer,

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:58.730
but an extraordinary human being.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.660
And where many had said
to me, there's no option,

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.930
perhaps if you find somebody to
get married, or do something that,

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:08.430
you know, is perhaps not
the most Orthodox option,

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:10.740
they would say, there's
no possibility.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.180
Eileen instead looked at
all my work and she said,

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.850
let's try, let's give this a try.

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:20.310
And she didn't give up and she
very sharply took everything I had.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.290
She didn't make any
promises she couldn't,

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:25.580
but she put in her best work,

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.820
and this was the most inspiring
thing I have seen when I was

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:33.060
in a very, very dire situation.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:37.830
So I said before, you know, how
I had decided to take these rules

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.710
of being kind, of working
hard, and having fun,

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:44.030
but this took it to
a whole new level.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:49.690
Yeah, over three years of waiting,
of jumping at any project I could,

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:54.020
of still trying to keep my life
together, and it wasn't easy.

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:56.130
It wasn't easy at all.

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:59.610 position:56%
The uncertainty was despair inducing

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:03.490
because it affects every
single inch of your life.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:05.540
Do I buy this book I love?

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:09.640
But if I have to leave the country
in 30 days why would I buy it?

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:13.350
Do I really want to make this
incredible friendship or what seems

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:16.030
like -- well, I might be gone.

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:19.880
Any conversation, it just seeps in

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.360
and it's incredibly
hard to shake it off.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.550
Decision-making is hard,
as I said, you know.

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:29.290
Do I take a new phone plan even
though my flip phone is broken

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:31.530
and it's partly working?

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.070
Well, you don't want to get
into a contract if you are going

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.780
to need to leave in no time.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:42.060
Uncertainty could easily
drive anybody insane.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.850
And, finally, before
losing it, I decided, okay,

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:48.370
what is under my control?

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:52.840
What can I change to make
things easier for myself?

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:57.170
So I decided to reach out and
to share my personal story,

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:00.430
something I wasn't
adamant to do earlier.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:03.580
It was just, no, work will do it,
work will do it, and that's it.

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:07.880 position:56%
And I started realizing that
sharing my story allowed for empathy

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.650
to start building, and then
people would have references,

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:14.570
or people to point me to, and
things would start changing.

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.810
And I allowed for others
to elevate me

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:19.550
and to think of things differently.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:25.310
So taking on those personal
challenges and continuing

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:28.080
to create was imperative
throughout that time.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:33.560
I also tried my best to aim
high and turn every disadvantage

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.050
into an advantage, to make sure

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:41.110
that the uncertainty would
be countered by adaptability.

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.530
I don't know if there
are many Colombians here,

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:44.830
but -- or [inaudible].

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:49.840
In Columbia, in Bogata there's
a market called San Andresito.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.850
And San Andresito, whenever you go
there you can you can find anything

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.150
you're looking for.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:56.850
And if you don't find what you're
looking for, they'll tell you all,

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.880
oh, I don't have this, but
I have this, and I don't --

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.550
and, you know, they'll
figure it out until you end

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.830
up buying whatever it is.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.880
And I thought -- I never
thought I would find wisdom

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.320
in San Andresito, but there I was.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.680
They would call, Juana, will
you do this annual report?

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.310
Yes. Will you do this animation?

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:18.000
Yes. Will you do whatever it was?

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.100
Yes, I'll do it, it doesn't matter.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.580
Of course, I was collapsing out
of all the work I was taking on,

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:27.210
but it just meant a
possibility and an opportunity.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:30.050
Meanwhile, Eileen kept
on working on making sure

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:33.590
that I could get a
visa as an artist.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:37.730
And then I got a denial,
and it was as hard

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:39.980
as a breakup, or even harder.

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:46.190 position:56%
It -- just the idea of, you know,
yeah, you're good but not that good.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:51.030
It was basically what that eight
page letter was telling me.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.820
So I was losing it.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:37:00.720
Moreover, this process was very
expensive and I didn't have a lot

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.790
of money just to keep
on going and spending.

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:09.030
But I knew I needed to stay here
and that there was no reason

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:14.070
after all those years of hard work
to go back to Columbia and give up.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:15.560
Throughout the time, of course,

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.380
there were ongoing
conversations with my mother.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:23.430
And one day in particular
she pointed out to me, Juana,

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:28.660
this is very much like
swimming 1500 meters.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.490
One thing I didn't tell
you early on in an attempt

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:35.300
to make the story shorter,
was that I was a swimmer

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.320
for a very long time, a
competitive swimmer, and believe it

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.890
or not I would swim
1500 meters as --

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:47.760
that was what I would
compete on most at my meets.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:52.540
And 1500 meters is
a long, long swim.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:56.310
And your head feels like
it's bursting, your eyes

00:37:56.310 --> 00:38:00.320
and the goggles feel like they're
going to bulge out of your head.

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:04.190
You barely have the
physical stamina,

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:07.180
even though I was training
four hours a day,

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:10.970
going an hour to the gym,
it's very, very hard to do.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:16.320
And the moment my mom said this
it was clear to me that I had

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.560
within me the tools to keep
on swimming and to keep

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.150
on going forward, and to
treat things basically

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:25.960
as if it was a 1500 meter meet.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.870
There I am.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:33.270
I'm [inaudible] but,
you know, just try.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:38.010
So onward, and I kept
being persistent.

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:40.720
And I had to be very,
very pragmatic,

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.570
which as a Colombian wasn't
part -- wasn't easy to do.

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:48.100
So I had to think of
myself as a phone battery

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:52.300
and having 15% of battery left.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:57.440
If you have a 15% battery
left you don't check Facebook.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.610
You don't waste time, you know,

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:04.420
chatting with somebody really don't
feel like chatting, or doing things

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.900
that are unnecessary, because
you have to save that battery.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.950
And I felt that I had that --

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:14.840
a lot of energy and I could not
lose it being tremendously dramatic

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:18.240
or petty or crying about
things, and instead I had

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.460
to keep a mentality of, okay,
that denial was very hard.

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.760
Now what next?

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.660
How can we overcome this?

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:31.100
So, fortunately enough, we had
done a second filing of a visa

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:34.790
and just kept on going
hoping for that to go well.

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:40.180 position:56%
And then when pragmatism doesn't
work, there's optimism, and of that,

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.550
fortunately as Colombian,
I did have my fair share.

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:48.560
Thank goodness by the -- by
mid-December in 2012 I received one

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.200
of the most delightful
calls I've received.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:57.520
Eileen, my lawyer, called to say
that my visa had been approved.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.100
We both cried on the phone.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.400
We both celebrated.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.920
I still can't get over it.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:06.990
And that night of the 12th I
slept like I hadn't in years.

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:12.630 position:56%
For those of you who have waited for
a visa, you know what that means.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:17.010
Shortly after I got a book
deal that made me feel

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:20.090
like the effort was
entirely worth it.

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:23.660
I have been showing some of
the illustrations of the book

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:24.960
within this presentation.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.550
That book is called Juana and
Lucas and it's back there.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:34.510
And this validated a lot of
the work that I had been doing.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:38.130
Moreover, I happened to
meet Sally, my partner,

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:42.400
and this was within a span of three
months, and I thought, oh my gosh,

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.130
is this whole year
going to go this way?

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:51.300
So it was in a way a new
life and a way to see

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.150
that hard work had paid off,

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:57.640
that there was definitely
a certain amount of luck,

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:01.760
but a lot of it had been that
persistence, that pragmatism,

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:06.930
that optimism just in the right
dose to make things happen.

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:09.930
So is now everything perfect?

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:20.820
No, but darn close, and for
that I think it's worth saying

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:26.920
that the journey was humbling,
very reassuring, fortunately,

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.190
and tremendously inspiring.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:31.090
And for that I'm grateful.

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:32.890
Thank you very much.

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:44.370
[ Applause ]

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:45.670
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Thank
you so much, Juana,

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.800
for this beautiful,
beautiful presentation.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.920
Again, we're selling
the books in the back.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.220
And also I wanted to announce

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:54.290
that we have this little
survey close to the exit here.

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:57.320
They're from our office
of communications.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.910
If you have a second to fill those
out we would really appreciate it.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:02.130
Thank you again for coming.

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:03.430
&gt;&gt; Can I ask you a question?

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:04.730
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: Sure, yeah.

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:06.030
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Questions,
yeah, we have questions.

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:07.540
We're speechless, I'm speechless.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.840
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: Yes [inaudible]?

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.950
&gt;&gt; When you're doing the
illustrations with the food,

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:19.440
do you have any set way of
designing the illustrating first,

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:23.440 position:56%
or do you see a piece of food and --

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.660
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: It's mostly the
food first, and that does help.

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:33.100
With the latest series of books
that I've been working with food,

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:39.870
there has been some theme set up
beforehand so that I have an idea

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:43.760
of what I have to -- you know, the
parameters I have to work within.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:48.220
But if it's just for fun I'll
look at a carrot and see,

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.960
you know, what ends up happening.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.960
So it's not necessarily
prescribed, yeah.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.510
&gt;&gt; Like the radish that
you showed a minute ago.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:58.810
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: Yeah.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:01.380
&gt;&gt; Do you draw from a photograph
or [inaudible] like that?

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:05.090
[inaudible] on paper and
then you put the food there,

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:07.720
but that's not possible.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.020
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: Right.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:12.880
Yeah, so initially I did
start drawing with pen and ink

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.890
around the fruit that I was
using, and then I realized

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:19.240
that it's a lot easier to
just photograph the food

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.430
because it has such
a short lifespan.

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:26.120 position:56%
So just to photograph the food, take
it into Photoshop and try all sorts

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.140
of iterations, so that guaranteed

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:31.940
that I could play a
lot more with it.

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:36.060
So, yeah, this is Photoshop.

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:42.620 position:56%
And then I can use it, you know,
for however many times I want, yeah.

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.510
Yes?

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:59.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.870
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yes.

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:03.780
There have been many influences.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:07.570
I think being a child,
Quentin Blake,

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:10.070
Jules Feiffer, Kino [phonetic].

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:18.190
I'm blanking right now but,
you know, there were so --

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:20.550
yeah, Cheryl Steinberg
[assumed spelling],

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:23.150
were of great inspiration.

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:28.370
And then I started learning a
whole new amount of illustrators

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:37.170
and cartoonists and that definitely
was humbling and so inspiring.

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:41.040
Moreover, and thanks for your
question, as Catalina was saying,

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.050
winning the National Cartoonist
Society J. Kennedy Memorial

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:51.550
Scholarship was a wonderful way of
connecting with many cartoonists,

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:55.490
and that guaranteed that
I could learn from them,

00:44:55.490 --> 00:45:00.050
not just about their work, but
their personal experience with art,

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:07.510
and that was a -- you know, just
a great privilege really, yeah.

00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:19.530
[ Inaudible ]

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:20.830
That's a really good question.

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:25.670
So with Juana and Lucas, the story
was very clear from the beginning.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:27.600
I'll just tell you very briefly.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.990
What happened was my mom picked
me up at school and I was fuming

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:33.770
and furious, and she
asked what was going on.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:37.030
And I said, well they want me to
learn something called the English.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:39.270
I really don't want to learn this.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:42.010
And she said, well, we're
going to Disney World

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:46.050 position:56%
and Mickey Mouse only speaks English
so you might want to give it a try.

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:49.320
And that kind of solved it.

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.310
So the structure of
the story was there

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:56.740
and it was very clear
what I wanted to do.

00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:00.690
And when I started presenting
the pitch for the story

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:03.930
to different publishing houses
I got all sorts of answers.

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:06.600
Within those answers
there were some that said,

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.210
you know, Bogata is too remote.

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:10.080
Nobody really knows about Columbia.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.930
Why we should kids in the
U.S. learn about Columbia?

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:14.390
That's not interesting.

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:17.400
Some were saying, well,
this is very exciting.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.700
The character is very cute.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.450
Why don't we make them Mexican,

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:24.070
and instead of a dog we give
her a burro, and instead of --

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:26.600
you know, oh she would be
so cute with a sombrero.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.900
And I was like, Jesus,

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:31.550
do they realize how offensive
this is just, you know?

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:34.680
And moreover, unfortunately,
I've never been to Mexico

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.290
so how could I tell the story.

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.860
And so it was really interesting.

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:42.330
Or turning her -- the
character into an immigrant

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:43.650
and being at Jackson Heights.

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:46.790
And I thought that's perfectly
valid, but it's not my experience.

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:48.370
I can't really speak of that.

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:53.880 position:56%
So that was a point where instead
of yes, I had to very kindly decline

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.980
and say no, and know
exactly what I wanted to do.

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.750
And that's hard, especially
after saying yes so many times

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:03.630
to everything, and not
knowing if that no is going

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:07.710
to cut my opportunities
that are lying ahead.

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:10.200
Yeah. Yes?

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:20.440
&gt;&gt; Speaking of Columbia, how does
[inaudible] is that tomorrow?

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:23.540
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: It's --
the voting is next week.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.810
I'm so moved.

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:31.020
I am so moved to think that after
so, so many years we are going

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.820
to see peace in our lifetime.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:36.590
That is the most exciting
thing I can think of.

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:42.590
And I truly hope that all of us
Colombians will be able to see

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:43.960
that in some kind of way.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.810
Is this peace treaty perfect?

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:48.150
No, but no peace is
going to be perfect.

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:53.510 position:56%
It's -- there's been so much pain
and so many violations of everything

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:56.400
that it's impossible
to think of a way

00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:01.990
that would erase the
problematic entirely, but I truly,

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:05.640
truly hope for a yes and that
people will see the value

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.880
of what has been done in
Cuba in all the talks.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.180
Yeah. Yeah.

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.480
Yes?

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:17.620
&gt;&gt; How much of a culture
shock was [inaudible]?

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.980
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: Oh,
it was interesting

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:25.750
because my grandparents lived in
Boston for a while, so I had grown

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:29.830
up hearing a lot of stories about
Boston and I -- we had visited.

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:32.830
So it wasn't a tremendous shock,

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:35.620
until conversations
started to come forward.

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:39.840
I remember in particular talking
to somebody for about half an hour

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.850
and she must have been
completely absent-minded and all

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:44.100
of a sudden she turns to
me and she says, you know,

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.940
I just realized this is the first
person, I talked to a brown person.

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:54.330
And I couldn't even
think of what to say.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:58.410
So, yeah, there have
been interesting things,

00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:01.080
but not all of them have
happened in New England.

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.380
I love New England.

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:06.350
I'll be there in a week
or so, and I love it.

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:08.140
But it was interesting.

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:11.560
D.C. also has -- I mean, I
remember I was volunteering

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.580
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center,

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:17.490
and on my first day this very
kind woman was guiding me

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:20.430 position:56%
through the hospital, which is huge.

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:22.960
This was at the prior location.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.930
And all of a sudden
she said, wait hold on,

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:26.710
I need to show you something,

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:29.950
because I had told
her I was Colombian

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:31.800
and I had just arrived
and all these things.

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:36.670
And she said, let me show
you, this is an elevator.

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:39.230
If you press this button you go up.

00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:40.900
If you press this button
you go down.

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:45.420
And I was like, wow, you know, we
don't have those in the jungle.

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:48.030
I mean, it's just like, oh my God.

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:53.570
I mean, how do you
even -- so I just said,

00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:55.070
thank you, thank you very much.

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:59.570
And then later on --
because I think people most

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:01.360
of the time do it out of kindness.

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.470
And there's some nervousness
and simply not knowing.

00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:09.010
And I'm sure I have said
awful, awful things to people,

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:10.790
you know, in many situations.

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:12.860
So it was hard.

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:17.440
At the end of the, you know, just a
few minutes later we were standing

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:20.080
in line and she said, so
how is the cultural shock?

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:22.770
You know, how hard has it
been to adapt to the city?

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:25.340
And I said, you know, I feel
like I'm in a small town.

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.160
It feels so tiny and the
buildings are so short.

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.150
And she was like, really?

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:38.880
Really? So, yeah, I think, again,
kindness goes a long way, yeah.

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.170
&gt;&gt; I hear that you're
going to participate

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:43.470
in a project with [inaudible].

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:48.550 position:56%
Can you comment a little about this?

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:50.640
&gt;&gt; Juana Medina: You
heard right, yes.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:54.310
I can barely contain
myself about this project.

00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:56.260
I'm so excited.

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.560
Can I say the name?

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:05.280
Catalina [inaudible] will be
joining many young readers

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:08.400
through her Technicolor Adventures.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:15.070
And the poet laureate has been
writing absolutely fantastic,

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:18.910
just such beautiful
versus for this project.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:20.390
And we'll be collaborating.

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:21.690
He will be writing.

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:22.990
I will be illustrating.

00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:24.290
And there's a whole team
behind us guaranteeing

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:28.940
that everything will turn
out as well as it can go.

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:34.380
And it'll be a great
collaboration with second graders.

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:36.100
&gt;&gt; Second and third graders.

00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:37.640
&gt;&gt; Second and third graders,

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.860
so we can't wait [inaudible]
come up with, yeah.

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:43.310
Yeah? That was your question?

00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:45.970
Oh great. Good.

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:47.910
All right.

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:49.420
Well, thank you very much.

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:55.020
Thank you [applause].

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:58.720
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
