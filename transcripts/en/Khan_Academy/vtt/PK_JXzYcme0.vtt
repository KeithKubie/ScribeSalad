00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.260
We saw in the last video that if
we defined enthalpy, H, as

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.160
being equal to the internal
energy of a system plus the

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.860
pressure of the system times the
volume of the system-- and

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.060
this is an almost arbitrary
definition.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.100
But we know that this is
a valid state variable.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.910
That no matter what you do in
terms of how you get there,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.330
you're always going to
have the same value.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.770
Because it's the sum
and product of

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.510
other valid state variables.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.100
But this by itself isn't that
useful or that intuitive.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.330
But we saw in the last video
that if you assume constant

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.720
pressure-- and that's a big
assumption, but it's not an

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.290
unreasonable assumption for
most chemical reactions.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.780
Because most chemical reactions,
you know, we're

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.480
sitting at the beach with our
beakers, and they're exposed

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.640
to just standard temperature and
pressure, or at least some

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.420
pressure, that's not changing
as the reaction occurs.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.200
If we assume constant pressure,
we saw that the

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:57.570
change in enthalpy becomes the
heat added to the system at

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.670
that constant pressure.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.090
That P there is just to show you
that hey, this is assuming

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.870
that we're dealing with
heat being added

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.480
at a constant pressure.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.090
Fair enough.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.820
So how can we use these concepts
in any useful way?

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.380
Let's say that I had some carbon
in its elemental form

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.150
as graphite, and I add
to that-- say I

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.280
have a mole of carbon.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.010
And I add to that 2 moles
of hydrogen in

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.820
its elemental form.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.810
It's going to be a gas, and
it's going to be as a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.930
molecule, right?

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.360
If I just have a bunch of
hydrogen in its gaseous state,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.670
let's say, in a balloon, I'm not
going to have individual

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.760
atoms of hydrogen.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.890
They're going to bond and form
these diatomic molecules.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.800
And if I react them, I'm going
to produce a mole of methane.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.530
CH4.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.020
But that's not all I'm
going to produce.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.110
I'm also going to produce
some heat.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:02:01.250
I'm going to produce 74
kilojoules of heat-- plus 74

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.460
kilojoules of heat-- when
I produce that one mole.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.699
I'll do a lower case
k for the kilo.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.330
When I produce that one
mole of methane.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.240
So what's happening here?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.960
So first of all, how much heat
is being added to the system?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.740
And let's assume that this heat
just gets released from

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.230
the system.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.480
That this isn't an adiabatic
process.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.520
I haven't insulated the
system from anything.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.050
That this just gets released.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.650
It just goes away.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.200
It gets released.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.830
So my question is, how much--
you know, I started off with

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.550
this container, I guess we could
call it, that's at a

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.700
standard, fixed pressure.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.270
And maybe I had a bunch
of-- well, I

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.090
wanted to do the carbon.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.430
I'll do it in gray.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.210
I have a bunch of solid
carbon lying around.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.230
Maybe some type of dust. And
then I have some molecular

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.470
hydrogen gas.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.910
Each of those dots is actually
two hydrogen atoms. And then,

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.700
I don't know, maybe I shake it
up or something to make them

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:05.430
react, and then I get a
bunch of methane gas.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.120
I'll do that in green.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.080
So now I just have a bunch of
methane gas, and I released 74

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.330
kilojoules.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.980
So how much heat was added
to the system?

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.150
Well, we released heat
from the system.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.980
We released 74 kilojoules.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.700
So the heat added to the
system was minus 74

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.170
kilojoules.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.460
Right?

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.870
If I asked you the heat
released, then I

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.840
would have said 74.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.930
But remember, we care about the
heat added to the system,

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.420
is 74 kilojoules.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.820
And I just showed you that
that's the exact same thing as

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.070
the change in enthalpy.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.990
So how can we think
about this?

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.510
What is the enthalpy
of this system

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.280
relative to this system?

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.650
Well, it's going to
be lower, right?

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.550
Because if you take enthalpy--
so the change in enthalpy is

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.480
the enthalpy of your final
system, minus the enthalpy of

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.720
your initial system.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.970
And we got a negative number.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.600
We got minus 74 kilojoules.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.589
So this has to be lower than
this by 74 kilojoules.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.680
So this enthalpy right here
is less than this

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.640
enthalpy right here.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.850
So if we were to actually draw
it on a diagram, if I were to

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.490
draw the reaction-- let's say
that this is just time or

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.290
something, as the reaction
proceeds, that axis.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.340
And on the y-axis, I'll
draw enthalpy.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.150
So the reaction starts off at
your initial enthalpy, Hi and

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.970
that's this state right here.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:45.760
So you start there.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.615
I'll do it in the yellow
of that container.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.060
You start there.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.270
And then, I don't know, you
shake it up, or I'm not going

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.180
to go into the activation
energies, so it might have

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.160
little hump and all of
that, but who knows.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.320
But then we end up at
our final enthalpy.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.090
We have this final enthalpy,
right here, after the reaction

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.510
has occured.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.910
That's this state right here.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.790
This is H final.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.680
So you can see, you've had this
drop off in enthalpy.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.530
And what's interesting here is,
is not so much what the

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.240
absolute value of this enthalpy
is here, or what the

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.150
absolute value of this
enthalpy here is.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.580
But now that we have enthalpy,
we can kind of have a

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.260
framework for thinking about
how much heat energy is in

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.970
this system relative
to this system.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.310
And given that there's less
heat energy in this system

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.100
than that energy system, we
must have released energy.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.960
And you know, to some degree,
I told you that from the

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.120
beginning, right?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.990
I told you that energy
is released.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.910
And the word for this we
use is exothermic.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.920
Now, if you want to go the
other way-- let's say we

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.000
wanted to go from methane and
go back, you'd have to add

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.510
heat into the reaction.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.500
If you wanted to go backwards
through this reaction, go

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.290
upwards, you would have to add
that heat content to get that

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.850
positive delta H, and
then you would have

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.430
an endothermic reaction.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.350
So if a reaction releases
energy, exothermic.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.940
If a reaction needs energy to
occur, it's endothermic.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.390
Now you might be asking, Sal,
where'd that energy come from?

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.400
So I started at this
enthalpy here.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.836
And enthalpy has this weird
definition right here, and

00:06:19.836 --> 00:06:21.510
then'll ended up as that
other enthalpy here.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.520
And as you see, enthalpy,
the pressure

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.090
we're assuming is constant.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.250
Let's say the volume isn't
changing much in this

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.360
situation, or maybe doesn't
change at all.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.030
So most of the change is going
to come from the change in

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.680
internal energy, right?

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.030
There's some higher internal
energy here, and some lower

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.080
internal energy here
that's causing the

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.990
main drop in enthalpy.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.620
And that change in internal
energy is really a conversion

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.630
from some potential energy,
up here, into

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.870
the heat that's released.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.830
So there was some heat that was
released, 74 kilojoules,

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.360
and so our internal
energy dropped.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.750
And what all of this does is,
it gives us a framework so

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.380
that if we know how much heat
it takes to form or not form

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.370
certain products, then we can
kind of predict how much heat

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.450
will either be released, or how
much heat will be absorbed

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:10.880
by different reactions.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.190
And so here I'm going to touch
on another notion.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.920
The notion of heat of formation,
or sometimes it's

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.770
change in enthalpy
of formation.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.640
So the way they talk about
it is, the change

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.390
in enthalpy of formation.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.840
And it's normally given
at some standard

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.990
temperature and pressure.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.190
So you put a little, usually
it's a naught, sometimes it's

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.270
just a circle in there.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:37.310
And what that is is, what is the
change in enthalpy to get

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.480
to some molecule from
its elemental form?

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.420
So for example, if we want it
for methane-- if we have

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:51.150
methane there, and we want
to figure out its heat of

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:56.630
formation, we say, look, if
we form methane from its

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.080
elemental forms, what is the
delta H of that reaction?

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.480
Well, we just learned what the
delta H of that reaction was.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.750
It was minus 74 kilojoules.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.080
Which means that if you form
methane from its elemental, I

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.500
guess, building blocks, you're
going to release 74

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.900
kilojoules of energy.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.625
That this is an exothermic
reaction.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:23.940
Because you've released heat,
you can say that the methane

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.180
is in a lower energy state, or
it has a lower potential

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.170
energy, than these guys did.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.620
And because it has
lower potential

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.990
energy, it's more stable.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.460
I mean, one way to think of it
is, if you have a guy, you

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.840
have a mountain here, and down
here, you have a ball.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.650
And this isn't, you know, a
complete, direct analogy.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.090
But the analogy to potential
energy is, look.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.000
When you're down at a lower
potential energy state, you

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.670
tend to be more stable.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.990
And so, in the everyday world,
if you have a bunch of methane

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:01.830
sitting around, the fact that
it has a negative heat of

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.020
formation, or a standard heat
of formation, because I have

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.490
that naught here, or a negative
standard change in

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.270
enthalpy of formation-- those
are all the same things--

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.480
tells me that methane is
stable relative to its

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.030
constituent compounds.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.690
And actually, you can look
these things up.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.500
You don't have to memorize them,
but it's good to know

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.010
what they are.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.850
And I copied all of this stuff--
actually, let me get

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:30.390
the actual tables from
Wikipedia down here.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.270
I copied all of these directly
from Wikipedia.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.750
These give you the standard
heat of formation

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:37.760
of a bunch of things.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:43.050
And if you look down here, for--
let's see if they have

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:47.110
methane-- right there, this is
what we were dealing with.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:51.030
They're telling us essentially
the delta H of the reaction

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.280
that forms methane.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.000
This point table right there
tells us that if we start off

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.030
with some carbon in a solid
state, plus two moles of

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.860
hydrogen in a gaseous state,
and we form one mole of

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.860
methane, that if you take the
enthalpy here minus the

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.930
enthalpy here-- so the change
in enthalpy for this

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:17.320
reaction-- at standard
temperature and pressure, is

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.100
going to be equal to minus
74 kilojoules.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:21.990
Per mole.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.170
And this is all given
per mole.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.580
So if you have a mole of this,
two moles of this, to form one

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.340
mole of methane, you're
going to release 74

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.880
kilojoules of heat.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.370
So this is a stable reaction.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:33.850
Now there's a couple of
interesting things here, and

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:37.050
we'll keep using this table
over the next few videos.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:46.200
You see here, monoatomic oxygen
has a positive standard

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.590
heat of formation.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.300
Which means it takes
energy to form it.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:50.620
Right?

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.360
That if you have a reaction, let
me just say, the reaction,

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.180
I'll write it this way.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:05.980
One half of molecular oxygen as
a gas to go to one mole of

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:10.290
oxygen in its gaseous state.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:15.060
This tells us that this
state has more

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.330
potential than this state.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.980
And in order for this reaction
to occur, you have to add

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.190
energy to it.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.860
You have to put the energy
on the other side.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:29.340
So you'd have to say,
plus 249 joules.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.500
So you might say, hey, Sal,
that doesn't make sense.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.000
Oxygen is just oxygen.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.800
Why is there a heat of
formation of oxygen?

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.260
And that's because you always
use the elemental form as your

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.500
reference point.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.870
So oxygen, if you just had
a bunch of oxygen sitting

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.790
around, it's going to
be in the O2 form.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.020
If you have a bunch of hydrogen,
it's going to be H2.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.590
If you have a bunch of nitrogen,
it's going to be N2.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.830
Carbon, on the other hand, is
just C, and it tends to be in

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.710
its solid form as graphite.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:01.620
So all heats of formation are
relative to the form that you

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.050
find that element when you have
a pure version of it.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.020
Not necessarily its atomic form,
although sometimes it is

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.400
its atomic form.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.450
Now, in the next video, we're
going to use this table, which

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.690
is a very handy table-- I cut
and pasted parts of it-- to

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.470
actually solve problems. In this
last video, I gave you

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.550
the heat of formation,
and we just thought

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:21.490
about it a little bit.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.720
In the next few videos, we're
going to use this table that

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.580
gives us standard heats of
formation to actually figure

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.800
out whether reactions are
endothermic-- meaning they

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.040
absorb energy-- or exothermic--
meaning they

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.750
release energy-- and we'll
figure out how much.
