00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.102
Now what I'd like to do is just, to kind of help us think through this.

00:00:03.102 --> 00:00:07.158
I'm going to show you a whole lot of examples to cover the space of

00:00:07.158 --> 00:00:12.330
what it means to go from different values of the exposure triangle.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.023
Let's take f number 5.6.

00:00:16.023 --> 00:00:20.160
And I will start off with a shutter speed of one over ten.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.600
This is the same scene.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.250
And of course, because of the fact that the apertures open for a while.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.590
And I'm also keeping the shutter speed.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.610
There is a lot of light entering the sensor.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.010
This image might be refered to as over-exposed.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.250
Same aperture value.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.110
I've now basically gotten the shutter to work at one one-twentieth,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.880
twice the speed of this.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.650
Twice as fast.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.740
Of course here you can start seeing that image is less over-exposed

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.040
then this one.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.550
I'm going down again, doubling the shutter speed.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.730
Doubling it more.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.920
And now you can start seeing that this image actually seems to have

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.400
less overexposure than any one of them.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.445
But I keep on going there to one one-sixtieth.

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:03.991
Same aperture value.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.990
Now it might start getting darker.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.160
More darker.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.280
Even more darker and now we are getting into the range of underexposed.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.440
For those of you interested, we may actually now start thinking about

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.540
what would histograms of these images would look like.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.870
Based on the lecture we looked at before.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.400
Darker image, nothing like this, this would be.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.530
Overexposed, underexposed,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.740
extremely underexposed because now we really can't see any details.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.940
Let's now actually move up and down these axes.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.108
So now, I'm actually going to take this speed,

00:01:37.108 --> 00:01:40.540
one over one-hundredth of a second.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.096
And then I'm going to go in and actually give it an f number of 4.0.

00:01:46.096 --> 00:01:48.127
F 5.0.

00:01:48.127 --> 00:01:50.043
This was 5.6.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:51.483
7.1.

00:01:51.483 --> 00:01:52.703
9.0.

00:01:52.703 --> 00:01:54.025
13.0.

00:01:54.025 --> 00:01:55.140
And 20.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.080
Again, you can see what the impact was.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.220
It was, these of course the images are much smaller.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.400
So you can't details of the depth of field kinds of stuff here.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.878
But this seems to be a nicely exposed image.

00:02:06.878 --> 00:02:08.590
A little over-exposed, but fine.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.290
But as you go on increasing the aperture size, oh sorry, decreasing

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.590
the aperture size, we notice that now we're getting a lot less light in there.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.820
So here, we went this direction and we basically make the shutter speed faster.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.166
And here we went down this way and basically made the aperture smaller.

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:32.919
These two are underexposed.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.850
These two are overexposed.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.010
We can imagine actually filling this complete matrix out, but

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.580
that would have been a too crowded of a slide.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.600
I just wanted to show you the impact of all of this.
