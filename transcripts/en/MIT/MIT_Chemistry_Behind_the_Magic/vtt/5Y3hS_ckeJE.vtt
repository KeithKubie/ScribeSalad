[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.484 --> 00:00:09.150
JESSICA: Hi, I'm
Jessica, and today, I'm

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.610
going to be talking about
a chemical demonstration I

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.130
like to call, "Money to Burn."

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.650
And chemist Dr.
Bassam Shakhashiri--

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.290
here he is-- is actually going
to be showing us the demo.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.810
He's the president of the
American Chemical Society,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.350
and is performing this
demo right here at MIT.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.015
Let's see if he has
some money to burn.

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:31.890
DR. BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
What I am going to do

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.520
now is going to reach in here.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.130
I'm going to take
dollar bill, and I'm

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.963
going to put it in the
flame just like that.

00:00:36.963 --> 00:00:38.040
[AWED GASPS]

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.360
STUDENT: Whoa!

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.810
DR. BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Was that too fast?

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.520
What we always do in science
is repeat the experiment,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.920
so I take out what looks
like a dollar bill,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.540
but it's not a real dollar bill.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.010
I bring it close to the flame.

00:00:56.794 --> 00:00:58.709
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:00.750
DR. BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Disappears into thin air.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.480
It looks like magic, right?

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.540
I love magic.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.270
Magic is engaging,
but not informative.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.360
JESSICA: How is that dollar
bill burning up so quickly?

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.670
Well, it's actually
not a dollar bill.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.820
It's called flash
paper, and it's

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.730
paper that has been treated
with chemicals to make it burn

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.250
quickly and leave no ashes.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.030
Now, flash paper
has been nitrated.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.730
Practically, what that means
is that you soak the paper

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.720
in a mixture of concentrated
nitric and sulfuric acids.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.610
The cellulose in the
paper then reacts

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.040
with the acid to produce
nitrated cellulose and water.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.230
The reaction is this.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.840
So our nitric acid here
mixes with the cellulose.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.120
Now, this is actually
just one unit

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.880
in the big polymer
that is cellulose.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.590
It's got lots of little units
of C6H10O5, so in this equation,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.810
I'm only writing one unit.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.720
And that's creating nitrated
cellulose and water.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.350
Now, the nitro group, the
NO2 is the reactive group,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.080
and it can be very
reactive depending

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.120
on the molecule that it's in.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.010
You've no doubt heard
of nitroglycerin,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.410
which looks like this.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.650
It's an explosive liquid.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.140
Or TNT, which actually
stands for trinitrotoluene.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.220
It looks like this.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.690
So all of these molecules
have nitro groups in them,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.080
and it's the nitro,
or NO2, groups that

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.050
make these molecules explosive.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.630
Now, let's watch what happens
when Dr. Shakhashiri tries

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.284
this again, but this time,
with a real dollar bill.

00:02:52.284 --> 00:02:53.950
DR. BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
I'd like someone

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.990
in the audience to let me
borrow from them a real $1 bill.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.490
Is there someone
in the audience who

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.865
would let me--
who would trust me

00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:05.380
with a real $1
bill or a $5 bill?

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.350
Steve, how about
a $20 bill, huh?

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.770
You got a $20 bill?

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.530
OK, here's $1 bill.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.399
It's a real $1 bill.

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.440
You know what I'm going
to do with it, don't you?

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.322
So I have a jar right here,
and I have, in this jar--

00:03:19.322 --> 00:03:21.280
what do you suppose--
what does this look like?

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.620
I have a liquid.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.578
What does it look like?

00:03:22.578 --> 00:03:23.090
Looks like?

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.890
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.030
DR. BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
Looks like water.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.160
The way we describe this
liquid is to say it's

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.760
a clear and colorless liquid,
which is what water is.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.600
So I'm going to take
this liquid, and--

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.090
so I want everybody to
see the jar right here.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.000
Get this out of the way.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.740
I'm going to take
the dollar bill.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.340
I'm going to soak it in this
clear and colorless liquid,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.940
which looks like water,
and I'm going to fish it

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.890
out using those tongs.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.089
You see, it's dripping
like any wet object would.

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:54.880
And then I'm going to
take it to the flame.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.240
Take a good look at
it, now, [? Judy. ?]

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.790
It may be the last
time you see it.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.630
So here is the
dollar bill on fire.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.956
Or is it?

00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:03.456
[AWED GASPS]

00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:05.956
DR. BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI: But you
did see a flame, didn't you?

00:04:05.956 --> 00:04:06.550
STUDENT: Yes!

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.870
DR. BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
So now, I ask you,

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.190
can this liquid be water?

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.890
STUDENT: No!

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.890
DR. BASSAM SHAKHASHIRI:
You know from experience

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.080
that water does not burn
under these conditions.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.920
Right?

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.220
So I will tell you
what's in this jar.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.060
This clear and
colorless liquid is

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.070
a mixture of rubbing alcohol
and water, isopropyl alcohol

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.300
and water.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.950
You know also from experience
that when you burn alcohol,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.210
what color flame do you see?

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.240
It's kind of bluish.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.177
You remember what color
flame you saw here?

00:04:35.177 --> 00:04:36.260
It was a little yellowish.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.310
Right?

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.280
That's because we also added a
little bit of sodium chloride

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.240
in there.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.640
The eye is more sensitive
to the yellow color

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.000
than it is to the blue color,
so we added the sodium chloride

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.210
to enhance the visibility
of what's going on.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.370
JESSICA: All right, so
what happened there?

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.910
Dr. Shakhashiri soaked the
money in a solution of water,

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.970
rubbing alcohol, and a
little bit of table salt.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.330
When he puts the money in
the flame, the alcohol burns,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.810
producing heat and light,
energy, and carbon dioxide

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:06.990
and water.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.925
The reaction is this.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.350
There's our alcohol
reacting with oxygen,

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.070
producing carbon dioxide,
water, and energy.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.230
So why doesn't the bill burn?

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.560
If you have a beaker of
alcohol and light it on fire,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.320
it's just that very
top layer of alcohol

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.720
and the gas above it that burns.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.280
The rest of the alcohol
in the beaker does not.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.400
So that's what's happening
with our dollar bill.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.170
Let's draw a dollar
bill right here.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.620
So the alcohol, ROH
could be any alcohol,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.330
is evaporating off the
bill, turning into a gas,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.870
and burning, so those are
the flames that you see.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.280
But remember that the
solution is 50% water.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.580
The water is evaporating much
less quickly than the alcohol,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.410
staying in the bill and
preventing the paper

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.760
from burning.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.190
So that's one way to
hold onto your cash.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.690
Hope you enjoyed
"Money to Burn,"

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.100
and I'll see you next time.
