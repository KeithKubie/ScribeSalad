00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:19.783
In the 11th and 12th centuries,

00:00:19.783 --> 00:00:22.055
most English commoners were illiterate.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.077
Since they had no way to learn the Bible,

00:00:24.077 --> 00:00:26.547
the clergy came up with an inventive solution:

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:29.127
they'd create plays out of certain Bible stories

00:00:29.127 --> 00:00:31.879
so even people who couldn't read could learn them.

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:33.271
These were called mystery plays

00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:35.939
because they revealed the mystery of God's word.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:37.186
At about the same time,

00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:38.970
the clergy also developed plays

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.244
about the saints of the church,

00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:41.904
called miracle plays.

00:00:41.904 --> 00:00:42.859
In the beginning,

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:44.610
the clergy members acted out Bible stories

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.029
on the steps outside the cathedral.

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:48.906
The audience reacted so well

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:51.026
that soon they needed to move out to the street

00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:52.573
around the town square.

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:55.099
By building moving carts to put on each play

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:56.816
and by lining up one after the other,

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:58.828
they could put on cycles of stories,

00:00:58.828 --> 00:00:59.997
which would take the viewer

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:00.695
from Genesis

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:02.039
to Revelation.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.915
These movable carts, called pageants,

00:01:03.915 --> 00:01:06.545
looked like huge boxes on wheels.

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:08.379
Each was two stories tall.

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:09.922
The bottom story was curtained off

00:01:09.922 --> 00:01:12.925
and was used for costumes, props, and dressing.

00:01:12.925 --> 00:01:16.086
The top platform was the stage for the performance.

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:19.095
Spectators assembled in various corners of the town,

00:01:19.095 --> 00:01:20.911
and the pageant would move around in the cycle

00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:24.144
until the villagers had seen the entire series.

00:01:24.144 --> 00:01:25.939
Soon, the plays required more actors

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.648
than the clergy could supply.

00:01:27.648 --> 00:01:29.191
So, by the 13th century,

00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:31.241
different guilds were asked to be responsible

00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:33.862
for acting out different parts of the cycle.

00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:35.447
The assignments were meant to reflect

00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:37.366
the guilds' professions.

00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.651
For example, the carpenter's guild might put on

00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:41.245
the story of Noah's Ark,

00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:44.167
and the baker's guild might put on The Last Supper.

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:46.458
Can you imagine what might happen to the story

00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:49.964
if the butcher's guild put on The Crucifixion of Christ?

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:51.297
Yes, without the clergy,

00:01:51.297 --> 00:01:53.122
the plays soon started changing

00:01:53.122 --> 00:01:55.217
from their true Bible stories.

00:01:55.217 --> 00:01:58.099
By the end of the 14th century, a new form of drama,

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:00.622
called the morality play, had evolved.

00:02:00.622 --> 00:02:01.060
Faith,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.518
truth,

00:02:01.518 --> 00:02:02.030
charity,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.980
and good deeds

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.194
all became characters on the stage.

00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:07.483
And, at the same time, the opposite virtues

00:02:07.483 --> 00:02:08.274
of falsehood,

00:02:08.274 --> 00:02:09.110
covetousness,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.070
worldly flesh,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.954
and the devil

00:02:10.954 --> 00:02:12.951
became the antagonists.

00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:15.451
The morality plays were allegorical stories

00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:18.743
in which these characters battled for the control of the soul.

00:02:18.743 --> 00:02:21.249
Audiences loved the immoral characters,

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:23.097
and spectators were encouraged

00:02:23.097 --> 00:02:24.998
to interact with the actors.

00:02:24.998 --> 00:02:26.461
Throwing rotten food

00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:29.132
and even getting into scuffles with other spectators

00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:30.672
became very common.

00:02:30.672 --> 00:02:32.376
The character of the devil

00:02:32.376 --> 00:02:33.801
often would roam through the crowds

00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:35.671
and pull unsuspecting watchers

00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:38.943
into a hell that was depicted as a dragon's mouth.

00:02:38.943 --> 00:02:41.302
The virtuous Biblical stories had morphed

00:02:41.302 --> 00:02:43.969
into crude and sometimes comic stories.

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.014
The clergy intended to teach against immorality.

00:02:47.014 --> 00:02:49.590
How ironic, then, that the morality plays

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.104
actually encouraged vices as more popular than virtues.

00:02:54.104 --> 00:02:55.707
By the mid-15th century,

00:02:55.707 --> 00:02:58.287
the church started to outlaw these performances.

00:02:58.287 --> 00:03:00.284
Town charters required that any theater

00:03:00.284 --> 00:03:02.613
must be built outside the city wall.

00:03:02.613 --> 00:03:03.874
One of the first theaters

00:03:03.874 --> 00:03:06.359
was built like a larger version of a pageant,

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.074
with tiers of gallery seating

00:03:08.074 --> 00:03:11.128
encircling a grassy area in front of the stage.

00:03:11.128 --> 00:03:12.341
Sound familiar?

00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:13.568
A young William Shakespeare

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:16.205
developed his craft here at the theater

00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:18.565
that was eventually renamed The Globe.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:21.566
The medieval morality play had led to Renaissance playwrights

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:23.456
who were inspired by the inner struggles

00:03:23.456 --> 00:03:25.237
and the conscience of man.

00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:27.657
And that, in essence, is how drama emerged

00:03:27.657 --> 00:03:30.207
as a literary art form.
