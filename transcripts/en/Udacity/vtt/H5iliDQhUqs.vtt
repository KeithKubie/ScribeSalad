00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.200
Great!

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.780
You've just implemented the work
horse of a very complex and

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.960
powerful design pattern,
the IntentService.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.200
To learn about intents and
how android uses them for

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.260
a synchronized functionality, check back
to the android fundamentals courses.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.600
They will make you a better developer.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.650
Now that you've built the service,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.290
you'll need to build the activity
that calls the service.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.860
Remember earlier we saw it.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.290
You'd press a button and

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.140
various activity types will
appear on your screen.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.730
Well that's what's next on your list,
so let's get coding.
