[MUSIC PLAYING - PROTEST SONG]

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.450
NOMI PRINS: So the imagery in
that is sort of a walk through,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.610
to an extent, the
parts of the world

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.220
that I was in in the putting
together of this book.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.680
And those parts of the
world were also historical,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.312
as well as geographical.

00:04:00.312 --> 00:04:02.520
The last book I wrote, "All
the President's Bankers,"

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.620
was very much historical.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.010
It went through the last century
and a bit of the relationship

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.100
of presidents in both
parties and the bankers,

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.290
and just what the actual
personal relationships were

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.010
and how they were interacting
before various types of world

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.250
events-- wars,
policies, and so forth.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.200
And this was kind of
that, but from just the 10

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.490
years since the
financial crisis of 2008.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.680
And then rather going back to
the history of one country,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.860
I sort of expanded it to
what's happened globally

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.930
since the financial crisis.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.970
And to get to the
punch line first--

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.130
because I also want
you to feel like you

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.810
can interrupt me
and ask questions.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.830
I know I'm here to
speak to you, but you're

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.280
a very informed group.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.970
And so I think that if
I say something that's

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.060
either troubling, or confusing,
or you want me to expand,

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.070
or whatever it might
be, just shout out,

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.740
because I think that that
will be a good thing.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.250
But anyway, so I divide
my book into the regions

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.200
of the world that were
either involved, or affected,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.750
or impacted by the
financial crisis and then

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.640
how they've acted
differently since then.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.840
And I talk about collusion.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.800
It's not about Russia.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.577
It's not about politics--

00:05:12.577 --> 00:05:14.910
well, everything is ultimately
about money and politics,

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.451
but that's not the
point of the book.

00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:19.320
The point of the book is to look
at what the main central banks

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.470
in the world have done, in
an unprecedented way since

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.580
the financial crisis, to
artificially stimulate

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.300
the financial system-- the banks
and subsequently the markets--

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.360
in a way that's been
very historically epic

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.490
in terms of size,
but also in terms

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.311
of just their
unlimited capabilities,

00:05:38.311 --> 00:05:39.810
in terms of the
amounts that they've

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.860
created, in terms of no
auditing, no information going

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.500
in and out as to where
that money actually goes.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.750
And so what I did was, I didn't
have a chapter on the Federal

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.690
Reserve, which I'll
talk about a bit more

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.730
in a second, which is kind
of the central character.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.689
If we look at central
banks as just characters

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.980
throughout the world, and
the individuals that run them

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.310
as just the characters that
are part of those scenes,

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.910
I took 2008 as the beginning of
each chapter and each region.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.740
And I always started
there and then looked

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.210
at how that region was impacted.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.764
So I go to Mexico, to
Brazil, to China, to Japan,

00:06:12.764 --> 00:06:13.680
and throughout Europe.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.200
And each time, I go back to the
beginning and say, OK, well,

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.190
this is the perspective
of what happened

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.190
between the Federal Reserve
of the United States

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.610
and this area.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.530
And this is how the
fallout occurred.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.980
Or this is how they
expanded, but not really.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.950
And my general
theme is that having

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.410
had an unprecedented amount
of money being thrown

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.710
into the system, fabricated
or manufactured or conjured

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.710
by the central banks, has really
distorted the idea of value.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.810
It's even distorted
the idea of how

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.630
companies who actually show
their profits and losses based

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.380
on actual cash, actual revenues
and so forth, that aren't

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.040
artificially stimulated
by money coming in

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.340
from an outside
source are operating

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.040
in a world in which there
are also ones that are.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.890
And so in terms of just
the graph of that--

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.460
I wasn't, again, going to do
slides, because I tend to--

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.450
I can just write on this.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.790
So the way that looks--

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.890
and if anyone wants
me to just mention

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.960
what a central bank is while
I'm making sure these write--

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.460
does everybody know
what a central bank is?

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.480
OK.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.150
So basically, a central bank--
and the Fed, in particular,

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.260
here--

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.120
was usually designed to provide
emergency capital in the event

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.060
that the financial system
can't produce it for itself.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.560
It's going to create
a bigger crisis

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.090
for the rest of the economy.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.270
There needs to be a
particular reaction to, say,

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.130
a war, or interplanetary aliens
coming, or something like that.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:45.210
And the reality is that they
have clauses in their mandates

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.570
that are emergency clauses
to be able to do this.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.470
So it's all quite legal.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.710
And I'm not advocating that
the collusion of central banks

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.049
is something that's illegal--

00:07:54.049 --> 00:07:55.590
I do get asked that
question-- but it

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.006
is something that's,
to an extent,

00:07:57.006 --> 00:08:00.120
deceitful because, by
having a large supply

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.060
of artificial money that
has no limitation in terms

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.340
of when and how it
can be fabricated,

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.270
as it has been the last 10
years, that distortion thing

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.530
does create a level of deceit.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:11.970
So one of the
things that happened

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.500
since the financial crisis--

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.330
I'm bad at drawing, but I'm
just going to-- this is 2008,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.080
and this is now.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.800
And I have this on my Twitter,
this particular graph.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.649
But I thought it was cool,
because it was three lines.

00:08:27.649 --> 00:08:29.940
One was the Federal Reserve
and how much money and when

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.870
it dumped it into the system.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.960
One is the Bank of Japan.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.631
And one is the
European Central Bank.

00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:37.380
Because the idea of
this collusion is that

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.220
the major-country central banks
have also adopted a cheap money

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.330
policy and a
quantitative easing,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.380
or buying securities policy--

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.124
buying bonds, buying
ETFs, or buying stocks

00:08:48.124 --> 00:08:50.290
if you're in Japan, buying
corporate bonds if you're

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:50.950
in Europe--

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.310
where they've been able to
fabricate money and decide

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.590
where, effectively,
they want to invest it.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.540
But they go through a
financial system that

00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.860
has an impact on the market.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.160
So the Fed kind of
started this in 2008.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.180
And they did some
sort of a taper,

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.330
in terms of-- this line
represents the amount of money

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:14.374
they conjured since the
2008 period to buy--

00:09:14.374 --> 00:09:15.790
in the case of the
United States--

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.800
Treasury bonds,
government bonds,

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.890
and mortgage bonds from
the banking system.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:26.110
And so this is 2015.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.580
This isn't really--
it's a tiny line down.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.410
Though they haven't
continued here,

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.600
they have a pretty high value--

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:40.960
$4.5 trillion of what I consider
to be subsidies for the banking

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.210
system in the market because
they're really coming out

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:48.610
of the electronic
activities of the Fed.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.920
So this is the Fed line.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.690
Colors don't mean
anything, by the way.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:57.370
I'm just randomly
picking colors.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:00.790
Then the European
Central Bank came in

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.610
and did something
similar, except that they

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.050
were kind of here.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.530
And then they kind of did that.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.400
So this is the
European Central Bank.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.150
This is 2012 where--

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.270
my bad geometrics is such
that they kind of accelerated

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:25.370
their process of being
involved in quantitative easing

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.490
by a lot when there was a
credit crisis in Europe.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.735
So the minute there wasn't
enough money in Europe--

00:10:30.735 --> 00:10:33.110
they thought they had recovered,
they really hadn't, they

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.450
were still adopting the policy
of colluding with the Fed

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.830
to produce money in the system--

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.880
they accelerated.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.410
And in this period
of time where the Fed

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.640
stopped putting as much in,
they accelerated even further.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:53.400
So now they're around
that $5.5 trillion.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.780
And then the Bank of Japan--

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.500
which was the bank that actually
created quantitative easing

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.290
to begin with-- they came
up in 2001 with this idea

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.510
that if they produced
money into the system,

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.240
because their banks were
basically undergoing

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.150
a collapse in the
beginning of the 2000s,

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.260
that they would have
a way to help them.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.300
And they did produce money.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.250
They did engage in
quantitative easing,

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.780
but it was really, really tiny.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.000
So I talk about, in
my Japan chapter,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.100
how Ben Bernanke, who
was the chair of the Fed

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.120
when all this kind of started,
goes in front of Congress

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.620
and talks about how
what we're doing

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.090
is not what the
Japanese are doing.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.504
It's really different.

00:11:27.504 --> 00:11:28.920
We're doing it for
other purposes.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.010
But the reality is that
the mechanism's the same.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.270
They're producing money in order
to increase the money supply,

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.361
in order to then
decide where it goes--

00:11:37.361 --> 00:11:39.110
into the banking system,
into corporations

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.780
who then borrow it, which then
goes into the stock market

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.100
or other financial assets.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.050
So the Bank of Japan
was kind of also here.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:58.200
And then in about
2013, they did that.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.330
So they're around $5
trillion right now.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.120
And basically, the reason
they had an acceleration

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:11.990
in about 2013, 2014 is because,
from an economic perspective,

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.600
having watched all
of this happen,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.800
the prime minister, the
head of Japan, Shinzo Abe,

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.780
decided that we should
be doing the same thing,

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.970
or doing more so
of that in Japan.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:28.010
And so the head of the central
bank now in Japan, Kuroda--

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.410
this is Mario Draghi.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.064
Currently, this now at the Fed,
through a different period.

00:12:34.064 --> 00:12:35.480
It says Jerome
Powell, but there's

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.160
been three different Fed heads,
two different Japanese heads,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.800
and two different European
heads over this time period.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.410
They've all engaged
in the same process.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.240
And as a result, there's about--

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.100
well, this is $15 trillion.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.476
But when you aggregate
all of these numbers

00:12:53.476 --> 00:12:54.850
and you aggregate
all this graph,

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.410
the level of money
that's continuing

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.010
to be conjured and dumped
into the system is going up.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.220
So when you hear in the news
that the Fed is tapering,

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.080
that they're doing
this, and this somehow

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.380
is a reflection of
their experiment

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.710
in quantitative easing and
cheap money succeeding,

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.600
you have to understand-- and
this is the collusive efforts

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.470
involved-- that
collectively, the world is

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.010
increasing their amount
of quantitative easing.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.760
It's just happening
in different countries

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.900
for different reasons.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.480
And in the European
Central Bank realm,

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.020
it's being dumped into
corporates, for the most part.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.500
And in Japan, it's a combination
of government bonds and stocks.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.565
And in the US, it's
kind of stopped.

00:13:34.565 --> 00:13:36.940
But it was a combination of
government bonds and mortgage

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:37.440
bonds.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.310
So it was always going
into the place that

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:43.890
needed the most help, but
the, say, corporations

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.620
in Europe that needed that help
were receiving it basically

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.360
without giving very
much in return.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.304
The European Central
Bank would decide, well,

00:13:51.304 --> 00:13:53.470
we're going to give money
to this particular company

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.530
in Germany, versus these
particular companies in Greece.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.230
And that was, in a lot of
ways, a political decision.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.650
But the monetary
elements of that

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.080
enabled certain countries,
and certain companies,

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.330
and certain stocks
to go higher simply

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.210
because there was an
outside artificial source

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:11.770
to push things higher.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.010
And so when I started going
around the world and examining

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:19.360
what the real actors were
doing throughout this period--

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.490
this is just kind of the
summary, and the summary,

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:29.391
again, looks like this,
from a half a trillion--

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.190
there's a picture that
starts to be developed.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.100
And that's that the ones
that had the ability

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.810
to produce money did.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.030
Their markets have risen
more substantially.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.180
There has been more
speculation outside

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.930
of those markets
because, once they go up,

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:46.805
where else do you go?

00:14:46.805 --> 00:14:47.610
Capital flows out.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:48.360
It goes to Mexico.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.470
It goes to Brazil and so forth.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.220
But in those kinds of countries,
there is less of an ability,

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.780
and they didn't
choose, necessarily,

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.850
to get involved in
quantitative easing.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:00.204
So there was an entire
political ramification

00:15:00.204 --> 00:15:01.620
that doesn't really
get discussed,

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.360
behind just the value
of money and the amount

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.734
of quantitative easing that
these major central banks are

00:15:05.734 --> 00:15:09.420
doing that actually has
changed the shape of the world.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:15.580
So the first country I go to in
collusion is actually Mexico.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.320
And the reason I did
that is because I

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.840
spent a lot of time working with
companies in Mexico and stuff.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.637
But basically, the Mexican
government and the individuals

00:15:24.637 --> 00:15:26.220
who were really
involved in the period

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.800
from 2008 to 2018
that were running

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.050
the central bank in Mexico
had real strong opinions

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.520
about what the Fed was doing.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.990
And a lot of countries
had strong opinions

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.670
about what the Fed was
doing because, to an extent,

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:36.530
it's just not fair.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.040
It's not really capitalism.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.390
It's not really free markets.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:43.230
It's kind of like a subsidy
for the financial system

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.750
that then has major
ramifications of creating

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:46.800
an artificial system.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.950
And that can go terribly
wrong very quickly

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.770
if it gets taken away, which is
why it's not being taken away.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:54.480
And there's
ramifications to that.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.390
So what Mexico decided in
2008-- and their economy

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.850
was actually doing fine.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.226
The crisis happens
north of the border.

00:16:02.226 --> 00:16:04.350
In the beginning, they say,
well, it doesn't really

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.995
affect us.

00:16:04.995 --> 00:16:05.995
It's a financial crisis.

00:16:05.995 --> 00:16:07.230
It's contained in the banks.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.396
The Fed's taking care of it.

00:16:08.396 --> 00:16:10.740
But then it starts to become
apparent very, very quickly

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.180
that that's not the
case, that if there's

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.440
a recession in the
States, or if there's

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.080
a depression in the States,
or if the financing closes up

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.420
and there's no credit going
throughout the system,

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.130
it impacts everyone.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.320
So the head of the central
bank of Mexico, a guy

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.446
named Guillermo Ortiz,
he went to Washington.

00:16:25.446 --> 00:16:26.820
He was part of
the establishment.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.860
He sort of floated in the
economic ideas of the Fed

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:32.850
governors and so forth.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.060
He goes up to Washington, and
he says to Ben Bernanke, look,

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.107
we've seen this movie.

00:16:37.107 --> 00:16:37.940
We know how it ends.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.030
It doesn't end well.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.980
We had the tequila
crisis in '94.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.870
We restructured
our banking system.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.500
Smaller banks got eaten up.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.990
People got thrown out of jobs.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.890
Companies closed.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.990
It took us a really
long time to recover.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.210
And more than just the
economic problems of recovery,

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.760
our people lost
confidence in the system.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.690
And there, that manifested in
lots of crowds in the streets.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.200
But the point was, if
you simply create money

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.829
to simply help the financial
system, to help the banks,

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:08.040
it's not really stable capital.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.173
It's not really
ultimately going to work.

00:17:11.173 --> 00:17:12.089
There will be bubbles.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:13.500
There will be problems.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.829
And Ben Bernanke
says, thanks, doesn't

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.357
cover Ortiz and
his memoirs at all,

00:17:19.357 --> 00:17:21.690
even though this meeting was
covered by "The Wall Street

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:22.190
Journal."

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.430
It was public.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:28.590
And he basically goes about in
manufacturing this emergency

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:31.560
quantitative easing amount,
and then has the whole world

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.400
join in.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.110
Why does the whole
world join in?

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.790
Or why do the major
countries join in

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.520
to any quantitative
easing movement?

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.970
Because if you have
capital in the US--

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.310
and money is made
very cheap so it's

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.080
more liquid to the
financial system

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.440
so they can sort out
the stuff they did--

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.660
and rates are higher
elsewhere, in particular,

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.070
in the main countries
with which there is trade,

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.950
or with which the banks
have relationships,

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.610
then the money is
going to leave.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.820
And so the only way to keep
the dollar strong enough

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.080
and keep the money in the US
is to export the same method

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.110
to the countries that have
the largest relationships.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:11.230
So something like Mexico has to
also deal with its own economy.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.520
So if it reduces
rates by too much,

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.970
that will cause
inflation in the economy,

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.480
because it has a more direct
impact on actual people

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.090
and on actual prices, because
it's a smaller economy

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.300
to begin with, and it's
reliant on other economies

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.740
for its trade by more so.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.970
So Ortiz didn't want
to reduce rates,

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.800
like the Fed was
doing, very quickly.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.220
And they couldn't produce
money electronically to buy

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.629
securities in Mexico-- they
didn't have the same capacity--

00:18:41.629 --> 00:18:42.420
and so they didn't.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.050
So he didn't.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.060
He went about
criticizing the US.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.070
As a result, he lost his job--

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.440
or he didn't get
reappointed to be the head

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.760
of the central bank of Mexico.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.130
And the subsequent
appointee, a man

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:58.724
named Agustin Carstens, who
also was in the same group

00:18:58.724 --> 00:19:01.140
as the people running the Fed,
Treasury Department, and so

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:01.989
forth, came in.

00:19:01.989 --> 00:19:04.530
And he at first said, OK, I'll
do what the Fed's going to do.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.090
I'll reduce rates.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.910
I'll keep it sort of stable
between the border of Mexico

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:09.520
and the US.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.790
I'll follow along.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.330
He used to go public
about the fact

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.349
that this easing
was going to help

00:19:14.349 --> 00:19:16.890
the real economy-- ultimately
will trickle out of the banking

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.431
system and out of
the markets, and it

00:19:18.431 --> 00:19:20.460
will help real growth
and long-term growth

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.972
and wages and everything else.

00:19:21.972 --> 00:19:23.430
And that's what he
said originally.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.755
That's how he got that
job and had that job

00:19:25.755 --> 00:19:26.880
for a while in this period.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.630
But the reality was
they didn't do that.

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.750
And he started feeling
the political pressure

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:38.069
in Mexico of the fact that
Mexico wasn't really getting

00:19:38.069 --> 00:19:39.610
any of this money
into their economy.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.700
And it was very, very obvious.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.580
And so he started criticizing
the Fed and everything else.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.180
And he ultimately resigned
before the end of his term,

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.170
last year.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.000
And he's now the
head of the Bank

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.680
of International
Settlements, which

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.140
is the central bank
of central banks

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.570
that does reporting on
all of these activities

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:01.140
and always used to support
the Fed, the IMF, the World

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.710
Bank, the ECB when it
came into being, as doing

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.330
the right thing by
their economies,

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.210
by employment versus inflation,
which is one of their mandates,

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.040
by helping their system.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:17.130
And it was created, basically,
as a unified US-Europe entity

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.060
to begin with.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.370
It's starting to
have real critiques.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.260
And the fact that it is now
run by someone who bought,

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.980
then kind of sold, the
policy of the United States

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.810
and is now at the head
of that institution

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.390
really shows a shift in
general in the world in terms

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.880
of how it looks at what the
end game of this could be,

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.790
how risky it could be for
the rest of the world,

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.180
and is just simply questioning
how long this can go on.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.244
So that's been one shift.

00:20:40.244 --> 00:20:42.660
Another shift-- it's a longer
story; I won't get into it--

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.720
is in Brazil, because
that has so many

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.980
of its own pieces of corruption,
and scandals, and government

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.640
overthrows, and so forth.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.670
But one of the people
who's currently

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.670
running for the
presidency of Brazil

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.280
is a man named
Henrique Meirelles.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.430
I pronounced it "Meireyes,"
because for some reason,

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:03.827
my Portuguese is very bad.

00:21:03.827 --> 00:21:05.910
I was corrected last night,
actually, in Berkeley,

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:07.890
about my pronunciation
of his name.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.770
But he was someone who was head
of the central bank of Brazil

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:14.370
when this all started, when the
crisis all started happening.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.760
And he and the president of
Brazil at the time, Lula,

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.546
who's now in jail,
was at first saying,

00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:22.920
Brazil's not going
to be impacted

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.350
by the crisis, same way Mexico
said it wasn't going to be,

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.780
until they were very
shortly thereafter.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.950
And he wanted to do
what the US was doing.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:36.000
The party in power, who
became in power, the Workers'

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.220
Party, headed by a woman
named Dilma Rousseff,

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.460
said no, we want to
maintain help for Brazil.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.830
He says, we want to do
what the US-- so he loses.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.142
He doesn't get appointed to
be the central bank leader.

00:21:46.142 --> 00:21:47.850
And he goes back into
the private sector.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.060
He winds up being the
minister of finance when

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.530
her government was overthrown.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:56.520
And so he's basically gone
from being a central banker,

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.240
to private sector, to being
a minister of finance.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.920
And now he's running
for president.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.250
In the meantime, Brazil,
during that period--

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.580
and this is just where politics
meets monetary policy--

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.340
has basically reduced
its rates from--

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.930
this is a completely
separate graph,

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.820
this doesn't count
on that graph--

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.720
reduced their rates
from 14.5% to 6.5%

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.390
in a very short period of time.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:27.210
Mexico has raised its
rates from 3.5% to 7.5%

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.540
in the last few years as well.

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.720
So they've gone
independent of the Fed.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.810
They've gone sort of
dependent on the Fed.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.354
And that really manifests
into political relationships.

00:22:36.354 --> 00:22:37.770
If you're an
investor, it actually

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:40.590
also manifests into figuring
out why this has happened,

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.720
because it's very unique
that, actually, Mexico

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:47.220
has higher rates than Brazil.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.550
So there was a lot of shakeout,
as well, from a monetary policy

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.250
perspective, where
government bonds are trading,

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.560
where stocks are
trading, and who's

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.860
shifting in the power
relationships of central banks

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.199
and also the governments.

00:23:00.199 --> 00:23:01.740
Now, central banks
are supposed to be

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.450
independent of governments.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.070
That's how they are mandated.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.010
So supposedly, the
Federal Reserve

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:12.120
is independent of whatever
the US government wants to do.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.540
The Bank of Japan
is independent.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.392
And I went through a
lot of documentation.

00:23:17.392 --> 00:23:19.350
I had this team of
researchers around the world

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:20.980
who knew languages
that I didn't know.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:25.020
And so we were looking at
real media publications

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.480
at the time, real documents
and research information that

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.970
was coming from these
central banks themselves.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.810
And it was interesting,
because there

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.032
was a lot of both
criticism of what

00:23:34.032 --> 00:23:36.240
was happening on the outside
and trying to figure out

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.490
if they should adopt
it on the inside, which

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:41.610
is part of where
there's a lot of tension

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.760
and still tension in the world.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:49.800
But China, which is
the middle of the book,

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.940
is a place that has grown
in its "superpowerness",

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.640
from an economic perspective,
and also its relationships

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.940
with other countries.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.740
And one of the reasons it
doesn't get talked about

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.400
is that it chose
to criticize, very

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:10.380
vocally, the monetary policy
of the United States because

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.260
of this whole creation
of money policy.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.970
Now, it has created
money as well,

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:18.457
but it chooses to do it
outside of the main G7 groups.

00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:20.040
And it does it for
different purposes.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.485
And you probably
know this here--

00:24:21.485 --> 00:24:23.110
it does it for building
infrastructure,

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:27.000
for paying for technology, and
R&amp;D, and individuals, and also

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.840
for trade alliances with other
countries in that region,

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.930
with Mexico, with Brazil,
in order to establish itself

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.290
as a sort of more--

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.390
both from a trade perspective
and a monetary perspective--

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:40.650
superpower.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:45.150
The reason that all started
to happen in 2008, 2009

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.060
is because the head of
the central bank in China,

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.180
at the People's Bank of
China, got very public

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.130
with his criticism of the Fed.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.560
Ultimately, the Chinese
currency, the ren,

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.370
was accepted into the IMF's
special drawing rights

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.620
basket, which is
the representation

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:02.640
of the main currencies.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.370
It had always been the
dollar and the euro--

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.350
which had before that
been the German mark

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:09.090
and the French franc--

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.310
and the Japanese yen
and the British pound.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:15.660
And in this period of time,
the Chinese currency, the ren,

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.260
became part of this basket,
because even the IMF that

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:23.100
had been established to
really work on the reserve

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.620
currencies of the dollar
and the euro, mainly,

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.960
was beginning to criticize
whether all this money being

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.612
dumped in the system, when it is
retracted, or when rates rise,

00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:32.820
or when something goes wrong
with all the debt that's

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.640
been created on the back
of it, causes problems

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.720
throughout the developing world,
causes problems within the US.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.900
So they've been very
critical of late as well.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.810
But China's been
able to utilize that

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.150
in order to really
become and create

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:51.510
more trade agreements, and
more currency arrangements,

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:55.080
and also develop their alliances
and their own companies

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:55.672
within China.

00:25:55.672 --> 00:25:57.630
That's what they've been
doing with that money.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:58.860
We really haven't been.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.190
We've been-- just as a
sort of super power--

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.660
this money has
predominantly gone

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.950
into financial speculation,
into the markets.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.760
It hasn't been dedicated
to building a railway,

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.190
or building a canal,
or anything like that,

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:14.774
or lending to other
countries in order

00:26:14.774 --> 00:26:17.106
for them to be able to do
that, because they're partners

00:26:17.106 --> 00:26:18.780
and that strengthens
them, and therefore

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.650
the trade relationship.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:23.404
We've really gone off the
rails relative to that.

00:26:23.404 --> 00:26:25.320
That's not to say China
doesn't have problems,

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.180
it's just to say that,
in this period of time,

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:33.690
money's been created here,
and in Europe, and in Japan,

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:39.070
and to a lesser extent in the
UK, for a different reason.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:41.820
And that reason has been
more of a financial reason,

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.630
and not so much as a long-term
economic stability reason,

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:46.860
as it has in Asia.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.320
I talked a little
bit about Europe

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.040
in the last chapter of the book.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.170
But one of the things that's
come out of the ECB's policy--

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.676
aside from the fact that there
is criticism from certain

00:26:57.676 --> 00:27:00.300
countries, like Germany against
the ECB-- because they're like,

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.790
our country's fine, we have
savers, we're developing,

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.920
we don't need this
whole easing thing,

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.160
we don't want to be concerned
about bubbles bursting--

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.260
is that the southern
part of Europe--

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.880
Greece, Italy,
Spain, and so forth--

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.550
haven't had the benefit
of the same amount

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:15.499
of money being put in.

00:27:15.499 --> 00:27:17.040
So when there's a
lot of money that's

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.300
put in in one part
of the market,

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.159
and it's not divided,
or even selected,

00:27:25.159 --> 00:27:27.200
or chosen to be put in
other parts of the market,

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.950
it creates inequalities, and
volatility, and instability.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.360
So what we've seen in
the last few months,

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.380
in even our stock
market, is this beginning

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:40.280
of more volatility
coming into the market,

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.950
more defaults and
delinquencies coming

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.750
into some of the
corporate bonds that

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.380
were issued because
money was so cheap,

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.110
and therefore repaying
the debt was so low--

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.510
but the debt payments
will get higher, and also

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.010
money coming out
of the stock market

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.840
to make debt payments-- and
then separately, buybacks,

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.010
which keep the level
of the market up.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.590
So you have these two
competing forces of capital

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.240
that are creating
more volatility now.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.150
You have cheap money
still available.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:10.790
You have a lot of buybacks--
some from companies that have

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.810
cash, and some from companies
that have received cash--

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:14.730
but nonetheless.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:18.530
And then you also have cracks in
the system from both the rumors

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:21.640
that are in the market as to
whether or not this can stop.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.690
Any time any of these
central bank leaders

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.850
talk about the possibility
of it stopping,

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.767
the markets tend to get
really, really upset.

00:28:27.767 --> 00:28:29.600
And then the next
meeting, there's like, oh,

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.380
we didn't really mean it.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.460
There isn't really inflation.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.543
There isn't really growth.

00:28:32.543 --> 00:28:34.040
We're going to stop--

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.210
which is what he does a lot.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:36.168
I mean, they all do it.

00:28:36.168 --> 00:28:41.652
But it's interesting, because
even the Japanese last week had

00:28:41.652 --> 00:28:42.860
a meeting, the Bank of Japan.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:43.805
And they came out
and they said, well,

00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:46.880
we're going to probably have to
keep doing this, like, forever.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.410
They used the term "unlimited."

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:51.424
Mario Draghi said
the same thing a week

00:28:51.424 --> 00:28:54.090
and a half ago when the European
Central Bank came out and said,

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.960
yes, we're keeping
rates negative.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.411
And we're also going to
continue our quantitative easing

00:28:58.411 --> 00:28:58.910
program.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:00.020
So these line up.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.121
The Fed is kind of-- yes?

00:29:02.121 --> 00:29:03.620
AUDIENCE: So I just
have a question.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.211
Is there really an alternative
to printing all this money?

00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:08.210
Because if you look at
the rate of debt creation

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.650
over the past 30,
almost 40 years,

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:14.550
debt growth has exceeded GDP
growth almost that entire time.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.000
There are projections that
so many public pensions will

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.394
be insolvent, that there's
no mathematical way

00:29:19.394 --> 00:29:20.310
to make that possible.

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.600
So is unlimited money
printing just the easiest way

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.350
to kind of softly
default on that,

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:28.220
rather than causing some
catastrophic collapse?

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.070
NOMI PRINS: Well, or having to
worry about a solution to it.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.680
I mean, yes, debt has increased
over the last 30 or 40

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.580
years relative to GDP, but
it's accelerated by a lot.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.432
It's increased because it's
had this sort of plaster over.

00:29:40.432 --> 00:29:42.140
So if the financial
system, which kind of

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:47.490
started this in 2008 and
was on the brink of what

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:49.490
it said to be collapse,
there are different ways

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:50.570
that that could
have been addressed.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.100
One way would have
been to let one

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.650
or two extra banks collapse.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:58.160
And that really sounded
harsh at the time,

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.680
but throughout Wall Street,
banks have collapsed.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.540
It's not like that
hadn't happened.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.290
And the problem was there was
so much attention focused on

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:09.380
whether that was going to create
a massive depression going

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.677
forward that there was
no conversation, or very

00:30:11.677 --> 00:30:13.135
limited conversation,
in Washington

00:30:13.135 --> 00:30:15.070
as to doing something else.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:17.170
You're, I'm sure, very mathy.

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:20.480
The reality-- I'll just go
back for one little explanation

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.390
of how I saw that--

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:27.200
was, at the time of the
2008 financial crisis,

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.410
which was predicated on mortgage
bonds, and all the derivatives

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:33.890
associated with them, and all
the credit and insurance that

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:36.650
was traded between
banks, and all that,

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:38.060
there was only
like $0.5 trillion

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:41.030
worth of upset
subprime mortgages

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.700
in the market at the time,
or $0.5 trillion, right?

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.640
There was $14 trillion
worth of toxic assets,

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:51.080
of assets that were reliant on
those subprime mortgages paying

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.510
their interest, and if
they didn't get paid,

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:57.560
would start to
deteriorate in value.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.980
Banks lent to investors
around the world,

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.610
including pension funds,
or helped pension funds,

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:08.790
including municipalities,
corporations,

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:12.020
other financial
entities, 10 times that.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.680
So $140 trillion,
effectively, was on offer,

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:21.560
going after $0.5 trillion
of subprime-related assets.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.730
So that problem is what
caused an acceleration

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:30.920
of the production of
artificial capital

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.600
in order to solve
what was really

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.990
a major financial crisis.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.800
It was.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.300
But what could have
been done is you

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.883
could have just paid
off $0.5 trillion

00:31:39.883 --> 00:31:42.110
worth of subprime mortgages.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:44.069
And forget whether that's
an ideology of you're

00:31:44.069 --> 00:31:45.985
paying people who didn't
deserve it, or banks.

00:31:45.985 --> 00:31:46.770
It doesn't matter.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:50.810
The economics of it would
have been far, far cheaper.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.170
Instead, the decision
was made to plaster

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:57.560
over that and to start
this creation of 0%

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.050
money so that banks would have
the liquidity to start to--

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:02.540
whoever was still left
standing-- to repay each other,

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.161
so that companies
could repay some

00:32:04.161 --> 00:32:05.660
of the money they
had borrowed, that

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.850
were still left standing,
that were involved in this.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:15.080
And as a result, it has created
an extra level of capital

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.145
in the system that
makes debt accelerate.

00:32:18.145 --> 00:32:22.450
And it also makes stock
levels go up artificially,

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:24.870
so that the next time there
is a crisis you're falling

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.760
from a much higher height.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.640
So absolutely, they
want that not to happen,

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.320
which is why every single time a
Fed chair says there is growth,

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.450
there's inflation--

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:36.990
like, you can
trade this, I mean,

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:39.240
if you're just even looking
at this from an investment

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.380
perspective--

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.350
it's going to be followed
by some major hiccup

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.900
in the market, and then some
other central bank, or maybe

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.660
the same one, or someone
in their country,

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.737
saying well, no,
we didn't mean it.

00:32:51.737 --> 00:32:53.820
The European Central Bank
was talking about growth

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.710
a minute ago, so was
the Bank of England.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.210
They were going to
be raising rates.

00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:59.640
All these rumors in the
market, it put the pound up.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.880
And Brexit's fine.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.910
It's all going to be worked out.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:04.620
The Central Bank is
going to raise rates.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:05.620
It's a sign of strength.

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.250
It's going to help our currency
into negotiations with Europe.

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:12.360
There's all these discussions,
and media narratives,

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.340
and politics going
on back and forth.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.170
The reality is they
don't have the growth.

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:18.990
And the Central Bank head
last week said, by the way,

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:22.020
things aren't so great.

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.560
They can raise rates on
Thursday, they're not going to,

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.230
I think, because actually, the
numbers don't bear them out.

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:31.500
And also, it hurt the market.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.810
And so yes, you are right.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:35.350
Long answer to your question.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:37.410
But the reality is they
want to keep this going.

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:38.880
They found a method to do it.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.414
And that just means
that when things crack,

00:33:41.414 --> 00:33:43.830
they crack from a much higher
height than they would have,

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:48.270
or even did during 2008.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.100
AUDIENCE: So now we
have $4.5 trillion

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.965
in the market as money supply?

00:33:51.965 --> 00:33:52.980
NOMI PRINS: Extra.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:53.280
AUDIENCE: Extra.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:53.760
Exactly.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.900
And I was wondering,
how come inflation

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.510
hasn't happened, because all
of this money are in the banks?

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.093
NOMI PRINS: It's
such a good question.

00:33:59.093 --> 00:34:02.297
And different people ask
that in different settings

00:34:02.297 --> 00:34:03.630
for, I think, different reasons.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:08.010
And I think that
inflation has not

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:11.040
risen on the average
generic way that inflation

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.540
is considered and calculated
because this money has inflated

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.210
markets.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:20.130
This is inflation.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:26.010
The level-- well, a third graph
would-- well this and the stock

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:31.110
market, so it's
dipped a little bit,

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.790
but it's sort of like that.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:44.610
And you have QE1, QE2, QE3,
Europe, Japan, and so forth.

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:47.190
Ultimately, this $15
trillion, and $21 trillion

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:49.440
if you add in all the other
banks that are involved,

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.170
and the market level is
pretty much the same.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:55.320
So there has been a tremendous
amount of inflation.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.790
There's been inflation
in the money supply

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:58.831
that has gone into inflation
of financial assets.

00:34:58.831 --> 00:35:01.090
It's gone into lining new debt.

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:03.420
It's gone into inflating
the value of stock,

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.000
because it's been an artificial
source of money that's

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.700
been used not just
for stock buybacks,

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.837
because that's kind of a
one-to-one relationship.

00:35:10.837 --> 00:35:12.420
But all along the
way, it's been there

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.940
as a sort of security
blanket for banks

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:18.210
to be able to leverage more
companies, or leveraging more.

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:22.596
Right now, actually, on
average, companies in the S&amp;P

00:35:22.596 --> 00:35:23.970
are leveraged more
than they were

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:25.430
before the financial crisis.

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:29.340
So there's inflation, but it's
not inflation of real prices.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.220
Where it had been for a
while, for example, in Mexico

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.010
where they were reducing rates,
it was inflating real prices,

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:38.070
because the relationship
of that central bank

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.040
and that monetary policy
was more closely connected

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.660
to the real economy.

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.530
And the fact that we don't have
inflation in these countries--

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:50.160
because we don't, officially,
but we have inflation

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.495
in financial assets-- is
a sign of how just sort

00:35:54.495 --> 00:35:58.136
of off the rails this has gone.

00:35:58.136 --> 00:36:00.450
AUDIENCE: And my second
question, quickly.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.640
But also, we used to have
the gold standard, which

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.181
would basically be
something we could

00:36:04.181 --> 00:36:07.380
peg the actual value
of the dollar to.

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.590
Today, we don't have that.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:10.230
But we also have
petro dollars, which

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:13.290
are representing an asset or
resource that can be traded.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:15.884
Is that also why the
dollar is so strong,

00:36:15.884 --> 00:36:18.300
and we haven't lost the value
of the dollar in the market?

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.624
Or is that completely
unrelated to--

00:36:20.624 --> 00:36:22.290
NOMI PRINS: It's not
entirely unrelated.

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:26.160
The concept of the gold standard
was something or has been

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.740
something-- not returning
to it exactly as it was

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:33.510
pre-'71, but returning to some
sort of component of gold--

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:36.270
say, in the Special
Drawing Rights basket.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.989
So you have your five
currencies, and you have gold.

00:36:38.989 --> 00:36:40.280
And there's sort of an average.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.600
So you have something that's
a real asset or some sort

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.450
of manner of bringing back a
version of the gold standard

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:46.170
gets discussed.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:49.470
But for example, when
the Chinese central bank

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:54.710
was criticizing this Fed
policy of just inflating

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:58.020
a sort of currency, but not
having anything real behind it

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.690
to back it, Ben
Bernanke actually

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.090
went on the defensive--

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:05.664
and I have this in
different parts of the book,

00:37:05.664 --> 00:37:07.080
throughout the
years-- and started

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.262
talking about how we don't
want a gold standard.

00:37:09.262 --> 00:37:11.220
Like, it wasn't even
brought up as a topic when

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:14.160
he started defending it,
or just throwing it away

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.420
as a potential.

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:18.540
And one of the reasons for
that is you can't create gold.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.880
This is not to say that we
should be on a full gold

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.690
standard, or that it's actually
a practical development.

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:27.390
But having gold as a
portion of a currency basket

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:30.360
makes some sense because
it's just an anchor.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.850
It's just something that's
actually physically there.

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:35.855
And it doesn't retain
the same kind of value

00:37:35.855 --> 00:37:37.230
the more there's
other currencies

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:39.120
and there's more
speculation in the market

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.190
than it might have if
everything was going off

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:43.760
of real trade and
real hard asset.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.890
But it had an
anchor level to it.

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:49.740
And the fact that it isn't
a part of the main system,

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.391
but it is something
that gets bought up

00:37:51.391 --> 00:37:53.640
by some of the countries,
the emerging countries, that

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:57.030
are trying to trade with each
other their own currencies,

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:00.180
as well as to try to have more
of a portion of gold reserves

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:04.500
in the potential that they
create some sort of standard

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.260
amongst themselves, or something
outside of the dollar, outside

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.840
of the euro, is
certainly something

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:15.390
that has been re-initiated
in this whole process.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:18.580
Where that goes and how
long it takes to get there,

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:19.159
I don't know.

00:38:19.159 --> 00:38:20.700
I mean, there's
people out there that

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.449
say the dollar's going
to deflate tomorrow

00:38:22.449 --> 00:38:23.940
and gold's going to go sky-high.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:29.160
I think there's a trend to gold
being considered as something

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.050
that should anchor this.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:36.450
But in other countries using
their currencies and trading

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:39.070
with each other, like China and
Russia, like Europe and Japan,

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:41.070
there's a lot of trade
agreements that have been

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:43.860
developed-- and I have a
lot of them in "Collusion"--

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:47.100
but that have been developed in
these years amongst countries

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.250
to try and offset some of the
potential risk of, really,

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:51.240
this policy--

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.030
not simply the dollar
geopolitically, but really

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:56.790
the policy of bolstering
a system that's

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:59.880
not really restructured
and that has the potential

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:05.850
to bring down an economy,
or multiple economies again.

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:08.160
One alternative that
comes up in questions

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:14.490
is cryptocurrencies,
and for similar reasons.

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:16.560
And what's interesting
is that though there's

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.950
a lot of volatility in
Bitcoin and other currencies--

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:22.610
and there's a lot of risk
in being involved in them.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:24.690
There's speculating
in them, which

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:26.130
has its own risk attached.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:29.790
But actually, if you're going
to use them on a regular basis,

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:33.390
that kind of volatility
could ruin anyone's business

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:34.920
on any given day, or pop it up.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.503
And that's not the
kind of volatility,

00:39:36.503 --> 00:39:41.340
in the real economy, that most
people can or should handle.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.130
But the idea of having
alternatives, any alternatives

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:48.270
to this system is very
much an accelerated concept

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.910
because of how it's been
handled, because nothing has

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:52.950
really been reformed or fixed.

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:57.240
It's just been plastered
over by this artificial part

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.840
of the system.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:03.540
So the head of the IMF,
Christine Lagarde, who--

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:06.450
again, IMF, the International
Monetary Fund, very much

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:08.170
a part of the system,
very much involved

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.920
in the whole dollar-European
currency system

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.170
from when it was created in
the wake of World War II.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:15.000
And it was created to
basically subsidize

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.520
countries that were allies
of the US and Europe.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.590
I mean, this is kind
of part of the point.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:24.420
She currently has been
on multiple public arenas

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.340
talking about
alternative currencies,

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.250
and how cryptocurrency is
something that is happening,

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:32.670
and it's expanding, and
they need to be aware of it.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:35.670
There are full SWAT teams
at the Federal Reserve now

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:39.720
that are doing that,
under the radar.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:43.290
And you can get jobs at
the European Central Bank

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:46.950
right now that are listed
to be involved in developing

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:49.950
technology related to
cryptocurrency analysis

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:51.000
and so forth right now.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.310
So they're definitely
all involved

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:54.570
from a different perspective.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:41:00.380
But the idea of who
actually ultimately gets

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.980
the regulation of it, versus
the use of it, I think,

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.030
is still up for grabs.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:09.890
Because if you had
cryptos created

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:15.140
by the same central banks that
are creating this currency,

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:20.920
then you don't necessarily
gain autonomy from this system

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.009
by doing that.

00:41:22.009 --> 00:41:23.800
But if there are cryptos
that are regulated

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.620
by a portion of this so that
they're not as volatile for end

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:32.303
users, then they actually might
spread that much more quickly.

00:41:32.303 --> 00:41:35.680
AUDIENCE: Just a follow-up
question to that.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.780
Just as a dabbler
in cryptocurrency,

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.760
people always ask, but
what is it based on?

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.232
And the answer is,
well, not much,

00:41:42.232 --> 00:41:43.565
but it does have a fixed supply.

00:41:43.565 --> 00:41:45.314
I'm thinking of just
the original Bitcoin,

00:41:45.314 --> 00:41:46.450
like 21 million coins.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.860
Well, gold is a fixed supply.

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:51.610
So when I look at
those, I think--

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:55.709
one of the arguments is, well
sure, Bitcoin is volatile.

00:41:55.709 --> 00:41:57.250
But if nobody's on
the gold standard,

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.110
it doesn't matter either.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:00.910
It's kind of an odd,
magical thing to me,

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:06.130
of how people decide to buy into
agreeing to stick with a fixed

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:07.690
supply of anything.

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:11.440
When it comes to, I guess I
would say, a gain this big,

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.810
what would be the motive?

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:17.000
Would it just be looking
for something stable?

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.175
And what would bring this air
balloon back down, I guess?

00:42:21.175 --> 00:42:23.370
NOMI PRINS: Yeah, well,
I think the idea--

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.330
and it's slightly different--

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:28.860
the language for crypto
is similar to the language

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:29.950
for gold.

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:31.420
And that's not an accident.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.940
And the idea of
having a fixed supply

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:39.190
as part of what pegs it to
some form of anchor, right,

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:40.780
is not an accident either.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.730
With respect to gold,
it doesn't mean that you

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:44.320
can't have speculation in gold.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.420
And if you had a gold
standard, or a similar thing

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.628
to a gold standard, you
could still have speculation.

00:42:48.628 --> 00:42:51.910
You could still have
stockpiles of gold.

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:54.070
You can still squeeze
the market, et cetera.

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:56.950
But the idea of anything
outside of the system

00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:58.330
is that it is fixed.

00:42:58.330 --> 00:42:59.870
And it does have a limitation.

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:03.340
And this process has been
particularly unlimited.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:07.270
I mean, it's still going up.

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:09.430
And so even though
the Fed can talk

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:12.190
about tapering, or stopping to
buy at this particular moment,

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:14.650
or creating money, creating
dollars to basically continue

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:18.510
this process, the reality
is, if things go south,

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:21.286
there's no limitation on--

00:43:21.286 --> 00:43:22.910
let's just create
another few trillion.

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:25.720
There was no limitation on
literally any of the process.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.540
And so talking about
assets, hard assets

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:35.590
or cryptocurrencies, as a way
to just infuse a limitation

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:38.380
to the system
should, in theory, be

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.980
able to reduce the
volatility of the system.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.300
Now, on any given
day, there's markets

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.620
moving for different reasons--

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:47.710
geopolitics, wars,
trade wars, whatever.

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:50.600
But in terms of the overall
backdrop of the system,

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.380
if you have something
that's real, that's

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:58.000
there as a peg or even a
proportion of all the currency

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.460
activity in the
world, the idea is

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.930
that it should
reduce the risk It's

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:04.840
like any portfolio in finance.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.600
It's like if you have more--

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.140
the idea is, if
you're diversified

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.250
you reduce the risk.

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:12.320
Now in practice, you have
to watch what's going on.

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.610
But if you have a standard of
some sort outside the system

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:20.050
that's limited, that should
reduce the volatility,

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:21.970
ultimately, of the system.

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.010
And it should act
as a counterbalance

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:27.914
to the unlimitedness of
what these people are doing.

00:44:27.914 --> 00:44:29.830
Because not only are
they not limited in terms

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:32.171
of how much money or
currency can be created,

00:44:32.171 --> 00:44:33.670
they're not limited
in terms of what

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:36.370
they have to show in
terms of where it went,

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:40.540
or what happens if it goes away,
or what happens if anything

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:41.530
gets really negative.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:43.260
There's no real
auditing going on.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:47.710
There's no real checks and
balances to any of this.

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:50.907
Whereas, an outside hard asset
could be a check and balance.

00:44:50.907 --> 00:44:56.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] add
it to the pool of currencies

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:57.770
that the-- what is
it-- the IMF uses?

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:00.219
NOMI PRINS: Yes.

00:45:00.219 --> 00:45:02.260
AUDIENCE: Does that have
that same kind of effect

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.510
of stabilizing the volatility?

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.219
And what effect does
that have for China?

00:45:06.219 --> 00:45:07.384
Is it a good thing for them?

00:45:07.384 --> 00:45:09.500
Or is it problematic if
a bunch of their currency

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.760
gets created to deal with
some financial crisis?

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.510
NOMI PRINS: Right.

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:13.385
It's a good question.

00:45:13.385 --> 00:45:17.440
It hasn't had, yet,
the kind of effect--

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.900
in terms of the
percentage of trade

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:24.040
that is done in Chinese currency
at this particular moment,

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.560
relative to the percentage
they have of the basket--

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.700
is still low.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.500
So they basically
came into this basket

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.380
between the UK pound, the
Japanese yen, and then

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:33.380
the euro and the dollar.

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:36.250
So they kind of came in
between third and fourth place.

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:37.870
So Japan and China
kind of have a--

00:45:40.535 --> 00:45:42.280
they mix and match
what place they're in,

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.488
in terms of third and fourth.

00:45:43.488 --> 00:45:45.790
But they came in pretty high.

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:49.400
But the actual trade that
goes on internationally

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.090
in the Chinese ren still
remains pretty low,

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:54.970
just because it takes
time to catch up.

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:57.460
So they came in high because
of the size of their economy.

00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.640
But in terms of the actual
trade that's going on,

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.660
that number is still
small, but going up.

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.480
And the reason for
that is they are

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.660
very active in creating trade
partnerships and currency

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:11.290
relationships that
involve the ren.

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:13.474
And in fact, the US
banks have opened--

00:46:13.474 --> 00:46:15.640
just in the last few months
some of the major banks,

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.740
like JPMorgan Chase
and stuff, have

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:20.490
opened clearing banks, or
banks that can actually

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:24.360
take Chinese currency for the
purpose of getting involved

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.990
in the Chinese market.

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:28.770
So I think that's going to grow.

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:31.338
The second part of
your question again?

00:46:31.338 --> 00:46:32.316
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:32.316 --> 00:46:33.294
NOMI PRINS: Yeah.

00:46:33.294 --> 00:46:35.708
AUDIENCE: Like what purpose--

00:46:35.708 --> 00:46:36.458
NOMI PRINS: Right.

00:46:36.458 --> 00:46:38.700
AUDIENCE: --having their
currency in this basket serves.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.450
NOMI PRINS: It gives
them a political seat

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:45.390
at the table, too, and
geopolitical seat at the table.

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:49.920
One of the reasons they
wanted to match their status

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:56.070
in the ladder of the world and
the entities that run things

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:58.140
from a monetary
standpoint is because it

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.149
helps their economic
superpower status.

00:47:00.149 --> 00:47:02.190
It helps their relationships
with other countries

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:06.245
in their region and
throughout the world.

00:47:06.245 --> 00:47:08.620
And so that's one of the
reasons it's beneficial to them.

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:11.220
It's sort of like, look, if
this is the basket that's

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:14.250
representing the world,
and we're actually

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.380
bigger than several of
these economies, then

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:17.616
why shouldn't we be in it?

00:47:17.616 --> 00:47:18.990
Because once we're
in it, then we

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:21.777
can utilize that to develop
our presence elsewhere.

00:47:21.777 --> 00:47:23.610
And what they've done
with some of the money

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:27.360
that they've been fabricating
as well is they've used it

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.120
specifically for that purpose--
of having better relationships

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.112
and alliances with
countries, saying,

00:47:32.112 --> 00:47:34.320
you give us your workers,
and we'll build this bridge

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.484
and we'll finance it.

00:47:35.484 --> 00:47:37.400
And so a lot of the money
that they've created

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.970
has actually gone
outside of China,

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:41.610
but for development projects.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:44.640
And that's their way-- that's
their strategy of developing

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:49.260
a long-term economic presence
and a superpower presence,

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:51.240
by having--

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.040
like the beginning
video there, I'm

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:58.800
in Colombo, Sri Lanka in the
first scene of that video.

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.440
And in the middle of Colombo,
there's a huge tower.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.420
And it's reminiscent
of the Shanghai

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.930
Tower, which is like the
second-tallest building

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:08.390
in the world.

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:10.590
And it was like a mini-version.

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:13.170
And when you go around, even
when you're studying this,

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:16.230
you're not following every
real estate development

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.800
in the world.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.300
And so I'm in the
middle of Colombo.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.740
I'm like, golly, that looks a
lot like the Shanghai Tower.

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.573
That's kind of cool.

00:48:21.573 --> 00:48:24.480
And of course, it turns out
that the Chinese funded it.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.430
They had their engineers
come over and do it.

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:28.720
It was a joint effort, also,
with people in Sri Lanka.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:33.290
But basically, that's how
the presence develops.

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:35.880
It's like the boots on
the ground-- military.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:41.299
It's like structures
on the ground.

00:48:41.299 --> 00:48:42.840
AUDIENCE: So I guess
I'm still trying

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:46.100
to wrap my head around all
this, right, and still trying

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.564
to better understand
the check and balance.

00:48:48.564 --> 00:48:49.980
So my understanding
is, when we're

00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:53.580
looking at this, the reason
why we haven't seen any crash

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:57.172
or fall is because
all of the players

00:48:57.172 --> 00:48:59.130
are recognizing each
other's currencies, right?

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:00.880
They're recognizing
that they're printing.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.180
They're playing along.

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.880
And is this crash that
could possibly happen--

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.830
does that happen
when someone says,

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:11.170
no, we don't recognize the
money that you've been printing?

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:14.330
Or the money that you've
been trading back and forth

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:16.495
is not admissible anymore.

00:49:16.495 --> 00:49:17.620
We're not going to take it.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.070
And is that when
everything crashes?

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:21.990
Because otherwise,
it's just based on--

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.200
NOMI PRINS: Of what stops it.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:22.995
AUDIENCE: --the
strength of an economy.

00:49:22.995 --> 00:49:23.460
Yeah.

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:24.430
NOMI PRINS: Right,
and what stops it.

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:26.730
And that's the odd thing that's
been happening over the last 10

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:27.230
years.

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:31.690
All of this started out as an
emergency policy 10 years ago.

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:33.750
And obviously, the fact
that it still exists

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:36.060
is an indication that
whatever caused that emergency

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:37.140
hasn't really been fixed.

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.306
And if you pull the plug,
yes, it will be a problem.

00:49:39.306 --> 00:49:41.070
So whether you pull
the plug on working

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:42.528
with someone else's
currency, which

00:49:42.528 --> 00:49:43.710
these banks can't really--

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:45.210
they trade in each
other's currency.

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:46.501
They own each other's currency.

00:49:46.501 --> 00:49:49.590
They hold bonds in each
other's currency-- particularly

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:51.210
the holding of the
dollar, because we

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:52.830
have the most amount
of debt relative

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:56.740
to the rest of their nations.

00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:00.480
And so the problem
is, if they stop,

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.029
that's one way the
system could collapse.

00:50:03.029 --> 00:50:05.070
If they stop because they
don't trust each other,

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:06.150
it's because this happens.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:07.774
Again, it's because
you all of a sudden

00:50:07.774 --> 00:50:10.500
have a bunch of banks
going under or having

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:15.940
a real crisis of some sort
that's related to a derivative.

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:20.592
It's related to derivatives
that are now partly created

00:50:20.592 --> 00:50:22.800
from corporate bonds, that
used to be mortgage bonds.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.440
And those corporate
bonds start to default,

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.990
so those derivatives
start to go under.

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:27.540
And the whole chain
starts to happen again.

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:29.123
And they're like,
well, wait a minute.

00:50:29.123 --> 00:50:31.770
We really need to accelerate or
move away from these currencies

00:50:31.770 --> 00:50:32.700
or from each other.

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.664
That is how these crises happen.

00:50:34.664 --> 00:50:36.330
It's not like this
definitive statement.

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:37.860
Like Europe can't say, we're
never going to use the dollar.

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.780
Like, it's just not
going to happen.

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:43.050
But what they can do is they
can develop relationships

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:45.750
outside of the dollar so
that, if something like this

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:47.430
happens again--
and the chances are

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:50.340
it will start in the
United States again too,

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:53.130
because we have lent a lot of
money to a lot of countries.

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:54.810
We've done all the
complex structures.

00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:56.760
We have more at risk.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:59.860
And we're more codependent, in
general, related to the world

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:01.690
than other countries are--

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:03.820
then you could have that
fall start to happen.

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.095
So it's not like a decision--

00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:06.720
we're not going to
trust your currency.

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.720
It's more like, we're not
going to trust the way

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.710
you deal with your system.

00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:15.480
And what happened with
the developing countries

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:18.262
in the wake of the financial
crisis is there's--

00:51:18.262 --> 00:51:19.720
and I talk about
this in the book--

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.020
there's a lot more meetings.

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:24.072
There's a lot more conferences
amongst themselves.

00:51:24.072 --> 00:51:26.280
There's a lot more growth
in trade agreements outside

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:28.072
of the US, and not
necessarily using Japan.

00:51:28.072 --> 00:51:29.946
And there's ones where
Japan is using Europe.

00:51:29.946 --> 00:51:32.160
There's just a lot of
realignments going on.

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.910
And that's a way to say not so
much we won't use the dollar,

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:36.660
we won't use your
currency, but we

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:42.220
are cognizant that this is
still on kind of shaky ground.

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:45.570
And so the next time there
is a financial crisis,

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:48.270
hopefully, we have a
little bit more protection,

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:49.680
sort of alternatives.

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.660
Which may or may not--
it depends what happens.

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:52.800
It depends how big that is.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.508
I mean, no one really
expected the market

00:51:54.508 --> 00:51:56.850
to be cut by, like,
45% in 2008 from where

00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:57.810
it was the year before.

00:51:57.810 --> 00:51:59.820
I mean, that wasn't
an expectation.

00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:01.320
And even now, when
I say this stuff,

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:04.279
like that the market's
going to potentially crash,

00:52:04.279 --> 00:52:05.820
we're up at these
like heady heights,

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:09.640
most people don't
feel the same way.

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.989
But it could still happen.

00:52:10.989 --> 00:52:12.530
AUDIENCE: Like a
continuation-- maybe

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:14.190
this is an obvious question.

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:17.910
But then couldn't everyone
just hit the reset button

00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:19.750
and then build each
other back up again?

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:25.890
NOMI PRINS: Well, one of the
solutions or possible paths

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:28.920
that I talk about
in the last chapter

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:33.630
is this idea of canceling
out each other's debt

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:37.530
and doing it in such a way that
the countries that would be

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:39.690
most burdened by a collapse--

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:41.250
that were most
burdened by a collapse

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:44.490
that they did not
cause in 2008--

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:46.480
could be in a more
stable situation.

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.000
What's happened
with all of this is

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.380
that the countries
that were most

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:52.695
at the center of the
last financial crisis

00:52:52.695 --> 00:52:56.130
and have the ability to
do more harm financially

00:52:56.130 --> 00:52:58.710
are the ones that got
the most subsidies.

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:01.430
And so that just created
more inherent risk.

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:03.450
And again, this could
go on for a long time.

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:05.240
But it created
more inherent risk.

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:09.450
So that's one of the things
that could also happen.

00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:11.610
AUDIENCE: So the word
"collusion," to me anyway,

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:14.130
has a negative connotation.

00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:16.530
Is it fair to characterize
this collusion, in your view,

00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:17.580
as something sinister?

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:20.640
Or do these people responsible
for these systems think

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:25.020
they're acting in a
very honorable way

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:27.810
by saving the
economy or whatever?

00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:30.300
NOMI PRINS: Well, it's weird,
because I think most of them

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:36.390
believe that what they're doing
is ultimately going to help

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:41.520
the economy, even though the
evidence is that it hasn't.

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.617
The evidence is that wage
growth hasn't really increased.

00:53:44.617 --> 00:53:47.200
Stock growth has increased, so
certain bonuses have increased,

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:50.850
but the evidence is that the
economies that supposedly were

00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:53.550
fixed are really sputtering.

00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:55.140
And the economies
that didn't receive

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:57.750
so much quantitative easing
are either doing better,

00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:59.880
or they're still
caught up in what

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:05.270
might be the impact
of what happens here.

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:08.860
So it's hard to say.

00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:14.650
But I think what
ultimately will happen,

00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:17.220
though, is that at some
point these people--

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.750
they shift.

00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:21.960
Some of them move out and
some new people come in.

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:23.940
Mario Draghi, at some
point, has to leave.

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:29.880
And probably-- or possibly,
but probably whoever takes

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:32.507
his place will come, say, from
Germany or from a country that

00:54:32.507 --> 00:54:34.590
actually is against this
policy and actually would

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:38.702
prefer that less artificial
money is in the system.

00:54:38.702 --> 00:54:40.410
And they have political
reasons for that.

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:41.640
Their economy's doing
better than some

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.015
of the other
economies in Europe,

00:54:43.015 --> 00:54:45.210
so this had other ramifications.

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:47.910
And so a shifting in
the actual individuals

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:49.650
at the top of these
institutions could

00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:51.540
create a shift in the policy.

00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:53.970
But also, there's a
way to unwind this,

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:55.860
or at least to start to
unwind, that actually

00:54:55.860 --> 00:55:02.910
is using this off-the-rails
solution in a good way.

00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:07.260
For example, the Fed could take
$1 trillion, or $2 trillion,

00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:08.790
or whatever, of
the $4.5 trillion

00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:11.130
worth of money they
created and assets

00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:13.710
they received in
return for doing that,

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:15.180
and create an
infrastructure bank,

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:18.240
or create a development bank,
or do something that's actually

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.970
really financing
the real economy

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:23.070
and also moving forward.

00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:27.060
When I was in China, I took the
high-speed rail from Beijing

00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:29.040
to Shanghai.

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:33.180
And I don't know if anyone has--

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:35.580
I mean, when you talk
"high," it's really fast.

00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:39.180
Like, you cannot
see the countryside.

00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:40.320
And it's quiet.

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.620
And I mean, it's
excellent technology.

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:44.370
I mean, obviously, it
costs what it costs,

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:45.990
but that's the kind
of development,

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:48.410
that's the kind of
infrastructure building--

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:50.310
developing the
technology in conjunction

00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:55.260
with the real parts
of the economy

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.870
that real people
actually work on-- that's

00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:59.244
more forward-stabilizing.

00:55:59.244 --> 00:56:01.410
So you could actually take
a lot of the money that's

00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:03.493
been created, and rather
than have it go into debt

00:56:03.493 --> 00:56:07.167
and have it go into stock,
actually have it diverted.

00:56:07.167 --> 00:56:08.750
Nobody's going to
be happy about that.

00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:09.916
It might cause a correction.

00:56:09.916 --> 00:56:12.833
But ultimately, it's a question
of long term versus short term.

00:56:12.833 --> 00:56:13.712
AUDIENCE: Thank you, so much.

00:56:13.712 --> 00:56:13.740
Nomi.

00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:14.100
NOMI PRINS: Yeah.

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:14.500
No, thank you.

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:15.166
Thank you, guys.

00:56:15.166 --> 00:56:18.700
[APPLAUSE]
