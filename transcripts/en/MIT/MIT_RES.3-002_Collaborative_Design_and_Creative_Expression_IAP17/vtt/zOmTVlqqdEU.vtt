00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:15.800
KYLE KEANE: All right.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.599
So on a scale of zero to 10, how
energetic is everyone feeling?

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.390
I'm going to count to
three and then-- hey,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.200
is that a super familiar face?

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.880
Hey.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.700
Howdy.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.380
Yeah, so on the
count of three, I

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.080
want everyone to say a
number between zero and 10

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.316
about how much energy you're
feeling about being here today.

00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:42.440
So I don't want to project.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.266
I'm feeling a little
bit low energy.

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.390
So I don't want to project.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.765
So if you guys
feel good, tell me

00:00:46.765 --> 00:00:49.880
you feel good so that I know
that my internal state is not

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.380
your state.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.630
It's really important to
gauge these things sometimes.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.270
All right.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.850
So 1, 2, 3.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.420
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
KYLE KEANE: All right.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.690
There was a gradient in this
direction, but all right.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.190
That's good.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.200
Nobody went down to three,
which is about where I am.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.150
Unless there was any threes
out there-- if there are,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.066
come talk to me after.

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.170
There's support services.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.760
And we can go together and
get a little bumped up.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.470
But yeah, so again, I want
social interaction today.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.010
So we're going to do something
quicker than yesterday,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.085
but I want people to
introduce yourself and say

00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:34.610
a random animal and make that
animal's noise if you can,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.330
or attempt to.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:44.330
So I'm Kyle and-- it
doesn't even have to--

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.982
I'm trying to make it
rhyme or have alliteration.

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:48.190
Doesn't even have to be that.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.930
I'm going to say
Kyle, cat, meow.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.450
That's most-- OK, meow.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.000
That's more like
an actual cat says.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.759
That's not what we
represent cats saying.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.560
Yeah, so try to look
around and figure out

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.640
people's names and maybe
one other thing, something

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.009
personal about us that we can
get to know some type of thing.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.892
And what's a good--

00:02:10.892 --> 00:02:12.600
AUDIENCE: What we want
to eat for dinner.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.990
KYLE KEANE: Great.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.250
All right.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.166
What you're hoping to
have for dinner tonight.

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:16.550
Thank you.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.564
All right, so Kyle,
probably Thai food,

00:02:20.564 --> 00:02:21.980
but that's because
it's my default

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.250
and I never know what
else to do, so Thai food.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.910
All right.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.759
So with you guys--

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:28.550
AUDIENCE: I'm Mark.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.942
I'm probably going to end up
having pasta tonight, maybe

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:31.680
Soylent.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.180
Who knows?

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.680
We'll see.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.642
And [INTERPOSING VOICES]
KYLE KEANE: horrified.

00:02:38.642 --> 00:02:40.121
AUDIENCE: You really
drink Soylent?

00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:42.353
AUDIENCE: I survived off of
that for weeks at a time.

00:02:42.353 --> 00:02:44.312
AUDIENCE: Just like just
Soylent, nothing else?

00:02:44.312 --> 00:02:44.764
AUDIENCE: Just Soylent.

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:45.264
Yeah.

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:47.386
KYLE KEANE: Anybody not
know what Soylent is?

00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:51.450
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
AUDIENCE: Not Soylent Green.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.700
KYLE KEANE: Not Soylent Green.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.469
No.

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.427
AUDIENCE: It's like a
better version of Ensure.

00:02:55.427 --> 00:02:56.136
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:02:56.136 --> 00:02:56.886
KYLE KEANE: Right.

00:02:56.886 --> 00:02:59.480
But it has all the nutrients
that a human needs to survive.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.560
And you just drink it and you
never have to worry about food.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.720
But-- AUDIENCE: It's
easy and it's cheap.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.180
Those are all the requirements
a student should--

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.140
and my favorite animal
is the prairie dog.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.848
I don't really know
what sound they make,

00:03:12.848 --> 00:03:14.510
but I think it's
like [CLICKING]....

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.560
KYLE KEANE: Aw.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.860
That was nice.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.040
Cool.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.140
All right.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.790
Thank you.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.625
So today, at some point, you're
going to break up into groups.

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:27.500
And at some point, I'm
going to do a pop quiz

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.370
and you're going
to have to tell me

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.130
the names of the
people in your group,

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.766
because I forgot to
do that yesterday

00:03:31.766 --> 00:03:33.140
and I wonder how
many of you know

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.710
the names of the people
that were in your group.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.200
I'm not going to ask
you about yesterday,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.930
but today I will
ask you about that.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.780
So I mean, some of you
may have known the names.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.230
Thumbs up if you did.
