00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:06.934
You guys will love him.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:08.702
From <i>The League, </i>
Mr. Paul Scheer, everybody.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:14.041
Let him hear it.
Paul Scheer.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.176
Whenever I leave my house,
every morning,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.711
I walk out front,

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:21.715
and there's this big,
giant piece of dog shit.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.350
Boom, right there
every morning,

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:25.285
it's like,
"Good morning."

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.389
No, not a good morning.
Terrible morning.

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:32.226
'Cause now I have to clean up
a bunch of dog shit.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.894
And I always say--
when I'm cleaning it up,

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.063
I'm like,
"Oh, man, one day.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:39.366
"One day, I'm gonna find the guy
who shits on my lawn,

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.804
"and, oh, he is going
to rue the day.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.539
He is gonna rue the day."

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.908
It's gonna be like something
out of <i>Death Wish,</i>

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.810
which is a movie
I have not seen,

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:52.846
but I think it is about a guy
who hunts down people

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.648
whose dog shits
on his lawn.

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:56.550
Not positive about that.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:02:00.487
So cut to a couple months ago,
I have a baby, brand-new baby.

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.823
It's very exciting,
very cute baby.

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.224
It's awesome.

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:06.159
My wife and I
are at our house,

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:07.928
and we're, like,
super cracked out.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.231
Like, we haven't been out
of our pajamas for days,

00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:13.000
and my wife came up
with this plan.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:17.905
She's like, "We have to catch
the dog-shitting guy."

00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:22.109
I'm like, "Oh, yeah.
We're gonna catch this guy,"

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:25.279
and we create, like,
an elaborate sting operation.

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:27.114
We close all of our blinds,

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.515
make it look like
we're not home,

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.017
and then we just kind of wait.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.685
And we're just peering
out the window,

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.987
and when someone comes,
we're like, "Honey, come quick.

00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:35.689
Aw, no, they picked up
their shit."

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:37.925
We're actually upset when people
pick up their dog shit.

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.092
We're like, "No."

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:42.429
And then finally,
he came,

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.431
and I knew it was the guy,

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.200
because when he came
down the block,

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.535
he looked like--I guess--
how can I explain this?

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.774
He looked like a home-schooled
John Goodman, all right?

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:56.143
Walking down the block
very boldly

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:59.112
with a Bluetooth headset
that was so big

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:00.747
that even when
Bluetooths came out,

00:03:00.781 --> 00:03:03.217
it was too big,
you know?

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.553
He comes.
Dogs stop in front of our house.

00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:08.422
We're watching, like,
"All right, here it goes.

00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:09.890
Here it goes."

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:11.592
And the dogs,
like synchronized swimmers,

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:14.127
just squat
at the same time--boop--

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:15.896
and...

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:19.299
They shit,
and the guy just goes--

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:21.568
Looks around,
sees our blinds are down.

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:23.770
He's like,
"No one can be inside."

00:03:23.804 --> 00:03:24.771
[laughs]

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:26.607
He doesn't know.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.208
And he walks off,

00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:29.910
and my wife and I--
we freak out.

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:32.379
It's like the jackpot,
like, "Yes!

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:33.614
"We got him.
We got him.

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:35.082
What do we do?"

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:36.650
My wife's like,
"You got to go out there.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:38.252
You got to confront him,"
and I'm like,

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:39.620
"No, I can't,
'cause I'm a pussy.

00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:42.389
You go!"

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:44.791
So I send my wife
out there,

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.661
a woman who has
literally weeks ago

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.230
given birth
to a human being,

00:03:50.264 --> 00:03:53.934
to confront a large man
and two wild animals,

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:55.402
and she goes out there

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:58.138
and then affects
what I guess what I call,

00:03:58.172 --> 00:04:00.741
like, a <i>Downton Abbey</i> accent.

00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:06.914
She's like, "Excuse me, sir,
your dog defecated on the lawn,

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:10.717
and this requires
immediate attention."

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.186
No one's gonna stop
for that.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.488
The guys just blows
right by her,

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:17.090
and I go, "No one can talk
to my wife like that."

00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:19.393
And I bust out of the house
in my pajamas,

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.061
and I run down the street.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:24.731
I'm like, "Hey, sir,
your dog shit on our lawn,"

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:26.200
and then I wait for it.

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:28.368
And he looks at me,
and he's like,

00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:31.371
"No, they didn't,"
and I go, "Yes, they did."

00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:33.240
And he goes,
"No, they didn't."

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.909
And then I realized
I did not have a plan

00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:38.111
of how to confront
this guy.

00:04:38.145 --> 00:04:40.080
I want say something else,
I don't know what to do,

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.549
so I figured
I'd do the next best thing.

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:46.119
I insult his dogs.
I look down.

00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:48.355
I'm like,
"Well, guess what.

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:54.862
This dog's dumb,
and this dog's dumber."

00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:56.763
I did it.

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:58.932
And the guys looks at me weird,
and I'm like...

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:00.701
[laughs]

00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:02.703
And I walk back to my wife,
and I feel so triumphant.

00:05:02.736 --> 00:05:04.271
I'm like, "Did you see
how I just, like,

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.773
"slammed that guy's dogs?

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:09.376
She is gonna be
so proud of me."

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.179
And then as I'm walking away,
I hear,

00:05:12.212 --> 00:05:15.816
"You're a disgusting
human being."

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.787
And I turn to him,
and I go, "I know!"

00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:23.190
Screaming, and then I go
to approach my wife,

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:24.958
and then he goes,
"You two--

00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:28.562
You two belong together."

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:31.698
And I approach my wife
in a way

00:05:31.732 --> 00:05:33.233
that I've never done before.

00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:36.136
I put my hand on the small
of her back,

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.173
and I tilt her over,
like, in a <i>Gone with the Wind</i>

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:40.574
style kiss,

00:05:40.607 --> 00:05:41.575
and I'm like--

00:05:41.608 --> 00:05:43.243
[growls]

00:05:43.277 --> 00:05:47.814
And I give him the finger.
I'm like, "Take that."

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:51.852
And he leaves,
and then I feel so triumphant.

00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:53.820
And then I look down
at the ground,

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:56.390
and I see
a giant pile of shit

00:05:56.423 --> 00:05:58.692
that I still have
to clean up,

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:00.794
and then I realize
that I left my child inside

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:03.664
unattended
for, like, 15 minutes,

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.899
'cause I am
a terrible parent.

00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:07.334
Thank you guys so much.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:07.434
[cheers and applause]
