00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.340
SPEAKER: I would like to welcome
you all to the Authors Talk

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.380
for "Firewall."

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.860
We have Jack Nolan here, who,
in addition to serving in the US

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.360
military as a propagandist, is,
as people do in Los Angeles,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.950
is an actor.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.240
So I'm hoping for an
entertaining and fascinating

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.590
presentation, and
then it will be Q&amp;A.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.856
So without further ado, Jack.

00:00:30.856 --> 00:00:32.278
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.110
JACK NOLAN: First, thank you
all so very much for having me.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.810
We are in an interesting
situation in our country

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.000
right now, aren't we?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.460
Several intelligence
agencies have

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.590
alleged that a foreign
power has exerted influence

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.340
upon our voting system in order
to get their favorite candidate

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.570
in office.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.750
Now, I really don't want to
get into the question of which

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.510
candidate we prefer, whether
on the left or the right.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.730
This is an American problem.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.030
When you have a foreign
power doing that,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.210
it affects the legitimacy
of our entire government.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:21.540
The tool that they use to do
this is, in a word, propaganda.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.330
Now, our founding fathers--

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.790
Washington, Jefferson,
Franklin-- geniuses all--

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.220
they built a republic
that has not only

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.810
survived, it has flourished,
spread through the world,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.920
defeated slavery,
communism, fascism.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.390
It's vital.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.050
And it preserves our
freedoms, our way of life,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.290
and our ability to live
in this free society--

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.380
affects us every day.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.910
And that's terrific.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.440
The problem is there are always
authoritarians out there.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.450
The US military exists
because of that.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.290
And having somebody like
Vladimir Putin come in

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.289
and affect our
election results--

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.730
well, obviously,
it's unacceptable.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.050
Unfortunately, even
if these allegations

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.180
are proved to be
true, and Mr. Trump

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.120
was to be ejected from
the Oval Office tomorrow,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.530
the problem, the central
problem, remains--

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.420
propaganda.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.730
Vladimir Putin has shown us
a weakness in our system.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.060
In their genius,
our founding fathers

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.870
could not have foreseen in
an era when ponies carried

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.500
the mail, a time of 20th
century propaganda raised

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.730
to the power of 21st century
communication technology.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.180
We are unprepared for this.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.980
And not meaning
to sound paranoid,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.400
although I inevitably
always do, they'll be back,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.800
and there will be more of them.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.070
The Saudis, whoever,
will also try

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.960
to interfere with
our system in order

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.240
to get their preferred
candidates elected.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.000
How do we fix this?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.660
Propaganda, when you
really start studying it,

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.700
is interwoven into the
fabric of our lives.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.250
We really can't
dispense with it.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.950
And honestly, it
does a lot of good,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.520
and it serves a lot of
important economic functions.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.780
I'm not advocating that
we, well, outlaw it--

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.410
a little bit of regulation, a
little bit of corralling, sure.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.790
We could stand that.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.470
But to try to fix this
problem through legislation--

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.110
well, it's not going to work,
not and keep a free country.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.840
Besides, let's be frank--

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.120
trusting the Democrats
or the Republicans

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.900
to fix the problem or
propaganda is ludicrous.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.320
They're not upset
that the United States

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.700
populous was propagandized.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.140
They do it all the time.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.170
They're more like royalty
trying to run poachers off

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.750
of their hunting grounds.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.360
They're upset that
somebody else horned in

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.775
on their target audience.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.930
With apologies to Harry
Truman, this time the buck

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.450
stops with us.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.630
We must understand propaganda.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.870
We must study it.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.800
I believe that the principles
that I teach in my book

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.710
"Firewall-- the Propagandist's
Guide to Self-Defense"

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.486
should be required reading
to get a high school diploma.

00:04:49.486 --> 00:04:50.860
When I was in
college, I remember

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.030
taking a wonderful class
in Aristotelian logic,

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.624
argumentative logic, learning
about fallacies, and so

00:04:55.624 --> 00:04:56.290
forth and so on.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.940
And I remember
thinking, this shouldn't

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.392
be a college elective.

00:04:59.392 --> 00:05:01.350
This should be taught at
the high school level.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.225
This should be taught
to high school seniors.

00:05:03.225 --> 00:05:04.780
Well, I feel the
same way about this.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.870
And in fact, I'm
hoping to develop--

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.730
it's called a module--

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.780
four-week module, two-week
fast track for high schools.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.400
And I would be very reassured if
that information was out there.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.880
So what is this information
I'm talking about?

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.700
How much time do we have
because it took me five hours

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.040
to do the audio book?

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.320
The whirlwind tour, ladies
and gentlemen, pay attention.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.660
What is propaganda?

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.974
Well, you can look it
up on the Wikipedia.

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:42.390
You can look up
in the dictionary.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.440
You'll get all kinds
of definitions.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.300
My favorite definition is
the simple almost brutalist

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.640
military definition--

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.540
any message that serves
the needs of the sender.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.580
Any message that serves
the needs of the sender

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.000
is, by definition, propaganda.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.190
Propaganda is a or any message
that serves the sender.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.760
Repetition is also a
valuable tool in propaganda.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.850
So when you have a little
girl look up at you and say,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.450
would you buy me some
ice cream, please?

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.180
That's propaganda.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.040
It's a very simple propaganda--

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.150
rudimentary.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.450
But it's very effective, as
any parent will tell you.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.360
Or if I say to you, buy my book.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.500
Yes, that's propaganda.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.966
I get $3 a pop.

00:06:33.966 --> 00:06:36.340
But I'm really more interested
in getting the information

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.400
out there than I
am getting that.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.860
And at least I told you
what I was when I started.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.720
But when you have
a message like vote

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.550
for this candidate or a
message like buy our product,

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.100
buy our service, eat
at our restaurant,

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.810
that's also propaganda.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.810
Advertising is a
subset of propaganda.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.750
It's a little brother.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.030
Big brother propaganda went
to work for the government

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.150
and is working extensively
for people like North Korea.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.660
Little brother advertising went
to work in the business world.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.870
And that's fine.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.350
There's nothing wrong with
advertising and making money

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.410
so long as you're
telling the truth.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:21.770
So the first tripwire, the first
wall that our personal firewall

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.160
incorporates is the
message that we have just

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.750
received propaganda.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:32.880
Does it serve the
needs of the sender?

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.700
But that begs the
question, doesn't it?

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.880
Who is the sender?

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.346
And when you start
asking that question,

00:07:41.346 --> 00:07:42.720
you'll discover
how many messages

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.080
you get every day where
the sender's signature has

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.460
been effaced, the serial
numbers have been filed off.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.960
Most recently, of
course, I doubt

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:57.510
Mr. Putin signed the messages
he sent to the United States.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.690
So it puts you immediately
into the thought pattern

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.150
of a detective-- cui bono?

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.160
Who benefits?

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.630
Buy the person you are engaged
to a diamond engagement ring,

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:10.830
not signed De Beers.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.020
The third barrier--
is that source,

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.670
once you've identified
it, credible?

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.120
For example, does anyone
remember Baghdad Bob back

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.400
in the year of Saddam Hussein?

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.879
That guy rapidly
lost his credibility.

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:30.420
He may have had some
at first, and he

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.600
lost it quick to the point
where he became a laughingstock.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.600
That is what happens when
you lose credibility.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.200
So news organizations are
very jealously guarding

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.679
their credibility, as, for
example, Dan Rather learned,

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:50.730
to his discomfort, back in 2003,
when he published information

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.940
that turned out to be
spurious with CBS News'

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.680
imprimatur on it--

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.950
very important for organizations
like CNN, the New York Times

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.410
to maintain their credibility.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.900
Those news organizations
that handle the extremes

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.035
like Occupy Democrat or
Breitbart-- not so much.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.762
Is the sender credible?

00:09:12.762 --> 00:09:14.970
And you don't want to lose
your credibility if you're

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.810
going to be a propagandist.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:23.860
Why did this person
send me this message?

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.600
Very important question.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.230
Let's look at the news.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.530
The news, including creditable
organizations like CNN,

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.320
always have an agenda that
they're not telling you about.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.090
That agenda can be as
simple as sell newspapers,

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.130
get hits on websites.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.750
Therefore, their
headlines are going

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:49.180
to be sensationalist-- this
horrifying new development.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.240
And certainly, you're going
to find even more of that

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.060
the more you get to the
extremes and the less credible

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.090
the source is.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.920
Why did this person
send me the message?

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:12.040
The news organizations can alter
public opinion without lying--

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.540
without lying and without
jeopardizing their credibility.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.240
How?

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.051
By choosing very
carefully what truths

00:10:20.051 --> 00:10:21.550
they're going to
communicate to you.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.140
Now, fortunately, we live
in the era of the internet,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.580
where truths are out there.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.540
The question is, can you find
them amidst all the noise?

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.890
But if something is good news,
well, it doesn't get covered,

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.810
does it, because that
doesn't sell newspapers.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.285
The fact that, for example,
the crime rates are down

00:10:37.285 --> 00:10:39.460
to historic lows, so
I understand-- well,

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.800
that doesn't sell
the morning paper,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.550
does it, or nowadays,
the feed sites?

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:49.000
So yes, all of these
messages that you received

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.280
through the media, through
the advertisements,

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.930
and through propaganda
organizations

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.790
run by governments--
you have to ask

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.290
why did they send this message?

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.509
Did this message come
to you repeatedly?

00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:02.050
That's one of the first and most
valuable and important signs

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.840
because propaganda
is repetition.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.370
Propaganda is
repetition-- repetition,

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.039
repetition, repetition.

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:11.580
When you're driving
down the freeway,

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.970
and you see the same
billboard over and over,

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.110
that's deliberate.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.040
When you're watching
the television,

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.180
you see the same commercial,
or you know, YouTube,

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.540
and you're watching the same
commercial over and over,

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.160
that's deliberate.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.000
They want to bang into your head
their slogan or their jingle.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.950
Is anybody old enough--

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.500
were most of you raised
here in Los Angeles?

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:35.030
Do you remember-- I would pay
real money to have this jingle

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.890
effaced from my memory--

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.740
Pete Ellis Dodge, Long Beach
freeway, Firestone exit,

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.240
south gate.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.490
I see we have some
here who remember that.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.890
I wish the men in black would
come with their neuralyzer

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.990
and blink that right
out of my head.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.960
I can never get rid of it ever.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.720
Some of you who are older
may remember plop, plop,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.840
fizz, fizz, and you know
exactly what follows--

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.670
oh, what a relief it is.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.720
Ladies and gentlemen,
when I say that phrase--

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.380
plop, plop, fizz, fizz--

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:09.300
I have just activated
a pop-up in your brain.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.970
It's a full audiovisual
presentation

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.260
with music and sound effects.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.630
You can see the pill
dissolving in the water.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:18.710
Now, if somebody did that to
your computer, you'd be upset.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.330
How did this slip
past my antivirals?

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.890
How did it slip
past my firewall?

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.410
How is this, now, slowing
down my processing power

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.240
and my memory, even
though I've got plenty,

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.280
and interrupting me
while I'm trying to work?

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.110
You'd be angry.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.540
How much more angry
should you be that they

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.250
put this in your head?

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.050
Did you give informed consent?

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:41.620
Did anybody ask you
permission to do this to you?

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.820
And that's just advertising.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.250
Advertising is
relatively harmless

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.210
compared to big government.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:53.440
So the final point--

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.960
when you know that you're
dealing with propaganda,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.870
the only way to deal with
it is to deny access.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.060
As you've seen, if you
are repeatedly exposed,

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.457
it gets in your
head deliberately

00:13:02.457 --> 00:13:04.540
because you've got very
high-powered psychologists

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.400
behind this.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.950
Deny access.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.625
That's what the people in those
swing states should have done

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.000
and I'm sure they
would have done

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.166
had they known that the
messages they were receiving

00:13:16.166 --> 00:13:18.070
came from Vladimir Putin.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:22.000
And that's the skill that we
all need to development in order

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.930
to fight off this
problem and to be sure

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:32.860
that our opinions in all their
diversity really are our own.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.260
And once we've done
so, then we can

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.080
approach the real
problems of our world

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.970
with clear heads, clear eyes.

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.950
One last thing I
want to communicate--

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:48.510
I've given you the
bare essentials.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.950
My name is Jack Nolan, and
I am a trained propagandist,

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.230
graduate of the John F.
Kennedy Special Warfare Center

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.432
and School, and
afterwards, I went off

00:13:57.432 --> 00:13:58.890
to work in the film
industry, where

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.290
I saw propaganda being made and
insinuated into our television

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:03.050
and features.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.450
And I'll be glad to talk
to you all about that.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.600
The thing that I can't
communicate, even

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:15.070
in book-length form, is how
to think like a propagandist.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.010
Does anyone here
remember a film called

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.120
"They Live," produced by John
Carpenter back in the '80s?

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.450
In this-- not a very
good movie, mind,

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:27.300
but it's a lovely metaphor.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.594
The main character had a
set of special sunglasses,

00:14:30.594 --> 00:14:32.260
and when you peer
into these sunglasses,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.442
you could see the world
in a different way.

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:38.650
And he tried desperately to
get the people around him

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:42.720
to put on the glasses, to
see the world as he saw it.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.140
Well, that's very
much how I feel

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.830
because I think a propagandist,
and I see the world

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.975
in a slightly different way.

00:14:49.975 --> 00:14:52.600
And now, I know that you have a
lot of very smart people here--

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.360
marketing people here, for
example, psychologists--

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.180
and they see the
world in a similar way

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.160
that's slightly different.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.770
If you don't have this
training, listen to them.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:08.260
But at the very least, have a
listen to what I have to say.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.380
My audio book is
available for like $3.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.320
The electronic reader
version is available for $3.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.380
You'll come away thinking
slightly differently.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:24.480
You'll come away, I pray,
thinking like a propagandist so

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.880
that, yes, there will
be some steps taken

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.040
to try to prevent
Putin and the others

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.100
from interfering with
our next election.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:38.190
But if we don't put down
our own personal firewalls,

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:41.100
the next guy foreign agents
put in the White House

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.030
may not be, forgive
me, a bumbler.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.950
He may be a competent
authoritarian

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:48.780
like Juan Peron or
Francisco Franco,

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.510
and then, ladies and
gentlemen, the jig is up.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.020
I see we have two minutes left.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:00.830
We have some very intelligent
people in this room.

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:05.050
I'm looking forward to hearing
some wonderful questions.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.680
Our nation is at stake.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.915
Impress me.

00:16:07.915 --> 00:16:09.895
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:21.450
AUDIENCE: I'll start out
because I'm holding it.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:24.240
Can you talk a little bit
about some of the propaganda

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.110
you perpetrated?

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.830
It could be for good,
not necessarily for evil.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.380
JACK NOLAN: I can give
you a brief overview

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.140
of what PSYOP units do.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.690
Now, mind, I don't
oversell myself.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.140
I'm no war hero.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:43.080
I served with the 353rd
research and analysis company

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.080
here in Seal Beach and
when they inactivated

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.560
with the 15th tactical
up in upland California--

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.020
both fine units.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:57.010
PSYOP deals with
foreign personnel,

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.670
whether you're dealing
with enemy combatants

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.940
or you're dealing with
civilians or enemy combatants.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.119
We have rained artillery
down upon an Iraqi unit.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.160
It's reduced to 50% strength.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.700
We rained down upon these
little comic strips,

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.190
and these little comic strips
provide explicit instructions

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.310
on how to surrender
safely and why

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.010
you want to because we have a
good reputation, or at least

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.440
we did.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:22.950
I'm an MP.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:23.824
Don't get me started.

00:17:23.824 --> 00:17:24.339
Abu Ghraib.

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:27.174
So and they,
therefore, surrender,

00:17:27.174 --> 00:17:29.340
which means that they are
not fighting to the death,

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.470
we're not having to fight
people to the death,

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.280
and lives are saved.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.630
Now, this is a weapon system,
classified as a weapon system.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.640
And we're prohibited
from using it on you,

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.004
but the point is lives
were saved on both sides.

00:17:42.004 --> 00:17:44.170
And I think everybody can
get behind that, no matter

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:48.030
where they stand on the
interventions in the Gulf.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.600
Another example might be
interfacing with civilians.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.570
Hey, folks, this is
our main supply route.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.910
Please don't drive here.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.230
Please don't walk here.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.700
Even if you're a
refugee, we really

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.270
hate picking you out
of our tank treads.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.590
Sorry, black humor.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.850
All right, that's
what PSYOP units do,

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.480
and I was involved in that,
in the production of it--

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:14.130
researching and profiling
target audiences when

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.480
I was in the research company.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:20.580
Tactical PSYOP is a little
bit more boots on the ground,

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.960
using loudspeakers.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.830
As an example, you wheel
up a loudspeaker up

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.252
to some enemy unit, and you play
the sound of tanks going on.

00:18:29.252 --> 00:18:30.960
And they think, oh,
we're being attacked.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.543
No you're not.

00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:33.630
It's a loudspeaker, fine.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.500
You do that two
times, three times,

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.750
they start getting used to it.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:40.490
By the 30th time, it's
a real tank company.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.990
So yeah, there's a lot of wicked
supervillain stuff going on

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.857
here.

00:18:43.857 --> 00:18:45.940
But the things that I would
like to tell you about

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.290
are the things that I
saw in civilian world.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.710
I was on the set of a television
show-- no names, please.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.470
Here's the DP saying--

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.150
I'm standing in, so I'm right
there on top of the action.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.260
Here's the DP saying, OK,
so the bartender pours

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.300
the Drambuie in one hand,
the Coke in the other.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.160
We pan down from that
to the drink, then

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.770
over here to our actor
sitting in the booth,

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.680
and I get my $25,000, right?

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.919
Now, a side fact--

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:13.710
I resent this because
he's getting 25 grand

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.690
and not sharing it
with us when we're

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.647
in this de facto commercial.

00:19:17.647 --> 00:19:19.230
I've complained to
my guilds about it.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.230
It's a long story.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:21.930
But I mean, also,
look how simple

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.890
it was for them to slip a
Drambuie and a Coca-Cola

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.104
commercial right there
into your television show.

00:19:28.104 --> 00:19:29.520
And I can show you
that on Netflix

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.186
right now when you
think you're watching

00:19:31.186 --> 00:19:33.090
a commercial-free show.

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:36.020
No, there's no such thing.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.880
Another one that I
was involved in--

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:44.610
some of you may remember
"Superman Returns."

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.700
And there's a scene
there where Superman

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.060
lands a plane in the stadium,
and a kid yells out, Superman!

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.790
I was right there when that
was being filmed, by the way.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.980
And you look it up,
you'll see there's

00:19:54.980 --> 00:20:00.440
a guy right behind him holding
a big cup marked Bud Light.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:05.050
They're using Superman
to sell alcohol to kids.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:06.050
But nothing has changed.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.340
Back in 1980, I
remember "Superman 2"

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.950
when he was fighting
General Zod.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.510
General Zod punches
him and slams him

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.060
into a great big Marlboro truck.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.620
Now we're using Superman
to sell tobacco to kids.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.940
Must I quote Kevin Spacey?

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.170
That's wrong!

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:28.520
So those are examples
that I've personally seen

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.630
and examples of some things
I've had of my part in.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.530
One last example-- feature
film that I was involved in--

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.450
again, no names, please.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.370
My job is, simply, to
type away at a computer.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.780
And they set the camera
right here next to me, great.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.850
Set guy puts an open
can of Sierra Mist

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.910
right there next to me.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.260
Well, maybe it's his drink.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.460
I'll just move it aside.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.870
Nope, he puts it right back.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:53.860
Ah ha!

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.360
That's product
placement, and you've

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.193
got to give me a lot
more money to associate

00:20:57.193 --> 00:20:58.792
my face with that product.

00:20:58.792 --> 00:20:59.500
They replaced me.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.750
Did that answer your question?

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:05.650
Great, next question.

00:21:09.177 --> 00:21:10.760
AUDIENCE: I want you
just to follow up

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.650
there, since you were on the
subject of product placements,

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.280
is that something that's
been going on forever,

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.470
or is some of that more of a
reaction to things like TiVo

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:25.777
that would let you skip ads
that were put in overtly?

00:21:25.777 --> 00:21:27.860
JACK NOLAN: I can't speak
authoritatively on that.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:32.600
I can say that I have an eye--

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.120
my special sunglasses
for this sort of thing.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.790
Let's go back to Casablanca.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:38.510
Everyone seen it?

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:40.340
Wonderful, I love this film.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.470
That is great
propaganda, by the way.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.140
That is propaganda that
inspires us to be our best.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.880
I love this.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.330
But in the midst of it,
they are showing people

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.250
constantly drinking
and constantly

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.290
smoking, even Ingrid Bergman.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:56.720
Now, yes, they're in a bar--

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.490
Rick's Cafe Americain, sure.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:02.060
But the point is, they're
reinforcing the norm

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.760
that everybody smokes
and everybody drinks all

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.750
the time, including the women.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:09.230
This wasn't always so, and
now it's certainly not so.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.940
And if you watch the
film now, you look

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.760
and you think, whoa,
what's all this?

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.210
So yes, there is product
placement even back there.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.280
Now, you look at things today.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:23.064
I remember watching "Superman"
back in '78, '79 back

00:22:23.064 --> 00:22:23.980
in the movie theaters.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:24.920
I'm an old guy.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.090
And there was a Cheerios box
right there next to Ma Kent.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.760
And you look at--

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.160
I was in a TV show--

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.200
again, no names.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.270
Lovely scene, arguing
between a couple--

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:40.340
it happens take place
in a Nissan dealership.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:43.860
And this was about 2008,
2009, I'm going to say.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.370
So yeah, it's a
consistent thing.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.420
It's always been there.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.560
And it may always be there.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.202
The exceptions, thank heaven,
are wonderful fantasies

00:22:53.202 --> 00:22:55.660
like Star Wars or Lord of the
Rings, where you can't really

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.085
slip a Cheerios box in there.

00:22:58.085 --> 00:23:00.830
Does that answer your question?

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:04.140
Very good, anyone else?

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:04.640
Please.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.430
AUDIENCE: I'm interested
in this deny access step,

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.620
and I'm wondering
by what mechanism

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:18.490
do we achieve that because,
since everything that we see

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:22.900
around us is basically a form
of propaganda and everybody

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.230
has a lot more money and
willpower than we do?

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:31.930
So the deny access step
seems like kind of a way

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.440
to just get into this
extreme form of isolation,

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.150
and that seems kind
of dangerous also.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.980
So how do we do that?

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.910
JACK NOLAN: That is
an excellent question.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.910
I myself have to wrestle
with that every day.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.810
Now, there's no way to
absolutely deny access,

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:50.600
obviously.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.610
You're a person living
in the modern world.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:56.110
And I wrestle with this.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:59.442
I can't go out of my apartment
without seeing billboards.

00:23:59.442 --> 00:24:01.900
And every time I see one, I
have this parenthetical message

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.840
in my head-- made you look.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.720
So it's like a constant
warfare, and I really

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.380
do feel like my force
fields are up all the time.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.000
It's like this
pressure, and it makes

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.600
me feel like a foreigner
in my own culture.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.939
And I don't like
feeling like that.

00:24:18.939 --> 00:24:20.980
But at least I know that
that kind of advertising

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.390
is relatively harmless.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:28.330
When you get into watching a
political debate on television,

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:30.430
you can feel them
trying to channel you

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.980
into left audience,
right audience

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.560
and then trying to encourage
your brand loyalty.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.500
And that's harmful.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.260
You've seen the rise
of polarization.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.761
You've seen that
it's very difficult

00:24:42.761 --> 00:24:44.426
to have a conversation
with somebody who

00:24:44.426 --> 00:24:46.900
holds a different political
view because they immediately

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:51.400
become defensive and hostile,
and often, so do you.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.120
So how does one deny access?

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.410
Well, the simple and
obvious tools, of course--

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.450
don't watch
commercial television.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:02.950
Watch it on Netflix.

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.847
Read a book.

00:25:04.847 --> 00:25:06.430
Except I remember
one time I opened up

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.430
a '70s copy of William
Goldman's "Marathon Man,"

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.120
and right there
was a Marlboro ad.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.590
Great.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.060
Fortunately, that
practice is gone.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:21.790
Ad blockers on your computer,
using a secure browser.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:24.010
I, personally, use
Firefox, but I'm

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:26.500
going to bow to the superior
experience of everybody

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.310
in here.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:32.900
Adblock Plus is still, despite
recent issues, still very good.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.320
I'm able to watch YouTube
without commercials popping up.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.550
That's helpful.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:39.940
Just being aware and
finding every way

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:43.750
you can deny access without
cutting yourself off.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.120
Yes, it requires effort,
and it requires thought,

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.880
and it requires application.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.700
But it's something, I
feel, that has to be done.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.730
It's a survival
skill in our culture

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.642
so that you can know that the
opinions that you've formed

00:25:57.642 --> 00:26:00.100
and the choices that you make
day to day-- economic as well

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.040
as political choices.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.719
Whether you go to
Harry's Burger,

00:26:02.719 --> 00:26:04.510
where a man is his own
boss, or whether you

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:08.460
go to McDonald's, where a
person is putting together

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.335
your food by factoring rules
written by some guy in Ohio--

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.540
are those choices your own?

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.220
If you have the
firewall in place,

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.560
and if you try to deny
access, you can at least

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.780
feel a little more confident.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.520
Now, Chris here reminded me
of a wonderful principle from

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.590
my military days--
defense in depth--

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:32.100
the idea that you have
multiple layers of defense

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.370
in order to secure something.

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:39.659
My car was stolen, so I put on
an alarm, and I have LoJack,

00:26:39.659 --> 00:26:41.200
and I have all these
different tricks

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.200
I've pulled to keep it
from being stolen again--

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.700
multiple levels of protection.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.410
It's the only way to be sure.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.830
Even then, it's not
foolproof, but it's better.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.140
And so that's the only
answer I can give you.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.360
And honestly, one
of things I hope

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.730
is that people will use my
book as a kind of framework

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.660
and that people who are
much smarter than me

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:06.100
like Noam Chomsky will come in
and say, hey, good start, kid.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.722
Let's build upon this format.

00:27:07.722 --> 00:27:09.430
Let's build upon this
framework and that,

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:12.530
by the time they're done,
people like you, for example,

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:16.490
coming in and telling us about
search engine optimization

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.630
so that a particular
sponsored product comes up

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:20.950
in your search list first.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:23.260
I know nothing about this.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.090
I need good people like
you to write that chapter.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:29.590
And more and more contributors
will come and more and more

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.920
people sharing their experiences
with things like denying access

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.290
so that this firewall can
get stronger and stronger

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:38.122
and it becomes less and less
associated with me and more

00:27:38.122 --> 00:27:39.580
of the kind of
collaborative effort

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.290
you see at Microsoft,
where they've

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.680
got Windows Defender, written
by many, many more than one

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.110
programmer.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.700
Next question.

00:27:58.292 --> 00:27:59.750
AUDIENCE: I have
so many questions,

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:03.140
but one of your
things is evaluating

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.520
the credibility of sources.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.950
And certainly, in
the last year or so,

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:11.390
fake news has been very
much one of the topics.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:15.200
And there are
various attempts now

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.810
on the part of like Facebook
and other companies,

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.950
including our own,
to try to figure out

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.920
how you might identify this.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.230
So how can you tell if
a source is credible?

00:28:30.205 --> 00:28:31.580
JACK NOLAN: A very
good question.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:36.020
Well, first off, remember
that the political parties are

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.700
trying to ensure brand loyalty.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.420
If you're one head of
a two-headed duopoly,

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.399
and you know your
product isn't very good,

00:28:42.399 --> 00:28:43.440
what are you going to do?

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.398
You're going to insult
the other guy's product.

00:28:45.398 --> 00:28:48.590
So if you see a
news show or a talk

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.470
show or read an article where
they're just constantly bagging

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:55.010
on the other side, you know
you're dealing with propaganda.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.310
Keith Olbermann opens
his mouth, and out pours

00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:02.897
a diatribe against Donald
Trump, or Michael Moore

00:29:02.897 --> 00:29:05.480
opens his mouth and talks about
all the terrible conservatives

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.022
in the world.

00:29:06.022 --> 00:29:08.646
Well, if you're a conservative,
you can naturally take offense,

00:29:08.646 --> 00:29:11.750
but even if you are a liberal,
understand that propaganda

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.145
you agree with is the
most dangerous to you

00:29:14.145 --> 00:29:15.770
and that the true
test of your firewall

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.311
is whether or not it can protect
you from propaganda that you

00:29:18.311 --> 00:29:19.070
agree with.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.380
And on the other side,
you get Rush Limbaugh

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.940
talking about the
liberals, and you

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:27.090
get Ann Coulter talking about
how awful the Democrats are

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.970
and how awful Obama is or was.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:33.220
And yeah, you can know right
there what you're dealing with.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.450
Now, most of the news sites--

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:41.540
CNN, US News &amp; World
Report, the BBC--

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.640
these are going to be
reputable because they

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.760
have a lot at stake
with their credibility--

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.870
as I said, the
extremes, less so.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:52.550
There's a very good website
that I've found I can recommend.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:56.180
I have some concerns about it,
but it's called allsides.com.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:01.880
And on allsides.com, they have
people reviewing and rating

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.010
the coverage of
various news sources

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.830
and saying where it falls
in the political spectrum.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:07.950
That's very useful.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.940
So they have a page where
you can look at the--

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:13.710
let's say you find an
article on Huffington Post.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:14.989
What's Huffington Post?

00:30:14.989 --> 00:30:16.530
So you look it up,
and lo and behold,

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:17.738
they're just left of center--

00:30:17.738 --> 00:30:19.460
fine.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:22.070
And so you know what
you're dealing with.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:27.200
And they present news stories
from all across the spectrum.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.810
So if you have an interest
in a particular story,

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:35.300
you can see everybody's take on
it and everybody's spin on it--

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.500
very useful website.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.630
I have some concerns
about their rating system,

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:41.619
but all in all, valuable.

00:30:41.619 --> 00:30:43.160
If you're looking
at motion pictures,

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.696
I did find a very
good site called--

00:30:45.696 --> 00:30:48.250
oh, gosh, what was this thing?

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.250
I'll have to look it up.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.840
But anyway, this
website mentioned

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:56.540
commercialism, consumerism
in its review of movies--

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.340
very good.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:01.760
I think we need websites that
will list the amount of product

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.060
placement from no noticeable
to substantial to Michael Bay

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.910
was feeding on pleasant
habits that month

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.910
and will tell us in advance
before we go to see it

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.310
because they're very good
about slipping these product

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:17.210
placements in there in a
way that you won't notice.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:21.140
And so I forget the
name of the website,

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.550
but I'll get back
to you on that.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.760
So these are very
useful resources

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.826
that are available if
you're looking for them.

00:31:29.826 --> 00:31:30.450
Does that help?

00:31:32.961 --> 00:31:33.460
Yes, sir.

00:31:41.187 --> 00:31:43.520
AUDIENCE: One thing you said
that kind of surprised me--

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.040
you characterized kind
of the state propaganda

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.820
as the big brother
and the commercial one

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:50.800
as the little brother.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.100
It kind of seems odd.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.470
I think it looks like
way, way more money

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:59.110
is put into the
commercial propaganda,

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:05.450
and also the
political propaganda--

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:08.680
there is somebody who
has as much interest in,

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.560
who also has the resources,
in kind of countering that.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.200
But in the case of
commercial propaganda,

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.080
where the main message of just
about every commercial that you

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:23.540
see is that, if you buy my crap,
then you will be loved, right?

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:29.880
That's the underlying message of
just about any commercial ever.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:34.449
Yeah, but then there's
so much little--

00:32:34.449 --> 00:32:36.490
I mean, of course, there
are people who tell you,

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:39.170
no, no, that's not
what's important.

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.400
They are out there.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.730
But the amount of exposure that
they can cause to you, I mean,

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.380
they're much smaller.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.800
So I mean, it would seem to
me it's the other way around.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.075
The political one is
the little brother.

00:32:51.075 --> 00:32:52.950
JACK NOLAN: Well, you
make a very good point.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:55.940
And I agree that,
certainly, the corporations

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.860
tend to be investing
more money, and there

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.470
are fewer voices refuting them.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:02.720
One of them would be, for
example, Buddhism-- the idea

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.451
of abjuring materialism.

00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:06.950
I've often thought
that, if Buddhism

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:08.840
were to become the
major religion,

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.520
that our entire
economy would collapse.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:17.390
Anyway, I was really
speaking more in terms of--

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.920
well, I created a Venn
diagram for the book,

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.920
which I wish I had brought
with me as a slide.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:27.470
But the idea is that advertising
is a subset of propaganda,

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:34.640
so purist propaganda you find
in state-sponsored propaganda

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.990
like you'd find, say, in
North Korea or the kind

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.990
that you'd see coming
from the political parties

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:40.960
during election seasons.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:47.120
The subset called
advertising is defined

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:52.220
as any message that directly
serves the economic needs

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.600
of the sender.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.080
And so you see, advertising is
a subset of the larger rubric

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.220
of propaganda.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:01.060
And to my way of thinking, it's
much the less interesting one.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.660
I mean, I feel that we have
that we've inundated ourselves

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.690
with advertising to the
point of saturation,

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:10.580
and I find it depressing.

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.699
But I don't find it as
dangerous as the kind of thing

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:16.040
that we're seeing
now with fake news,

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.590
and that's why I'm so alarmed.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:22.760
And honestly, when I wrote
my book back in 2015,

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.210
I had no idea that,
suddenly, fake news

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.360
and alternative facts--

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.070
a phrase designed
to make Orwell spin

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.679
in his coffin like a dervish--

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:37.250
that these would
become front page news

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.880
and would be dominating
the airwaves.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.210
Really, in some ways, I
feel like I was pressing,

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:43.672
and I'm very grateful.

00:34:43.672 --> 00:34:45.130
I wish things had
gone differently.

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:48.650
Anyway, so that's why
I feel that advertising

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:51.409
can be thought of as a little
brother to the larger scale

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:52.310
propaganda.

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:53.750
But you're right.

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.960
More funds go into advertising--

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.180
what we think of as
commercials-- than

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.630
go into political campaigns.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:03.990
But political campaigns
are significant.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:07.172
I know that, in a book
"The Assault on Reason"

00:35:07.172 --> 00:35:09.380
written by Al Gore-- and I
cannot recommend this book

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.734
because Al Gore is very
partisan-- however,

00:35:11.734 --> 00:35:14.150
he did write something that I
think is important for every

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:16.280
American to understand.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.380
He wrote that-- and
he's a senator, mind,

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.960
so he's putting his credibility
on the line by saying this--

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.140
during the build up to
the second intervention

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.154
Desert Storm--

00:35:25.154 --> 00:35:26.570
second intervention
in Iraq-- this

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:30.560
would be under George W. Bush,
not Desert Storm, excuse me.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.380
When the Capitol
dome should have

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:39.000
been ringing with extensive
debate, most of the senators

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.560
were absent.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.330
They weren't there
debating whether or not

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:44.190
our country should go to
war, which is, I think,

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.398
one of their major functions.

00:35:45.398 --> 00:35:50.340
No, they were out soliciting
funds for their re-election

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.690
campaigns.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:55.060
And what are they buying
with these solicited funds?

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.000
Propaganda.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.700
They're buying commercial spots,
and they're buying buttons,

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.760
and they're buying posters.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.720
So yes, propaganda,
once again, shows itself

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.840
as being one of our
society's major problems.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:14.040
And if we take it upon
ourselves to make ourselves

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.110
more resistant to propaganda--

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:19.330
mind, there's no such
things invulnerability.

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:20.970
I'm as well as they
come in this field,

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:22.510
and I'm not invulnerable.

00:36:26.652 --> 00:36:30.480
If we take it upon ourselves to
make ourselves more resistant--

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.380
and who knows?

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.480
Maybe all these senators
and representatives

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.390
will actually try other means
to get themselves re-elected

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:40.870
like doing their jobs well.

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:43.560
But that's why, I
feel, that advertising

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.120
should be considered
a little brother

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.680
to big brother propaganda.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:51.647
Also frankly, big brother
propaganda came first.

00:36:51.647 --> 00:36:52.230
Next question.

00:36:55.415 --> 00:36:59.710
Now, fair disclosure-- I'd like
to introduce Abbie Melideo.

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:04.110
Abbie Melideo studied
profiling with the FBI

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:06.330
and looked over the
psychological side of my book

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:07.590
when it was in development.

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:10.410
She also designed
this spiffy cover.

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:11.820
ABBIE MELIDEO: Thank you, Jack.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:16.440
OK, as a renegade
professional propagandist,

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.650
what can you do, if you
can do anything directly,

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.325
to target the fake news problem?

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.800
JACK NOLAN: In my
opinion, all we can do

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:33.300
is to put the firewall out
there like Windows Defender

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.600
or Adblock or any
other program that we

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:41.400
use to protect our computers
from outside tampering.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.780
But this is one for our minds.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:46.996
We didn't take it seriously,
and in our arrogance,

00:37:46.996 --> 00:37:48.120
we thought, no, we're fine.

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.328
Propaganda doesn't affect us.

00:37:49.328 --> 00:37:53.850
Yes, it does as any successful
ad man will tell you.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:56.580
And Putin exploited that--

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.260
not good.

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.870
I think we need to be
teaching this material

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:02.950
at the high school
level, as I said.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:06.900
I think we need to be
teaching Aristotelian logic

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.527
and argumentative logic at
the high school senior level.

00:38:10.527 --> 00:38:12.360
And so that's why I'm
working my friend Doug

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.860
King as a high school teacher.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:17.610
I'm hoping to turn this
into what's called a module,

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:21.960
like four-week standard module
and a two-week fast track

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.690
so that this can be available
to history teachers,

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:29.549
social studies teachers, and
English teachers, and in fact,

00:38:29.549 --> 00:38:30.465
anybody who wants it--

00:38:30.465 --> 00:38:32.760
it'll fit into anything
besides math, I guess--

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.540
so that this material can
be taught to our students.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:40.330
I think, as I said before, the
buck stops with us this time.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:43.470
The legislature is
not going to help us,

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:45.930
and the police
force can't help us.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:47.132
It's up to us.

00:38:47.132 --> 00:38:49.090
ABBIE MELIDEO: So are
you saying it's too late?

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.725
We have to start early
when they're kids?

00:38:51.725 --> 00:38:52.350
JACK NOLAN: No.

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:53.310
No, I'm not.

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:55.110
I think that anybody
can be taught

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:58.530
and can teach themselves, when
exposed to the right material,

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:00.990
to think like a propagandist.

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:02.940
Ray Bradbury once
said, if you can't

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.490
find the book that you
want in the library,

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:07.200
sit down and write it.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.060
Well, I looked around--

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:12.210
Edward Bernays, Gustave Le Bon--

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:13.930
God help us-- "The
Devil's Diaries"--

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:18.240
I had to wade that Parisians
sewer to write my book.

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.310
And now I've brought
his nuggets of wisdom

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:21.630
for you so you don't have to.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:24.290
You're welcome.

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:26.040
It was hard reading.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:32.430
But no primer existed, no
propaganda for dummies.

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.410
And so I thought, I'm
going to write this.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:37.230
I created a primer based
upon my military training

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:39.360
to say, OK, here's a framework.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.620
We can build on this.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.120
We can make this work.

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.620
It's not too late.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.860
We can give people the
special sunglasses.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:51.010
We can show people
how I see the world.

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:52.790
And I think that it will be--

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.850
well, it won't be
absolute protection,

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:58.380
but it will be one extra layer
of protection, one more barrier

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.230
to prevent outside influence.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:05.340
And that makes us more free
as individuals, as well

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:05.940
as a nation.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:14.560
ABBIE MELIDEO: Thank you.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.180
AUDIENCE: I had one
other question myself,

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:21.640
which was how can we use
propaganda in our own lives

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:24.939
for our own benefit in a
positive way, not an evil way?

00:40:24.939 --> 00:40:26.730
JACK NOLAN: Oh, I'm so
glad you asked that.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.335
Let me give you some of
my favorite examples.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.080
The tools of propaganda
are more properly called

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.270
the art of persuasion.

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:43.199
Now, we use persuasion
all the time.

00:40:43.199 --> 00:40:44.740
If the tools of the
art of persuasion

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:49.136
are not used to directly
benefit you as the sender,

00:40:49.136 --> 00:40:51.190
well, then they're
not propaganda.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.510
But you can use these tools.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:55.240
For example, I mentioned
using cigarettes and alcohol

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:58.300
in Casablanca to
enforce a new norm.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.980
Well, let's look
at people who've

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.590
used that tool in other ways.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:05.460
1967-- Bill Shatner's
"Star Trek"--

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.540
everybody remember that?

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:11.410
Well, you have a
milieu of the Mad Men,

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:14.140
where Caucasian
males run everything

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.180
and the women are consigned
to the switchboards

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:19.480
and the African-Americans
are consigned to the waiters.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.140
And they come home from
that exhausting world, where

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.360
the Democratic National
Committee are literally

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:28.630
punch fests, and they
sit down and they

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:33.280
see this new workplace-- the
bridge of the enterprise, where

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.740
an African-American
woman and an Asian man

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.380
and an alien and a Russian
are all working together

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.040
in harmony.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.123
And they're there because
of their accomplishments

00:41:41.123 --> 00:41:43.420
not because of their race.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.700
That was an inspiring
new message back then.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.892
I mean, it seems kind of
quaint now because, that is,

00:41:48.892 --> 00:41:50.350
we've kind of made
that a reality--

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:51.370
terrific.

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:53.530
But Gene Roddenberry
and Gene Coon

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:56.660
gave us this vision of a future.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.870
Another example--
there was a man

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:01.960
who was a veteran of
the Pacific theater.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.570
And then he went into
ad work, writing jingles

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:08.710
and so forth, and he got so
sick of it just like I did.

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:11.320
So he began writing
TV shows, and he was

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.870
known as TV's angry young man.

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:15.490
And after writing
some serious shows

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:16.990
and getting them
rejected by the censors,

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.948
he says, you know what?

00:42:17.948 --> 00:42:20.380
I'm going to make a fantasy
show because fantasy shows

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:22.002
the censors don't care about.

00:42:22.002 --> 00:42:23.710
And there's a fabulous
interview with him

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:26.980
with Mike Wallace, where Mike
Wallace comes down on him

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.530
for writing for a
lightweight genre.

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:29.821
What are you doing selling out?

00:42:29.821 --> 00:42:31.320
No, I'm not selling out.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.430
I'm making something amazing.

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:35.890
Well, that creator
was named Rod Serling,

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:38.800
and I'm sure you all
remember "The Twilight Zone."

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.190
Now, "The Twilight Zone"--

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.920
there's no interpreting.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.322
He dominates his audience.

00:42:43.322 --> 00:42:45.280
He tells you exactly what
he wants you to think

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.570
by the end of that show.

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:50.380
That's the mechanism of
manipulation at work.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.680
This guy was using those tools
that he learned at advertising

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.230
to channel you to his
preconceived conclusions

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:57.940
all the way.

00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:59.740
And God bless him for it--

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.750
really good stuff.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:04.270
Norman Lear-- "All
in the Family"--

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:06.404
showing us Archie Bunker.

00:43:06.404 --> 00:43:07.570
Do you want to be like this?

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:08.350
No, you don't.

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:10.360
Then don't think like him--

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.420
good stuff.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.870
And we see this continuing
in the modern era.

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:17.502
We see television shows
that are put together

00:43:17.502 --> 00:43:19.210
and motion pictures
that are put together

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:22.420
by liked people, who
have an idea of what

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.350
they'd like the world to
be and want to promote it.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:28.600
Most recently, and
please don't laugh,

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.520
I'm very fond of
"My Little Pony"--

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.080
the recent revision.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.760
Lauren Faust is the
name of the creator,

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.430
and she created a lovely vision
of the world as it should be.

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:39.940
And if you dismiss the
unicorns and the pegasuses,

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.680
it's a really lovely vision.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.610
So yes, this is
happening even today.

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:47.350
That's how you use
propaganda for the best.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:50.470
Just remember, your objective
is not to profit yourself.

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:55.960
Your objective is to elevate
and ennoble your audience.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:00.280
Hold on to that vision,
and you can't go wrong.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.140
SPEAKER: Anything else?

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.010
SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:08.004
JACK NOLAN: Please, please.

00:44:08.004 --> 00:44:09.920
AUDIENCE: Well, since
you brought up Goebbels,

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:15.250
do you have any thoughts
on his big lie hypothesis?

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:18.160
JACK NOLAN: Oh, there's
one of my favorites.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.970
It's a damned lie.

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:22.210
It doesn't exist.

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:24.340
The myth of the big lie
comes from a passage

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:29.290
in "Mein Kampf" in which
old Schicklgruber accused

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:32.890
the other side of using big lie.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:36.070
And there's also a passage
in one of the motion pictures

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:38.300
that Goebbels created called--

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.960
not "Jud Suss"--
which one is it--

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:45.100
anyway, one of his
propaganda stories,

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:49.330
where one of his antagonists,
who's, of course, Jewish,

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:51.790
starts talking about big lie.

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:56.020
And the English accuse the
Germans of using big lie.

00:44:56.020 --> 00:45:01.000
I read the entirety of Joseph
Goebbels personal diaries.

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.570
Never once did I catch him
bragging about actually

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:09.460
using the big lie.

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:10.630
And he gloats.

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:12.660
Trust me, he gloats.

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.830
No, I didn't catch him once
gloating about using it,

00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:18.260
and I can tell you that
it's not a principle that

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.860
is taught at the USAJFK
Special Warfare Center

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.420
and School for Psychological
Operations and Warfare.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:25.670
It's simply not taught.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:27.530
It doesn't work.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.200
While we're on things
that don't work,

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:34.360
and we're debunking myths,
subliminal advertising

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.330
from Dr. Joseph
Goebbels himself--

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:42.050
propaganda that is not perceived
is not propaganda at all.

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:44.030
Excuse me.

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:45.830
If you can't perceive
it, it doesn't work.

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:48.350
Now, can it trigger somebody
sitting in the audience

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:50.150
who's already hungry
and who likes popcorn

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:52.840
to go and buy some popcorn?

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:53.870
Maybe.

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:58.790
Can it persuade large groups of
people the way propaganda does?

00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:59.720
Absolutely not.

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:03.155
If it could, my job would
have been a lot easier.

00:46:03.155 --> 00:46:04.460
Does that answer your question?

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:08.370
Do we have anymore?

00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:11.520
I'm thoroughly enjoying
myself, so please.

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.920
SPEAKER: Well, I think we
can wrap it up for now,

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.360
but thanks again for coming.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.300
And I hope everyone
reads and enjoys

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:19.857
and takes lessons of the book.

00:46:19.857 --> 00:46:20.940
JACK NOLAN: Thank you all.

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:21.940
It's been an honor.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:24.390
[APPLAUSE]
