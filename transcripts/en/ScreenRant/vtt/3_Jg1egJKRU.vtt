00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.440
Some films go out their way to be offensive,
pushing the envelope of good taste even if

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.480
it means making enemies. But it’s when filmmakers
go in with the best intentions that they often

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.300
create the most offensive material. Even the
best filmmakers can suffer momentary lapses

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.460
of judgment and offend large groups of people
with insensitive choices.&nbsp;Here are Screen

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.110
Rant’s Most Offensive Moments in Popular
Movies&nbsp;

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.840
Jurassic World
While much fuss was made about the silliness

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.550
of Bryce Dallas Howard’s character running
through the jungle in high heels, there was

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.640
one line that had British comedian known as
‘Guzzy Bear’ boycott the film. “Another

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.531
paki roaming outside his zone…” referring
to the head-butting Pachycephalosaurus. Of

00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:50.190
course, dinosaur or not, “Paki” is a pejorative
term that people from Pakistan don’t want

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.819
to hear anywhere. It didn’t help matters
that the comedian googled the dino and found

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:58.359
the similarly named Pakisaurus, a lizard that
got its name for being from Pakistan, whereas

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.519
the Pachycephalosaurus from the film is actually
from North America. Still, they should have

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.460
given this one a second thought.&nbsp;
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.840
Among its many crimes against cinema, Transformers:
Revenge of the Fallen has two of the most

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.820
offensive robots ever committed to screen.
Created solely for the film, “Mudflap”

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.930
and “Skids” are inexcusable stereotypes
of urban African Americans. Since their characterization

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.910
has caused controversy, everyone involved
has been quick to pass the buck. From the

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.742
screen writers to the voice actors, and ultimately
to director Michael Bay, nobody wants to take

00:01:27.742 --> 00:01:32.160
credit for the gold toothed, illiterate, unfunny
attempts at broad humour in the broadest of

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.520
broad franchises.
Avengers: Age of Ultron&nbsp;

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.460
Joss Whedon has a history of creating strong
female characters and often speaks of the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.210
importance of this, which is why it was even
more disappointing to see what the Black Widow

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.690
character was reduced to in Avengers: Age
of Ultron. With so many characters, it’s

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.240
expected that some will get pushed to the
sidelines, and her love story with Bruce Banner

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.410
was at least somewhat established, but when
she tearfully refers to herself as a “monster”

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.451
because she can’t have babies, her persona
as an independent woman is diminished. Matters

00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:01.640
are only made worse when she later becomes
the damsel in distress, locked up by Ultron

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.310
and in need of rescue by Bruce.&nbsp;
Aladdin

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.310
Sometimes its the films that appear the most
innocent that can be the most damaging. Disney

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.920
has a rough history when it comes to the depiction
of other races and cultures, and unfortunately

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.610
it extends far beyond the animation studios’
early days. 1992’s Aladdin raised objections

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.840
at its depiction of Arabs. One line in particular
was famously removed from the opening song

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.650
“Arabian Nights”, which originally stated
“where they cut off your ear if they don’t

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.450
like your face”. Gone but not forgotten,
this controversy will always be remembered

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.160
as one of Disney’s many insensitive missteps.
Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace&nbsp;

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.760
16 years and a crowd-pleasing Star Wars relaunch
still haven’t made audiences forget about

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.900
the big mistake that was Jar Jar Binks. The
character is offensive in just about every

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.650
way. Not only is he an obnoxious failed attempt
at comic relief, but he’s also seen by many

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.790
as a thinly veiled Jamaican stereotype. While
this may not have been the intention of George

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.459
Lucas or actor Ahmed Best, the character’s
accent, physical comedy and clumsy antics

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.280
are certainly reminiscent of the minstrel
shows popular in the 19th Century but now

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.500
widely regarded as ignorant and racist.&nbsp;
The Little Mermaid

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.090
Speaking of minstrel shows and Disney missteps,
1989’s The Little Mermaid has one of the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.790
briefest yet extremely offensive examples
of the residual effects these minstrel shows

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.400
have left on the North American subconscious.
These shows would often have white actors

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.670
playing African Americans by putting on black
face paint and red lipstick, a look commonly

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.060
referred to as “blackface”. During the
Oscar-winning song Under The Sea, Sebastien

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.520
the crab introduces all of the sea creatures
and their musical specialty. When he gets

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.510
to the fish who sings disco, its look is clearly
inspired by blackface performers. Even though

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.090
it’s only shown for a second, you have to
remember how many departments of approval

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.150
every frame of a Disney film must go through,
and even though the songs explicitly states

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.160
that this is the “blackfish”, somehow
not a single red flag was raised by its appearance.&nbsp;

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.700
Spectre
While the Daniel Craig Bond films have brought

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.660
the spy into the new millennium, in many ways
the character still keeps one foot firmly

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.860
rooted in 1960s misogyny. Most recently, Bond
showcased his love ‘em and leave ‘em ways

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.410
with Monica Belluci’s character in last
year’s Spectre. After killing her husband

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.500
and making her a marked woman, he shows up
at her house to save her life, invite himself

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.849
in for a drink and have his way with the frightened
widow before leaving her to an uncertain fate.

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.120
Just another day on the job for Mr. Bond.
Man of Steel

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.699
Unlike Deadpool, some super heroes are meant
to be role models. In particular, Superman

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.850
is meant to represent the ideal hero, one
who always does what’s right and does not

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.669
resort to killing his enemies. While having
him kill Zod in such a brutal manner at the

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.600
end of Man of Steel had many fans calling
foul, this scene is actually offensive for

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.639
reasons apart from simple fan service. Imagine
being a parent, thinking that taking your

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.830
young child to Man of Steel would be a wholesome
alternative to the increasingly adult superhero

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.139
fare, only to see their powerful idol snap
the neck of Zod at the end of the PG-13 movie.

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.370
Director Zack Snyder has justified his controversial
decision in several interviews, but few have

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.740
addressed the act as symbolic of what the
older audiences have taken away from kids.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.150
In an age of ever-increasing awareness with
regards to diversity and representation, filmmakers

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.900
need to be sensitive and adapt in order to
not get left behind the times. What offends

you in movies? Let us know in the comments,
