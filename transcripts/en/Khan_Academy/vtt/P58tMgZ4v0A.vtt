00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:01.915
- [Instructor] What
we're going to talk about

00:00:01.915 --> 00:00:06.399
in this video are the origins
of the Russian people.

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:07.794
And in particular, we're
going to talk about

00:00:07.794 --> 00:00:11.711
the eastern Slavs who
not just modern Russians,

00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:16.222
but also Ukrainians and Belorussians

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:18.222
view as their ancestors.

00:00:19.643 --> 00:00:20.826
So let's think about the world

00:00:20.826 --> 00:00:22.576
in the ninth century.

00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:27.832
The early ninth century, we
see the reign of Charlemagne

00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:30.433
that we talk about in some
depth in other videos.

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:33.190
As we get into the 10th century,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.547
you see the reign of Otto the Great,

00:00:35.547 --> 00:00:39.651
Holy Roman Emperor over
the Germanic kingdoms.

00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:44.428
The ninth century is also
the time of Tang China.

00:00:44.428 --> 00:00:47.196
You have the Abbasid Muslim Caliphate

00:00:47.196 --> 00:00:49.570
in control over most of the Middle East

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.381
and North Africa.

00:00:51.381 --> 00:00:53.881
And it is also the Viking age.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.295
So we have here in this magenta color,

00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:00.590
this would be modern day Sweden,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.439
but it was also the
home of the Varangians,

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.352
or whom we later would
refer to as the Vikings,

00:01:07.352 --> 00:01:09.947
and we know them to be great seafarers.

00:01:09.947 --> 00:01:11.763
In Western Europe, they're viewed

00:01:11.763 --> 00:01:14.051
as raiders of towns along the coast.

00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:15.442
But you have to remember, these histories

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.844
are often written by
the western Europeans,

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:19.943
not by the Vikings themselves.

00:01:19.943 --> 00:01:23.096
But they were also known as traders.

00:01:23.096 --> 00:01:25.610
What you see here are
two of the major centers

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.115
of power and trade in the ninth century.

00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:30.791
You have Constantinople,

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:33.209
the capital of the Byzantine Empire,

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:35.328
and you have Baghdad, the capital

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:38.039
of the Abbasid Caliphate.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.332
You also see these major
waterways in eastern Europe,

00:01:42.332 --> 00:01:45.998
in particular, the Dnieper
and the Volga Rivers.

00:01:45.998 --> 00:01:48.832
And so you have these
significant trade routes

00:01:48.832 --> 00:01:50.458
going from the Baltic Sea

00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:54.006
either via the Dnieper,
crossing the Black Sea

00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:57.356
to Constantinople, or
going from the Baltic

00:01:57.356 --> 00:02:00.512
to the Volga all the
way to the Caspian Sea

00:02:00.512 --> 00:02:03.961
and eventually making
their way to Baghdad.

00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:05.857
And this is well documented.

00:02:05.857 --> 00:02:07.357
There is archeological evidence

00:02:07.357 --> 00:02:10.440
of Viking jewelry along these routes.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:15.182
There's evidence of artifacts
from these far off lands

00:02:15.182 --> 00:02:18.818
in Viking territory, and we believe

00:02:18.818 --> 00:02:20.802
what the Varangians traded

00:02:20.802 --> 00:02:25.230
were first they hunted in
this area of northern Europe.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.863
Now, the people who lived in this area

00:02:28.863 --> 00:02:30.863
were known as the Slavs.

00:02:31.794 --> 00:02:34.487
And there were several
broad groups of Slavs

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.723
that you will hear historians refer to.

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:38.857
You have the Western Slavs,

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:41.143
who you could view as
some of the ancestors

00:02:41.143 --> 00:02:44.226
of modern Poles, Czechs, and Slovaks.

00:02:45.774 --> 00:02:46.781
You have the Southern Slavs

00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:48.296
in what would eventually be referred to

00:02:48.296 --> 00:02:50.012
as the Balkans.

00:02:50.012 --> 00:02:51.503
And then you have the Eastern Slavs

00:02:51.503 --> 00:02:55.670
in what will eventually be
Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine.

00:02:57.547 --> 00:03:00.315
Now to be clear, they
weren't unified groups.

00:03:00.315 --> 00:03:02.208
There were many many many, for example,

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:04.041
Eastern Slavic tribes.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.377
Our best account of the early history,

00:03:07.377 --> 00:03:11.357
especially in the period as
we get into the ninth century

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:15.597
comes from what is known as
the Russian Primary Chronicle.

00:03:15.597 --> 00:03:17.705
And keep in mind, this was written

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:19.599
at a much later period.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.004
It was written in the early 12th century.

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:26.968
It is sometimes ascribed
to the Kievan monk Nestor.

00:03:26.968 --> 00:03:29.892
So at previous times, it was
known as Nestor's Chronicles,

00:03:29.892 --> 00:03:32.333
but we don't even have
surviving accounts of this.

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:34.940
We have surviving accounts
of copies of this,

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.722
or what we believe are copies of this.

00:03:37.722 --> 00:03:39.309
What I'll share is a version

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:41.249
of the Russian Primary Chronicle

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:45.144
known as the Laurentian Text from 1377.

00:03:45.144 --> 00:03:47.658
And this is, of course,
an English translation.

00:03:47.658 --> 00:03:49.168
It gives us some of the earliest accounts

00:03:49.168 --> 00:03:52.585
of the relationship between the Varangians

00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:56.561
and the Eastern Slavs
and how what we have come

00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:58.790
to identify as the Russian people

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.594
and the Ukrainian people
and the Belorussian people,

00:04:01.594 --> 00:04:03.677
how they got their start.

00:04:04.834 --> 00:04:06.462
So right before this passage,

00:04:06.462 --> 00:04:10.663
it talks about how the
Varangians tried to get tribute

00:04:10.663 --> 00:04:13.900
from some of the Eastern Slavic tribes.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.629
And it says the tributaries
of the Varangians

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:18.940
drove them back beyond the sea

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.851
and, refusing them further tribute,

00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:23.321
set out to govern themselves.

00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:25.664
So they pushed them back
beyond what we now call

00:04:25.664 --> 00:04:29.609
the Baltic Sea, and they
decided to govern themselves.

00:04:29.609 --> 00:04:31.669
There was no law among them.

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.802
Tribe rose against tribe,

00:04:33.802 --> 00:04:36.758
and they began to war one against another.

00:04:36.758 --> 00:04:40.032
They said to themselves,
let us seek a prince

00:04:40.032 --> 00:04:44.099
who may rule over us and
judge us according to the law.

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.093
They accordingly went overseas

00:04:46.093 --> 00:04:48.410
to the Varangian Russes.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.014
So they went back to the Russes,

00:04:50.014 --> 00:04:53.673
and they said, these warring
Eastern Slavic tribes said,

00:04:53.673 --> 00:04:55.395
our land is great and rich,

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:57.463
but there is no order in it.

00:04:57.463 --> 00:05:00.794
Come to rule and reign over us.

00:05:00.794 --> 00:05:02.993
They thus selected three brothers.

00:05:02.993 --> 00:05:06.910
The oldest, Rurik, located
himself in Novgorod.

00:05:07.777 --> 00:05:09.136
Right over here.

00:05:09.136 --> 00:05:12.099
Novgorod literally means new town.

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:13.857
Gorod means town.

00:05:13.857 --> 00:05:15.532
The district of Novgorod

00:05:15.532 --> 00:05:18.282
became known as the land of Rus'.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.881
So a lot of really
interesting things going on.

00:05:22.881 --> 00:05:25.903
The Varangians, first,
are trying to get tribute

00:05:25.903 --> 00:05:29.815
from these tribes, which is
a way of saying tax them,

00:05:29.815 --> 00:05:33.359
making them subservient to these Vikings.

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:34.754
And even though these Eastern Slavs

00:05:34.754 --> 00:05:36.373
were able to push them back,

00:05:36.373 --> 00:05:38.291
according to the Primary Chronicle,

00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:40.196
they said hey we need your help.

00:05:40.196 --> 00:05:42.787
We want you to rule over us.

00:05:42.787 --> 00:05:44.839
There's very few times in history

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:47.554
where people are asking a foreign group

00:05:47.554 --> 00:05:49.672
to rule over them.

00:05:49.672 --> 00:05:51.589
And so this is an interesting question.

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:55.216
Remember, this history
is written under the rule

00:05:55.216 --> 00:05:58.693
of one of the descendants of Rurik.

00:05:58.693 --> 00:06:01.076
So do you think it was actually this way?

00:06:01.076 --> 00:06:04.101
Or do you think the Varangians
maybe forced themselves

00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:07.796
on the Eastern Slavs and
later created this narrative,

00:06:07.796 --> 00:06:10.248
that they were invited to come in?

00:06:10.248 --> 00:06:12.062
But according to the Primary Chronicle,

00:06:12.062 --> 00:06:15.714
we have Rurik coming from Scandinavia

00:06:15.714 --> 00:06:19.547
to Novgorod and establishing
the land of Rus'.

00:06:21.008 --> 00:06:23.464
Now the word Rus is really interesting.

00:06:23.464 --> 00:06:26.254
Most historians believe
it to be the source

00:06:26.254 --> 00:06:28.467
of what we now say Russia,

00:06:28.467 --> 00:06:31.730
or even Belarus, which means white Rus.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.727
Some historians think
it comes from the name

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:37.220
of Sweden at the time.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.387
Some believe that the Rus
were a subgroup of Varangians,

00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:43.517
of Vikings.

00:06:43.517 --> 00:06:45.872
Some believe that the word is derived

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:47.903
from those who row.

00:06:47.903 --> 00:06:52.661
But either way, the Primary
Chronicle goes on to tell us

00:06:52.661 --> 00:06:55.411
from 870 to 879, on his deathbed,

00:06:56.627 --> 00:06:59.302
Rurik bequeathed his realm to Oleg,

00:06:59.302 --> 00:07:01.173
who belonged to his kin,

00:07:01.173 --> 00:07:04.841
and entrusted to Oleg's
hands his son Igor,

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:07.373
for he was very young.

00:07:07.373 --> 00:07:11.626
And then from 880 to
882, Oleg set himself up

00:07:11.626 --> 00:07:15.626
as prince in Kiev and declared
that it should be the mother

00:07:15.626 --> 00:07:17.126
of Russian cities.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:21.354
So Rurik's immediate successor is Oleg.

00:07:22.383 --> 00:07:24.348
And in the early 880s,

00:07:24.348 --> 00:07:27.750
he goes and establishes himself in Kiev,

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.000
expanding the land of Rus'.

00:07:31.332 --> 00:07:33.389
This is Kiev right over here,

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:36.639
and because Oleg was able to take Kiev,

00:07:39.007 --> 00:07:42.168
the state that emerges from Rurik and Oleg

00:07:42.168 --> 00:07:44.615
not only is it known as
the Land of the Rus',

00:07:44.615 --> 00:07:47.162
but it's also known as the Kievan State,

00:07:47.162 --> 00:07:50.153
and they're often known
as the Kievan Rus'.

00:07:50.153 --> 00:07:52.885
And you can see here
how that state expands

00:07:52.885 --> 00:07:55.777
over the next few hundred years.

00:07:55.777 --> 00:07:57.870
As we get to the year 900,

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.858
you have this off-white color,

00:07:59.858 --> 00:08:01.287
and you can see, it is in control

00:08:01.287 --> 00:08:03.454
of both Novgorod and Kiev.

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:08.553
As you get to 1015, it's
taken even more territory,

00:08:08.553 --> 00:08:12.720
and by 1113, which is near
the peak of the Kievan state,

00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:14.858
you see that it has taken control

00:08:14.858 --> 00:08:18.306
of a good chunk of Eastern Europe.

00:08:18.306 --> 00:08:20.274
And as the state expands,

00:08:20.274 --> 00:08:22.731
its character changes as well.

00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:25.400
As you get to the end of the 10th century,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.420
you have a major event in
one of Rurik's descendants,

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.045
Vladimir, often known
as Vladimir the Great,

00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:37.978
he decides to convert to
Eastern Orthodox Christianity.

00:08:37.978 --> 00:08:41.206
And in a future video, I might
talk about his rationales,

00:08:41.206 --> 00:08:45.162
or what historians view as
his rationales for conversion.

00:08:45.162 --> 00:08:47.508
And as we will see, over time,

00:08:47.508 --> 00:08:49.905
and because of not only his conversion,

00:08:49.905 --> 00:08:51.353
but essentially the conversion

00:08:51.353 --> 00:08:53.833
of the entire Kievan state,

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:56.654
over time, especially
with the eventual decline

00:08:56.654 --> 00:08:58.934
of the Byzantine Empire,

00:08:58.934 --> 00:09:01.298
what would eventually be Russia

00:09:01.298 --> 00:09:06.257
becomes a center of Eastern
Orthodox Christianity.

00:09:06.257 --> 00:09:09.657
Now the Kievan state lasts
as an independent state

00:09:09.657 --> 00:09:12.957
until we get to the 13th century.

00:09:12.957 --> 00:09:14.315
And from many other videos,

00:09:14.315 --> 00:09:18.057
you might be guessing what
happens in the 13th century.

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:20.883
You have Genghis Khan
and then his descendants

00:09:20.883 --> 00:09:24.347
emerge out of Central and Eastern Asia,

00:09:24.347 --> 00:09:27.952
and in 1240, you have the Mongol invasion,

00:09:27.952 --> 00:09:30.673
at which point, many of the principalities

00:09:30.673 --> 00:09:34.532
within the Land of Rus' become tributaries

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.434
to the Mongolians.

00:09:36.434 --> 00:09:40.308
And they would be so for
the next, roughly, 200 years

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:50.269
for the Rus, but we will cover that

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:51.769
in a future video.
