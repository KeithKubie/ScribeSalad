00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:09.209
If you have to ask why some animals kill their
young, you’ve never been a parent.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:11.159
Hello survivors, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:15.710
Aside from being adorable little bundles of
joy, babies serve an important purpose - They’re

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.510
pretty vital to keeping the human race going.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.790
Babies are born, they grow up, they make more
babies.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.990
And yet there are species that intentionally
kill their young and somehow haven’t wiped

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.170
themselves off the earth.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.170
Why would they do that?

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.660
Ok bear with me here because this is going
to sound paradoxical, but some species kill

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.859
and eat their young because it’s good for
the survival of the species.

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:38.710
And there are actually a couple of ways that
could be true.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.059
First off, don’t forget that raising offspring
is expensive, resource-wise.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.050
Baby animals are useless: they can’t find
food on their own, they slow the parents down,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.100
and they’re liable to walk right into the
mouth of a predator because they don’t know

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.159
any better.

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.989
So if a youngun is born when resources are
already scarce, some mothers may decide it’s

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.070
just not worth the effort.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.920
Or, if the little one is sick and the mother
thinks it’s going to die anyway, she may

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.780
figure there’s no sense letting a little
snack go to waste.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.620
That appears to be what happened when a sloth
bear in captivity in the Smithsonian’s National

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.830
Zoo gave birth to three cubs.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.940
She had raised offspring before so no one
thought there would be an issue.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.460
Then all of a sudden she ate two of them.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.030
Zookeepers intervened to rescue the third
and discovered it was suffering from hypothermia

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.190
and an infection, so the hypothesis is the
mother knew they were as good as dead anyway.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.380
Rather than just abandoning them, she ate
them, possibly so the rotting carcass wouldn’t

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.350
draw predators back to her den.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.110
Don’t go thinking we’re above all this
either, researchers analyzed cases of human

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.360
mothers who killed or abandoned their children
the day they’re born.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.310
The new mothers were typically young, poor,
and without a partner.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.770
In other words, they were short on resources.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.720
And unlike other mothers who kill their children
later, these women had no psychopathology

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.140
or suicidal tendencies after they had done
the deed, so the researchers suggested they

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.000
killed their offspring because of some instinct
evolved long ago.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.240
If mom doesn’t get you, you’re not necessarily
home free.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.760
When a male lion finally rises to the top
of the hierarchy and can start breeding, they

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.860
are known to kill all the cubs in a pride
that aren’t their own.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.410
By doing this, the females become ready to
breed sooner, so he can father cubs with them

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.910
and extend his genetic lineage.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.640
That’s right, the females breed with the
guy who killed their baby.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.630
Shakespeare’s got nothing on nature.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.390
Lions aren’t the only ones who do this either;
bottlenose dolphin males will separate calves

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.890
they know aren’t their own from their mother
and bash them or launch them into the air.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.930
Male langur monkeys will also kill offspring,
but never their own and never those older

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.270
than 6 months.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.230
That lead researchers to conclude it’s not
because they’re indiscriminate monkey murderers;

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.819
they’re only killing babies that are still
suckling.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.069
While they’re suckling, their mothers are
producing milk and in these monkeys milk production

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.690
inhibits ovulation.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.650
So get the kid out of the picture and the
males have a potential mate sooner.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.480
To counteract this, the females of some species
have developed an ingenious strategy: mate

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.220
with everyone.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.220
Bonobo ape females will sleep around so when
a little behbeh is born, nobody knows who

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.349
the father is.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.900
Scientists think that’s part of the reason
bonobos are one of the few great apes are

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.300
infanticide free.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.970
Pregnant horses will do the same thing.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.761
If a female horse is mated with a male from
outside her herd and then brought back, she

00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:16.040
will mate with multiple stallions in her herd
to disguise its paternity.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.670
And if she’s can’t do that, a mare may
actually chemically abort the pregnancy.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.360
This shell game of “who’s your daddy?”

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.840
keeps baby bonobos and horses alive.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.069
Just hope they don’t get smart enough to
develop paternity testing.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.150
Animals killing their young because it’s
good for the species sounds like a BS fact

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.600
but I swear it’s true.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.290

check out our friends at Did You Know.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:51.900
Don’t worry it won’t be as morbid as this
episode.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.610
So some animals kill their own babies, but
which animals don’t care about babies and

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.900
just have sex for fun?

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:09.349
We answer that in this video.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.850
Alright it's a wild world out there and there's
a lot of interesting animal stuff to look

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.850
into.
