It could actually be 90% as advertised and you were just unlucky, but we believe

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that high probability of this is correct or is the data actually contradicting this claim

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and you should complain that the claim is incorrect.

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's the essence of hypothesis testing. We make decisions whether a hypothesis is correct.
