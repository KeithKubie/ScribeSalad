00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.830
So this allows us to now start of course
knowing what H is, and then using that

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.160
for being able to now find a warp
between the two different images.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.010
So again let's take these
two different images here.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.640
These two points that I want to actually
be able to model, and of course,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.330
these two points are visible here.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.030
To achieve this first I need
to create a bigger space,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.860
coordinate space like this one.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.270
Then I can put this one here.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.000
Now I know these two points are aligned.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.870
You can put this on top
of each other that way.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.310
And, of course, this means now actually
I'm enable to align these two images.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.960
because I know where
these two points are.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.460
Course, we need to do a little bit more.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.370
We need to also do a little bit of
warping and interpolation, something we

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.540
have looked at before, to be able to
align this image with the other one.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.690
Basically, I need to
find the fact that this

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.840
is the original image that I actually
have the transformations for.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.570
And, of course, knowing this warp and
interpolation parameters,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.010
I can now generate a much cleaner
image between those two regions.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.530
And that will allow me to kind of
create a much smoother type of an image

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.140
between those two.
