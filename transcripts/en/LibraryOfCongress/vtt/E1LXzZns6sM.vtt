00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Came from Carolina
but went to school here at MICA

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.890
and while she was still there
had a dream for a web comic

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.860
and it just flat out
took off, it just --

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.200
she creates characters
that resonate with readers,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.500
she defies expectation, she has a
vision, she knows what she's doing

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.930
and that led to Nimona which
recently was a finalist --

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.550
yes, a finalist for the
National Book Award,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.510
a big hand for that I think.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.480
[ Applause ]

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.960
And you may know her as well
for her work on Lumberjanes,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.020
he fantastic work and we're
going to sit down and we're going

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.320
to talk about these successes.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.470
She's also written for
Marvel, she has other projects,

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.640
she is in Hollywood, she's --

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.590
everything she creates seems
to be option for films.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.220
Our hope is between live action
and animation people, smart people,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.970
talented people will bring
her vision to the screen

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.140
and she will just continue rising.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.200
It is my true pleasure to bring
to the stage for the first time

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.510
on this stage, Noelle Stevenson.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.250
[ Applause ]

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.250
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Which chair
do it sit in, where am I going?

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Go
there, go there.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.920
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: This
chair is as good as any other.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Well,
thank you so much.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.450
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Hi,
guys, thank you for coming,

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.280
now you can be [inaudible]
it says you're here.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.220
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: He's easier
to find, we know where he is.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.890
But thank you so much, you know
we were talking the other day,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.980
what moves me is people's origin
stories and I'm always fascinated

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.860
when -- like I was a kid my parents
threw so much pop culture at me

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.550
and so much art and it
was sort of a gluttony

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.970
of getting to see everything.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.680
You had the opposite experience
right, your parents were

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.760
like no Disney films, not much TV,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.760
I think what Scooby-Do was
one of the few exceptions.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.120
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah, I mean
I was raised in South Carolina,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.790
I have four brothers and sisters
and we were all home schooled.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.390
So you know we were kind of a --
it was the whole movement of people

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.890
who -- we weren't allowed to read
Harry Potter when I was growing

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.870
up because it would teach
you to be a witch obviously.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.370
I think I was not allowed
to watch Pocahontas

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.870
after my little sister saw it
at a sleep over and came home

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.000
and said mommy did you
know you could pray

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.910
to trees, so no more Pocahontas.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.270
I got a baby sitter fired for
letting me watch Power Puff girls.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.870
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
Yeah so it wasn't like --

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.590
I don't know if it was an across
the board ban on, you know,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.250
all kid's movies, like kid's media,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.740
but it certainly wasn't
a really wide open world

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.380
that I was partaking in.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.910
The first movie I saw in
theaters was the Prince of Egypt.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.510
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
Because it was about God.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.810
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: and it was
great, I mean I was obsessed with it

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.960 position:56%
and there's a lot of like instant
murder and naked man butts in it so,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.670
you know but it was about God.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.850
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You can have
that but you can't pray to trees

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.590
but you can have man butt.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.750
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yes,
because it was about God.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.810
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah, it
was all good, but they mellowed

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.330 position:56%
out as I got older, yeah now they're
so mellow, they are like too mellow.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.250
I come home and my mom puts a drink

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.100
in my hand [inaudible]
where's my real mom?

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Did
they change or did you?

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.200
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I
think that the kids --

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.330
I think that they were
hippies before they had kids

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.100
and then they wanted to be
like the good Christian parents

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.050
and raise their kids right
and they did that for a while

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.350
and then they got tired of it.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.290
And then they were just like
let's just be hippies again,

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.250
our kids are already, you know --

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah
and your parents are --

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.330
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
They're just going

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.630
to do whatever they're going to do.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.930
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Well, your
parents were next to you

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.740
at the National Book Award
ceremony right last year?

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.040
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Right.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And
they looked happy.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.640 position:56%
They looked like they were chilling.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.940
Maybe drinking with you.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.490
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Oh,
oh, yes, my little sister,

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.010 position:56%
I could only get tickets -- I mean
I wanted they said I could only have

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.340
one ticket, I will bring my
mom because I promised her

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.410
that she could come but then
my dad is like I want to come.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.710
So I was like I'll pull strings

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.010
and get you a ticket,
I got my dad a ticket.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.400
And they're like oh your
sisters are coming with us,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.080
I'm like I can't get, I
can't get two more tickets,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.010
this is a really expensive event.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.720
So my sisters like snuck in.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.100
and my little sister
she works as a waitress,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.550
so she worked as a
waitress at the time,

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.820
so she had a white tuxedo
jacket which happened

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.340
to be exactly what the
waiters were wearing.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.910
So my little sister infiltrates
the rings of the waiters

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.230
and at some point I just
hear somebody go shots.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.300
And like three shots are set down
in front of me and my parents

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.830
and I look up and she's like
disappearing again into the crowd.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So when a good
family goes bad they go really bad.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.990
That is amazing, so I mean you
were drawing, what I love again

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.480
with origins stories is
like if you don't get

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.840
to see anything except the
occasional Disney man butt,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.550
where do you go, well you were
drawing like stick figures.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.240
We talked about I think wild
rollercoaster rides, maybe ants

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.120
or decapitations or something.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.380
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I had an
ongoing series that I wrote,

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.570
filled several notebooks
with it was a story of an ant

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.100
who was traumatized
by rollercoasters.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.700
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: But he
wanted to overcome his fear

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.400
for rollercoasters so he would
like ride more rollercoasters

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.360 position:56%
and they would always crash in
terrible ways and this ant would get

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.680
like mangled and he was just like
three little black dots with arms

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.180
and legs and antenna coming out.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.050
So I would just -- all of his
body parts would go everywhere,

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.220
like in different train
cars and then he'd be

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.020
like no more rollercoasters, he's
have like this little ant cast on.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.610
And then like rollercoasters comes
in the middle of the grocery store

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.670
and like scoop him up and he'd
have to ride the next one.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.970
It was very gruesome.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.910
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Now you
were like 5 or 6 though right.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.310
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah I
didn't know how to write yet,

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.470
all I could write was like I
drew my things was like broom,

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.290
I think was the only sound
effect, it was like broom

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.290
and you hear it coming
and it was like oh,

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.670
no and then a rollercoaster
would come.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Did you let
your parents see your comics?

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.370
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I don't
think anyone else ever saw the ant

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.020
rollercoaster comics, I have
like a bunch of sketch books

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.670
that I kept all the time and my
siblings snooped through everything

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.270
so they might have seen it but --

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: If they can
infiltrate the National Book Awards

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.820
they can --

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.570
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah, oh I
have the snoopiest family ever,

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.940
everyone goes through
each other's stuff.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.000 position:56%
I was like my little sister came out
to visit me last year and she was

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.780
like -- I was like talking about
something that had happened

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.260
when we were kids and I was
like this is secretly how I felt

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.160
about it, I didn't want
to tell anyone that.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.590
She says oh I know
I read your journal.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: They're
just open too.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I think she has
like a bright future ahead of her

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.580
as like a spy or like a private
investigator or something.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Or your
lawyer or agent I think --

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.650
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: She
did do my hair and makeup

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.950
for the National Book Awards.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.250
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Nice.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.550
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: It was
this whole like bouffant thing,

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.890
it was great, it was cool.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Would
you let her do that again?

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.050
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
Oh, totally, yeah.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So
there are family skills,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.760
so you're there you're being
home schooled, did you --

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.970
like were you sneaking out comic,
I think you said you were about 11

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.860
when you went to your
first comic book store?

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.490
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I don't know
how old I was, I would have been --

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.790
I was into Star Wars at the time,

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.290
I was going for Star Wars action
figures, I wasn't going for comics.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.310
And I went to the one comic
shop that was in my town,

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.330
it was called like --
I don't know it looks

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.240
like a big castle with
a dragon on top.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.920 position:56%
It was really cool and they had like
a huge Jaba which I really wanted.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.690
And I remember the first thing
I saw when I walked in was

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.030
like a cardboard cutout of Princess
Leia in her like metal bikini.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.330
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.160
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: And she had
a sign taped over her belly button

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.900
with the like deals for the day
and I was like 11 and I was just

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.450
like oh, this is the kind
of place this is, I get it.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.840
And like I didn't ever go back,

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.400
you know I wasn't even
like oh no not a bikini.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.700
Like I've seen Star Was of course

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.870
but like you know I just got a
really clear message from that was

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.860
that this store wasn't for me.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.930
I could go with like my friend's
older brothers but it was going

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.680
to be weird if I went by
myself, so I just didn't go back.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Not for you
in a male, female way, did it --

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.150
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: It was
like this is what girls look

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.420
like here you know,
and you get the --

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.070
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
You just get messages.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.120
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Is that shop
still there, have you been back?

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.970
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah,
actually I went back,

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:33.380 position:56%
I was looking for some random little
comic that I was reading at the time

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.480
and I go in and it
was kind of like --

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.990
it's got a lot of cardboard
boxes, like long boxes full

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.070
of like back issues, very,
very like hard core nerdy now.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.380
And I went in and I was like so
nervous, I was like are they going

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.510
to be -- because it's a thing
you always do whenever you go

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.880
into comic shops, like are they
going to be nice to me this time.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.180
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: And the
guy behind the like counter,

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.420 position:56%
he kind of looked like you know like
a little I don't know like unshaven

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.400
and I was like oh is
he going to be nice.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.150
And he's like hi, how are you,
like what are you looking for,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.960
and he's like oh you like
that comic try this one.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.260
He was like so nice.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So it
was like totally different.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.860
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
He was introducing me

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.160
to like other comic book shoppers
in there and they were all like --

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.900
I was like this is great, I was
like so sorry that I judged you

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.700
because it's like a
weird dark basement.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.340
But it was so great and I've
been in like the most trendy,

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.170
like brightly lit comic shops and
people have been terrible to me.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.700
It's like you really can't
tell, sometimes it's just

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.150
like a little hidden gem of
people who really do want

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.920
to share their passion with you.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.190
They really like want to like --

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.040
they want to like introduce
you to more comics,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.030
like recommend more comics, so
that was an amazing feeling,

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:40.410 position:56%
just feeling like oh you never know.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: It's changed, I
saw a photo of the shop recently

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.390
and there was a dude in
a metal bikini out front

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.540
so I think it means things
have totally changed.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.430
No, it is -- I remember going to
Comic-Con and talking to Stan Sakai

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.510
who had been going to
[inaudible] Comic-Con for decades

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.100
and he'd bring his family
and he said we were --

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.360
you know my wife was often
the only female there

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:07.440
and we've just seen you know this
revolution, do you feel a part

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.160
of a revolution, do you feel
you know, what do you feel,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.320
what do you see as change occurs?

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.440
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I mean I
would say more part of a wave,

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.290
so and like I managed to jump on,

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.370
on the wave as it was already
happening, so you know the part

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.820
that I jumped onto was web comics.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.690
Web comics had been, it was
pretty new but you know 10,

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:36.790
15 years old by the time I started
dabbling in it and just so much

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.090
of the work had already been done.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.080
You know people had figured out how

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.820
to have a web comic what the
format would typically be,

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:49.070
how to monetize it using ads
and kick start and patrion

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.420
and so it was already this really
rich community and I managed

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:57.680
to just kind of like
standing on the shoulders

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.120
of giants you know,
that's what it is.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.570
It is like a lot of people
had laid the ground work.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Is there anyone
you look to artists, creators,

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.030
writers, anyone you look to?

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.330
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
Oh, yeah absolutely,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.270
I mean Kate Beaten is
another guest here,

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.230
she's one of the first
web comic artists.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.610
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Hark,
a vagrant, among others.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.910
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah,
Tony Cliff's book, Delilah Dirk

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:22.330
and the Turkish Lieutenant
was the first like serialized,

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.240
fantasy-ish comic that I
read that made me think

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.860
that I could do something
like that, you know.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.930
And then you know there's Yuko
&amp; Anath from Johnny Wander.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:36.760
Jess Fink, Ryan North
all of the old greats

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.060
who were working ten
years before me,

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.360
back in the olden days
of web comics.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:45.680
And they were, you know it was
just such a welcoming world

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.700
when I came into it and yeah.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So you're in
sought Carolina, you're in Columbia

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.040 position:56%
until you're about roughly 18 right.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.340
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: 17.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.470
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And then you go
off to MICA and you're majoring

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:02.100
in illustration and did
it feel like any sort

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.030
of cultural shift or you know --

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.330
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, you feel
like okay and now I'm in art camp.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I mean I showed
up and like the first college party

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.260
that I went to there were
clippers and they were just dolling

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:18.020
out undercuts -- I woke up
the next day and my wrong bed,

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.120 position:56%
with half my head shaved, I was like
this is the best part of last night,

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.010
it's the one thing noticed.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.830
But yeah no it was completely
different it was like --

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.650
I mean I came from South
Carolina, I came from a little bit

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:37.080
of like country club area and
like where everything was very --

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.010
it was just really controlled,
what I would respond to and a lot

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.140
of my friends would go to Christian
schools with the assumption

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.680
that you know if you
are exposed to sins you.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.280
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
You will become sinful

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.420
so you'd better not expose yourself
to that at all, which is just,

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.510
I don't know just strikes me as
like terribly backwards thinking.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.630
Like I don't know how
you can have so much --

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.980
have like real faith if
you don't trust yourself

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.680
to be out in the real world.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.900
But the place that I did go it was
a place of undercuts and a place

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.720
of tattoos that you administered
yourself and it was a place

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.730
of you know really, really
queer students as well.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:16.380
And everything changed, it
was like you know I have

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.860
to reexamine every single
thing that I've grown up with

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.770
because I know these people
now, they're my friends.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.250
So you know I have to reconsider
every single thing I've ever

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.840
learned, I was wrong about
everything and it just tore me

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.220
down to the base and
like built me up again.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.610
And I'm still you know trying
to reevaluate as often as I can

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:36.910
because I don't want to --

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So did you
start going out every night

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.610
and testing your faith with --

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:44.300
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Well, my
faith got pretty well tested,

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:49.330
it was no longer much
of a thing, but yeah.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.120
Yeah, I guess I should have
gone to Christian school.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:59.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So when did you --
you know, Nimona just what's amazing

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.480
to me is how you can
take something --

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.980 position:56%
some things emerge and they just see
fully formed and Nimona just comes

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.860
across as one of those
things that you just,

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.310 position:56%
from wherever it sprang you just had
such vision for it and such vision

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.550
for Nimona as a character.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.710
I think you've talked about going
through certain times of interviews

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:22.320
where you said you hated certain
female characters and you didn't

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.840
like what you were seeing, can
you just talk about the creation

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.780
of Nimona and what maybe
you were reacting to.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah, I mean it
all came out of just like, I guess,

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:38.200
a fateful collision of different
influences that I had at the time.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.240 position:56%
I mean one of them was that
Halloween was coming up and I wanted

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.440 position:56%
to dress, I wanted to dress up for
Halloween of course, it's a big deal

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.760
at our school, everyone
goes crazy on their costumes

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.060
and makes something
really elaborate.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.720
And I was like I dressed up
as a male character every year

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.170
for Halloween, I've never dressed
up as a female character before

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.310
because I don't feel comfortable
in the clothes that a lot

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:00.610
of female characters' wear.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.000
And even if I do it's like
most of them have long hair,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.260
I have short hair, like
where are the characters

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.570
who look a little bit more like me?

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.680
And I think I probably
dressed up as Hawkeye

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.040
or something that year anyway.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.560
But it was like on my mind that
I wanted to design somebody

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.630
who was iconic and just
looked a little bit different

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:25.000
from the other heroines
that I had to pick from.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.020
And so that was kind of on my
mind and then also I was --

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.350
drawing like this Joan of Arc
type character a lot of the time.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:39.020
It was just like a medieval
interest that I was just exploring

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.840
and so I went to a class and they
were like all right you're going

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.180
to make a character in 30
minutes, I was like all right.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.930
You know, and it just came out,

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:51.560
like she just appeared actually
the character had existed before,

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.500
I had a character in high
school, whose name was Night Shade

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.550
and she was a shapeshifter,
she wore an eye patch

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.890
and she was really cool,
she was just like so cool.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Did you
cast her as Night Shade?

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.650
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: No I mean she
had never really been anything,

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.100
I had never even really drawn
her, it was just like an idea

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.830
and so I was like I
want to do something

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.830
with this character who's kind
of been floating around for a bit

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.850
but I've never had a story, she's
not been with other characters.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:22.270 position:56%
And so she emerged for this project
and it kind of combined those ideas,

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.570
I think she'd be like a super hero

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:24.870
because the original
one had been more

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.320
of a standard super hero
universe and then it --

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.790
I was like oh I'll make it medieval

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:33.250
and that added this interesting
flavor I think that took it a step

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:38.560
above the typical you know,
deconstructing the super hero.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.160
Like generic buildings, and
wear a T-shirt and like yeah.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.360
So yeah and it just -- you know
after the assignment was done I was

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.800
like oh I like this character, I'm
going to see where this takes me.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Well, can you talk
about like we're saying this image

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.650
if we can go to that
you know and her look.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:59.080
I don't know if she ever had
an undercut but you know --

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.120
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: The whole
back of her head is an undercut.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Exactly, so
the whole look can you talk

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:08.810
about you know as your -- you have
just a beautiful sense of design

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.790
and your characters, you have the
gift, you feel your characters,

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.280
you feel Ballister,
you know you feel sort

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.270
of this easy arrogance privilege
of Goldenloin right you know

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.150
so could you talk about
like you know when you --

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.480
her look and what you're
trying to do there

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.170
and what you've succeeded at?

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.920
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah, her
looks stayed pretty much the same,

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.760
it was really important to
me that she was like chunky,

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.360
just because that was
one of the things

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.360
that I like can't see as often.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.030 position:56%
And it's really fun to draw frankly.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.230
But she stayed pretty
much unchanged,

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.540
I think her first iteration
she had a different,

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.980
if anyone remembers read the
web comics she had a little bit

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.330
of a different look on the first
few pages and then I changed it

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:55.720 position:56%
to give her -- she's the most
anachronistic character in the comic

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.450
but I did want to give her a little
bit of almost like a pageboy.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:17:59.750
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.050
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
Effect to her hair cut,

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.780
so that's where that
haircut came from,

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.190
still with the punk element though.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.610
Yeah and it's funny because
I was like talking about how

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:11.350
like I wanted her to be
cosplayable and then I was

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.810
like yeah she's not
going to wear pants.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.560
And this was like really
funny to me,

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.420
the first two pages I had not
slept in like three weeks so I

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.470
like it was really funny to me
that she wasn't wearing pants,

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:26.160
I don't remember what the joke was
but there was some kind of joke.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.980 position:56%
And then I also like gave her the
shaved which no cosplayer ever wants

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.950
to like commit that
hard to, you know.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.540
So kind of shot myself
in the foot there,

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.590
making like the ultimate
cosplay character.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.270
Not that that you know should
really form your decisions

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:42.570
when you are designing somebody.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.290
But yeah I mean she stayed
pretty much the same,

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:50.320 position:56%
it was just like how can I combine
medieval elements with the some more

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.680
like punk elements, you know.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And
I like the sense

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:58.040
that you know Ballister you
think he's going to be this free

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.060
for all super villain
and that he has rules

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.070
and he has standards and --

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.690
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: No
one was more disappointed

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.060
than Nimona to find that out.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Exactly yeah,
and he has pants on thankfully.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.360
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: He does, most
of the other characters don't.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
I found that out, yeah.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.820
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.120
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So could you --

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.960
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I put like
a fanny shot on the second page

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.350
of [inaudible] I don't know how
anyone let me get away with this.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You could
cosplay like that a MICA

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.250
but anywhere else I think.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.340
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I'm really
trying to remember I had like --

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.920
I told my friend I was like we
need to draw knights without pants,

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.250
this was really funny,
I don't remember why

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.940
and it must just be funny
when you haven't slept.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.090
Which also explains the shark.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: It all makes
sense now, so before you guys --

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.060
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I'm
just destroying the magic

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.640
for everybody, no thought
went into it.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: At some point try
reading this after just not sleeping

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:50.730
for a week and you may --

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.920
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
It becomes way funnier.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So could you talk
about their relationship and that

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:59.240
because that's again very
immediately their dynamic was very

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.670
natural, can you talk about that?

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:02.970
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah, I
think I was always very interested

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:07.220
in as the middle child of five,
I was very interested in the idea

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.960
of having like an older
parental figure

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:16.040
who would give you
their sole attention.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:22.140
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Another way your
parents didn't measure up or --

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:27.750
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I mean
I was one of five, you can't,

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:34.550 position:56%
you just cannot, I was the middle so
I Batman and Robin influence there.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.590 position:56%
Batman and Carrie Kelly specifically
which I kind of expected to like --

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.410
I thought I was being so obvious
about the Carrie Kelly thing

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.630
and thought I'd get called out
about it but it's actually not

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.730
that obvious now that
I look back at it.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.590
At one point she wears like green
goggles and like yellow gloves,

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.930
I'm like this is such a
shout out and no one got it.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.150
No one knows who Carrie Kelly
is I guess, I don't know.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Another thing

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.020
that in the moment was
just yeah [inaudible].

00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.650
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah, so it
was kind of a Batman and Robin,

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:04.100
it was kind of a there's a little
bit of mystic [inaudible] in there

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.360
and there's a little bit of a
[inaudible] from Impossible.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Sure.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.960
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: So
those are all just kind

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.410
of the boss side kick relationships
that I was inspired by.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Nice, nice,
now in you know being 17, 18,

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.490
19 that can be a time of
enormous change and you were going

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.210 position:56%
through change, it's just incredibly
cool that she's a shapeshifter

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:29.710
and what that speaks to, identity
and feelings toward identity.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:32.330
Could even be identity politics,
can you talk a little bit

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.520
about why a shapeshifter?

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.820
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
Yeah, I mean that's --

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:40.360
it's the point of the whole
book I think is identity

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.060
and what was interesting to me
about Nimona was a spoiler like --

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.630
she doesn't have a default form,
which most shapeshifters do.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.470
So you kind of assume because you
meet her as this girl that this is

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:56.130
who she really is but it isn't,
and I think that really --

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.510
because I did make Night Shade up
you know when I was in high school.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.850
I had been homeschooled until
my junior year and then I want

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.460
to public high school for two years

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.740
and I just had no idea what I
was doing there, like who I was.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I just have
to -- how was that, was that --

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:13.300
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I just skated
through, you know, I like didn't --

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.400
I was in the drama club
and the drama club is kind

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.760
of in a separate building away
from the rest of the school

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.620
and I would just cut class
all the time and like --

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.950
I was friends with the
librarian and the art teachers

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.440
and the drama teacher so I would
just cut class an go and read

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.680
or I'd cut class and go and like
-- I mean I always had a note

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.190
or something, I'd be like I'm
painting sets at drama club,

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.500
I'm working on a children's
book in art class.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.610
So they would just let me walk out,
I was not used to sitting at a desk

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:36.960
and chair and having people be

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.910
like here's your worksheet,
do this in 30 minutes.

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.970
I'm like I'm done, can I go,
like no you have to stay.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:44.150
I've been home schooled for this
long, my mom gives me a list

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:46.000
of things to do, I do them
and then I can go play.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.720
Like I mean I was in high school
so I guess I wasn't like playing

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.790
but I want to go eat
a bagel or whatever.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:55.530
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: By the way
have any of those teachers,

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:58.650
librarians have they seen
Nimona or have they seen --

00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.950
have you heard from any of them?

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.090
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I'm
a little bit in touch

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:06.330
with my high school art teacher,
really she was one who told me

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:10.590
like art school was a thing and
brought in art like [inaudible].

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:14.710
So she's like basically
the reason, she was the one

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.410
who showed me what
illustration was at all,

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:17.900
I didn't know it was a thing.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: That's amazing,
you want to give her a shout out?

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.450
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah, yeah,
she's changed her last name by now,

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:28.050
Mary Connor, Mary Hendricks is
her name is now Mary Hendricks,

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:32.000
yeah and she you know I was
well taken care of there

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.820
and I was the only person -- I was
one of two I think in the school

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.640
who wanted to do like IB art.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.410
So they wanted to cut it, my school
tried to cut all the art programs,

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:47.810
all of the kind of higher art
programs and she fought for it

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.580
for me, even though
she had to double it

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.390
with the freshman art class.

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.970
So it was like me and one other
person a little table in the corner

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.950 position:56%
and then the rest she's teaching
freshman how to like make snowflakes

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.830
and not throw paint at each other.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:05.830
So it was like it was, you
know it was life changing.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:09.420
Yeah I'd never really had art class
before being a home schooler you

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.140
know because your parents
teach you everything you know.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:16.710
I'd had like a few art
classes here and there but --

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So good job Mary.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:25.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah and so I
mean being a shapeshifter was almost

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.160 position:56%
like the best thing that I could
think of because it was just like --

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.650
I was pretty invisible there

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.590
but I didn't really know how
I was perceived and I like --

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.620
I was fine, like I just skated
through, I had my friends and we

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.760
like went to see community
theater and like old movies

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.740
because we were huge nerds but like
I definitely wanted to be the kind

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.190
of person who went to homecoming,
I mean kind of, like not enough

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:46.800
to actually try but like you know.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.100
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.400
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Like in my
heart I was like what would it be

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.270
like to be prom queen,
I have no idea,

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.940 position:56%
literally it's the farthest thing
from my head, I don't even know most

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.240
of the kids I go to school with.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.240
They've been going to school with
each other since they were kids

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:03.160
and like now I'm here, like
the hell am I, you know.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: It's
the ultimate costume.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.960
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: It is,
what if I could just try this on

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.010
and just try this on and be someone
different for just a little bit.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:13.190
But like and I think teen girls
are kind of always thinking

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:16.890
that you know, you're like, I just
want to like be this person just

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:20.370
for a second and I don't
know how to be that.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:23.580
And so -- and then
you know when I got

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:28.370
to college I had my sophomore
year was a very, very hard year,

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:31.800
I mean it was the year I
stopped going to church.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:40.530
It was the year like -- a lot of
things happened and I just sort of,

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:45.200
I sort of -- it was
just hard I guess.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Did it feel
like a year of discovery?

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.970
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: It was a
year of kind of self-harm a lot,

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:55.570
that came out in various ways, you
know I lost a huge amount of weight

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:59.860
that year, in a really short period
of time and it was just like a lot

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.400 position:56%
of my friends at school that year
killed themselves and it was like --

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.170
it was just like I don't
know what's going on,

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:13.530 position:56%
I don't know which way is up, I need
some kind of hero who was as fluid

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.460
as I wished that I could be.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:20.370
Who can roll with these punches and
be a literal chameleon and just fit

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:24.280
into every situation that she's in.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.810
And like drawing her as chubby
was like a huge part of that,

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:30.930
with being like sometimes
I just want to disappear,

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:34.290
like I want my body to just
disappear and just having someone

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:38.780
who was so physically there, who
was just so loud and boisterous

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.690
and you know she had real weight.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:44.430
And took up real space and that
was just, it was my way of kind

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:50.470
of working through all those
feelings inside myself and --

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:52.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I
mean is brave act

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:56.220
of almost self-declaration
it sounds like.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.520
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I love, you draw
transformation just beautifully,

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:05.290 position:56%
the first time I saw that I still
remember it's just, it's so gorgeous

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:10.530 position:56%
in one panel the way you do that so
effortlessly, is it hard to get that

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:13.390
or did that just flow
from your hand?

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:14.690
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I mean
nothing ever just flows

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:16.560
from your hand, let's
get that straight.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I know.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.390
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: It's never
like [inaudible] it's never

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.690
like [inaudible] purple crayon.

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:22.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:26.340
I didn't know just how honest
we were going to be here.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.520
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Nothing
ever just flows from your hand,

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.820
get used to that right now.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:34.950
It doesn't mean that it
can't be a lot of fun but no,

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:41.510 position:56%
yeah I mean I was very, very alarmed
by I think Willow traumatized me,

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.570
the part where Val
Kilmer turns into a pig.

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:44.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:46.170
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: And it
takes him like a really long time

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:50.000
and it seems like it's really
painful and I was just like oooh,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.150
same like Pinocchio where
some children were like crying

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.400 position:56%
because they're turning into donkeys
and they can't even talk anymore,

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.930
they're just braying
and it's like, ahhh.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:00.690
So I wanted her transformation
into animals to not be horrifying.

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:01.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes, yes.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:04.100
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: So I came up
with this idea that she's kind of,

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.800 position:56%
especially since she's not really --

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.660 position:56%
I came up with the idea that she
would completely deconstruct herself

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:12.180
before she could turn into another
form, so she would kind of turn

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.630
into this black dust and
flow into the next form.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.900
So there wouldn't be that awkward
in between like animal stage,

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.960
where it's like I'm
a dolphin and a girl.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.660
It's funny that I love [inaudible]
so much and I was so horrified

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.150
by the actual act and that's the
media that I was growing up with.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:34.680
But yeah having the idea for
that middle period it almost was

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.450 position:56%
like the death of her previous body.

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:37.750
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:39.050
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: and she had
to kind of remember if she wanted

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.240
to go back to a body that she
had used before she'd have

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.290
to remember exactly
what it looked like

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.050
and build it, rebuild
it from memory.

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:47.890
And so she'd start getting
things wrong along the way.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:53.090
And so yeah that was my, I don't
know how much of that I figured

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:55.140
out at the time because again
this was for a school assignment

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:59.040
so it was like the night
before and I was like ohhh.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You
put in a lot of thought

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.570
for a night before,
it's just amazing.

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:03.870
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
You'd be surprised.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:05.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:10.210
and so again you've got the
beautiful shapes and the fact

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:16.200
that she is capable of this quick
violence that we don't get from --

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.090
we don't expect it from Ballister,
I mean it just seizes us.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.750
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah, I
mean that was my idea for her,

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.550
that was my idea for her and the
original idea for [inaudible]

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.500
when she was Nightshade was like
how does someone who just comes in

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.950
and they're not following the rules

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:32.040
of a typical hero villain
relationship.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.230
So you come in with your
sidekick and they just kind

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:37.450
of shout peppy one liners from the
sidelines and get like attacked

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:39.810
by bees or something, I don't know.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.990
And then she -- he has this
very chivalrous relationship

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.530
with his nemesis and they just
fight and then he gets arrested,

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:46.920
he goes to -- it's
the same every time.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:51.000
She comes in and it's just like
murder, like murder immediately,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.140
but no we did not agree on
this, what are you doing.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:58.110
We don't murder people,
well I thought we did.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:01.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: We're villains,
right, that's what we do, yeah.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.060
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: So
yeah I mean having someone

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:07.740
who just breaks all the rules
immediately and just looks

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.390
so different from what the
kind of set esthetic is,

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:13.970
it's like no we were supposed
to wear this today and it's

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:17.730
like well I didn't
feel like it, you know.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So Nimona
is being that one is going

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.070
to be an animated film right?

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.370
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah.

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: How much
creative -- yes big hand.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.740
[ Applause ]

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.860
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: It
is you know it is a movie

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.840
so things happen all the time --

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.150
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah
anything can happen.

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:35.970
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: You
know it can go away tomorrow,

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:40.540
it can become a live action movie
starring Vin Diesel in a year.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.560
Which I would maybe kill to see.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.940
I'd kind of like to live
in that dark universe.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:48.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: As long
as Vin's pants are on.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.660
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: No I was
going to say the opposite.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:51.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oh, I know.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.660
I was kind of like I'll say it and
if you want to take it [inaudible].

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.390
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I'm
really bad at like sand casting

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:59.550
or like saying here's
the actor I would like --

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:02.280
I was like [inaudible] for
everything but when someone asks me

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.300
who I would cast for Nimona, it
was like I want Vin Diesel to play

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.030
and Ballister and [inaudible]
will both be played

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:09.590
by Lucy Lu wearing different wigs.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:12.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Nice, nice,
does Lucy know this yet?

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:14.250
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
I haven't talked

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.780 position:56%
to her recently, we got to catch up.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I know right.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.380
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
I'll call her for brunch.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.680
I could tell Lucy --

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.580
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Have your
people call her people and --

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.880
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: All the time.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, the a --

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.620
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
I'll text her right now.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.920
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wait
hold on, the [inaudible]

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:37.000
so how much creative control will
you have over this other than Vin

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.670
and Lucy, you know in terms
of the vision because this

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:43.990
like it was a movie just heard,
I mean this is coming from,

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:49.730
this is art as an act of not just
self-expression but affirmation

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:54.810
from a deep, deep place, a
sleepless place sometimes

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:57.490
but you know this is your baby so.

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:01.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah, I mean
I'm really lucky when it comes to --

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:04.140
so far -- when it comes to
the Nimona side of things.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:09.460
Like Lumberjanes I don't have
any control over but Nimona --

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.990
I'm the co-producer so I don't --

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:15.800
they don't really need to ask
me permission to do anything

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.900
but they kind of have to tell
me that they're doing it,

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.010
so that's really nice, so it was
like I was at the kickoff meeting.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:25.510
I just have like a
bigger connection to it

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:30.160
and yeah I will be pretty actively
involved through the whole process.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.660
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: [Inaudible]
good but we'll see like trying

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.900
to trust these people to
do their jobs and I'll be

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.350
like oh you're doing
it wrong but go ahead.

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:43.070
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: and then
Lumberjanes it's again a rating

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.760 position:56%
up there in Hollywood but on track
for to be a live action film, right?

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.050
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
Yeah, so I've heard.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So can you
just talk about any hopes

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.840
or any fan casting for that?

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.140
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
Gwendolyn Christie.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.440
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.740
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I
legitimately did tell them

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.930
that I wanted Gwendolyn Christie,
I don't know, it means nothing

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:03.650
to them, I don't think that
they actually passed that on.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:09.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay, well we will
text Gwendolyn and go from there.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.140
And you do amazing sharks.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.390
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I try.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:16.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And
do you hear from --

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:22.700
because I've talked to you
know friends of young relatives

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:27.920
about what Nimona means to the,
you must hear from young fans,

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.560
young readers especially girls,

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.500
you know what do you
hear, what do they say?

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.510
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah, I
mean it's really powerful to hear

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:39.020
from girls who are writing from
the experience that I was kind

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.780
of writing from, you know
and the dedication is

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.450
to all the Monster girls which is
like when you're a teen girl you're

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.460
like I mean you have
a lot of power in you,

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.940
you're a monster kind of, you know.

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:55.730
Most of them that I know it is
you're like trying to look normal

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:58.750 position:56%
or what you think normal should look
like but then you also have like --

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:02.540
in my experience a lot of anger
and a lot of fear and a lot of just

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.150
like the desire to be heard
and listened to and respected

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:10.070
and loved even if maybe you
know you have too many feelings

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:12.880 position:56%
and maybe you hurt people sometimes.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.330
So that to hear from
girls especially you know,

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:21.760
girls with mental illness or
who have you know something

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:26.340
that they feel has come
apart and this is just one

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.380
of the most -- that's
who this is for.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
that's amazing.

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:37.650
And anyone inspire Goldenloin,
any one person or family member

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:43.860
or is that just you know,
he's -- can't remember.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.160
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
I mean he's a guy.

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: A guy.

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.240
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: A
guy with pretty hair.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay, okay.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.910
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I'm sure
he's like legless at some point

00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:55.490
in the past, legless
was my favorite.

00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:57.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Could
Lucy Lu play him?

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.140
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
Yes, I would love to.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.440
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.740
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
Yeah [inaudible].

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay
we'll make that happen.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:07.000
We have just a few minutes here and
I really want you guys to be able

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.810
to ask her some questions, we
have a microphone right here

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.630
and I can't tell if we
have one over there.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.180
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: It looks
like there's one over there.

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Questions,
I think I see a hand.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.270
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
There's a hand over here.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:21.790
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
it's right here, go ahead.

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:26.160
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite book?

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:33.660
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: My favorite
book in the world, oh, wow.

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:38.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I
was going to ask that.

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:42.480
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I really liked
the Phantom Toll Booths growing up.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.380
I read that one like every
year at around the same time,

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:51.790 position:56%
so it's like a journey of a very
ordinary boy through a world of math

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:56.830
and letters and I don't remember
exactly what happened in that book.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:58.130
I liked it.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:59.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Was
that one allowed

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:00.730
in the home or was that one --

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:02.440
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah, yeah
because it was educational.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:05.040
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Also Red Wall,

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.340
Red Wall was very gruesome,
do you remember that?

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Of Course, yeah.

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.450
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Mice just
like [inaudible] each other

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:11.520
and that was fine, that was okay.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.400
No problem in my house.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: They're mice,
they're mice that harm, [inaudible].

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:19.070
&gt;&gt; What was your favorite
Scooby-Do character?

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:20.380
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
Velma, obviously.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.100
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I was one of
five, I was one of five so everyone

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.470
in my family if we ever saw like --

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:29.940
this is what kids do I think maybe
still, you see some character on TV

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.230
and you're like that's you.

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.980
Like there's the ugly
kid and like that's you.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.570
So there were five of us, five
Scooby characters and they're

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:40.330
like you're Velma because
you're the nerd, ha.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:44.730
It's like no I'm not, yes I am.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:48.910
I love her and I'll still get like
personally offended if someone

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:50.470
like talks trash about Velma.

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:52.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
so if they were

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:55.640
to remake Scooby-Do would you
be aboard, would you want to --

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.200
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: They're
always remaking Scooby-Do.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:01.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: No I mean; no
I mean the full feature film.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:03.290
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
Would you make Scooby-Do?

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:04.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:05.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: In a heartbeat.

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:07.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:08.490
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah.

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:09.790
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: All
right, so take note, yes?

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:11.600
&gt;&gt; When did you first
get influenced to draw?

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.680
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I started
drawing before I could write,

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:19.230 position:56%
so I think I just -- I don't really
remember because I was pretty young,

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:23.100
I know my dad used to bring home
papers from his work that had

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.560 position:56%
like numbers printed on one side and
then they were blank on the other

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.350
and I would just color on the other
side and my mom would put them

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:33.470
in frames and -- yeah I
must have been probably,

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:38.930
I don't know 4, 5,
pretty young yeah.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.140
The almost couldn't keep
up with the amount of paper

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.250
that I wanted to draw on, yeah.

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:44.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: We'll
probably have time to work

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.120
in two more quick questions,
so right here.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.750
&gt;&gt; How did you come up with the
idea for like the plot of Nimona?

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:56.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I actually knew
the plot almost as soon as I knew

00:37:56.050 --> 00:38:00.340
who Nimona was, I think the
idea that she didn't have --

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:04.110 position:56%
that she wasn't really a girl, or
she wasn't really like a human girl,

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:06.860
that was like really the
seed that set it off.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:10.220
And I kind of saw what the
ending was where it's like who's

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:14.620 position:56%
to say she's not the dragon and what
do knights do, they slay dragons.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:18.080
So how can I like set
up this relationship

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.080
between these three people where
you know you have the knight

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.520
or you have the hero, the villain
and the sidekick and then all

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.780
of a sudden twist those tables and
reveal that it's actually the hero,

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.080
the villain and the monster.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.380
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.180
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: And they're
not who you think they are,

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.640
so I kind of knew exactly
what was going to happen

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:39.870
and it evolved along the way but
I knew that she was going to have

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:46.060
to sort of betray Ballister at some
point and reveal that she was more

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.340
than who she seemed to be.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.670
Yeah, spoiler, sorry if
no one has read it but,

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:55.250 position:56%
it's really good you should read it.

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:57.080
&gt;&gt; Did you ever plan out Ballister

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.750 position:56%
and Aroseous [phonetic] relationship
like from the beginning?

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:02.540
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Yeah,
I think that was like part

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.870
of the original idea was that
like you know it's like Lex are

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:08.920
in Superman and they're always
like you know their faces are

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.290 position:56%
like this close together and they're
like grrrr, but they like really,

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:14.790
really care about each other,
they follow each other everywhere

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:19.330
and it's like if Superman didn't
show up Lex would be really sad.

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:23.240
And so it's just like I wanted to
just like break down every wall

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:27.350
and this has this guy kind
of in love with his nemesis.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:31.410
Like not, almost not ambiguously
it's just like obsessed with him,

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:34.010
they can't think of anything else
and they use their fight as a way

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:36.370
to just like hang out
with each other.

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:37.670
&gt;&gt; Also I really [inaudible].

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:41.280
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: That's a
better one that some I've heard.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.850
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Your
last question right here.

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:45.850
&gt;&gt; If you ever get artists or
writer's block what do you do

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:48.480
to make things through that.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.800
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Sometimes
I just lie on the floor,

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.830 position:56%
it really down help, like lying down
just helps but now I have like a dog

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:56.310
and a cat so they both
come and lie on me

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.420
and so it helps less
than it used to.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.500
My dog will literally
lie on my face so.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.510
But I also find taking
a bath really helps,

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:06.030
I will just like you know
run a nice bath and hang out

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:07.390
and I'll be like oh I got it.

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:10.620
Or I'll take a walk or drive my
car anything that you're doing

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.840
where you don't have to think
too much and you can get away

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.980
from your screen or away from your
air pen and paper and just walk

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:21.790
around and it always helps to talk
things through, so I always have,

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:23.490
you know I have my friends
and they get so tired but I'm

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:26.570
like all right can you just
help me with this story point

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:28.090
and I just like talk their ear off.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.050
And they don't almost
say anything and then I'm

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:31.750
like oh you're a genius
you helped me so much.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:35.450
They're like I didn't say anything.

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:36.910
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: All
your friends are geniuses.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.210
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
They are geniuses.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:39.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
I think this will need

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:42.800
to be the last question, so yes.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.910
&gt;&gt; Who inspires you the most?

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:49.780
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Oh, wow, oooh.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:57.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You want to
lie down on the floor and think?

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:59.200
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: Taylor Swift.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.820
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Whoa, I
did not see that coming, why?

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.120
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: I
think Taylor Swift is going

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.420
to take over the world one day.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oh yeah.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.020
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson:
She's a super villain.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.320
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, she
is, people think it's Trump,

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.880
it's Taylor Swift, she will.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:15.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: It's going to
be totalitarian, she'll rule us all.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: She'll say
squad goals but she is --

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.540
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: We
will all be in her squad.

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:23.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: The
world is her squad, yeah.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.720
&gt;&gt; Noelle Stevenson: My friend
got me tickets to her concert

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:27.070
and we got these little wrist bands
that light up in time to the music

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:29.400
and as we were leaving it's like
they were still like kind flash

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.430
from time to time and I'm like
one day these are going to go off

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:32.900
and you know that Taylor
is summoning [inaudible].

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:37.020
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And with
that we will all be there

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.510
for your squad goals, a
big hand Noelle Stevenson.
