You know what I love? that all episodes of your show Youth and Consequences is coming to YouTube Red on March 7th?

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:13.220
You know me, but do you know what else I love? shameless self-promotion? Youth and Consequences YouTube Red March 7th

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.040
oh girl thank you for the plug but seriously i also really love practising self-care by getting tattoos with my best friend on valentine's day

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.760
-off screen- happy valentine's dayyy, oh it looks great

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.020
-off screen- getting there

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.740
it's happening

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.160
I'm trying so hard not to look like I'm in pain

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.260
does it hurt?

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.860
yeah, I mean it feels good but it hurts

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.580
one thing I really wanted to do this year was to take care of myself but when i was like sitting down and thinking like

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.430
okay what does this actually look like

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.630
All i could come up with was like go get a massage once a month and take yourself out to dinner and a movie

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.069
once a week or something, but as I've been living out the year i'm trying

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.990
to be very mindful of like okay actually like take care of yourself and treat yourself like your own child

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.569
i've noticed that self-care is about

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.209
so much more than just taking myself out on a date

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.060
Self-care is doing things that people don't necessarily agree with like one thing I do now is I don't go out if I don't want to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.190
even if I've clicked attending on Facebook, even if I told the person I would be there I know I have a tendency

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.050
towards being a workaholic and if i'm exhausted and my body knows it, I listen to that and I bail

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.220
because sometimes i just need to stay at home and recharge by like journaling or drawing or just

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.290
vegging out in front of the tv

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.300
(ahh, I needed this)

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.470
I've also been forcing myself, to be really healthy to a very annoying degree like by going

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.880
to the gym and eating healthy vegan meals all year and even if it's not really fun you force yourself

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.759
to do it because you know what's gonna help in the long term manage all of your

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.340
anxieties and depression

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.789
I've cut out unhealthy people who don't give a shit about my well-being

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:11.499
I've quit stand-up and improv all together to focus on other artistic pursuits and when people ask me how I am, I tell them

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.160
terrible

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.160
- Okay

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.128
- how are you?

00:02:15.128 --> 00:02:16.096
- not terrible

00:02:16.096 --> 00:02:17.139
- oh that's cool

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.390
I don't necessarily tell them all the details but i also don't feel the need to lie

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.009
for the sake of making regular chitchat, if you're gonna ask me how I am you're gonna know how i am

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.879
And I've come to accept things about myself like that I'm hella extra that I'm assertive with the capability to be aggressive

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.660
and I will always love

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.680
Harassing my friends for their opinions on my scripts and my songs and my art even if it's 1am and they just got home

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.360
hell i even come to love things about myself that normally i agonize about

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.280
daaaaammmnnn girl

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.880
yo boobs looking hella smart today

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.080
and self-care for your life may look completely different, maybe you're the kind of person who needs to force yourself

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.000
to go to parties or social events because you know that's what you need or it means taking a day or two off of the gym

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.519
to completely rest or adopting a couple of cats because you're a responsible mature adult who's ready

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.279
to give love and receive love with beautiful furry children

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.149
Whatever self-care means to you incorporate it into your daily life not just as like a once a month or once a week occasion

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.299
Really come from the mindset that you're going to take care of yourself because if we don't who will

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.229
