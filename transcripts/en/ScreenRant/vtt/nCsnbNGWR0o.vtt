00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.420
Even though a TV production schedule may be
lightning fast, show writers, directors and

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.360
visual artists take the time to pay attention
to the details.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.730
So when the chance to slip in a hidden reference
presents itself, they take it.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.539
Casual viewers may not catch the references
hidden in a TV show, but die-hard fans will

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.732
be rewarded with a nod to another one of their
favorite shows beloved by the writers - or

00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:25.960
the punchline to a long-running joke.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.480
Make sure you let us know about other cool
easter eggs we might have missed in the comments

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.480
below!

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.390
Here are Screenrant's 10 Hidden References
In Amazing TV Series.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.080
The Walking Dead - Red Challenger

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.829
In one of the lighter scenes from The Walking
Dead's first season, Glen drives a red Dodge

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.281
Challenger out of Atlanta, blasting music
and the car’s alarm to draw walkers away

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:45.560
from the other members of his group.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.690
A red Dodge Challenger also appears on another
AMC series, Breaking Bad.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.329
Walter White buys the car for his son, and
the general manager of the dealership just

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.160
so happens to be a man named Glen.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.829
The appearance of the car is just one of tons
of easter eggs that have led some fans to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.190
believe the two shows exist in the same universe.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.700
The Flash – Creator Credits

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.289
From its very first episode, The CW’s Flash
was jam-packed with easter eggs and nods to

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.070
the speedster's comic book history, but the
show also tipped its hat directly to the writers

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.210
who had made the biggest impact on the character.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.950
Writer Mark Waid illustrator Scott Kolins
and artist Howard Porter all contributed memorable

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.610
work to The Flash comics, included as street
addresses in the show’s universe But none

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.549
of that compares to Professor Stein's “Conway
Prize for Scientific Achievement” – named

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:39.150
for famous Marvel and DC writer Gerry Conway,
the creator of Stein’s alter-ego, Firestorm.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.470
Fringe – Fox’s Observer

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.170
FOX's sci-fi series Fringe followed a team
of FBI agents who use fringe science to investigate

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.210
unexplained events, all under the watchful
eye of a mysterious bald stranger called The

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.210
Observer.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.450
The Observer appears in every episode of Fringe,
but leading up to the show's second season,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.720
this mysterious man appeared on other Fox
broadcasts.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.200
He could be seen in the audience on American
Idol, on the sidelines of a football game

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.590
and a NASCAR race, as well as in the crowd
at a Major League Baseball game.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.049
Easter eggs in one show are impressive, but
across a network is something even rarer.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.789
The Walking Dead – Kirkman’s Works

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.860
Before The Walking Dead was a hit TV show,
it was a hit comic series by Robert Kirkman.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.250
It wasn’t Kirkman’s only comic, either.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.549
References to the creator’s other comics
are littered throughout the show's five seasons.

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.250
Carl's shirt from season 1 features the logo
of Science Dog, another Kirkman comic.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.370
And in season 5, copies of The Astounding
Wolf Man and Invincible make appearances on

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.220
screen being read by Carl and Enid.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.579
Community - Beetlejuice

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.730
Tim Burton's 1988 comedy/horror film Beetlejuice
stars a freelance bio-exorcist who helps ghouls

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.850
scare away the humans who move into their
homes.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.360
If you need his services, Beetlejuice can
be summoned by simply saying his name three

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.760
times.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.780
Community set up a three-season long gag based
on that idea.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.150
After working Beetlejuice's name into scripts
in seasons 1 and 2, the ghoulish character

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.100
appears in the third season when Annie finally
speaks his name for the third and final time.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.500
Gotham - Queen Consolidated

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.190
The CW's Arrow follows the vigilante Oliver
Queen, heir to mega-corporation Queen Consolidated.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.390
Fellow DC Comics TV show Gotham takes place
in an alternate universe, but the two crossed

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.420
paths when a Queen Consolidated Logo appeared
in the skyline of Gotham's famous city.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.900
However, Gotham producer Danny Cannon denied
this was an indication of a crossover between

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.660
the two series, claiming the logo's inclusion
was unintentional.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.400
The Walking Dead – Macon, Georgia

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.290
Following the success of the AMC series, Telltale
Games developed an episodic adventure series

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.109
based in the zombie infested world.

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.459
Instead of following Rick Grimes, the game
focuses on characters Lee Everett and Clementine

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.000
in the Georgia town of Macon (use gameplay
clip).

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.430
The game received critical acclaim, and even
earned its own reference in the TV show.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.699
In the season 4 premiere, Michonne points
out the county of Macon on a map - an easily

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.840
missed nod to the video game.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.299
Battlestar Galactica - Serenity Lives

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.269
The short-lived space-western Firefly has
earned a massive die-hard fan base who helped

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.670
the show to live on in the feature film Serenity,
named after the spaceship piloted in the series.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.310
Shortly after Firefly ended, the Battlestar
Galactica miniseries premiered – one more

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.829
cult sci-fi series with a dedicated following.

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.500
The premiere paid homage to its colleague,
including a brief shot of Serenity in the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.500
show’s background.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.360
The shot was included by visual effects artists
Jarrod Davis and Lee Stringer, who both worked

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.859
on Firefly as well as the big screen adaptation.

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.340
Community - Stock Photos

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.140
For a few years, NBC's Thursday night comedy
block was a heavy hitter, including 30 Rock,

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.980
Community and Parks and Recreation.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.010
When Troy is reacting to meeting his childhood
idol in season 2, a poster on the wall features

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.380
a stock photo of another NBC comedy star.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.600
The candy striper on the poster is none other
than Parks and Rec's Amy Poehler, who was

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.230
in her 20s when she posed for the photos,
well before she played Leslie Knope.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.230
Star Trek Voyager – Presidential Crew

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.480
The political drama the West Wing offered
audiences a look inside the workings of Washington’s

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.060
White House, and apparently earned plenty
of fans in the art department on Star Trek:

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.060
Voyager.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.630
So when a season 7 episode saw Seven of Nine
pull up a list of crew members killed in action

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.580
on the starship Voyager, names like Commander
J. Bartlett were obvious references to West

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.730
Wing cast members, like Martin Sheen’s President
Jed Bartlett.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.900
Star Trek graphic art supervisor Mike Okuda
confirmed the nod to the political drama,

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.180
and that he wasn’t the only staffer looking
to give the TV show a nod.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.730
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.960

or easter eggs?
