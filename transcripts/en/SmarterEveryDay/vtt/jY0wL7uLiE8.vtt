I'm Destin from Huntsville Alabama. This is Sadie and Spotsy. So here's my question.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.050
On the International Space Station, if you're free falling in one position,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.090
without touching anything, with no spin, and you have no airflow over you,

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.110
is it possible to wiggle in such a way that you're able to rotate to a different

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.150
angular position and then stop without violating the conservation of

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.200
angular momentum? On Smarter Every Day we demonstrated this with a high speed camera and a cat,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.230
who is a non holonomic system and can do this by extending his legs, arching his back

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.270
and twisting in a very specific pattern. So can humans do this on orbit? I'd love to see

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.310
a video demonstration on the International Space Station, and explain to me if your 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.330
brain had to figure it out or if you just instantly knew how to do this. Anyway,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.340
thank you for helping us get Smarter Every Day on orbit, and uh.. you want to say hey to the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.370
astronauts?
- Hey.
- Thank you. We look up to you guys.
