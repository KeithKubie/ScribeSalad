00:00:00.894 --> 00:00:02.094
- [Voiceover] One of the characters

00:00:02.094 --> 00:00:06.397
in Milton Murayama's
novel is considered blank

00:00:06.397 --> 00:00:09.540
because he deliberately defies

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.965
an oppressive hierarchical society.

00:00:12.965 --> 00:00:14.512
So we can think about what word (mumbles)

00:00:14.512 --> 00:00:18.075
you'd be considered blank, if
you're deliberately defying

00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:21.516
an oppressive hierarchical society.

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:25.134
So let's think about it, so
the first choice is rebellious.

00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:28.207
Well this seems pretty good, rebellious...

00:00:28.207 --> 00:00:29.669
if you're rebellious,
that means that you're

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.795
rebelling against something,
that you tend to rebel.

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:35.872
To rebel means that
you're fighting the power,

00:00:35.872 --> 00:00:38.806
you are rising up against the man.

00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:42.547
You are deliberately defying an oppressive

00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:46.069
hierarchical society, so this
seems to be a pretty good fit.

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:49.373
One of the characters in
Milton Murayama's novel

00:00:49.373 --> 00:00:53.367
is considered rebellious,
because he rebels against

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:55.166
an oppressive hierarchical society.

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:58.542
He deliberately defies an
oppressive hierarchical society.

00:00:58.542 --> 00:01:02.944
You could literally replace
the word, he deliberately...

00:01:02.944 --> 00:01:07.066
You could replace the word
defies with the word rebel,

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.633
and it would make complete sense,

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:10.797
because he deliberately rebels...

00:01:10.797 --> 00:01:13.973
rebels against...

00:01:14.373 --> 00:01:18.863
rebels against an oppressive
hierarchical society.

00:01:18.863 --> 00:01:21.444
So, someone who defies, or rebels against,

00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:22.907
well, they're rebellious, but we can look

00:01:22.907 --> 00:01:24.644
at these other choices to just make sure

00:01:24.644 --> 00:01:27.288
that they don't also fit in some way.

00:01:27.288 --> 00:01:28.498
So here they're saying...

00:01:28.498 --> 00:01:31.157
so choice B would be,
one of the characters in

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:34.523
Milton Murayama's novel
is considered impulsive.

00:01:34.523 --> 00:01:36.395
Well impulsive just means that

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:39.851
you don't think before you
act, you just do something.

00:01:39.851 --> 00:01:41.884
You could be impulsive in
a lot of different ways,

00:01:41.884 --> 00:01:43.938
it could be, in some ways,
rebelling, but it could

00:01:43.938 --> 00:01:48.424
be impulsive, just not acting
before you're thinking.

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:51.208
So this doesn't seem as close to

00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:54.839
deliberately defying an
oppressive hierarchical society.

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:58.167
Artistic, well that doesn't
really, that's not even,

00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:00.841
deliberately defying an
oppressive hierarchical society.

00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:04.138
Sometimes artists have done
things like that, but rebelling,

00:02:04.138 --> 00:02:06.216
or being rebellious is much closer to this

00:02:06.216 --> 00:02:08.178
than just being artistic,
you could be artistic

00:02:08.178 --> 00:02:11.085
and have nothing to do with defying

00:02:11.085 --> 00:02:12.528
an oppressive hierarchical society.

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:15.759
You'd just wanna go into a
field and work on your art.

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.922
Industrious, well
industrious means you're...

00:02:19.922 --> 00:02:22.558
you're always busy doing
things, you're productive,

00:02:22.558 --> 00:02:26.172
you're working hard, and
someone who's rebellious

00:02:26.172 --> 00:02:28.610
might be industrious in their rebellion,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.419
but it doesn't mean that
you're deliberately defying

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.590
an oppressive hierarchical society.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.958
So, if anything, you
could be very industrious

00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.350
being a part of the oppressive
hierarchical society,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.488
you're busy oppressing people. (laughs)

00:02:41.488 --> 00:02:44.537
So we'll rule that out, and then,

00:02:44.537 --> 00:02:46.242
it's considered tyrannical, because

00:02:46.242 --> 00:02:49.278
he deliberately defies an
oppressive hierarchical society.

00:02:49.278 --> 00:02:52.569
So tyrannical, you see the...

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.437
root of tyrant right over
there, so that's really...

00:02:55.437 --> 00:02:59.091
you're being like a tyrant.

00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:02.694
And so, someone who's rebelling
against, or who's defying

00:03:02.694 --> 00:03:03.936
an oppressive hierarchical society,

00:03:03.936 --> 00:03:06.258
that's kind of the opposite of a tyrant.

00:03:06.258 --> 00:03:08.405
A tyrant is someone who would run

00:03:08.405 --> 00:03:10.588
the oppressive hierarchical society.

00:03:10.588 --> 00:03:12.536
So I would rule that one out, as well,

00:03:12.536 --> 00:03:13.766
so we can feel even better.

00:03:13.766 --> 00:03:15.914
But if I was doing this
under time-pressure,

00:03:15.914 --> 00:03:18.634
I got to rebellious, that feels right,

00:03:18.634 --> 00:03:22.708
you're rebelling against
the hierarchical society.

00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:24.945
I would just go with that and move on,

00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:27.026
and if you have some extra
time, you could come back

00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:29.622
and review these other choices.
