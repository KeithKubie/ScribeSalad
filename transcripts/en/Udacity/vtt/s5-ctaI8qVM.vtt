00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.299
The tubes and
forms are basically

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:07.439
the underlying concept of
HTTP, requests, and responses.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.449
Well, we're not really
going to be shoving paper

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.299
through tubes, but rather
data through network cables.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.870
This is what an actual
request looks like.

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.579
This is the exact
text the browser

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.479
sends to the server to request
an image called kitty.jpg.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.399
Let's dig into the
first line a little bit.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:26.759
In this case, we are trying to
get a document from the server.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.600
The protocol is also able
to add, delete, and update

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.830
documents.

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.059
To distinguish between
these capabilities,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.320
the first line starts with
an HTTP method or a verb.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.539
This request uses
the GET method,

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.679
which means we want the
server to send data to us.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.109
Another example of
a method is POST,

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.530
which instructs the server to
save the data we are sending.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.429
There are more
methods than these,

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:54.659
but we'll worry about them later
when we talked about REST APIs.

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.909
Let's get back to
the original request.

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.789
After the method, comes the
path and name of the document

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.549
we would like to get.

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:03.269
Here, we want the
server to send us

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.770
a file called kitty.jpg located
in the pictures directory.

00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:10.799
The last thing in the first
line is the version of the HTTP

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.480
protocol we are using.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.740
As of today HTTP/1.1 is the
most common and widely supported

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:21.000
version, however HTTP/2 is
slowly catching up and taking

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.280
over as the de facto standard.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.849
More on this later.

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:27.419
Surma is now going to show you
the different kinds of headers

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.320
an HTTP request can have.
