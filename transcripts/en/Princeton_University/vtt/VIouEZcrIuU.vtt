00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.490
[HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.350
LORENZO LAING: I like hip-hop,
because it reminds me of where

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.970
I'm from -- New York City.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.480
While one, it can be fun,
it has a great beat that I

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.680
like to dance to, it also
is reflective of a lot

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.650
of societal issues, and
it brings the two together

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.250
in a really unique way
that I really appreciate,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.080
and I haven't really
found in another genre.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.480
My name is Lorenzo
Laing, and I'm

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.820
a senior in the Class
of 2016, and I'm

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.090
a sociology major with a
certificate in American studies.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.540
[HIP-HOP MUSIC]

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.480
So my thesis is on the
re-appropriation of rap music

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.420
by queer artists of color.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.210
So I'm looking at how a small
group of recently emerging

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.940
artists have
incorporated themselves

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.740
into a historically
homophobic genre, and one

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.560
that still maintains a
hetero-normative structure

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.320
in the mainstream.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.600
I think hip-hop dance very
much influenced my decision

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.070
to become a sociology
major, because I understand

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.280
that hip-hop music
can be problematic,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.230
and that those problems aren't
necessarily justifiable.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.970
But sociology has taught
me that those problems

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.640
can be explained.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.190
In doing so, we go beyond
superficial understandings

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.720
that can be potentially
dangerous of the genre,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.790
and of the people who make
the music and consume it.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.520
In terms of my thesis,
I guess I've just

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.900
been looking at some more
literature related to the ones

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.070
that I had looked at before,
just looking at general themes

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.330
like re-appropriation
and appropriation,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.090
kind of in a historical context.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.750
CAROL STACK: And are we still
hopeless about actually

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.130
getting to interview
some of these people?

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.980
LORENZO LAING: Luckily,
I got IRB approval

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.270
during our last meeting,
so I have approval to do that.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.240
Before Princeton, I had done
sports for most of my life.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.700
But before I got
to college, I knew

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.410
that I wanted to do
something different,

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.980
and I didn't necessarily
know what that would be.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.760
But when I got to
Princeton Preview

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.550
and I saw the Black
Arts Dance Company,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.630
I knew that that was it, and
I auditioned my freshman fall,

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.280
and I've been a
member ever since.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.030
What I appreciate about
BAC is that we're really

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.290
a tight-knit group.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.920
We're also a pretty
diverse group,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.350
and it's introduced me to
people that I might not

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.580
have met otherwise.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.790
So while I'm a social
sciences major,

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.340
I never really venture into
the engineering part of campus,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.790
but there are a lot
of engineers in BAC,

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.550
and a lot of
different class years.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.560
So in that way, BAC brings a lot
of different people together.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.660
Our friendship goes
beyond the dance studio,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.170
so we'll hang out
together, we'll

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.000
help each other with
homework, and we'll just

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.690
be there for each other.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.690
And then my dance company has
kept me sane, essentially,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.090
for the past four years.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.710
And I can't imagine
what the experience

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.010
would be without them.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.460
