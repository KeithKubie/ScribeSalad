00:00:00.532 --> 00:00:01.707
- [Instructor] So we're told the square

00:00:01.707 --> 00:00:03.578
below represents one whole,

00:00:03.578 --> 00:00:05.824
so this entire square is a whole.

00:00:05.824 --> 00:00:08.358
And then they ask us what
percent is represented

00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:11.775
by the shaded area, so why
don't you pause this video

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:13.902
and see if you can figure that out.

00:00:13.902 --> 00:00:14.904
So let's see.

00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:18.704
The whole is divided into
one, two, three, four,

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:23.137
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, 10 equal sections,

00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:26.136
of which one, two, three, four, five,

00:00:26.136 --> 00:00:28.792
six, seven are actually filled in.

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:30.723
That's the shaded area,
so one way to think

00:00:30.723 --> 00:00:34.616
about it is 7/10 are shaded in,

00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:37.312
but how do we express this
fraction as a percent?

00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:39.010
They're asking for a percent.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.613
Well remember, percent, it
literally means per hundred.

00:00:42.613 --> 00:00:44.557
Cent, same root as the word 100.

00:00:44.557 --> 00:00:48.010
You see it cents or century,
and so can we write this

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.905
as per 100 instead of per 10?

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:55.072
Well, seven per 10 is the same
thing as 70 per 100, or 70%.

00:01:00.472 --> 00:01:03.455
And how did I go from 7/10 to 70 over 100?

00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:05.400
Well, I just multiply both the numerator

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.567
and the denominator by 10.

00:01:08.652 --> 00:01:10.099
And once you do more and more percents,

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:11.336
you'll get a hang of it.

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:12.400
You'll say, "Oh, 7/10.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.928
"That's the same thing as
70 per 100, which is 70%."

00:01:16.928 --> 00:01:19.600
Let's do another example.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.493
Here, we're told 100% is shown

00:01:22.493 --> 00:01:24.618
on the following tape diagram,

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:28.827
so just this amount
right over here is 100%,

00:01:28.827 --> 00:01:30.843
and then they ask us what
percent is represented

00:01:30.843 --> 00:01:32.823
by the entire tape diagram,

00:01:32.823 --> 00:01:36.940
so by this entire thing right over here.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.964
Pause this video and see
if you can answer that.

00:01:39.964 --> 00:01:41.746
Well, one way to think about 100%,

00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:44.770
100% is equivalent to a whole,
and now we have three times

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.657
as much as that for the
entire tape diagram,

00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:49.291
so you could view this as three wholes,

00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:51.184
or you could say that's 100%.

00:01:51.184 --> 00:01:53.893
We have another 100% right over here.

00:01:53.893 --> 00:01:57.403
And then we have another
100% right over here,

00:01:57.403 --> 00:02:01.570
so the whole tape diagram,
that would be 300%.

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:04.003
Let's do another example.

00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:06.648
This is strangely fun. (laughs)

00:02:06.648 --> 00:02:08.522
Okay, and I'll see.

00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:11.639
It says the large rectangle
below represents one whole.

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:15.719
All right, so that's this
whole thing is one whole.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.010
What percentage is represented
by the shaded area?

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.590
So pause the video and see if
you can figure that out again.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.597
So let's just express
it as a fraction first,

00:02:24.597 --> 00:02:28.457
so we have a total of one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:02:28.457 --> 00:02:30.394
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12,

00:02:30.394 --> 00:02:33.644
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 squares.

00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:37.662
So out of those 20
squares, we see that six

00:02:37.662 --> 00:02:39.953
of them are actually shaded in.

00:02:39.953 --> 00:02:43.946
So 6/20, could we write that as per 100?

00:02:43.946 --> 00:02:45.716
Well, let's see.

00:02:45.716 --> 00:02:48.940
To go from 20 to 100, I multiply by five,

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.344
and so if I multiply
the numerator by five,

00:02:52.344 --> 00:02:53.437
I'll get the same value.

00:02:53.437 --> 00:02:57.582
Six times five is 30, so
six per 20 is the same thing

00:02:57.582 --> 00:03:01.749
as 30 per 100, which is
the same thing as 30%,

00:03:03.697 --> 00:03:08.568
which literally means
per 100, so this is 30%.

00:03:08.568 --> 00:03:11.467
Let's do one last example.

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:14.547
Here we are told each large rectangle

00:03:14.547 --> 00:03:17.762
below represents one
whole, so this is a whole,

00:03:17.762 --> 00:03:20.331
and then this whole thing right
over here is another whole.

00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:23.221
What percentage is represented
by the shaded area?

00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:24.596
Again, pause the video.

00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:26.611
See if you can answer that.

00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:30.958
So this one, we've shaded
in a whole, so that is 100%,

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.181
and then over here, we have shaded in one,

00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:36.747
two, three, 4/5 of the whole.

00:03:36.747 --> 00:03:39.186
So 4/5, if I wanted to express it

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:42.416
as per 100, what would it be?

00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:46.583
Well, five time 20 is 100,
so four times 20 is 80,

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.993
so 4/5, or 80/100, is filled out here.

00:03:51.993 --> 00:03:56.462
We could say 80 per 100, which
is the same thing as 80%,

00:03:56.462 --> 00:04:00.076
so this right over here is 80%.

00:04:00.076 --> 00:04:02.868
So what percent is represented
by the shaded area?

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:07.035
Well, we have 100%, and then
we have 80%, so we have 180%.

00:04:08.805 --> 00:04:10.295
It's more than a whole.

00:04:10.295 --> 00:04:13.478
If you have a percentage
that is larger than 100%,

00:04:13.478 --> 00:04:14.665
you're talking about
something that is more

00:04:14.665 --> 00:04:16.341
than a whole, and then we see that.

00:04:16.341 --> 00:04:18.109
We have a whole right over here,

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.406
and then we have 80% more than that.
