00:00:00.963 --> 00:00:03.765
LeBron: If the history of the
earth was a basketball game,

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:07.607
at what point in the game
will the humans show up?

00:00:09.084 --> 00:00:12.518
Voiceover: Let's first think about how
long a basketball game is in the NBA.

00:00:12.518 --> 00:00:16.099
We have 4 quarters that
each lasts 12 minutes,

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.110
so we're talking about 48 minutes.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.629
48 minutes of regulation play.

00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:25.057
I'm not considering half
time and the time outs

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:27.333
and the commercial breaks
and potential overtime.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.002
I am just taking about regulation play.

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:31.297
We could think about how the numbers
might change if you think about

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:34.338
the total duration of the game,
including time outs and commercial breaks

00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:38.090
and everything that might get
you closer to 2 or 2 1/2 hours.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.584
But 48 minutes we can
actually convert to seconds

00:00:40.584 --> 00:00:44.503
because we know that there
are 60 seconds per minute,

00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:49.690
times 60 seconds, 60 seconds per minute

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.552
and this is pretty straight
forward multiplication.

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:58.421
We can just say 48 times 60
gives us, so we got this 0 here

00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:02.293
and then 6 times 48, 6 times 8 is 48

00:01:02.293 --> 00:01:07.137
and then 6 times 4 is 24 plus 4 is 28.

00:01:07.137 --> 00:01:15.520
So there's 2,880 seconds
during regulation play.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.421
Now let's think about
the actual age of earth.

00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:24.417
We estimate that the earth, and
actually the entire solar system,

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:30.073
which was all formed roughly at the
same time, is 4.54 billion years old.

00:01:30.073 --> 00:01:32.083
So let me draw that here.

00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:32.965
We're going to make a comparison,

00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:34.852
so I am going to draw
it as the same length.

00:01:34.852 --> 00:01:40.996
So 4.54 billion years old
and just to give a sense

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:45.497
of how large of a number that
is, a billion is a 1,000 million.

00:01:45.497 --> 00:01:52.474
So we could also write this
as 4,540 million years.

00:01:52.474 --> 00:02:01.080
or we could write it as 4,540,000
thousand years, or millennia,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:11.964
or we could just write out the
number as 4,540,000,000 years

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:16.447
which seems kind of old but let's
think about how long anatomically,

00:02:16.447 --> 00:02:19.608
modern humans have been roaming
the surface of the earth

00:02:19.608 --> 00:02:23.587
and here we estimate that
anatomically modern humans have been

00:02:23.587 --> 00:02:30.251
on the surface of the earth
for about 200,000 years,

00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:32.691
which seems like a
reasonable amount of time

00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:34.998
but we'll see it's a very small fraction

00:02:34.998 --> 00:02:38.496
when you compare it to 4.54 billion years.

00:02:38.496 --> 00:02:40.526
So let's say that that's that little there

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:42.895
and I am actually overdoing it
when I'm drawing the diagram.

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:46.469
So that right over there is the amount
of time humans have been 200,000 years

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:48.661
and I am actually
drawing this way too big.

00:02:48.661 --> 00:02:53.596
But what we want to figure out
is what is that equivalent length

00:02:53.596 --> 00:02:55.748
in seconds on a basketball game

00:02:55.748 --> 00:03:02.712
or another way to think
about it, 200,000 years is

00:03:02.712 --> 00:03:15.691
to 4.54 billion years as
the number of seconds.

00:03:15.691 --> 00:03:22.306
Let's call this thing
right over here x as x is

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:24.482
to the total number of seconds in a game.

00:03:24.482 --> 00:03:27.726
So 2,880 seconds,

00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:33.633
2,880 seconds just like that.

00:03:33.633 --> 00:03:36.524
And one way that we can
do this, to solve for x

00:03:36.524 --> 00:03:39.750
and this is kind of a more basic algebra,

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.260
but just as a reminder if
we want to solve for x here,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.508
the easiest way is to multiply by 2,880

00:03:44.508 --> 00:03:47.127
and that will cancel with
this right over here.

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:49.673
but we can't just do it to the right
hand side, we also have to do it

00:03:49.673 --> 00:03:55.625
to the left hand side and so if
you multiply both sides by 2,880,

00:03:55.625 --> 00:04:01.959
so multiply both sides
by 2,880, you get that x,

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.010
the number of the equivalent number
of seconds in a basketball game.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.820
If the history of the earth
was a basketball game,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.014
when the humans would show up is equal
to the fraction of earth's history

00:04:11.014 --> 00:04:12.655
that humans have been around.

00:04:12.655 --> 00:04:16.786
That's this part right over here,
times the number of seconds in a game.

00:04:16.786 --> 00:04:19.990
So let's think about what we get there.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.337
We are going to have the
fraction of earth's history,

00:04:22.337 --> 00:04:28.907
so 200,000 divided by 4.45 billion.

00:04:28.907 --> 00:04:30.412
There's a couple of ways I could write it.

00:04:30.412 --> 00:04:37.545
I could write it 4.54e9, which
literally means 4.54 times 10

00:04:37.545 --> 00:04:42.208
to the 9th or 4.54 times
1 followed with 9 zeros

00:04:42.208 --> 00:04:47.496
or 4.54 times a billion,
which is exactly 4.54 billion.

00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:48.881
So I could write it like that

00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:50.920
or I could just write it out.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.877
I could write 4, 5 so 4
billion, we'll be careful,

00:04:56.877 --> 00:05:04.606
4, 540,000,000 and now
I am doing the thousands

00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:09.346
2, 3 and now I am just doing the 1, 2, 3.

00:05:09.346 --> 00:05:13.319
So this is 4 billion and then I
should have 9 places after that

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:18.710
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.586
So this expression right here
is a fraction of earth's history

00:05:21.586 --> 00:05:24.372
that anatomically modern
humans have been around

00:05:24.372 --> 00:05:26.574
and then I am going to multiply that,

00:05:26.574 --> 00:05:30.936
I am going to multiply that, times

00:05:30.936 --> 00:05:32.729
I am going to multiply that
times the number of seconds

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:39.004
of regulation play,
2,880 and now drum roll,

00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:45.183
we get .12, we could round up .13 seconds.

00:05:45.183 --> 00:05:50.424
So we get x is equal to, or I could
say maybe approximately equal to

00:05:50.424 --> 00:05:57.150
0.13 seconds and so, just to imagine

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.656
if the history of earth were
regulation play of an NBA game

00:06:01.656 --> 00:06:03.605
and let's say this game is kind of,

00:06:04.742 --> 00:06:08.729
at the end of this game there is a
buzzer beater shot that wins the game,

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.980
the humans don't show up in the
game until the ball has left

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:18.820
that final shot taker's hands and it
has just about to enter the basket

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.513
that's when the first humans,
200,000 years ago will show up.

00:06:23.513 --> 00:06:27.407
A little over a tenth of a
second before the end of the game

00:06:27.407 --> 00:06:30.597
and since we already have
our brains in this mindset,

00:06:30.597 --> 00:06:32.433
I will throw out another
interesting question.

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:34.566
Okay, humans are you know, just a flash

00:06:34.566 --> 00:06:35.820
that they've actually shown up.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.429
Just as the ball is about
to go into the basket,

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:41.135
we have a little over a tenth
of a second left in the game.

00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:44.420
Think about when the
dinosaurs went extinct.

00:06:45.574 --> 00:06:46.539
I will give you a hint here.

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.237
The dinosaurs went extinct.

00:06:48.237 --> 00:06:50.520
So we believe an asteroid hit the earth.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.235
So, this kind of a meteorite.

00:06:52.742 --> 00:06:55.611
This is a current theory,
meteorite hit the earth,

00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:59.986
mass extinction event
65.5 million years ago.

00:07:00.878 --> 00:07:04.321
So if we think of that 65.5
million years ago relative

00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:05.766
to the history of the earth

00:07:05.766 --> 00:07:08.792
and if the history of the earth were just
regulation play of a basketball game,

00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:10.813
when did that happen?

00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:13.794
Well, once again let's
get our calculator out.

00:07:13.794 --> 00:07:16.510
What fraction of the earth's
history ago was this?

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:23.563
65.5 million, I could write this
as 65.5 times 10 to the 6th,

00:07:23.563 --> 00:07:29.784
which is that and then I'll just
divide that by 4.54 billion years.

00:07:29.784 --> 00:07:33.886
So times 10 to the 9th and so this
is the fraction of earth's history

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:38.487
that has happened since the
extinction of the dinosaurs.

00:07:38.487 --> 00:07:41.898
So a little more, about a percent and
a half of earth's history has happened

00:07:41.898 --> 00:07:47.778
since the extinction of the
dinosaurs 65.5 million years ago

00:07:47.778 --> 00:07:49.445
and if we are talking
about a basketball game,

00:07:49.445 --> 00:07:52.868
let's just multiply that times the
number of seconds in a basketball game,

00:07:52.868 --> 00:07:57.711
2,880 and we get about 41 seconds.

00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:00.646
So with less than a minute
left in the 4th quarter

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:03.568
is when the meteorite hits the earth
