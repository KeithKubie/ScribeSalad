00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:08.870
Can Smoking tobacco and Drinking beer actually
be … good for you?

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.759
Hey Everyone, Crystal here for DNews.

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.889
I think your mother and your doctor would
both agree that smoking and drinking are not

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.240
healthy habits.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.160
Something about lung cancer and cirrhosis
of the liver, I dunno … but both tobacco

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.869
and hops have a healthy little secret.

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.289
They contain a high concentration of compounds
that may help protect your brain cells against

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.089
neurodegenerative disease.

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.759
Both Parkinson’s and Alzheimer's Disease
are major health concerns in the US.

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.180
These diseases are characterized by degeneration
of neurons in the brain.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.430
and no small neurodegeneration mind you, at
the point that Parkinson’s Disease is usually

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.430
diagnosed over 50% of the dopaminergic neurons
in the brain’s substantia nigra region are

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.430
already gone.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.219
Research is currently being done to understand
how we can best interfere with the progression

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.220
of these diseases, and many a pharmaceutical
company is hoping to develop drugs that don’t

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.520
just treat the symptoms but that can actually
protect our brains from cell death.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.179
Ironically, some of the most promising compounds
being discovered are found in some pretty

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.039
unhealthy places.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.830
Smoking continues to be a leading cause of
preventable death worldwide, but nicotine,

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.580
the addictive component found in tobacco smoke
may have neuroprotective properties!

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.979
And trials are being performed to investigate
the inverse correlation between smoking and

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.310
Parkinson’s Disease.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.310
Weird right?

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.490
If you’ve ever smoked a conventional cigarette,
you’ve lowered your risk for developing

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.490
Parkinson’s.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.420
A recent article published in the Journal
of Agricultural and Food Chemistry identified

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.479
another compound found in beer, Xanthohumol,
as being potentially neuroprotective.

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.909
When scientists challenged neuron-like cells
grown in a dish with destructive oxidizers

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.829
like peroxide, over 60% of the cells died.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:44.360
But when the cells were pre-treated with xanthohumol,
they showed 25% more viability than the cells

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.360
not pre-treated.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.729
The researchers were also able to demonstrate
that this was due to an increase in the cell’s

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.990
ability to defend itself against stress, and
not due to direct interactions between xanthohumol

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.880
and the oxidizing agent.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.909
Xanthohumol is emerging as something of a
cureall antioxidant and it has already attracted

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.430
attention due to its role in cardiovascular
protection, as well as its anticancer, antiviral,

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.670
anti obesity, and anti-inflammation properties.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.600
And right now, high (micromolar) concentrations
of the compound has only been found in beer.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.501
So hoppy beers and nicotine might be good
for your brain, but be careful to stay on

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:19.430
the lower end of exposure.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.280
Cancer, heart and liver disease are a poor
exchange for Parkinson’s and Alzheimer's.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.860
And because I know some of you are going to
ask: no, the two won’t cancel each other

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.860
out!

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.420
No amount of “anti-cancer” and “cardiovascular
protection” beer drinking will prevent the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.810
development of heart disease and lung cancer
if you smoke like a chimney.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.940
What do you think?

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.450
Is your lifestyle helping or hurting your
brain?
