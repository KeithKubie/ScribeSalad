00:00:05.518 --> 00:00:08.268
(pleasant music)

00:00:09.353 --> 00:00:12.649
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:15.149
Bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:21.890
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.307
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.178 --> 00:00:29.504
Aware that death is inevitable

00:00:29.504 --> 00:00:31.587
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:35.096
We grow up slowly.

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:37.457
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.457 --> 00:00:39.540
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.282
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.282 --> 00:00:45.032
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:50.137
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.137 --> 00:00:53.098
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.098 --> 00:00:54.765
and how we got here.

00:00:56.064 --> 00:00:57.769
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.852
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:35.257 --> 00:01:38.676
- So I'd like to tell you
a bit about the young man

00:01:38.676 --> 00:01:40.101
who I've worked with now for

00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:43.018
32 years I think, Derek Paravicini.

00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:48.847
Here's a picture of Derek
at 26 weeks when he was born

00:01:48.847 --> 00:01:53.825
weighing a little over 700
grams, about 1 1/2 pounds.

00:01:53.825 --> 00:01:58.184
So Derek could literally fit
on the palm of an adult's hand.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.782
And he had a fierce fight for survival.

00:02:00.782 --> 00:02:04.036
This was 38 years ago,
so you know the kind of

00:02:04.036 --> 00:02:07.260
therapeutic treatments
for very premature infants

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.178
were still quite primitive.

00:02:09.178 --> 00:02:11.293
For example, there's no way of measuring

00:02:11.293 --> 00:02:15.126
Derek's oxygen saturation
levels consistently.

00:02:15.973 --> 00:02:18.702
So to measure oxygen they
had to take a tiny drop

00:02:18.702 --> 00:02:20.754
of the blood from his finger,

00:02:20.754 --> 00:02:22.160
rush off to the machine to measure it

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.485
that took half an hour by which time

00:02:23.485 --> 00:02:27.319
of course the oxygen had fluctuated again.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.977
So little surprise really that Derek

00:02:28.977 --> 00:02:32.745
developed retinopathy of prematurity,

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:33.908
which is when the blood vessels

00:02:33.908 --> 00:02:37.119
at the back of the eye
force the retina forward.

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.855
And his early development
was also very delayed.

00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:44.919
He was later diagnosed with
severe learning difficulties

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:48.759
with the verbal IQ of about 57 and autism.

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.824
As a child his speech
was largely echolalic

00:02:51.824 --> 00:02:55.924
so he rather than sort of speak
with semantic understanding

00:02:55.924 --> 00:03:00.349
he tended to repeat back
whatever was said to him.

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.190
But the very good news
was he was brought up

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.690
by a traditional British nanny

00:03:06.804 --> 00:03:08.856
and she was determined that
Derek was going to make

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:11.808
the best of his life,
whatever that was going to be

00:03:11.808 --> 00:03:13.896
and she went up into the attic one day

00:03:13.896 --> 00:03:17.578
despairing of finding
something to entertain Derek

00:03:17.578 --> 00:03:21.905
and she found this old
toy really, toy keyboard

00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:24.947
which she plugged in and gave to him.

00:03:24.947 --> 00:03:26.611
And not thinking anything of it,

00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:29.253
in fact Derek just seemed
to bash this thing for ages

00:03:29.253 --> 00:03:31.210
and then suddenly they realized that

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.306
in fact he wasn't bashing randomly.

00:03:33.306 --> 00:03:37.342
He'd actually taught himself
to play chords and then tunes

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:41.491
just through a process of self discovery.

00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:44.407
I met up with Derek when
he was four years old,

00:03:44.407 --> 00:03:48.265
and he'd already built up a
large repertoire of pieces.

00:03:48.265 --> 00:03:52.441
Now he'd had no tuition, of
course he had no visual model

00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:55.072
to guide him 'cause
Derek was totally blind.

00:03:55.072 --> 00:03:58.128
He had very small hands,
he was only four years old

00:03:58.128 --> 00:04:02.577
and as a consequence he got
a very eccentric technique,

00:04:02.577 --> 00:04:04.165
as you can see from the pictures.

00:04:04.165 --> 00:04:07.085
So there was lots of karate chops

00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:09.484
and fists and knuckles and
even the occasional nose

00:04:09.484 --> 00:04:13.234
went down to pick out
notes he couldn't hear.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.398
By great good fortune that same nanny

00:04:16.398 --> 00:04:19.758
who was responsible for Derek's upbringing

00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:23.405
pressed the button on a
tape recorder just briefly

00:04:23.405 --> 00:04:26.169
and so we've got a little
fragment of what it was like

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.718
to hear Derek's playing
when he was four years old.

00:04:29.718 --> 00:04:32.901
Here's a little bit,
see if you recognize it.

00:04:32.901 --> 00:04:36.068
(playing "Ave Maria")

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:08.528
Any offers?
- Ave Maria.

00:05:08.528 --> 00:05:11.861
- Yes so good on Derek, it is a miracle.

00:05:12.707 --> 00:05:15.452
Here's a boy who understood
virtually nothing

00:05:15.452 --> 00:05:17.470
about the world around him.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.106
Really no useful language,

00:05:19.106 --> 00:05:23.106
and yet without any
encouragement to start with,

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:26.569
he taught himself to play the piano.

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.509
One of the great human accomplishments.

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:30.916
I think the important thing about that

00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:35.639
early recording though it
shows such a lot about the way

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.095
that Derek's musical mind was working.

00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:41.043
For a start he wasn't
just copying what he heard

00:05:41.043 --> 00:05:44.825
because the recording he
heard was a voice and pianist,

00:05:44.825 --> 00:05:47.492
so he had to rearrange that duet

00:05:48.994 --> 00:05:52.454
for a single instrument of course.

00:05:52.454 --> 00:05:53.776
Also because he had such small hands

00:05:53.776 --> 00:05:56.579
he had to change the spacing of the chords

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:58.630
in order to be able to play them,

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.783
and so the result really to me provides

00:06:00.783 --> 00:06:03.950
evidence of genuine musical intelligence

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.834
and indeed the beginnings of creativity.

00:06:05.834 --> 00:06:09.629
We've heard that savants
are more than just mimics

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:11.975
and I think Derek even
in that very early stage

00:06:11.975 --> 00:06:15.975
shows a genuinely creative
musical mind at work.

00:06:18.537 --> 00:06:21.139
Just to show you a bit about Derek today,

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:22.911
he's now age 38.

00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:25.655
I think he's been to
California about six times now,

00:06:25.655 --> 00:06:28.498
so he's very cross he's not
here today I can tell you

00:06:28.498 --> 00:06:32.823
because although he doesn't
enjoy 12 hours on a plane,

00:06:32.823 --> 00:06:36.660
he does enjoy making music when he lands.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.863
But he now has his own jazz quartet

00:06:39.863 --> 00:06:42.088
and I think music for him is so much more

00:06:42.088 --> 00:06:44.774
than just a technical exercise.

00:06:44.774 --> 00:06:48.941
It's genuinely a social and
emotionally fulfilling activity.

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:53.870
It's incredibly important for
his identity and self-esteem.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.173
If you ask Derek what he
does he says I'm a pianist.

00:06:57.173 --> 00:06:59.445
It's important for friendship,

00:06:59.445 --> 00:07:03.317
for shared feelings, and even for humor.

00:07:03.317 --> 00:07:05.744
So here's Derek playing today.

00:07:05.744 --> 00:07:08.294
If I asked you to guess
the piece initially,

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:11.035
you might be wrong so there's a warning.

00:07:11.035 --> 00:07:13.086
This is Derek being witty.

00:07:13.086 --> 00:07:16.419
(classical piano music)

00:07:32.722 --> 00:07:36.722
♫ Night and day you are the one

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:49.031
♫ Only you beneath the
moon and under the sun

00:07:55.542 --> 00:07:56.623
- Now from later on the track.

00:07:56.623 --> 00:07:58.224
♫ Night and day

00:07:58.224 --> 00:08:01.141
(jazz piano music)

00:08:09.926 --> 00:08:12.037
- So you can see how Derek's evolved,

00:08:12.037 --> 00:08:15.204
hopefully in the intervening 32 years.

00:08:16.192 --> 00:08:19.732
So what kickstarted
Derek's musical learning

00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:22.850
and how is it he can do what he does?

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.712
And indeed with Leslie Lemke as well.

00:08:25.712 --> 00:08:28.720
And it's the same unusual
skills all musical savants

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.844
and indeed all musical prodigies rely on

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:34.926
which is universal absolute pitch.

00:08:34.926 --> 00:08:38.315
Now absolute pitch is
the ability to reproduce

00:08:38.315 --> 00:08:41.014
and to recognize pitches
not only in music,

00:08:41.014 --> 00:08:44.150
but in any, any environmental sound.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.519
And it starts very early.

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:48.602
It's generally in place by 24 months.

00:08:49.615 --> 00:08:53.379
It's interesting seeing
that young Indian drummer.

00:08:53.379 --> 00:08:56.537
I've certainly seen young
blind children age 12 once

00:08:56.537 --> 00:08:57.550
start to play the piano.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.117
By 18 months absolute pitch is in place

00:09:00.117 --> 00:09:02.865
and they're playing
pieces in the right key.

00:09:02.865 --> 00:09:04.401
So if these abilities are going to start,

00:09:04.401 --> 00:09:07.644
they're going to start very early.

00:09:07.644 --> 00:09:09.134
So absolute pitch is very rare

00:09:09.134 --> 00:09:11.700
in western populations as a whole.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.750
About .01%.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.978
Doing a kind of meta analysis
of all the literature

00:09:15.978 --> 00:09:18.174
I can find plus all the blind
children I've worked with

00:09:18.174 --> 00:09:20.081
which is hundreds over the years,

00:09:20.081 --> 00:09:23.443
something like 45% of
those who are born blind

00:09:23.443 --> 00:09:25.732
or who lose their sight early on,

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.832
they're ones who develop absolute pitch.

00:09:27.832 --> 00:09:30.690
Among partially sighted
children it's around 11%,

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.654
and around those on the
autism spectrum around 8%

00:09:33.654 --> 00:09:35.528
so you can see there's
something massively different

00:09:35.528 --> 00:09:39.556
going on with a fair
proportion of these children.

00:09:39.556 --> 00:09:40.622
It's interesting is about whether it's

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:43.939
genetic or environmental
is something one can debate

00:09:43.939 --> 00:09:47.353
because there's nothing genetic
about Derek's musicality.

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:49.175
I think it's the fact he was born blind

00:09:49.175 --> 00:09:51.168
that made the structural differences

00:09:51.168 --> 00:09:52.982
the way his brain developed.

00:09:52.982 --> 00:09:54.753
In fact actually I
think it's largely to do

00:09:54.753 --> 00:09:58.864
with his exceptional early
cognitive environments

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:02.816
that blindness or visual
impairment and autism create.

00:10:02.816 --> 00:10:05.153
Presumably there must be
a genetic component too

00:10:05.153 --> 00:10:08.235
because not all blind children develop AP.

00:10:08.235 --> 00:10:10.252
What it is, it's a focus on absolute

00:10:10.252 --> 00:10:13.650
perceptual qualities of
things for their own sake

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.529
that seems to make the difference.

00:10:15.529 --> 00:10:19.236
So I'll play you, one
wonderful thing about Derek is

00:10:19.236 --> 00:10:21.115
he loves psychological experiments.

00:10:21.115 --> 00:10:24.678
He never gets bored, and I do there's

00:10:24.678 --> 00:10:27.194
one particular experiment I'm
going to play you a bit of it

00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:29.990
where I play him 120 different chords

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.788
which would drive anyone crazy,

00:10:31.788 --> 00:10:33.551
and ask him to play them back.

00:10:33.551 --> 00:10:37.365
Most people freak out after
about 20 of these things,

00:10:37.365 --> 00:10:41.532
and after the end of a hard
day's of taking data from Derek

00:10:43.038 --> 00:10:44.809
he'd say can we do the
chords again tomorrow?

00:10:44.809 --> 00:10:46.892
I said wha, Derek, right.

00:10:49.368 --> 00:10:52.618
So here's a sample of those 120 chords.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.954
If there's someone with
absolute pitch in the audience,

00:10:55.954 --> 00:10:57.672
you might be able to pick out the notes

00:10:57.672 --> 00:11:00.692
but this is the only information Derek got

00:11:00.692 --> 00:11:03.780
and I guess most people
wouldn't be able to tell you

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.543
how many notes are in each chord,

00:11:05.543 --> 00:11:08.028
let alone what notes are being played.

00:11:08.028 --> 00:11:09.941
Here's a sample of them.

00:11:09.941 --> 00:11:12.691
(chords playing)

00:11:26.148 --> 00:11:29.190
You know how many notes
were in the last one?

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.333
I wouldn't have a clue,
there were nine in fact.

00:11:32.333 --> 00:11:33.780
(chords playing)
Here's the chords

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.197
and here's Derek's responses.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.667
This is me, this is Derek.

00:11:42.456 --> 00:11:44.206
This is me and Derek.

00:11:45.497 --> 00:11:46.603
We're on the second line.

00:11:46.603 --> 00:11:49.353
(chords playing)

00:12:01.558 --> 00:12:03.395
In fact what Derek does
is you might pick up,

00:12:03.395 --> 00:12:05.779
he actually adds notes in typically.

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:08.042
He very rarely misses them out.

00:12:08.042 --> 00:12:11.875
So here are Derek's stats
from the 120 chords.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:17.100
There's four, five, six,
seven, eight, and nine notes.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.101
You can see he got all the

00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:20.171
four note chords absolutely right.

00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:22.770
He got about 96% of the five notes

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:26.464
and so on down to about
93% of the nine notes.

00:12:26.464 --> 00:12:29.698
In fact, it was interesting
seeing the bit from 60 Minutes

00:12:29.698 --> 00:12:34.028
'cause Lesley Stahl interviewed
Derek at some length

00:12:34.028 --> 00:12:35.785
and got him to play 10 note chords

00:12:35.785 --> 00:12:37.903
and he was still about 92%

00:12:37.903 --> 00:12:42.145
which is amazing when you think
the sheer mental programming

00:12:42.145 --> 00:12:44.467
to get 10 fingers over the right notes

00:12:44.467 --> 00:12:46.636
at the right time is extraordinary.

00:12:46.636 --> 00:12:49.093
Oh it's again interestingly
it's not this sort of

00:12:49.093 --> 00:12:51.770
myth of savants as kind
of superhuman beings

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.545
that just don't conform to the rules

00:12:54.545 --> 00:12:56.166
that the rest of us play by.

00:12:56.166 --> 00:12:58.659
For example Derek did much
better with tonal chords

00:12:58.659 --> 00:13:00.524
than what you might call non-tonal.

00:13:00.524 --> 00:13:02.832
In other words, standard western tonality

00:13:02.832 --> 00:13:04.158
Derek was better at.

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:05.524
He was also more successful

00:13:05.524 --> 00:13:08.257
from the bottom of the chords up,

00:13:08.257 --> 00:13:12.015
so in other words he was
listening more structurally.

00:13:12.015 --> 00:13:14.851
Most of us only listen, we
tend to hear the melody line.

00:13:14.851 --> 00:13:17.802
Skillful musicians tend to
hear from the baseline up

00:13:17.802 --> 00:13:19.830
because that's telling them the structure.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.118
So in other words Derek was listening

00:13:21.118 --> 00:13:22.619
with musical intelligence.

00:13:22.619 --> 00:13:24.982
He wasn't just a perceptual machine

00:13:24.982 --> 00:13:27.784
that could copy, and in fact if we look

00:13:27.784 --> 00:13:31.205
at how Derek did compared to other savants

00:13:31.205 --> 00:13:33.863
and with expert what you might call

00:13:33.863 --> 00:13:36.550
neurotypical musicians
with absolute pitch,

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.697
you can see in fact there is

00:13:37.697 --> 00:13:40.125
a fairly continuous distribution.

00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:43.895
Derek's at the top, the
top blue line with S.

00:13:43.895 --> 00:13:46.103
Yellow savants are in solid lines

00:13:46.103 --> 00:13:48.737
and then the neurotypical
musicians with absolute pitch

00:13:48.737 --> 00:13:50.663
are on the dotted lines and I'm quite sure

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.348
if I found enough subjects there'd be

00:13:52.348 --> 00:13:54.930
quite a continuous distribution.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.639
So in other words the savants
are using the same strategies

00:13:57.639 --> 00:14:00.472
as the skillful trained musicians.

00:14:02.205 --> 00:14:04.824
So as I said, it suggests
that these people

00:14:04.824 --> 00:14:08.844
exist on a continuum and
that both use the same

00:14:08.844 --> 00:14:12.542
structurally based listening strategies.

00:14:12.542 --> 00:14:13.760
Right, another study now.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.330
A long term memory is a feature

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.348
of all musical savants as Darryl said.

00:14:18.348 --> 00:14:19.621
And sometimes this is said to be

00:14:19.621 --> 00:14:22.500
eidetic or photographic memory.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.714
This is absolutely, this is in fact true.

00:14:25.714 --> 00:14:28.162
Right, here's another mean
test that people think

00:14:28.162 --> 00:14:29.713
you must be mad doing this.

00:14:29.713 --> 00:14:31.405
So I composed a special new

00:14:31.405 --> 00:14:34.781
piece of music for Derek to learn.

00:14:34.781 --> 00:14:36.956
You'd have to compose something
'cause if he's heard it

00:14:36.956 --> 00:14:40.243
then he's probably already remembered it.

00:14:40.243 --> 00:14:44.195
And all he did was to
hear it and play it back.

00:14:44.195 --> 00:14:46.062
So imagine that you're
sitting down at the piano,

00:14:46.062 --> 00:14:48.251
you haven't got the music in front of you,

00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:49.751
and you hear this.

00:14:51.659 --> 00:14:54.742
(jaunty piano music)

00:15:41.077 --> 00:15:43.327
(applause)

00:15:45.783 --> 00:15:48.470
So how much do you reckon
you'd be able to play?

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.900
Well, I'll show you what
Derek did in a minute.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.727
Just to say this was
quite a long term study.

00:15:52.727 --> 00:15:56.155
Over four years we did 26 sessions

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:58.176
with increasingly long breaks between.

00:15:58.176 --> 00:16:01.777
Two days in the first case
and two years in the last one.

00:16:01.777 --> 00:16:05.467
And each session after the
first Derek tried to play

00:16:05.467 --> 00:16:07.596
whatever he'd remember.

00:16:07.596 --> 00:16:10.145
He then listened to Chromatic Blues again,

00:16:10.145 --> 00:16:11.837
attempt to play once more and then

00:16:11.837 --> 00:16:14.838
listened once more to Chromatic Blues.

00:16:14.838 --> 00:16:16.364
So his very first attempt, he just heard

00:16:16.364 --> 00:16:18.295
exactly what you've heard

00:16:18.295 --> 00:16:21.162
and in fact he got about 30% of it right.

00:16:21.162 --> 00:16:22.893
Here was his.

00:16:22.893 --> 00:16:25.976
(jaunty piano music)

00:17:00.654 --> 00:17:01.904
Not bad, Derek.

00:17:03.849 --> 00:17:05.697
Of course this shows
one of the real dangers

00:17:05.697 --> 00:17:08.756
I think of a lot of savant studies

00:17:08.756 --> 00:17:12.725
is that unless you do a
pretty systematic analysis

00:17:12.725 --> 00:17:13.922
it's terribly hard to know.

00:17:13.922 --> 00:17:17.713
In other words, if I just
played that piece in a concert.

00:17:17.713 --> 00:17:18.982
This so often happens.

00:17:18.982 --> 00:17:21.858
People play Derek something
in a live situation.

00:17:21.858 --> 00:17:24.006
He then plays it back, and
of course no one even knows

00:17:24.006 --> 00:17:25.814
if he's got it exactly right or not

00:17:25.814 --> 00:17:27.648
because we haven't got Derek's ear.

00:17:27.648 --> 00:17:29.527
So I think a lot of
savant myths are built on

00:17:29.527 --> 00:17:32.860
slightly dubious anecdotes shall we say?

00:17:34.216 --> 00:17:36.200
So what did Derek do,
what was going on there?

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.684
Well, it was evidently beyond

00:17:37.684 --> 00:17:39.900
the capacity of his working memory,

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.765
but he couldn't help but produce

00:17:41.765 --> 00:17:44.463
something that made musical sense.

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:47.319
In other words, he's using
music like a natural language

00:17:47.319 --> 00:17:49.844
in the same way if we record a story,

00:17:49.844 --> 00:17:51.425
we don't get every note right

00:17:51.425 --> 00:17:53.146
but we get the overall structure right

00:17:53.146 --> 00:17:54.816
and we get the meaning right,

00:17:54.816 --> 00:17:55.815
and that's what Derek did.

00:17:55.815 --> 00:17:56.845
He got the feel of the music right,

00:17:56.845 --> 00:17:58.168
he got the overall structure right

00:17:58.168 --> 00:18:00.278
and he got some of the detail right,

00:18:00.278 --> 00:18:02.119
but it wasn't completely right.

00:18:02.119 --> 00:18:05.269
So yet again we see creativity coming in.

00:18:05.269 --> 00:18:07.126
Derek had to be musically creative

00:18:07.126 --> 00:18:09.564
in order to make ends meet.

00:18:09.564 --> 00:18:10.397
So what did he do?

00:18:10.397 --> 00:18:14.538
Well he used the musical
fragments in a different order.

00:18:14.538 --> 00:18:16.595
In order to make them fit
he had to transform them

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:19.330
in real time and he
introduced stock phrases

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.687
from sort of the rhythm and blues style

00:18:21.687 --> 00:18:24.846
from Count Basie, from the
blues turnaround and so on.

00:18:24.846 --> 00:18:27.592
So in other words Derek's
functioning exactly like

00:18:27.592 --> 00:18:32.152
a skilled jazz musician is
functioning in that context.

00:18:32.152 --> 00:18:33.345
So in fact it's anything but this

00:18:33.345 --> 00:18:35.700
kind of photographic memory.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.392
It's a characteristic
of neurotypical recall.

00:18:39.392 --> 00:18:42.462
In fact here's a comparison
with Sacha who is an expert

00:18:42.462 --> 00:18:46.209
neurotypical jazz pianist
with absolute pitch

00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:48.084
whom we gave the same test to.

00:18:48.084 --> 00:18:50.957
And you can see Derek outperforms him

00:18:50.957 --> 00:18:54.164
after the initial burst, but
essentially Sacha's doing

00:18:54.164 --> 00:18:56.867
you know not badly at all.

00:18:56.867 --> 00:18:59.604
Much better than most of us could do.

00:18:59.604 --> 00:19:01.112
And analysis shows he was using

00:19:01.112 --> 00:19:04.482
very similar strategies to Derek.

00:19:04.482 --> 00:19:07.027
You can see that Sacha
gave up before Derek.

00:19:07.027 --> 00:19:10.690
Derek carried on for another two years.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.088
In fact occasionally now he'll
say can I do Chromatic Blues?

00:19:13.088 --> 00:19:16.099
And I'll say no, don't, no.

00:19:16.099 --> 00:19:17.939
Right, last of all.

00:19:17.939 --> 00:19:20.732
Very often I get asked, Derek gets asked,

00:19:20.732 --> 00:19:22.377
what about modern music?

00:19:22.377 --> 00:19:25.351
This problem of atonal music
as it's sometimes called.

00:19:25.351 --> 00:19:28.993
Now atonal music was
introduced by Schoenberg

00:19:28.993 --> 00:19:30.319
amongst others in the beginning

00:19:30.319 --> 00:19:34.375
of the first half of the
20th Century I suppose.

00:19:34.375 --> 00:19:37.142
And it consciously avoids
traditional musical

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:39.743
grammar, syntax, and rules.

00:19:39.743 --> 00:19:44.028
And most listeners report
finding atonal music discordant.

00:19:44.028 --> 00:19:46.195
In other words it sounds
like there are mistakes in it

00:19:46.195 --> 00:19:48.014
and it's very difficult to remember.

00:19:48.014 --> 00:19:49.731
Schoenberg said all he
wanted was for people

00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:53.898
to whistle his tunes in the
street but never got it.

00:19:55.152 --> 00:19:56.952
In fact Tchaikovsky
annoyed him particularly

00:19:56.952 --> 00:19:58.770
because people would
whistle Tchaikovsky's tunes.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.632
(audience laughs)

00:20:00.632 --> 00:20:01.789
So how did Derek get on?

00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:03.570
Well I gave him a bit of Schoenberg's

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:07.570
first atonal masterpieces
called to try to play.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.636
So again if you close your eyes

00:20:10.636 --> 00:20:13.655
and just pretend to be
Derek, this is what he heard.

00:20:13.655 --> 00:20:16.738
(atonal piano music)

00:20:38.695 --> 00:20:40.085
How did he get on?

00:20:40.085 --> 00:20:42.432
How do you think he did?

00:20:42.432 --> 00:20:45.242
Well here's a young man who can hit

00:20:45.242 --> 00:20:48.575
nine note chords with 93% accuracy.

00:20:49.619 --> 00:20:51.341
Absolutely, he couldn't do it.

00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:52.540
He completely couldn't do it.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.049
Here's the original first phrase.

00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:57.132
(atonal piano music)

00:21:03.642 --> 00:21:04.725
Here's Derek.

00:21:05.756 --> 00:21:09.673
(different atonal piano music)

00:21:15.701 --> 00:21:18.497
So you can see, even his absolute pitch,

00:21:18.497 --> 00:21:20.964
his flawless absolute pitch was confused

00:21:20.964 --> 00:21:24.342
when there's a lack of
background syntax and rules.

00:21:24.342 --> 00:21:25.530
Which I found quite extraordinary.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:26.989
In fact I had to check the equipment.

00:21:26.989 --> 00:21:29.018
I thought Derek you got
the first note wrong.

00:21:29.018 --> 00:21:31.356
I've never heard him
make a mistake like that.

00:21:31.356 --> 00:21:35.099
So in other words, the atonal,
the music without rules

00:21:35.099 --> 00:21:37.849
even confused Derek's perception.

00:21:38.873 --> 00:21:41.468
Time to play you a little bit
of what happened a week later.

00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:43.698
I asked him to play it a week later

00:21:43.698 --> 00:21:45.891
and the result he'd stepped
back from Schoenberg

00:21:45.891 --> 00:21:47.786
into the world of Wagner,
it was extraordinary.

00:21:47.786 --> 00:21:49.447
Here's a little bit of it.

00:21:49.447 --> 00:21:51.947
(piano music)

00:22:07.068 --> 00:22:10.062
So in other words Derek had
corrected the wrong notes.

00:22:10.062 --> 00:22:12.563
(audience laughs)

00:22:12.563 --> 00:22:16.284
So in conclusion Derek and other savants.

00:22:16.284 --> 00:22:17.808
I've worked, great pleasure have

00:22:17.808 --> 00:22:20.537
worked with about six prodigious savants.

00:22:20.537 --> 00:22:21.944
Have an unusual degree of expertise

00:22:21.944 --> 00:22:24.312
but his engagement appears to be

00:22:24.312 --> 00:22:25.918
qualitatively similar to

00:22:25.918 --> 00:22:28.376
neurotypical musicians
with absolute pitch.

00:22:28.376 --> 00:22:30.218
In other words it seems
to be a matter of degree

00:22:30.218 --> 00:22:32.928
rather than a fundamental difference.

00:22:32.928 --> 00:22:34.177
And I'd like to think that perhaps

00:22:34.177 --> 00:22:38.094
we're gaining more insights
about neurotypicality

00:22:38.094 --> 00:22:41.739
by looking as it were
the opposite way right?

00:22:41.739 --> 00:22:44.249
We tend to view savants from
the view of neurotypical

00:22:44.249 --> 00:22:47.584
of sort of mean based psychological tests

00:22:47.584 --> 00:22:50.364
whereas in fact if we look
at the world of savants

00:22:50.364 --> 00:22:54.066
and see what lights can
they show on all of us

00:22:54.066 --> 00:22:56.562
we might be in a stronger
position in some ways.

00:22:56.562 --> 00:22:58.796
And ultimately I think we're all part

00:22:58.796 --> 00:23:03.558
of the same continuum of human
neurodiversity, thank you.

00:23:03.558 --> 00:23:05.808
(applause)

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:09.560
(pleasant music)
