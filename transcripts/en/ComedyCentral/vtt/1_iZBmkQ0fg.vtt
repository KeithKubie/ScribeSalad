<i> - Robert was on board,
 so later that week,</i>

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:05.138
<i> I hired a professional tailor</i>

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:07.206
<i> to help design the chili suit</i>

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:09.776
<i> based on a detailed sketch
 I had drawn.</i>

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.946 align:end position:100%
- The easiest way is probably
to put the chili in--

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.049 align:end position:100%
I guess from
the neck part, right?

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.817 align:start position:0%
- Sure.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.886
<i> Our plan was to have
 the chili reservoirs</i>

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.955
<i> mimic the distribution of fat
 on a larger man's body</i>

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:25.458
<i> so it wouldn't look suspicious
 under clothing,</i>

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:27.493
<i> and with the help of a guy
 from Craigslist,</i>

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:30.897
<i> our tailor was able to take
 all the measurements he needed.</i>

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.166
- The chili is gonna go here.
- Mm-hmm.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.968 align:end position:100%
- And we can get more
in here too.

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.603
- You could probably do,
like, a cup there, right?

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:39.105
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Cup or so?

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:41.040
- Yeah, a cup, yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:42.175 align:start position:0%
- All right,
so we'll see you around, then.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.043 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Yeah. Thank you so much.

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:45.445
<i> And a few days later,
 we received</i>

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:47.246
<i> a completed prototype</i>

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:49.749
<i> of a heat-resistant
 polyvinyl fluoride suit</i>

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:52.285
<i> designed to hold
 over 100 servings</i>

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.153
<i> of fresh chili.</i>

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:56.055
<i> The individual reservoirs
 would be linked</i>

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:58.224
<i> by a network of tubes
 that would all lead</i>

00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:00.493
<i> to a battery-powered
 peristaltic pump</i>

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:02.395
<i> for dispensing the chili.</i>

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:04.363
<i> Using our intake funnel,</i>

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:07.800
<i> we loaded in over 30 pounds
 of Robert's product</i>

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.702
<i> that had been blended
 into a thin paste</i>

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:14.740
<i> to ensure an even flow
 without compromising the flavo.</i>

00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:16.576
<i> So with that,
 I activated the pump,</i>

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.245
<i> and it was time to see
 if this could work.</i>

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:21.981
[motor whirring]

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:24.484
<i> As I had hoped,</i>

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:25.551
<i> the pump dispensed the chili</i>

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:26.719
<i> at a steady pace,</i>

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:27.920
<i> which was good,</i>

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:29.422
<i> but I realized we had overlookd</i>

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:31.757
<i> a crucial detail.</i>

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.860
<i> The chili suit prevented
 bathroom access,</i>

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:35.094
<i> and because of its weight,</i>

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:36.529
<i> removing it during a game</i>

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.097
<i> would not be an option.</i>

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.899
<i> So I experimented with a design</i>

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:42.068
<i> that would allow me
 to deposit my excretions</i>

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.604
<i> directly into
 custom rubber underwear</i>

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:46.906
<i> connected to
 a secondary pumping system</i>

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.908
<i> so I could eject it
 into a toilet</i>

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:51.544
<i> via a second tube
 down my right arm.</i>

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:53.713
<i> But once I had some clothing o,</i>

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.982
<i> I realized the potential
 for a costly mix-up</i>

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:57.617
<i> was too great.</i>

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.385
<i> So I had the bottom part
 of the suit</i>

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:01.320
<i> redesigned with strategic holes</i>

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:03.055
<i> in the groin and buttocks regin</i>

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:04.724
<i> that would allow the wearer</i>

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.459
<i> to relieve him or herself</i>

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:09.195
<i> without taking off the suit.</i>

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:11.831
<i> But there was still the issue
 of the temperature.</i>

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:13.666
<i> To meet
 health department standards,</i>

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.635
<i> Robert said the chili
 would have to remain</i>

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:20.139
<i> above 135 degrees Fahrenheit
 at all times.</i>

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:22.842
<i> But when I put it on,
 the heat was so intense</i>

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:24.844
<i> that I could barely have it
 against my skin</i>

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:26.846
<i> for more than a few seconds.</i>

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.682
<i> So I tracked down
 some heat-resistant polymer gel</i>

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:31.350
<i> that could insulate the body</i>

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:33.352
<i> against
 the most extreme temperatures.</i>

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:34.420 align:start position:0%
- Feel anything?

00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:35.688
- No.
- Good.

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:37.490
<i> - I did a preliminary test</i>

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:40.026
<i> with a blowtorch
 on various parts of my body</i>

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:43.429
<i> to ensure the gel would protect
 even my most sensitive regions.</i>

00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:45.998
[groaning]

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:48.334
<i> And after getting gelled up
 from head to toe,</i>

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:50.836
<i> the burning sensation
 had completely vanished.</i>

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:52.672
Yeah.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.874
<i> It seemed like we had solved
 every problem,</i>

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:58.511
<i> but there was still one final
 thing I had to take care of.</i>

00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:01.314
<i> The pump on my chest that made
 the chili suit function</i>

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.748
<i> was made out of metal,</i>

00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:05.284
<i> and to get into Rabobank Arena,</i>

00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:08.120
<i> every ticket holder has to pass
 through a metal detector.</i>

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:10.323
<i> So I figured
 if I could convince security</i>

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:13.759
<i> that I had
 a medically necessary pacemake,</i>

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:16.128
<i> they wouldn't be suspicious
 when the alarm went off.</i>

00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:18.764
<i> So I taped a real pacemaker
 to my chest</i>

00:03:18.797 --> 00:03:20.399
<i> and then headed
 to a walk-in clinic</i>

00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:22.168
<i> to request an X-ray</i>

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:24.103
<i> that would hopefully trick
 the physician</i>

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:25.771
<i> into writing me a doctor's not.</i>

00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:28.140
- I would need to
actually examine you

00:03:28.173 --> 00:03:31.544
and see why is it
that you need the X-ray.

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:33.746
I have to have a reason why.

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:35.982
- Well, I'm paying you for it,

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:37.717
so what do you care?

00:03:39.184 --> 00:03:43.990
- I'm actually--
legally, it's being...

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:47.159
monitored to see why
we're ordering an X-ray.

00:03:47.192 --> 00:03:48.661
- Oh.

00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:49.996
Well, what's the minimum
I need to say

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.064
to get one?

00:03:53.832 --> 00:03:57.103
- Either some area hurts
of your chest or--

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:58.638
- Sure.
- You're having a cough.

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.539
- Okay. Yeah.

00:04:00.572 --> 00:04:02.842
- Are you--
what are you experiencing?

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:05.645
- Yeah, both those. Yeah.

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:06.912
- Mm-kay.

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:08.714
- Just step as close as you can,

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:10.617 align:start size:66% position:34% line:0%
and you're gonna take
this shirt off, okay?

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:17.390 line:0%
- Your undershirt will be fine,

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:18.457 align:end position:100% line:0%
but I gotta get rid
of the buttons, okay?

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.659 align:start position:0%
- Okay. Okay, sure.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:21.661 align:start size:63% position:38%
- Take a big breath.

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:23.262 align:start size:25% position:75%
Hold it.

00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:24.563
<i> - And once the doctor saw</i>

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:26.265
<i> the pacemaker on my X-ray...</i>

00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:27.466
- It looks like
it's in well position

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:30.603
and no abnormalities.

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:32.238
<i> - She wrote me a doctor's note
 that would hopefully</i>

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:33.773
<i> get me through security.</i>

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:35.775 align:start size:81% position:19%
Thank you so much, Doctor.

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:38.277
<i> And that meant it was
 finally time to buy a ticket</i>

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.947
<i> to the next
 Bakersfield Condors home game.</i>
