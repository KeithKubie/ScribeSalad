00:00:00.568 --> 00:00:02.323
Now, let's think about expressions

00:00:02.323 --> 00:00:04.079
with more than one variable.

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:06.009
So, let's say I had the expression

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.325
"a + b"

00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:11.222
and I were to ask you

00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:13.042
what is this expression equal to

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:16.000
when "a" is equal to 5

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.574
and "b" is equal to 7

00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:23.789
Well, in this situation, this expression would be...

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.635
instead of an "a" we would have a 5

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.004
it would be 5 plus...

00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.821
instead of a "b", we would have a 7.

00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:36.169
So it would be 5 + 7 is equal to 12.

00:00:36.214 --> 00:00:38.111
Now let's try another expression.

00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:39.751
Let's say we had the expression

00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:54.102
"10x - 3y"

00:00:54.102 --> 00:00:55.401
And, let's think about

00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:57.594
what would this expression evaluate to

00:00:57.641 --> 00:01:01.187
when "x" is equal to - 1

00:01:01.187 --> 00:01:06.244
and when "y" is equal to 5.

00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:07.849
Well, let's just evaluate it.

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:09.998
We have 10 times...

00:01:09.998 --> 00:01:10.825
instead of an "x",

00:01:10.825 --> 00:01:13.471
we know now that "x" is equal to -1,

00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:21.877
it would be 10 (-1) - 3 (5).

00:01:21.877 --> 00:01:23.338
So three times...

00:01:23.338 --> 00:01:25.630
instead of a "y", we will put a 5 there.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.268
- 3 (5).

00:01:28.268 --> 00:01:32.503
And so 10 (-1), that is -10

00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:35.727
and we're going to subtract from that 3 (5).

00:01:35.727 --> 00:01:37.010
You want to do the multiplication first

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.091
by order of operations

00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:38.910
that's the convention.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.149
3 times 5 is 15.

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.656
So, it is -10 - 15,

00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:52.256
which is equal to -25.

00:01:52.256 --> 00:01:54.807
And now, you have the next exercise

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:57.992
to practice some of these a little bit more.
