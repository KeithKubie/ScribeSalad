Hello, welcome to The
Other Show, I'm Chris.

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.143 line:0%
- I'm Sarah.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.644 line:0%
- And we're the creators
of The Other Two

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:14.180 line:0%
and we're here talking
about episode five

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:15.681 line:0%
with Ken, Helene, and Drew.

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:18.651
- Well, and this episode
was directed by--

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:21.120
- Oh, Mike Karnell, my husband.

00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:22.655
- Wow, her husband, wow.

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:23.790
- [Ken] Yes.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:25.625
- At the time he
was your fiancÃ©.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:26.793
- [Sarah] That's true.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.861
- Yeah, we shot this episode
days before your wedding.

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:31.697
- Shot this episode,
left on the next day

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.699
to go down to where
we got married.

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:34.834
Got married that
following Sunday.

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.436
- Consummated the marriage.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.171
- That following
Saturday, consummated it.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.206
And then we went on a scout
on Thursday the next week.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.775
- It's so pretty out here.

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:46.145
Makes me want to go
to a football game.

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:49.849
- Makes you want to sit and
watch a full football game?

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.651
- No, no, I guess
it just makes me

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.453
want to watch
Friday Night Lights.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.521
- I feel like a lot of
the show is you trying

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:57.824
to measure yourself
against your little brother

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.859
or other people or am
I doing well enough

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:02.795
or am I doing well
enough fast enough?

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:03.830
- Isn't that the question we all

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:05.565
ask ourselves all the time?

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.733
- Yeah, hopefully going
back to the high school

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.403
helped bring that
to a boil, sort of,

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:12.371
I guess especially for
your character, for Cary.

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:13.773
And even for Brooke
since she didn't get to

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:15.208
go to high school really,

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.476
she didn't have a
typical upbringing.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.511
- But I went to dance
school and did drugs.

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:20.580
- But in the writer's
room, we would say like,

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.249
okay and this scene will be on
the football field at night.

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:24.417
And the writer's
room would be like

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.685
"For why, what happens there?"

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.120
And we'd be like, we
don't know but there's

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:28.354
a big wide shot of
a football field.

00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:29.822
(laughter)

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:31.457
- I mean, we did Fiddler
on the Roof and I think

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.327
if I saw it now I would, I
would still think it was good.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.362
- Did you play Tevye?

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:37.597
- Yeah.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.532
- So you were a
gay child playing

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:41.834
a 40 year old Russian peasant?

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:44.604
- Yes, but I think
I pulled it off.

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:46.172
- In the writer's room we
were talking a lot about

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:49.242
like roles that you,
at the time, were like

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.710
"This is crazy that
I was cast as this,

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.445
"but I was actually very good."

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:54.147
cause, no, you weren't.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.216
- I still think I was
pretty good in everything,

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:58.718
so that never happened to me.

00:01:58.751 --> 00:01:59.685
- Well, you've done Broadway,
so you probably were good.

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:01.354
- Yeah.

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:03.623
- I played, in ninth grade,
I played Daddy Warbucks-

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:06.359
- In ninth grade?

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:08.761
- In ninth grade I didn't
want to shave my head

00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:10.730
and so I was like
"I'll wear a bald cap."

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:13.566
we glued it on so I
didn't, like you could feel

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.635
the pressure, you could feel,
you didn't want to rip it.

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:18.371
So I would, I did the whole play

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.606
like I had a neck brace on.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.442
- In the moment that
year, were you like

00:02:23.475 --> 00:02:25.578
"I'm getting away with
this, this bald cap works."

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:26.946
Or did you know this
was pretty rough?

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:28.648
- I was terrific.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:29.949
- Yeah, you were terrific,
you were terrific.

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:31.651
- At least I thought I was.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:32.952
- I don't want to
stop our conversation,

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:34.086
but we do have a
superstar in our midst.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.389
Because you won a very
important award in high school-

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:37.590
- Thank you, yep.

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:38.791
- So just let's
throw focus to her.

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:39.959
- What was the award?

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:42.495
- Well, in high
school, in 1999, I won

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:44.630
best actress in New Jersey.

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:46.299
- Wow
- Wow

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:46.966
- What Sarah?

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.434
- At a theater festival.

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:50.503
Best actor in New Jersey
was also in our play,

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:51.971
and so was the best
supporting actress

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:53.973
because our drama
teachers ran the festival.

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.609
- Okay, well this was
not told to me backstage.

00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:58.411
- So I do think it was real,
I do think it was real.

00:02:58.444 --> 00:02:59.245
- The fix was in,
the fix was in.

00:02:59.278 --> 00:02:59.979
- Edit out my set-up.

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:02.615
This is not what was told to me.

00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:04.250
- Cool hair, do you sing?

00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:05.685
- No, I play soccer.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.853
- Perfect, okay, athletes
make the best singers.

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:09.755
Meet me in the
library in 20 minutes,

00:03:09.788 --> 00:03:11.657
and bring your ball.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.793
- I was telling you
this story, which is,

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:16.662
it was a very pivotal
moment in my deciding

00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:19.465
to dive deeper into
being an actor.

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:23.302
I played sports and I
was in plays in school,

00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:24.770
and I would do both.

00:03:24.803 --> 00:03:27.640
The varsity coach cornered
me in the locker room

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:29.709
and he was like "Marino,"
and I was like "Yeah",

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:32.011
and he goes "You gonna
play basketball this year

00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:33.846
"or do that fag acting?"

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:34.680
- Oh

00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:35.548
- And I was like,

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.886
"I'm gonna do the acting"
and then that was it.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.724
I didn't play basketball
that next year, and I just,

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:48.794
and I still remember that and
that was many, many years ago.

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:50.429
- [Chris] Yeah.

00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:51.697
- But I remember that
moment and the decision

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.467
of being like, we
were talking about it-

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.002
- Yeah, it's a
thing about, yeah-

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:57.036
- It's a thing that drove,
that, you have these moments

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.571
of people who inspire you-

00:03:58.604 --> 00:03:59.439
- [Chris] Yeah.

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:01.407
- Or people who say things
that like, infuriate you

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:04.377
and motivate you to
dig deeper into it.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.845
- But that's cool that
that made you be like,

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:07.513
that didn't make you be like,

00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:09.015
oh, I don't want to seem like
a fag, I'll do basketball.

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:10.383
You were like (bleep)
him, I'm gonna-

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:11.384
- Exactly.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.419
- I guess it's probably
cause you weren't gay.

00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:14.954
I was gay, so I'd be no,
I'm playing basketball.

00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:16.722
(laughter)

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:18.258
I love basketball.

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:19.992
(everyone speaking gibberish)

00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:20.860
(bleep) fag, (gibberish)

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:26.399
- So, this is where
kids go after dances?

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.501
- I think just the losers.

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:29.769
- Well, where do
the cool kids go?

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:32.571
- I don't know, I
was a diner kid.

00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:34.707
- You guys have fun high
school dance stories?

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.009
- I only went to
dances with gay men.

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:39.045
(laughter)

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:40.780
- Yeah, that sounds about right.

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:43.082
- So, yep, I went to
theater school, so did you.

00:04:43.115 --> 00:04:45.651
Went to dances with gay
men and I'm thriving.

00:04:45.684 --> 00:04:47.453
- Right around the time
that we were going to prom,

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:48.921
I had a high school
boyfriend and

00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:50.723
we were very serious
about each other,

00:04:50.756 --> 00:04:52.958
and we both were like
in musicals and plays

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:54.727
and whatever
together and we each

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.529
wrote a song for each other and

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:58.030
then we snuck into a church and

00:04:58.063 --> 00:04:59.766
played them for each
other and sobbed.

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:02.068
- That is-

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:03.803
- That is adorable!

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:04.637
- Is he gay now?

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.571
- No

00:05:05.604 --> 00:05:06.939
- That is, by the way, it sounds

00:05:06.972 --> 00:05:08.073
like it's from Dawson's Creek.

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:10.343
- I didn't kiss a boy
throughout all of high school

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:12.945
cause I was in the
closet obviously and then

00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:15.748
my first kiss with
a boy, I came out to

00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:16.949
one of my friends
from high school in my

00:05:16.982 --> 00:05:18.651
freshman year of college.

00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:19.919
I AOL instant messaged him
and I was like "I'm gay"

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:23.356
and then he was like "Me too."

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.091
And then so the next time
I was in my hometown,

00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:27.360
we met up, we were like,
well, I don't think

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:28.328
we're going to be
together but should

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.829
we kiss each other since
we've never kissed?

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:32.665
So I made us drive
to a half-built home.

00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:33.899
- What?

00:05:33.932 --> 00:05:35.368
- It was half-built,
I drove us there.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:36.669
And then I kind of
location scouted,

00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:37.837
I was like, I think
this room's big enough,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.139
I can sit down
onto a step, and we

00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:42.141
made out there and it was great.

00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:44.577
- You produced your first kiss?

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.745
- Yeah, I did.

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:47.012
I guess as an
outro, I'll just say

00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:48.781
Hi Eric, that was a great night

00:05:48.814 --> 00:05:50.449
and watch our next episode.

00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:50.950
