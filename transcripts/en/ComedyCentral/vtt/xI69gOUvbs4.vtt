00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.971
(swinging jazz music)

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:27.927
- How was that?

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:29.929

Chris, you're the best.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:09.135
Who wants watermelon?

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:11.704
It's one of the five
basic food groups.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:12.939
- Oh no.

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.308
- Come on, have
some of my brain.

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:17.844

but no thank you.

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:19.979

some watermelon?

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:20.814

the neighborhood.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.908 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Why are you
required to tell me?

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:23.810 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We're not required by
law to tell you about that.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.346 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We're not legally obligated
to tell you what we did,

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:27.580
which is the best part.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.815
- You gotta go and
do all that research

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.316
and stuff on your own.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:33.319
- We have to let you know
that we're required by law.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.989
- That's right, a judge
ordered it, decreed it.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.391 align:start size:94% position:6%
- To tell you we're moving
into the neighborhood.

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:39.559

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.295 align:start size:88% position:13%
