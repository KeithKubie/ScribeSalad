&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb:
Okay, good morning.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.970
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.440
Good morning.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.010
I'm Mary Jane Deeb, chief of
the African/Middle East division

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.490
which is hosting this event.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.510
And as the division has
acquired the online Omar Said

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.940
autobiography that we are all
gathered here today to discuss.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.260
These items are now held
by the Rare Books division

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.450
where you will have a chance
to view them this afternoon.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.640
But this morning it is my honor
and privilege to introduce

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.480
to you Dr. Carla Hayden, the
14th Librarian of Congress

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.010
who will welcome
you to the library.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.870
Before coming to the library,
Dr. Hayden served as CEO

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.040
of the Enoch Pratt Free Library
in Baltimore and was nominated

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.020
by President Obama to be a
member of the National Museum

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.280
and Library Services Board.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.580
She was also president

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.060
of the American Library
Association from 2003 to 2004.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.770
Prior to joining
the Pratt Library,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.220
Dr. Hayden was deputy
commissioner and chief librarian

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.170
of the Chicago Public

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.480

Pittsburgh from '87 to '91.

She was also library services
coordinator for the Museum

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.030
of Science and Industry in
Chicago from '82 to '87.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.230
And she began her career with
the Chicago Public Library

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.340

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.640

Graduate Library School

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.160

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.990
She has received numerous --

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.220
and you can go online
and see numerous awards

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.920
and honorary doctorates.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.320
I would be here the whole
morning just to say it.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.260
So let us welcome Dr. Hayden.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.450
[ Applause ]

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.890
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carla Hayden: Thank
you, thank you, Dr. Deeb.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.480
Only my mother could do
a better job at that.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.060
And as you went through every
year I kept telling the young

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.640
people, I am getting
older and older and older.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.770
But good morning and Dr.
Deeb, I just want to start

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.320
out by thanking you
for your perseverance

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.130
and what you have done.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.890
And I'm not going
to break any news,

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.680
but we really appreciate
your service.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.980
So thank you.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.510
And I think we can
give her a hand.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.090
[ Applause ]

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.910
So good morning and welcome.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.200
I'm delighted to
be here with you

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.370
as we celebrate African American
history month and the launch

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.560
of the online publication
of the Omar Said Collection

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.640
which was purchased in 2017.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.730
And this unique collection
consists of documents

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.420
in both English and Arabic,
including an 1831 autobiography,

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.930
handwritten in Arabic.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.810
Mr. Said was a west African
scholar who at the age

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.110
of 37 was captured,
enslaved and brought

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.100
to South Carolina in 1804.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.340
And this document,
the autobiography,

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.590
is the centerpiece of the
collection that includes texts

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.570
which will be discussed
throughout the day

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:05.670
by prominent scholars and
library experts who acquired,

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.990
worked on the preservation,
cataloged

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.480
and digitized the collection

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.230
and then created what I think
is a very wonderful website

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.980
that we are launching for
the whole world to see.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.920
And you can see it takes a
village to present a Library

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.440
of Congress collection
to the public.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.120
And it requires expertise
and technological

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.730
and technical capacities
that showcase the expertise

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.210
of the library's staff.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.120
This collection and all of the
library's collections are used

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.540
by scholars and researchers and
anyone and everyone who wants

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.110
to come in and learn about the
items regardless of their age.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.480
And so what about
the Said collection?

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.880
Who apart from the
scholars and the researchers

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.340
and library staff
would be interested?

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.860
Well, high school students
who are here today.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.440
And we have a special
treat for you today.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.500
The Richard Wright Public
Charter School for Journalism

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.640
and Media Arts in
Washington DC --

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.510
and I told them to shout out --

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.170
[ Applause ]

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.430
And the Montgomery
Blaire High School

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.510
in Silver Spring Maryland.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.190
It's like the Super Bowls again.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.910
But Super Bowl of
research and history,

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.030
and that's what's so exciting.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.290
Well, both schools and
I say young scholars

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.810
in both schools have been so
fascinated by the collection

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.260
that they have actually
come to the library,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.550
viewed the collection,
did research,

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.530
met with the specialist
and experts

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.090
and then interviewed
and filmed them.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.200
And like professional
journalists and camera people,

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.280
they have created special
videos of the collection

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.210
and they will be sharing them
with you during the lunch hour.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.630
So I want you to please welcome
them and show your appreciation

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.440
and tell them how proud we
are that they are carrying

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.330
on the tradition of being
interested in history

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.900
and bringing history to life.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.700
Let's give them a hand.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:25.990
[ Applause ]

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.440
So, we will now have Marieta
Harper to say a few words

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.650
in memory of Mr. Derrick
Beard who was the last owner

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.850
of the collection, and who
wanted so much for it to be

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.340
at the Library of Congress.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.980
Marieta is an African and
Africa area specialist.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.430
And she first identified
this collection and thanks

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.150
to her perseverance, the
library was able to purchase it.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.510
So please join me
in welcoming her.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:06.500
[ Applause ]

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.600
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: Good morning.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.610
As you just heard, my
name is Marieta Harper

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.190
and I am Africa area
specialist in the African

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.420
and Middle Eastern division

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.630
at this institution,
Library of Congress.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:40.900
In January 2002, I
met Derrick Beard,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.790
the prominent antiquarian
book dealer

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.220
of African American
historical collections.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.620
He was visiting our division
while we were organizing a panel

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.160
on the historical roots

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.900
of Muslim immigration
to the United States.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:07.450
The symposium was entitled Islam
in America and was sponsored

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:12.250
by the African and Middle
Eastern Division and the Office

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.420
of Scholarly Programs.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.090
I coordinated the first
panel of the symposium

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.160
and Derrick Beard was
the first speaker.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:30.120
During this visit, Mr. Beard
showed me his collection

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:38.700
of historic Arabic manuscripts
written by Omar Ibn Said,

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.670
along with other manuscripts
written by African Muslims

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:48.070
from the 18th and
19th centuries.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:58.700
At the end of the symposium, Mr.
Beard told Dr. Mary Jane Deeb

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.720
and me that he felt the Library

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.920
of Congress should purchase
his unique collection

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.670
so the world could see

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:18.130
and research Arabic manuscripts
written by literate Africans

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:22.060
who were enslaved in
the early Americas.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:28.120
When Derrick Beard finally put
his collection of manuscripts

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.390
on sale, he informed me

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:36.090
and I then initiated the
recommendation for the Library

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.790
of Congress to purchase
this collection.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:47.140
So after much determination,
we were able to locate funds

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.110
to purchase the collection.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:56.810
The purchase was completed
in early winter of 2017.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:03.170
Regretfully, months
after the sale,

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:10.160
Derrick Beard died in July 2018.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.920
I am still shocked by his death,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.500
even though I knew he was
critically ill throughout

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.390
our negotiations.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:26.810
Derrick Beard was a consummate
connoisseur of various arts

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:31.170
and collectibles and
was recognized as one

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:38.310
of the world's preeminent
experts in his field,

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.040
which was the art world.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.090
He was a collector
of American, Islamic

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:52.850
and other foreign decorative
arts, including photography,

00:10:52.850 --> 00:11:00.600
paintings, rare books, unique
documents and other objects

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.510
of aesthetic and
historical value.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:10.800
The Art and Antiques Magazine
listed Mr. Beard as one

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.110
of the top 100 American
collectors

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:21.710
in 1994 and again in 2005.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.020
Prior to his death, Derrick
Beard resided in Dubai,

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.690
the United Arab Emirates.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:34.870
His 20-plus years of foreign
travels included residencies

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:44.830
in Europe, Asia, South
America and the Caribbean.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.500
Asia, sorry.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.280
Derrick Beard's broad

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.250
and extensive academic
background included a BS

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.930
in real estate finance
from the University

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:01.290
of Illinois Urbana-Champagne.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.640
And additional advanced
studies in interior architecture

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.530
at the Art Institute of Chicago.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:13.080
Studies in photography
at Loyola University,

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.900
studies in mechanical
engineering

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:22.570
at Tuskegee University,
studies in Islamic finance

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.860
at Harvard University,

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.810
and studies in earth
architecture construction

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.780
and management at the
California Institute

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.350
of Earth and Architecture.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.130
In acknowledging
these few aspects

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.860
of Derrick Beard's
background and accomplishment,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:52.950
we bid farewell to one of
America's greatest collectors.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:13:04.530
May his soul rest in peace.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:12.410
I will now share the memorial
tribute to Derrick Tyreek Beard

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:18.460
from the Mashid Asabar
Derrick Beard's mosque

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:22.500
in Los Angeles, Nevada.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:33.730
"In the name of Allah most
gracious, most merciful,

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:41.570
it is with deepest regret
that you are being advised

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:46.500
of the recent death of our
dear brother Derrick Beard.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:53.170
Brother Derrick Beard was an
amazing giant regarding the

00:13:53.170 --> 00:14:02.640
history, culture and ethnologic
research of Islam in America

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.890
and its reclamation
and preservation.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:13.640
Among his numerous and most
notable contributions was the

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:21.570

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:39.340
For years, Derrick
would actually travel

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.590

to their impact in early
America was phenomenal.

Derrick was always available
and approachable by anyone.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:24.920
He was an African
American giant of Islam

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.420

Now you won't hear
from me anymore.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:29.270
And I am passing the
baton on to Dr. Flanagan.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.510
Thank you.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:38.090
[ Applause ]

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:39.390
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:
Thank you, Mary Jane.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.480
So I just want to
circle back to a couple

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.760
of things Dr. Hayden said.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.750
One I think she referred
to us as the Super Bowl

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.830
of research and history.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.130
That's interesting.

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.430
I think there's probably
more people in room today

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.740
than watched the second
half of the game on Sunday.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.500
More seriously, she said
that this program is part

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.050
of the library's celebration
of Black History Month.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:05.910
And what an amazing sort of
history we have before us

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.770
to discuss this morning.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:13.120
Some 250 years of politics
and geography and religion

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:18.800
and literature from sort
of 18th-century west Africa

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.580
to the 19th-century American
south, and from the rediscovery

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.070
of the autobiography
in the 20th century

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.630
to the 21st century
when here we are.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.120
The Library has acquired,
preserved

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.280
and digitized the Omar
Ibn Said collection.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.000
So we have a lot
of ground to cover,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.810
and so I guess the obvious place
to begin is at the beginning.

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:46.740
And so, Sylviane, you've written
several award-winning books

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.600
on the African diaspora and
slave trade, one of which,

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.490
Servants of Allah:
African Muslims Enslaved

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.940
in the Americas, deals
with the time and place

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.030
of Omar's capture
and enslavement.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.370
That time and place seems

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.480
to have been sort
of far from simple.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:07.300
Maybe you could give us the
background to his environment

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.870
and what he would
have experienced

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.080
in the first 30 years
of his life.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.650
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sylviane Diuof:
Thank you.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:19.100
So Omar Ibn Said was
born in Senegal in 1770.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:26.320
He came from northern Senegal,
the region of [inaudible]

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:32.470
which is really kind of the
cradle of Islam in this area.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:42.670
And you know, for about 100
years before he was born,

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:46.050
there had been really -- the
region really felt the impact

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:48.430
of the transatlantic
slave trade.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:55.010
And that had given rise to
Islamic reformist movements.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:58.280
You know, there were
Muslims who were trying

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:08.370
to protect themselves from
the transatlantic salve trade

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:12.840
and from the despotism of
some of the local rulers.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.870
And many of them were
actually attacked, deported,

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:22.790
were victims of the slave trade.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.870
And Islam does not allow that.

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:30.080
Islam does not allow free
Muslims to be enslaved.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:37.990
So there were those movements
that started to protect Muslims,

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:42.170
to oppose the transatlantic
slave trade,

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:45.900
and as I mentioned,
despotism as well.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:51.560
And we see that not only in
Senegal but in several parts

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:57.930
of Senegal and in
Guinea as well.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:06.700
Now when Omar was born in 1770,
a few years later when actually

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:14.010
around 1776, when he
started his studies,

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:19.900
there was a real very
important movement there.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:30.590
For several years before, the
British had really taken a lot

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:35.890
of Muslims and sent
them to the Caribbean.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:38.670
There was also a famine.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:43.960
The British allied
themselves with the Moors

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:52.380
and there were really massacres
and large taking of people.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:28:00.220
So that gave rise to a new
Islamic reformist movement,

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.500
again to protect the Muslims.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:10.200
And their leader Sulaiman
Ball was a scholar.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:15.170
His view was that
it's not enough

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:18.440
to have a Muslim
leader, a Muslim king.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.790
You have to have a scholar.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:27.240
And I just want to read very
quickly what he envisioned.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.070
Because I think it's
very relevant

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:35.100
to that particular story,
but to others as well.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:39.900
He said, "Choose an
Imam, pious and ascetic

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:43.140
who is not interested in
the riches of this world.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:48.230
And if you see that his
possessions increase, depose him

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.760
and confiscate all
his belongings.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:55.260
And if he refuses to abdicate,
fight him and exile him

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.750
to make sure he does not
establish a tyranny his sons

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.430
will imitate.

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:04.690
Replace him with another among
the men of knowledge and action.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:09.250
Bring to power one who deserves
it, one who forbids his soldiers

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:13.080
to kill defenseless
children and old people

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.360
and to rape women,
let alone kill them."

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.190
So that was the basis
of those movements.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:23.540
And he was killed in battle.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:30.340
And the first leader of a new
theocracy [inaudible] really

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.920
forbade trade on the river,

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.230
forbade the enslavement
of Muslims.

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:44.780
And he was really very strongly
opposed to the slave trade,

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:55.110
not only of Muslims but also
putting an end to the transit

00:29:55.110 --> 00:30:04.440
of people from the
east to Saint-Louis.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:13.550
So this is the kind of regime
that Omar Ibn Said lived under.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:20.500
And it was really a time
where Islamic education spread

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.620
with lots of schools
being built.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.810
Omar continued his studies
he said for 25 years.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:32.530
He went to other parts of the
country and then he came back

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:35.680
to Futa, probably around 1801.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.900
And that was a period
which was crucial.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:50.130
The leader of the [inaudible]
continued to forbid the transit

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:57.870
of slaves, and there were of
course strong repercussions.

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:03.990
The French who had come back
to Saint-Louis burned villages,

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:11.180
killed people, enslaved
600 people, retaliations

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:15.560
from [inaudible] and
so on and so forth.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.580
Until in 1807 internal

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.930
and external forces
coalesced against [inaudible].

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:26.180
And as Omar wrote, an army
came and invaded Futa.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:30.180
And this army actually
killed [inaudible] and that's

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:35.660
when Omar was made a prisoner.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:47.110
He was worked to Saint-Louis.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:54.990
He was 37, very old actually for
being part of the slave trade.

00:31:54.990 --> 00:32:01.750
And in three ships
left Saint-Louis

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:06.330
between October and
December 1807.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:09.050
And he was certainly
on one of those ships.

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:17.200
Close to 400 people arrived
from Saint-Louis in Charleston.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:21.980
And Omar was on one
of those last ships

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.240
that brought legally Africans

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.810
through the transatlantic
slave trade.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:32.700
Because on January 1st, 1808,
the international slave trade

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.380
to the United States came

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:41.530
to a formal end even though
it continued until July 1860.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:45.260
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan: So given
that tumultuous background,

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.890
it seems to have swung wildly
from being turbulent at times

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.580
to being a safe haven
at other times.

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.790
Ala, perhaps you can
talk a little bit

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.610
about the intellectual milieu

00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:00.820
that he would have experienced
during those years before 1807.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:04.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ala Alryyes:
Uniquely I think,

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:10.530
because Omar has left this
manuscript, we are accessory

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:18.140
to the words of a "slave" who
recounts not only his education

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.610
in his country of
origin in Africa,

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:27.170
but also who seems to cast sort
of a symbolic role for himself

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.440
as resisting it in certain
ways as we will talk

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.860
about later today, I think.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:41.630
But as Sylviane was giving a
context of the previous lives

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:46.850
of slaves whom we
usually think of as,

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:50.160
or the standard narrative
thinks of them as sort

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.810
of a blank slate, right?

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.380
When slavery and the particular
kind of slavery that developed

00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:00.560
in the US turned human
beings into chattel,

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:04.290
people into real estate,
the standard narrative

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:09.780
of resistance became one
of freedom versus bondage.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.000
And that narrative, as crucial
and fundamental as it is,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.140
sometimes short-changes
this historicity

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:18.730
and the historical
forces and context

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:23.480
that set those slaves apart
or set those human beings,

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.120
those people, apart
as individuals.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:30.140
They all had unique stories,
but these unique stories

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:34.890
like the stories of all,
you know, frankly enslaved

00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:38.520
or poor people all over
the world are not known

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.680
or have been erased from
the historical record just

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.260
because of the fact that
they have left no records

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.560
of their own.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.020
In the case of Omar,
however, his literacy

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:54.390
which was a consequence of his
faith and his education in Futa

00:34:54.390 --> 00:35:01.340
in Sene-Gambia, left clues to
the mind, to the inner life

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:06.460
as well as to the kind of
contexts in which this man

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.680
when he arrived to the
US became involved in.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.980
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:15.070
And perhaps we can talk then a
little bit about the movement

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:18.150
from Africa to the Americas
and the slave trade.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:21.860
And Adam, this is something
you've studies particularly

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.530
on arrival in the Americas.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:29.880
But perhaps you can draw some
parallels for us in this regard.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.180
&gt;&gt; Dr. Aldam Rothman: Sure.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.480
Thanks very much.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.130
I just want to say before I
get into that history that most

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:39.460
of what I know about Omar
Ibn Said actually comes

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:40.760
from the scholarship

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.290
of the people sitting
on either side of me.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.320
And I want to acknowledge that.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.550
I'm especially lucky to be here.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:53.440
Just picking up on
something that Ala said,

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.500
I think it's very
important to understand

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:05.240
that not only had the history
of Atlantic slavery been written

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:11.070
and understood for a long time
in ways that generally ignore,

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:17.460
neglect or deny the African
historicity of enslaved people

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.860
and everything they
brought into that history.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.360
But the slave trade
itself depended

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.210
on the denial of that history.

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:29.410
Just to give you an example,

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.690
I was with some students
this week.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.450
We're looking at a letter
from a Jesuit priest

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:38.420
in the early 1600's who
is explaining to one

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.750
of his colleagues in
Cartagena de Indias

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:45.120
about why you shouldn't ask
captive Africans how they

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.060
were enslaved.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:50.460
And he says, "If you ask
them, they'll tell you

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:54.590
that they were unjustly
and illegally captured."

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:58.400
Because if they were, then
they ought to be free.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.560
He says, "They're
self-interested

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.990
so they're lying.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.430
So don't ask them."

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:10.000
The whole operation of the slave
trade depended upon willfully

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.800
neglecting the origins
of enslavement.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:21.770
And that's one of the reasons
why a text like Omar's is

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:25.240
so important, because
it recovers

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.550
that suppressed history.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.520
Slavery is a silencer.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.660
It denies the voices of captive
Africans and enslaved peoples

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:38.590
in the Americas, so recovering
this text is so important

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:42.210
to getting that history back
and understanding the lies

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:44.770
and violence that were
really at the root

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:47.070
of the Atlantic slave trade.

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:50.010
So that's one thing.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.250
The second thing is I
think it's so interesting

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:57.430
as Sylviana was talking about
the politics and history

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:03.610
of northern Senegal and these
tensions and in fact wars

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:07.190
over slavery that ended
up with Omar Ibn Said

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.880
on a slave ship in Charleston.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:15.600
It's interesting to think
about the intersection

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.910
of this tumultuous
politics in West Africa

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:23.490
with equally tumultuous
politics in North America.

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:28.870
Omar Ibn Said is a kind of
nexus, a connecting point

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:34.030
between those two histories.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:36.970
Sylviane mentioned that
Omar Ibn Said is one

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:42.590
of the very last captive
Africans to be imported legally

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:45.030
into the United States.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:47.030
Well, why was that?

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:51.050
This gets us into the
whole history of the debate

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:54.860
over slavery in the
New United States.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:39:00.440
You know, while Omar Ibn Said
is being born in West Africa,

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.930
there's a revolution about to
get underway in North American

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:07.990
in which the concept of
slavery both literally

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:11.690
and as a metaphor is central.

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:16.220
But so is the reality
of the slave economy

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:19.220
which undergirds the new nation.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:23.000
So a whole series of
compromises is worked out to try

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.340
to reconcile the
rhetoric of freedom

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.640
with the reality of slavery.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.050
And one of those
compromises has to do

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:29.600
with the Atlantic slave trade.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:34.160
So in the Constitution
of the United States,

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.970
one of the compromise clauses is

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:40.090
that Congress cannot
prohibit the introduction

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:42.490
of Africans for 20 years.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:46.590
So there's a 20-year window in
which captive Africans continued

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:49.200
to be introduced into
the United States.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:56.360
That 20-year window
basically ends in 1808.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:01.310
And right before that window
closes, there is a kind of surge

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:05.640
in slaving as planters
in the United States try

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.570
to get one last cargo
of Africans

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:12.020
in before that window closes.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:19.170
So Omar Ibn Said is caught in
this kind of trap of politics

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:22.090
on one side of the
Atlantic and politics

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:23.390
on the other side
of the Atlantic.

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:25.280
And I think it's
really important

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:30.660
to understand both sides of his
story, his story on both sides

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.960
of the Atlantic together.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:35.230
That's the only way we
understand the particularity

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.910
of his history.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.210
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ala Alryyes:
Just as a footnote

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:42.210
to what Adam was saying, if
I may, Omar is born in 1770,

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:45.350
so that's six years before the
Declaration of Independence,

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:50.050
and he dies in 1863-64.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:53.220
And so that's one
year before the end

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.520
of the American Civil War.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:58.480
So his life in a way is an
actual one might say record

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:02.430
or demonstration of what you
were saying about context.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:03.730
&gt;&gt; Dr. Aldam Rothman: Yeah.

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:08.430
His life is a microcosm
of the history of slavery

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:12.860
in the United States from the
Revolution to the Civil War.

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.640
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan: So
we've been talking about him

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:19.460
as both an individual and sort
of a sign for large themes.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:27.010
Getting back to 1807, Ala, maybe
you can have a go at this one.

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:32.250
Can you give us sort of a
sketch of who he was in 1807?

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:36.740
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ala Alryyes:

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.630
No one individual is
one thing for sure.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:46.240
And it's a difficult question,
but it's a crucial question,

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:50.740
perhaps the most
fundamental question to ask.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:58.050
And we know from the
manuscript that for example,

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:02.800
for those people who
captured him at that moment,

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.210
when he escaped -- as we know,
he escaped from South Carolina,

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:10.620
from Charleston, about two
years after he was brought

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:15.250
in the big ship to this country.

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:17.840
To the people he
must have seemed

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:22.160
like this remarkable phenomenon

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.530
of someone writing
Arabic letters

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:26.650
on the walls of his jail cell.

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:29.190
So that's one thing
that they saw in him,

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:33.640
someone who possibly
was unusually,

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.690
perhaps spectacularly
educated in a way

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:39.700
that they expected no
African or no slave

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.860
to be educated at the time.

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:47.190
Because of course
the common belief was

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:50.150
that Africans had no culture
or at least no literate culture

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:54.520
of that sort or no culture
that can be of value.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:43:00.140
On the other hand, he
himself from the manuscript,

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:04.930
we learn that he
was born in 1770.

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:09.260
We know from the dates that
he was an old man when he --

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.420
I mean, roughly, right?

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.790
He was 37.

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:17.880
He certainly was not -- I know.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:21.870
He was not a young,
youthful man.

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:25.240
He refers to himself
as a weak man.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.960
He certainly saw himself as a
scholar, did not see himself

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:32.390
as someone who is fit to work
in the fields or in plantations.

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:35.850
You know, certainly
the plantation regime

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:39.050
in Charleston was one
of the most difficult

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:42.860
and backbreaking in
the United States.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.730
But he refers to his education,
he talks about the fact

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:49.260
that he spent 25 years
seeking knowledge.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.490
He refers to three teachers,

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:56.180
one of whom was his own
brother in Putatoro.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:00.740
He refers endearingly to
his father and mother.

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.830
He refers to clearly both

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:04.740
of his parents were married
before they had a number

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.400
of children, and he
had a big family.

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:12.980
So he refers to all sorts
of details of that sort,

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:16.060
and the manuscript itself
also reveals details

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:19.910
about his escape, about the
number of days he was held

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:21.630
in jail in Fayetteville,

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:24.650
North Carolina once he
escapes from the south.

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:29.700
All of these various
details sketch Omar

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:33.160
as a multiple person,
like all of us.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.040
I mean, he was an African.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:39.030
He was one might say certainly
an insipient American.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:41.760
The moment he was captured,

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.850
he was an extraordinary
individual who could write.

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:49.060
And so that question I
think should not be boiled

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.980
down to one answer,
but we should look

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:56.320
at the historical record first
and foremost the autobiography

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.140
to open up that question.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:01.600
And that question is also
intertwined I would say

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:05.230
with a kind of one might
say informants or people

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:10.450
in the United States,
and we have a clue as to

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:13.810
who these people were from the
title page of the manuscript

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:15.150
that was written in English.

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:17.010
We know a lot about them.

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.580
These were well-known
people, scholars

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:24.960
and these are all white
individuals, including a man

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.790
by the name of Theodore Dwight,

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.160
whose uncle was a
former president

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.320
of Yale College, Timothy Dwight.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:36.330
And I'm sure Adam will maybe
later say a little bit more

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:38.420
about Theodore Dwight.

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.740
There were others,
Isaac Byrd who was one

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.040
of the early translators
of the manuscript,

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.950
and who himself was a
missionary actually,

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:46.850
ended up going to
the Middle East.

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:48.490
He was in Lebanon, working

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:50.520
on producing a new
Protestant Bible.

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.810
We have a lot of information
about that circuit of people

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:57.880
who solicited Omar to
write his autobiography.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:01.360
And certainly the question
of who Omar is, is a question

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.520
about his interiority.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.490
It's also a question about
his culture back in Africa.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:10.690
But it's also a question
about his future collaboration

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:14.070
and really incorporation
into the circuit of people

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:19.250
who had definite goals about
one might say the future

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:22.750
of enslaved people in
the Americas, right?

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:26.790
Including the fact that many
of them were not comfortable --

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:28.130
this particular circuit
of people,

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:31.140
they were not comfortable
with slavery as such.

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:37.100
They saw in Omar's culture,
his education and his literacy,

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:42.380
manifest proofs that
Africans were cultured

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:46.650
and they should not be
subject to this regime.

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:52.050
But they also were not happy or
not comfortable with the idea

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:55.370
of freeing those slaves
and then having them stay

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:56.670
in the United States.

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:57.970
There's a particular group

00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:02.390
of people called the American
Colonization Society whose plans

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:06.410
were to [inaudible] as
many slaves as they can

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:09.350
through convincing slave
owners to release them

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.510
and then have them
immigrate to Africa,

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:14.860
to Liberia or other places.

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:19.410
And so Omar has a multiple
identity and he's really --

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:23.880
as we were saying
before, he has a biography

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.170
but also a historical moment.

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:27.470
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:
Sylviane,

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.450
there's many ways
of looking at Omar.

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:31.900
There's a tendency to
see him as exceptional.

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.440
Is that the case?

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:37.210
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sylviane Diuof: Yes,
and he actually was not.

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:43.990
I mean, we have to understand
that the estimate is about 10%

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:46.800
of the 12.5 million
Africans who were deported

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:52.110
through the transatlantic
slave trade, 10% were Muslims.

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:56.090
So we are talking about
more than a million people,

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:59.800
more than a million Muslims
arrived in the Americas

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.190
and really in every country.

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:07.780
I mean, I used English, French,
Portuguese and Spanish sources

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:11.070
and I found them
in 20 countries.

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:15.660
And I didn't use Dutch
because I don't know Dutch.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.080
And what I found, you know,

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.480
again it's not just
what is there.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.680
There's many others.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:28.730
And you know, we're talking
about people who had been --

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:31.710
not all of them, but
many of them had been

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:37.060
to Koranic schools, could
read and write like Omar.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:40.540
Of course, you know, when
you were taken at 10,

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:43.750
you have a little knowledge.

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:47.520
When you arrived at 20
or 25, you had more.

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:52.820
Some had been teachers,
scholars, judges.

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:56.420
So we have really a
large number of people

00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:05.670
who like Omar were literate,
who like Omar left documents.

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:09.690
And there are a lot.

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:11.120
I mean, a lot.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.990
It's maybe not exaggerated.

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:18.390
But in Brazil, for example,
there are a lot of documents

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:22.530
that have been preserved
in Arabic as well

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:27.540
as in languages written
in Arabic script.

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:34.620
And we have that even
in the United States.

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:38.220
You know, there's a 13-page
manuscript that was written

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:45.100
by a Muslim on the island of
Georgia that still exists.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:53.840
We have facsimiles of other
writings that Muslims left.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:58.340
And in Jamaica, in Trinidad.

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:05.270
And that goes from chapters
of the Koran to full Koran.

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:14.560
One man here in the United
States known as Job ben Solomon

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.630
from Senegal wrote three
copies of the Koran

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:22.300
that of course he knew by rote.

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:27.880
And one copy of the Koran that
he wrote was sold at auction

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:37.210
in London, I think
it was in 2011.

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:45.060
So a number of manuscripts
still exist.

00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:50.240
And sometimes it's letters,
it's religious writings.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:55.100
It's also plans for revolt.

00:50:55.100 --> 00:51:00.750
Let's not forget that in 1807
when Omar Ibn Said arrived

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:05.470
in the United States, that
was the start also of a series

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:13.500
of conspiracies and revolts
by Muslims in [inaudible].

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.200
And those Muslims arrived

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:22.160
because of another
Islamic reformist movement

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:27.220
in Nigeria that started in 1804.

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:34.030
And there was also one
autobiography that was written

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:37.160
by a Muslim in Jamaica.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:43.490
And it's much longer
than Omar's.

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:47.910
It's much, much,
much more detailed.

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:52.710
Now the difference though is
that Abuba Asidic who wrote it,

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:55.950
and I think he wrote
three versions of it,

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:59.440
wrote it when he
was freed in 1834.

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:04.340
He wrote one version in
1834 and one in 1835.

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:06.640
He was free.

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.270
He actually went back to Mali.

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:14.450
He was born in Timbuktu.

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:18.400
And the other thing that
is different from Omar,

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:21.480
that particular original
manuscript doesn't

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.150
exist anymore.

00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:27.000
So it had been translated
and the idea is probably

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.080
that he actually took those
versions that he wrote with him

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.120
when he went back home.

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:40.460
So Omar's manuscript
as far as we know,

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:44.660
and maybe something would be
discovered, we don't know.

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:48.050
But Omar's manuscript
is unique in the sense

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:55.480
that it's the only autobiography
of a person who was enslaved

00:52:55.480 --> 00:53:01.930
and wrote his biography
when he was still enslaved.

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:03.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. Aldam Rothman:
Can I just add one thing?

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:07.260
I think Sylviane is
absolutely right to place Omar

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:11.330
and his autobiography
in a larger context

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:15.030
of enslaved Muslim
Africans in the Americas.

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:18.490
So it's part of a
broader picture,

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:21.870
but there's always this
tension between the degree

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:24.350
to which somebody like
Omar Said is representative

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:26.900
of something larger
and the extent

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:31.950
to which he really is unique
sort of in his own experience.

00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:37.680
So when I read the
translation of his autobiography

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:41.170
and the way he writes about
arriving in Charleston,

00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:44.360
the overwhelming
sense that I get is

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:49.260
that he is alone
and traumatized.

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:54.010
That there is a shock of arrival

00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:58.340
in this new very strange
and very harsh place.

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:01.780
He writes in the autobiography
of being sold into the hands

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:05.580
of Christians and arriving
in a Christian country.

00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:08.190
But then his first
owner, his first enslaver

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:13.810
in Charleston he describes
as a wicked infidel,

00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:16.860
which is strong language.

00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:19.680
And he suffers.

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:23.890
He's a scholar but he's
made to do hard labor.

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:26.610
He's literate but he
doesn't speak the language

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:29.170
of the society that
he's found himself in.

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:35.230
And it's hard, but instead
of having his spirit broken,

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:37.370
which could have been
one of the effects

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:44.160
of this extraordinary odyssey
that he's been on, he resists.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.910
He runs away.

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:48.920
You know, he takes matters into
his own hands and he runs away

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:52.590
and he wanders for
what seems to be weeks.

00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:55.530
And somehow he gets from
Charleston, South Carolina

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:59.030
to I think it is
Fayetteville, North Carolina.

00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:01.110
How does he do that?

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:07.200
And then he ends up you
know, and maybe it's a church

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:10.350
where he's arrested
and gets sent to jail.

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:14.860
He spends time in jail and
he's writing Arabic characters

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:16.160
on the wall of his jail cell.

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:22.190
I mean, you could not write a
novel that's more remarkable

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:23.890
than the true story of this man

00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:28.190
when he arrives in
South Carolina.

00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:32.420
So he is part of this broader
movement, but he is also

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:37.050
so alone when he arrives
in the United States.

00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:39.020
And I find that to be
one of the most poignant

00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:42.830
and powerful aspects
of his story.

00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:47.420
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan: And he
really is ripped from his world

00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:49.370
and placed in a very
different world.

00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:51.800
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ala Alryyes: May
I just follow up on that?

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.100
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan: Please.

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.400
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ala Alryyes:
It's no accident

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:57.200
that Omar was [inaudible]
a life, right?

00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:00.690
He refers to it a [inaudible],
an honorific title that he gives

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:05.980
to a clergyman who I
think later I traced

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:08.090
down to a man called Eli Hunter,

00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:10.260
a member of the American
Colonization Society.

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:12.180
I am pretty sure about that.

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:16.460
So this [inaudible]
asked him to write a life

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:20.420
which Omar actually ended up --
in the manuscript it refers to,

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:24.060
"You asked me to write hayati,"
which is the Arabic word

00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:29.110
for a life, immediately
translating it.

00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:35.040
Now the fascinating thing about
it is that the Arabic genre

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:40.040
of the life is not called that,
but is referred to as sira.

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:42.230
And so there is something
remarkable about the fact

00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:45.180
that he's asked to
write an autobiography

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:48.700
for the simple reason that
this particular genre has

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:53.290
by now become in the west
the kind of genre that speaks

00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:57.400
to the authenticity of
someone's experiences as well

00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.690
as the development
of a person, right?

00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:03.180
That is you turn
yourself into a person,

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:06.310
you sort of demonstrate your
personhood and consciousness

00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:09.950
by writing about it, by
writing an autobiography.

00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:13.380
And autobiographies remain
of course huge bestsellers

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:14.990
in the US today, right?

00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:17.110
They're seen as in
a way a reflection,

00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:19.160
a mirror of the person.

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:24.290
And so in a way, Omar's
1832 manuscript is unique

00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:29.130
because in it we encounter
someone who not only fulfills

00:57:29.130 --> 00:57:33.130
that premise or that
aspect of the genre.

00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:39.650
But he actually opens it by
talking about his previous life,

00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:44.850
by talking about his teachers,
by talking about his education

00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:49.030
by actually drawing on the other
Arabic tradition of writing,

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:51.790
which is the Arabic
tradition of the sira, right?

00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:53.750
Where you actually don't
begin by talking necessarily

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:57.730
about yourself and about your
education and about your culture

00:57:57.730 --> 00:57:59.200
and about your teachers.

00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:03.240
And therefore Omar is able
to bring together these two,

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:08.200
concatenate as it were
these two literary genres

00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:09.500
in his narrative.

00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:12.110
And that really sets him apart.

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:13.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:
And in your book,

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:17.150
A Muslim American Slave,
the Life of Omar Ibn Said,

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:19.410
you characterize a three-step
process of translating,

00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:21.620
deciphering and contextualizing.

00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:24.330
And I'm wondering if you
can tell us a little bit

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:29.010
about the insights that
come from that approach.

00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:30.310
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ala Alryyes: Sure.

00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:37.380
So the work that later became
this book really was done

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:38.680
in two stages.

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:42.530
One was an encounter with the
manuscript itself with the life

00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:45.740
and autobiography and
translating it and trying

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:48.770
to in translating it, to
interpret it and to think

00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:52.340
about both the inner life
of this man, his suffering

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:56.200
as Adam was saying, the
fact that at one point he

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:59.630
for example responds
to an overseer,

00:58:59.630 --> 00:59:02.090
clearly someone who's
sent by his southern owner

00:59:02.090 --> 00:59:03.980
to recapture him
and take him back

00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:07.800
or to buy him whatever
again, he responds by --

00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:11.100
I mean, he's responding in 1831.

00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:12.400
He's writing in 1831.

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:15.610
Remember, there is a
24-year differential or so

00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:17.620
between the moment of
the escape and the moment

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:19.420
of the writing of
the manuscript.

00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:22.210
And he's so traumatized
by that moment

00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:25.760
that he actually records it as
having responded to that man

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.810
by writing seven no's in Arabic.

00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:30.160
The word for no is
lah in Arabic.

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:34.720
And he writes seven no's,
right, not one but seven.

00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:37.960
And that is really a moment
where you could see just

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:41.600
by looking at the space of the
page, you could gain something

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.340
into one might say really
the mind of someone.

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:49.810
So there is that aspect of the
suffering of the human being

00:59:49.810 --> 00:59:54.560
that can be given by
the work of translation.

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:59.320
There is also the fact that
there is the political agency

00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:03.260
or the act of resistance itself
that the manuscript reveals

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.580
where Omar rhetorically
casts certain kind

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.550
of symbolic role for himself.

01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:14.910
The text, as my introduction to
the book shows, is full of sort

01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:16.910
of double hidden utterances

01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:20.760
in which he often will use
koranic suras to cast sort

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:25.140
of a role for himself or to
deliver a message that is hidden

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.760
to all except for those who
can really decipher what he

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.680
is writing.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:32.160
So that's one aspect or
one big part of the work.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.720
The other aspect that I refer
to as recovering the context

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.140
of it is something that I have
already spoken about briefly,

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:46.430
and that's kind of -- thinking
about the circuit of people

01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:50.790
who are mentioned, a few of
them are actually mentioned

01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:52.920
on the manuscript
on the title page.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:57.200
And these are white men
who obviously are related

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.370
to that [inaudible] who asked
him to write his manuscript.

01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:04.410
And you know, you need to
ask yourself the question,

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:09.770
in a country where --
what's the percentage?

01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:12.930
0.0001% of people spoke Arabic.

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:16.860
I mean, obviously I'm even
increasing that percentage.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.380
I haven't computed it,
but a minute number

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.680
of people spoke Arabic.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.980
Why ask this man
who speaks Arabic

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:25.940
to write a manuscript in Arabic?

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:27.260
Who could read it?

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:29.460
Who could really be
interested in it?

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:34.550
And that opens really
or has opened a window

01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:39.120
into the interest of a number
of missionary scholars,

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.130
ethnographers and so on who
saw in Omar an opportunity

01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:47.420
to do something or to kind
of prove or make a point

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:51.540
or create an anti-slavery
argument that was

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:55.230
at that point becoming
a third way shall we say

01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:58.430
in the anti-slavery rhetoric.

01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:00.490
Between the northern
abolitionists

01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:02.980
and the southern slave
plantation owners,

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.660
there was a middle
way as they called it.

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:08.990
And that middle way was
colonization, namely convincing

01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:14.210
as many salve owners to
release slaves or buying them

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:15.510
and then sending
them to Liberia.

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:19.100
And those particular people
were not universally it seems

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:21.180
interested in all slaves.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:25.130
They were particularly drawn
to men of culture and education

01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:28.530
like Omar was and as
Sylviane was talking

01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:35.360
about other people whom they
saw as deserving of manumission

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.840
because of their
culture and literacy.

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:41.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan: Now
part of the record assumes

01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:44.620
that he converted
to Christianity,

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.650
but the autobiography
itself starts

01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:52.400
with a long quotation
chapter from the Koran.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.700
What's in play there?

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.310
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:58.010
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sylviane Diuof: It's
one of the things that a number

01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:03.300
of Muslims did, you know,
that pseudo-conversion.

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:06.440
In some countries
they were forced.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:12.950
And they externally if you
will conformed to that.

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:16.230
And then you know, they
actually remained Muslims.

01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:20.080
And we have several
examples of that in Brazil,

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.930
in Jamaica, in Trinidad.

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:30.720
And when you read these
particular autobiographies,

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:39.520
you see how opaque if you
will it is, how contradictory.

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:46.080
And if he had been truly
converted as a Christian,

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:51.520
there wouldn't have been
I think this need to kind

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.110
of say one thing from
one side of his mouth

01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:59.910
and another from the other.

01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:02.650
It's confusing and
Ala, of course,

01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:08.710
you're very well
placed to dig into that.

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:14.100
But again, if he had
been a true Christian,

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:18.150
there wouldn't have been
the need to be that opaque,

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:23.060
that complicated, that unclear.

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:25.920
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:
And Adam,

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.960
the autobiography
was written in 1831.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.580
And I'll switch us
here in other ways.

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:36.720
Can you speak to the context
of that particular year

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:40.460
and the years surrounding it and
whether there's a coincidence

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:43.430
in play or they're connected.

01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:45.640
&gt;&gt; Dr. Aldam Rothman: 1831
was an auspicious year

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:51.150
in American slavery, the year
of Nat Turner's insurrection

01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:56.830
and the publication of Nat
Turner's alleged confessions.

01:04:56.830 --> 01:04:58.200
It's really interesting I think

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:07.120
to compare these two
biographies, the one ostensibly

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:11.970
of Turner written by a white
lawyer who had interviewed him

01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:18.360
in jail which represents
Turner as a kind of prophet

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.290
or religious fanatic,
depending on your perspective.

01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:23.470
So that's one thing
that's happening in 1831.

01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:25.350
And on one hand Turner's
insurrection

01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:29.410
of course causes widespread
panic across the south

01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:35.310
about the possibility of slave
insurrection and provokes a kind

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:39.150
of backlash, a crackdown
against slaves and free people

01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:40.890
of color across the south.

01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:43.750
So you have that going on.

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:48.460
At the same time you have
Omar Ibn Said writing his own

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:52.190
autobiography which represents
a totally different kind

01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:58.240
of textual presence or
representation of the life

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.990
of an enslaved person.

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:03.580
And I think there's
no direct connection

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:11.090
between those two events, but
I do think that by the time

01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:13.720
that Omar writes
this autobiography,

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.530
he's already become a
kind of minor celebrity.

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:23.380
Especially in the colonization
circles that Ala mentioned.

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:27.650
So the colonizationists
do represent this kind

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.490
of middle ground or third way

01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:33.190
between abolitionism
and pro-slavery.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:36.130
And they're trying to cultivate
a different way of thinking

01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:40.530
about slavery and its demise and
also a different relationship

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:43.530
between the United
States and Africa.

01:06:43.530 --> 01:06:46.450
So there's a kind of broad pivot
between Africa as a reservoir

01:06:46.450 --> 01:06:49.650
of labor through
the slave trade.

01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:52.330
And in the 19th century,
Africa as kind of an object

01:06:52.330 --> 01:06:54.230
of salvation and civilization.

01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:57.170
This is what the
missionaries are up to.

01:06:57.170 --> 01:07:01.760
And they see Omar Ibn Said as
this cultured, literate African

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.200
who in their minds had
converted to Christianity.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:10.470
And they see in him a
model for all of Africa.

01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:11.770
And I think that's one

01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:15.390
of the reasons why they
illicit this autobiography

01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:18.160
and he's described in
various colonization --

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:21.630
there are articles about him
in colonizationist publications

01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:24.540
where he really represents
this possibility

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:27.930
of civilizing Africa.

01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:32.620
So I think to put Omar
Ibn Said's autobiography

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:36.450
in conversation with
Turner's confessions is

01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:44.930
to show a wide range of both
the positions of enslaved people

01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:49.440
in America in the early
1830's, but also the variety

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:54.150
of white responses to
the problem of slavery.

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:55.610
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan: And
we should encourage everybody,

01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:58.710
if they're going to read
one autobiography this year,

01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:00.310
it should be his, right?

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:04.500
Because it's actually quite
short as well, which is handy.

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:09.710
So do we know details
of his life between 1831

01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:12.070
and his death in 1863?

01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:21.450
Perhaps we could sort of
sketch that out briefly?

01:08:21.450 --> 01:08:24.970
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sylviane Diuof: Well,
after he was bought by Owen

01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:32.580
who was a brother of the
governor of North Carolina,

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:40.200
he was said to have been put
to kind of light work regime,

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.950
gardening and that
kind of things.

01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:48.930
The thing also is that
there's no good slavery.

01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:54.630
And the fact also is
that he died enslaved.

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:56.980
And there was no
good reason for that.

01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:58.530
I mean, no good reason.

01:08:58.530 --> 01:09:05.440
He could have been freed, he
could have stayed where he was

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:10.470
and continued working
or drawing an income.

01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:12.310
He died enslaved.

01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:24.190
So you know, even though by
some measure his enslavement was

01:09:24.190 --> 01:09:29.260
lighter if you will in the
sense that he was not punished,

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:36.080
he did not have this horrible
workload, he was not abused --

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.810
and that's what he says.

01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:39.110
But at the same time,

01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:46.160
in his autobiography he
denounces slavery in the way

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:52.480
that he says that you know,
"I eat what they eat."

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:58.320
I mean, it's not
his exact words,

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:03.000
but "I have clothes,
I am not naked.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.320
I'm not abused."

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:09.040
Meaning that the
others are, right?

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:17.700
And so in that way he is
also denouncing slavery,

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:22.400
even as he contrasts
the normal lot

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:27.040
of enslaved people to his own.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.110
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ala Alryyes:
So regarding his life,

01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:35.670
there are fascinating contexts
that you find when you dig

01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:39.650
into the research and when
you look at known facts

01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:42.390
and context at an angle.

01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:45.460
So for example, one

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:50.940
of my favorite 19th-century
African American texts is David

01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:56.060
Walker's 1829 Appeal for the
Colored Citizens of the World

01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:58.850
which he modelled on the
US Constitution, right,

01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:00.150
with a preamble and everything.

01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:02.790
It is a really remarkable
document inasmuch

01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:07.350
as he creates a document
that is modeled

01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:12.530
on the supposedly
universal Constitution.

01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:17.850
But it speaks to
black experience.

01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:19.150
And the appeal

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:24.090
by the [inaudible] made him
really a hated man in the south.

01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:27.080
They were like Turner of course

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.900
after the rebellion
two years later.

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:38.190
And I found a letter which
was written to precisely Owen,

01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:42.620
John Owen who was then the
governor of South Carolina,

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:46.360
the brother of the man in
whose house Omar resided

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.820
for so many years.

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:52.780
And that letter alerts
the governor to the fact

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:58.780
that there have been attempts
to translate or to actually read

01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:01.510
that book to the
illiterate slaves, right?

01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:05.640
To the illiterate slaves
around where you live.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.730
And so be on the
lookout for that.

01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:10.590
And certainly Omar who never
learned English could not have

01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:14.030
read the appeal in English,
but he could have listened

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:15.640
to someone reading it, right?

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:18.810
Clearly that letter makes the
case that there are people going

01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:25.010
around reading that appeal
as Walker himself said

01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:29.020
when he offered the pamphlet
for no cost to people

01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:31.780
who would read it to your
brethren who were illiterate,

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.560
right, could not read
it for themselves.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.460
So there are these
fascinating intersections

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:40.600
that remind us again of, as
Adam was saying, the historicity

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:45.590
of Omar not only
in Africa which is

01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:47.820
to be emphasized
but also in America.

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:54.180
That history speaks
broadly and it's wider

01:12:54.180 --> 01:13:03.720
and full context are his
words placed in the context

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:07.190
of his intentions as well
as in the other texts

01:13:07.190 --> 01:13:08.890
that were circulating
at that time

01:13:08.890 --> 01:13:11.200
and the other political
acts that were being played.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:18.580
The full history of that
reprehensible institution.

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:20.830
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan: As you
said, that full history has sort

01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:24.190
of a deep fascination but
also a deep sadness running

01:13:24.190 --> 01:13:26.510
through the whole thing.

01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:30.640
Omar dies in 1863 and Adam,

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.800
I believe you discovered
his obituary.

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:37.410
Is that correct, while
you were researching?

01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:38.710
&gt;&gt; Dr. Aldam Rothman: Yeah.

01:13:38.710 --> 01:13:43.860
Just to add to this connotation
about Omar's life after 1831,

01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:46.550
I do think bits and pieces
of this have come up already.

01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:48.590
But I think it's
important to understand

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:54.630
that 1831 autobiography is not
the only thing that Omar wrote

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:57.420
and that still exists
in the archives.

01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:00.660
There's actually quite
an extensive set of --

01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:04.550
he left a paper trail, is what
I'm saying here, in Arabic.

01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:06.950
That extends to the 1850's.

01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:12.380
So his story archivally
speaking is even richer

01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:15.290
than just his extraordinary
1831 autobiography.

01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:17.210
It's one of the things
that makes him so,

01:14:17.210 --> 01:14:19.990
so deeply fascinating.

01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:21.990
But I do think that
the main fact is

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:24.210
that he remains enslaved.

01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:29.710
Unlike so many other African
Americans who made their way --

01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:31.850
not so many, but some
other African Americans

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:33.440
who made their way
from slavery to freedom

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.070
and then wrote their stories,

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:37.270
like Frederick Douglass
for instance.

01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:42.160
Omar is unusual because he
never made it to freedom.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:46.260
Yet we have this
archival record of him

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:48.900
as a person held in bondage.

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.290
And just the point -- I mean,

01:14:50.290 --> 01:14:53.730
he lived a long life,
a really long life.

01:14:53.730 --> 01:14:55.440
More than 90 years.

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:59.690
But just not quite long enough
to make it back to freedom.

01:14:59.690 --> 01:15:02.180
I mean, if he lasts
just two more years,

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:06.290
he sees emancipation
in North Carolina.

01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:11.080
And then how would the
story be different?

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.320
If he had lived just those
two more years and been able

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:18.330
to tell us stories of a free
person, what would he have said?

01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:24.590
That's to me one of the things
that's so sad about this.

01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:32.170
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan: Ala,
did you want to add to that?

01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:33.470
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ala Alryyes: Maybe later.

01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:34.770
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:
You each have --

01:15:34.770 --> 01:15:36.410
I mentioned the obituary.

01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:41.410
You each have sort of a
close connection to Omar

01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:44.540
and to the collection
or the autobiography

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.250
or the more extensive
collection.

01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:52.320
Perhaps we can touch
on those intersections,

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.740
each of you in turn.

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.700
Ala, perhaps you can start
in terms of what drew you

01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:00.760
to translating the
autobiography,

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:03.990
which had been done,
what, two or three times

01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:06.360
and it's been sort of
lost and rediscovered.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:10.600
What drew you to it?

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.580
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ala Alryyes: At
first it began at that time

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:22.650
to resurrect the words, thinking
about the words of someone

01:16:22.650 --> 01:16:27.460
who is so distinctive and
in many ways unique to think

01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:31.320
about what his words
mean to us today,

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.020
to think about the
fuller debate on slavery

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.960
that those words can entail.

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:41.630
And that as I said before
kind of morphed into --

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:45.720
connected with the story of
the bigger historical work.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.820
So there was -- I
mean, I'm a professor

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:49.840
of comparative literature
in English

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:55.790
and I spend my days
thinking about the way

01:16:55.790 --> 01:17:03.490
in which you interpret words
and sentences put together.

01:17:03.490 --> 01:17:08.780
And there is a fascinating
sentence by W. E. B. Dubois

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:13.980
that as I recall it,
"The expression in words

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:18.870
of the tragic experience
of the negro race is

01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:20.440
to be found in various places."

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.290
And it was fascinating
that in addition

01:17:23.290 --> 01:17:28.710
to the well-known places
of the Negro Spirituals

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:30.200
or the Slave Narratives,

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:33.190
wills in which certainly
slaves were left

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:34.820
as property from someone.

01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:36.790
I mean, that kind of expression

01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:40.260
of how they were treated
or seen as slaves.

01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:48.150
But their own expressions we see
in this autobiography by someone

01:17:48.150 --> 01:17:52.360
that in a way reorients
I think the debates

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:55.530
about slave narratives
themselves.

01:17:55.530 --> 01:18:01.110
So in a way I was drawn to
it first through the words

01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:04.290
of the man, then trying
to think about his agency.

01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:10.840
The fact that he was -- that
the opacity of his narrative

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:16.110
when he opens it for
example by a particular surah

01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:20.160
from the Koran, that seemed
to me to be included as kind

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.150
of a message, a hidden message

01:18:22.150 --> 01:18:25.170
that his owners had
no right over him.

01:18:25.170 --> 01:18:29.650
That the possession and power
are all in the hands of God.

01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:34.170
This seemed to kind of
go against the narrative

01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:39.550
of his conversion, right,
or his slavery itself.

01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:44.030
And to go back to your
question about earlier moments

01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:46.630
of translation, I mean
what is different is

01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:50.620
that certainly before the
overarching assumption

01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:54.010
about this man and
this narrative was

01:18:54.010 --> 01:19:01.130
that he is essentially a
convert to Christianity, right?

01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:08.010
His culture vindicates
the missionary converting,

01:19:08.010 --> 01:19:12.240
evangelizing aspect
of the people

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.490
who were circulating his work.

01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:19.920
And not necessarily or not at
all that it proves the universal

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:22.670
or near-universal
obviously education

01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:24.800
of people back in Africa, right?

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.730
So in a way I began my
translation and I began thinking

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:31.660
about his words and interpreting
them with different assumptions

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:34.560
which I think make a difference.

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:35.860
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:
Thank you.

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:38.060
And Adam, in your most recent
book, Beyond Freedom's Reach:

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:41.230
A Kidnapping in the
Twilight of Slavery --

01:19:41.230 --> 01:19:44.230
and this is while you were a
visiting Kluge scholar here

01:19:44.230 --> 01:19:46.950
at the Library of Congress
carrying out research

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:51.070
on African American voices
from slavery to freedom during

01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:54.550
which time you graciously helped
us out with some translations

01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:58.150
in the collections of Omar.

01:19:58.150 --> 01:20:02.170
Can you tell us a little
bit more about that?

01:20:02.170 --> 01:20:03.470
If you can give a plug

01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:06.350
to Chronicling America,
that would be okay.

01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:08.940
&gt;&gt; Dr. Aldam Rothman: Yeah,
like I said at the beginning,

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:11.770
I'm really a latecomer
to Omar Ibn Said compared

01:20:11.770 --> 01:20:15.340
to the other scholars
sitting up here.

01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:17.280
But I just happened to be sort

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.490
of in the right place
at the right time.

01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:23.690
I was here at the library Kluge
Center last semester working

01:20:23.690 --> 01:20:26.450
on a project of trying
to find material

01:20:26.450 --> 01:20:31.940
in the Manuscript Collections
written by African Americans,

01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:35.060
especially enslaved African
Americans in the 19th century.

01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:37.320
I mean, the Manuscript
Collections are vast.

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:39.350
Millions of pages of material.

01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:45.550
But only here and there do you
find anything actually written

01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:48.110
by a person who was enslaved.

01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:50.560
And I wanted to highlight
that material.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:55.840
So of course, the news that the
Omar Ibn Said autobiography had

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:59.130
come into the library and that
the library was doing a whole

01:20:59.130 --> 01:21:00.640
project around it was
incredibly exciting.

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:05.900
And then I was doing a series
of podcasts about the material

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:08.260
that I found in the manuscript
division, so we decided

01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:11.240
to do one on Omar Ibn Said.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:13.650
So that should be
coming out pretty soon.

01:21:13.650 --> 01:21:16.520
Sylviane is on it and
Mary Jane as well.

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:19.050
And for those of you
who like podcasts,

01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:20.520
be on the lookout for that.

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:27.110
But that's also part of a
broader I think goal which is

01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:33.390
to find new ways of telling
stories about history.

01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:37.530
Finding new ways to bring
manuscript materials

01:21:37.530 --> 01:21:39.870
and archival materials to light.

01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:42.950
You know, as scholars we sort
of seem to have a special

01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:44.790
and privileged access
to these materials.

01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:47.440
But something like Omar Ibn
Said's autobiography really

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.370
ought to be accessible
to everyone.

01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:50.950
It's that important.

01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:59.550
And part of that is
digitizing these materials.

01:21:59.550 --> 01:22:02.900
Part of it is translating

01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:05.970
and transcribing the
original documents.

01:22:05.970 --> 01:22:07.730
So my role was really
just to take some

01:22:07.730 --> 01:22:10.170
of the English language
documents in the collection,

01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:17.210
which are really remarkable,
and just transcribe them.

01:22:17.210 --> 01:22:21.120
Now many of you in this audience
look like you're of a generation

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:24.030
that probably knows
how to read cursive.

01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:26.040
[ Laughter ]

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.540
But some of you may not.

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:30.380
Reading cursive is
actually a dying art.

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:34.030
And it's not just reading
cursive, but going through some

01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:35.520
of these 19th century
manuscripts,

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:38.330
the handwriting is
actually difficult to read.

01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:40.560
I happen to have decades now

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.770
of experience reading
19th century handwriting,

01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:45.160
so I thought, let's put
those skills to good use.

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:47.010
I transcribed some
of these materials

01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:48.980
to make them more accessible

01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:53.070
in the overall digital
platform of the project.

01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:57.580
But actually transcribing
19th-century

01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:00.460
and archival materials,

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:03.810
it's much like how Ala
described translating materials

01:23:03.810 --> 01:23:05.500
from Arabic from English.

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:08.110
You just get a closer bond

01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:12.210
to the language and
to the artifacts.

01:23:12.210 --> 01:23:14.240
It just stays with you better.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.840
You sit with it.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.930
You just ruminate about it.

01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:19.750
And so doing these
transcriptions led me

01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:21.310
to do some of my own research.

01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:23.290
I started noodling
around on the Library

01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:25.160
of Congress's Chronicling
America website

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:30.710
which is an incredible database
of historical newspapers.

01:23:30.710 --> 01:23:37.880
And doing that led me to this
1863 obituary of Omar Ibn Said

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:40.230
in a North Carolina newspaper.

01:23:40.230 --> 01:23:43.300
So how many enslaved people
got their obituary written

01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:45.580
in a newspaper in
the 19th century?

01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:51.250
That's just a testament of
the kind of celebrity of Omar.

01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:53.970
But that was my connection
to this project,

01:23:53.970 --> 01:23:57.900
and it was really -- I'll tell
you all a tremendous thrill

01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:00.230
to get to the library and
have an opportunity to work

01:24:00.230 --> 01:24:02.770
on something as important,
significant

01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:05.440
and tremendous as this.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.740
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:
Terrific.

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:09.620
And Sylviane, your engagement
with Omar might be the longest,

01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:12.360
certainly over 20 years or so.

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.660
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sylviane Diuof: Yes.

01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:15.080
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:
And you've intersected

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.680
with the collection and the
Library of Congress on a couple

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:20.820
of occasions over those
couple of decades.

01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:24.300
Could you tell us about that and
what it all means to you today?

01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:26.000
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sylviane Diuof: Yeah.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.900
My encounter with Omar
probably started when I decided

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:37.330
to write this book on Muslims
enslaved in the Americas.

01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:41.850
And I don't remember
exactly when I got this idea.

01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:44.280
I think it was probably
'93, '94.

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:47.700
So I encountered Omar then.

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:53.910
But at kind of two encounters,
if you will, with him.

01:24:53.910 --> 01:25:05.970
I mentioned earlier that he was
taken a prisoner of war in 1807

01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:11.830
and during this entire
[inaudible] coalition.

01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:19.390
And I mean, to me there's
a family connection there.

01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:27.210
Sulaiman Ball whose text I read
earlier, and [inaudible] as well

01:25:27.210 --> 01:25:35.060
as many of the Islamist
reformists studied

01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:41.100
at [inaudible] in Senegal
which is a very renowned school

01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:47.790
which was founded by my
ancestor Hami Amachfal in 1603.

01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:51.870
So I had this particular
connection.

01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:56.710
Then while I was writing,
I was almost finished.

01:25:56.710 --> 01:26:04.560
When I was writing Servants
of Allah, I learned in '96

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:08.860
that there was this
auction in New York

01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:13.380
of the manuscript plus others.

01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:19.110
So I went there not exactly
to buy it, even though I tried

01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:24.760
to interest somebody who had
more money that I did to buy it.

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:35.270
So I got there and I was
looking at the document.

01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:43.100
And you know, this young
man came and very affable

01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:49.310
and sociable, and it's only
that he wanted to buy it

01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:53.700
and introduce himself,
Derrick Beard, Muslim.

01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:57.160
And you know, we
started to talk.

01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:04.350
And you know, the price was
not that expensive at all.

01:27:04.350 --> 01:27:09.450
And I thought, "Well,
he's there all alone.

01:27:09.450 --> 01:27:15.620
I'm sure a lot of other people
are interested as well."

01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:21.200
And I was kind of
appalled by the fact

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:26.560
that nobody bid for
that collection.

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.650
He was the only one.

01:27:28.650 --> 01:27:31.400
And I was happy for him,
but I thought, "Okay,

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:38.910
there's no museum, there's no
archive, library, university,

01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:43.370
collectors who are
interested in this unique" --

01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:45.230
because it was not
only the manuscript.

01:27:45.230 --> 01:27:47.890
It was other things as well.

01:27:47.890 --> 01:27:52.460
And I thought, "Okay,
nobody is interested?"

01:27:52.460 --> 01:28:00.690
And I was surprised and I
was disappointed as well.

01:28:00.690 --> 01:28:05.300
You know, fortunately
the interest came after.

01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:10.620
But at least the good
thing about the fact

01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:16.600
that Derrick bought it is
that he really exposed it

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:23.480
in the sense that he was
always willing to lend it

01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:27.760
to scholars and others.

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:34.090
To have it read,
translated, written about.

01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:39.330
He did something that was
in my view very moving.

01:28:39.330 --> 01:28:44.750
As I mentioned, he
bought it in 1996.

01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:52.540
In 1998, he took it to
Senegal in order to share it

01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:57.430
with the people of Senegal, with
the scholars and others there.

01:28:57.430 --> 01:29:03.910
And Omar never made it back,
but his manuscript did.

01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:08.050
And I thought that was you know,

01:29:08.050 --> 01:29:14.440
moving and that's
who Derrick was.

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:15.740
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:
Thank you.

01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:20.300
I will be opening it up
to questions in a minute.

01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:23.210
Any sort of final
thoughts before we open it

01:29:23.210 --> 01:29:25.200
up to questions, Ala?

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:28.330
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ala Alryyes: Since
there is a large number

01:29:28.330 --> 01:29:34.980
of young people here, I think
one important thing to say,

01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:40.410
one important advice is learn
foreign languages, right?

01:29:40.410 --> 01:29:48.200
That method of multiculturism
in the US, as positive as it is,

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:52.100
short-changes the
fact that people come

01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:54.790
with their own culture
to this country,

01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:57.900
and those cultures are
encoded in their own languages.

01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:59.970
And often the only
access you'll have

01:29:59.970 --> 01:30:01.930
to other people's cultures is

01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:03.950
if you take the time
to learn languages.

01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:06.760
Not everything comes in English.

01:30:10.290 --> 01:30:11.790
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:
So before I open it

01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:14.520
up to questions, please
join me in saying thank you

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.510
to our terrific panel.

01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:25.350
[ Applause ]

01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:26.870
So questions.

01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:28.170
Yes, sir?

01:30:28.170 --> 01:30:30.900
&gt;&gt; Hi, Ishmael Royer from the
Religious Freedom Institute.

01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:32.200
Thank you.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:36.110
This is a fascinating and
overlooked topic, all of you.

01:30:36.110 --> 01:30:39.760
And I was wondering
if anyone who wanted

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:42.210
to could say something
about what this collection

01:30:42.210 --> 01:30:44.870
or more broadly what
the collection

01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:50.820
of materials that's available
from Muslim slaves says

01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:55.960
about the ability to
practice Islam as slaves.

01:30:55.960 --> 01:31:00.770
We know that there was
originally under slavery,

01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:02.770
slaves were not permitted
even to be Christians.

01:31:02.770 --> 01:31:07.220
So what did the slave
owners and so on,

01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:10.360
how did they handle their
slaves that were Muslims?

01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:13.550
What did they do to either
allow or oppress that?

01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:16.660
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sylviane Diuof:
I can address that.

01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:20.450
You know, there were
two different kinds

01:31:20.450 --> 01:31:22.720
of things, of attitude.

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:31.060
You had really -- I mean, as
Muslims were known in the sense

01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:33.630
that people knew that they were.

01:31:33.630 --> 01:31:40.370
And that's why you have all
these testimonies of journalists

01:31:40.370 --> 01:31:44.490
and travelers and
slaveholders, et cetera.

01:31:44.490 --> 01:31:47.750
Mentioning my so and so is.

01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:49.940
So it was known.

01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:51.560
So you had this attitude,

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:54.900
especially in Catholic
countries,

01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:57.690
where they had to convert.

01:31:57.690 --> 01:32:04.800
So the idea was you know,
you have to be Christian.

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:09.410
And so you have all
these crypto-Muslims.

01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:15.740
You know, in an overt manner,
say that they are Christian

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:21.650
or go through the motions
and actually remain Muslims.

01:32:21.650 --> 01:32:27.370
Then you also have people
who know that the people

01:32:27.370 --> 01:32:32.180
who are enslaved
can read and write.

01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:40.970
And it was mentioned by a
number of American scholars

01:32:40.970 --> 01:32:47.930
at the time, that that created
jealousy in slaveholders

01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:52.820
because they themselves
were illiterate.

01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:56.380
So that was kind of an
impediment also to learn more

01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:59.620
about the people
they had enslaved.

01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:03.410
You also had in the
United States this idea

01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:08.650
that the Muslims were not
Africans, that they were Arabs

01:33:08.650 --> 01:33:15.600
who had been taken
kind of by mistake.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:20.820
And that those Muslims,
those Arabs,

01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:26.590
despised the rest
of the Africans.

01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:31.090
And you know, so there were
sometimes these attempts

01:33:31.090 --> 01:33:35.540
at putting people one
against the other.

01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:38.330
So you had kind of
a multiplicity

01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:43.780
of attitudes concerning them.

01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:51.400
But we also find for example
in the islands of Georgia,

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:56.190
people who had been enslaved and
had been freed were interviewed

01:33:56.190 --> 01:34:00.620
in the 1930's and who
described their parents

01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:04.480
and their grandparents
praying several times a day,

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:09.550
having prayer beads,
having turbans.

01:34:09.550 --> 01:34:14.100
So we know that they continued

01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:17.900
on the plantations
to actually pray.

01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:24.610
So you know, again we have
all those different attitudes.

01:34:24.610 --> 01:34:28.780
The thing is that
Islam did not --

01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:31.090
I mean, Islam as brought

01:34:31.090 --> 01:34:35.030
by the West Africans did
not really continue even

01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:39.120
in countries like Brazil

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:44.030
where you had really
established communities.

01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:45.330
So that's what I --

01:34:45.330 --> 01:34:49.230
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:
Thank you for the question.

01:34:49.230 --> 01:34:50.830
Any other questions?

01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:52.130
Here.

01:34:52.130 --> 01:34:54.700
&gt;&gt; This side, please.

01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:56.440
Just a couple questions.

01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:01.880
One is, what do you know about
Omar Ibn Said's descendants

01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:03.180
and relatives in Senegal?

01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:04.540
And for that matter,
what do you know

01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:07.440
about his family
in North Carolina?

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:09.890
Does he have descendants
that we know about?

01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:15.440
And two, what do you know about
the provenance of the documents

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:20.380
from Omar Ibn Said
to Derrick Beard?

01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:22.860
How did Derrick Beard
acquire the documents?

01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:24.210
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ala Alryyes: The
provenance of the sale?

01:35:24.210 --> 01:35:26.440
How it came to Mr. Beard?

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:28.280
&gt;&gt; How it came to
Mr. Beard, yeah.

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:32.850
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ala Alryyes: There is
a well-documented provenance

01:35:32.850 --> 01:35:36.860
because the title page as I was
mentioning, which is written

01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:40.300
in English, describes
exactly the way --

01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:45.840
it says written by Omar and
then given by another slave

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:50.460
and then translated ultimately
by a man called Theodore Dwight.

01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:54.470
Dwight was a member of the
American Ethnological Society.

01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:59.510
And he sends the
manuscript to another man,

01:35:59.510 --> 01:36:01.880
Isaac Byrd who then
has another --

01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:04.550
there's a letter actually in
the Theodore Dwight collection

01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:07.810
that has been acquired by the
Library of Congress as well

01:36:07.810 --> 01:36:09.890
within that rich collection,

01:36:09.890 --> 01:36:13.820
in which you see Isaac Byrd
responding to Theodore Dwight.

01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:17.260
There is a conversation
between them about a number

01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:18.610
of manuscripts that
have been sent

01:36:18.610 --> 01:36:20.580
to Isaac Byrd for translating.

01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:25.120
Isaac Byrd in later life
goes to Hartford, Connecticut

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:27.060
and opens a school,
right, a private school.

01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:28.920
I mean, he has been a
linguist in the Middle East

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:33.020
for many years and he ends his
life as a principle in Hartford.

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.400
But he is well-known and that
manuscript gets sent to him.

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:40.590
And he has it, and then it ends
up with I think the secretary

01:36:40.590 --> 01:36:44.260
of the American Numismatic
Society or something.

01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:45.560
We know that as well.

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:48.470
And then the manuscript I think
ends up in his family kind

01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:50.310
of hidden in an attic.

01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:56.310
And then finally it comes out
and ends up at the gallery

01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:58.920
at that auction that
Slyviane has introduced.

01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:02.060
So there's actually a
well-known record of it,

01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:03.880
quite a remarkable one.

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:07.880
As to your first
question, Omar never married

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:09.960
or sired children in the US.

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:13.240
I mean, he remained
a lonely man,

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:15.100
a lonely presence
for whatever reason.

01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:16.790
I mean, maybe he
didn't want his children

01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:18.140
to be sold into slavery, right?

01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:21.970
I mean, maybe he saw what
happened in Charleston

01:37:21.970 --> 01:37:26.530
where he spent two years and saw
the way families were treated,

01:37:26.530 --> 01:37:30.520
that they were not
respected as families at all.

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:35.460
And so in a sense, I think
that he never had children.

01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:37.450
He never had a progeny
in the US.

01:37:37.450 --> 01:37:39.260
&gt;&gt; Dr. Aldam Rothman: I
just want to add one thing

01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:42.900
to the question of the
provenance of the autobiography.

01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:47.090
One of the moments where the
autobiography reappears is

01:37:47.090 --> 01:37:49.290
in the early 20th century

01:37:49.290 --> 01:37:52.640
when a scholar named J. Franklin
Jameson somehow gets his hand

01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:56.180
on it and actually
translates it and publishes it

01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:57.840
in the American Historical
Review.

01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:01.690
Which is the leading journal
for American historians.

01:38:01.690 --> 01:38:04.860
So this is a document that's
been discussed by historians

01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:07.940
for 100 years and then has a
much longer history than that.

01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:11.310
But Jameson, the man who
translated and published this,

01:38:11.310 --> 01:38:14.380
then went on to become the chief
of the Manuscripts Division here

01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:15.790
at the Library of Congress.

01:38:15.790 --> 01:38:17.630
So there is a long Library

01:38:17.630 --> 01:38:21.770
of Congress connection
to this document.

01:38:21.770 --> 01:38:23.380
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan: So
we have a question over here.

01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:24.880
&gt;&gt; Yes. I'm Angela Pashane.

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.000
I'm a PhD student at
Howard University.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.360
Thank you so much for
your contributions.

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:34.000
It's just beyond beyond.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.300
Two questions.

01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:39.900
One, will the manuscript ever be
printed and bound for students

01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:42.010
to be able to read
and to be able

01:38:42.010 --> 01:38:46.460
to have a course with the book?

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:52.890
And two, I'm thinking about
the writings of Charles Meals

01:38:52.890 --> 01:38:55.240
in The Racial Contract.

01:38:55.240 --> 01:39:00.020
And I'm wondering how you
posit the importance of both

01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:02.420
of those writings together.

01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:04.020
And I know they're
completely different.

01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:06.680
I know they're from
completely different eras.

01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:10.110
But if you're familiar
with The Racial Contract

01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:17.290
and the importance of that piece
as compared to Omar Ibn Said.

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:24.150
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ala Alryyes: So I'll
speak to the first question

01:39:24.150 --> 01:39:27.520
which is the manuscript is
now available on the website

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:28.820
of the Library of
Congress itself

01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:31.820
of course in its full glory.

01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:34.170
But it's also available
in translation in my book.

01:39:34.170 --> 01:39:37.790
I hate to -- since you
were asking that question,

01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:41.340
I can take this occasion to
disavow plugging my book, right?

01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:42.640
&gt;&gt; Dr. Aldam Rothman:
I'll plug it for you.

01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:43.940
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan: Yeah.

01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:49.260
Is this the book that's for
sale outside at the break?

01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:51.620
Is that the book
we're talking about?

01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:55.350
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ala Alryyes:
Did I say that?

01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:57.630
But yes, available online.

01:39:57.630 --> 01:40:01.120
We also have facsimile
editions for on-site research.

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:03.860
So that's one of
the exciting things

01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:05.770
about this theme throughout.

01:40:05.770 --> 01:40:10.080
It's been available, studied on
and off for quite a long time.

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.650
And now it's readily available
to schools everywhere,

01:40:13.650 --> 01:40:17.840
high schools to colleges,
to book clubs, to churches.

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.130
You just go on, as long
as you have a computer

01:40:20.130 --> 01:40:22.860
and an internet connection,
it's there for you.

01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:26.770
So that's a very exciting
aspect of all of this.

01:40:26.770 --> 01:40:28.070
Did we answer this?

01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:31.170
Was there a second
part to the question?

01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:37.010
[ Inaudible ]

01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:38.310
&gt;&gt; Dr. Aldam Rothman:

01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:40.760
So I actually cannot
answer that question.

01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:42.060
&gt;&gt; That's fine.

01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:43.500
&gt;&gt; Dr. Aldam Rothman:
But I do think

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.920
that it is an exciting
opportunity

01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:51.270
to have this source available
to enter into all sorts

01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:56.660
of scholarly conversations
about race and slavery

01:40:56.660 --> 01:40:59.810
in American history,
about archival power,

01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:02.680
about religion and power.

01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:06.970
There are so many conversations
that this particular document

01:41:06.970 --> 01:41:09.450
and set of documents speaks to.

01:41:09.450 --> 01:41:11.680
And that's one of the
reasons why it's so exciting

01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:13.610
to have this material so readily

01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:16.920
and generally available
up on the website.

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:19.520
So scholars can talk about
it, students can talk

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:21.820
about it on every level.

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:23.370
Just to give you one example,

01:41:23.370 --> 01:41:26.140
I'm teaching an Atlantic
history class this semester

01:41:26.140 --> 01:41:27.440
at Georgetown.

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:32.340
And every week students have
to post an artifact to a map

01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:34.300
about Atlantic history.

01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:39.890
And then completely unprovoked
by me, two weeks ago one

01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:43.320
of the students used the
Omar Ibn Said autobiography

01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:44.620
for the map.

01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:47.720
Like the day after I
think it came online.

01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:51.710
So it's out there, it's
being used and it can enter

01:41:51.710 --> 01:41:55.260
into every conversation that
we can have about these issues.

01:41:55.260 --> 01:41:56.560
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:
Terrific.

01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:58.860
I believe we have a
question over here.

01:42:00.250 --> 01:42:01.550
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] I
am a [inaudible].

01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:03.720
I am from the Muslim Institute.

01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:07.790
I am in the process of
writing a history of Muslims

01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:12.030
of America going back
to Dr. Leo Winer.

01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:14.990
My question is this
Arabic manuscript

01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:17.600
of our elder Omar Said.

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:22.870
Is it in the Fusa
Arabic or local Arabic?

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:26.570
And do we find the
names of his teachers?

01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:34.270
&gt;&gt; Dr. Ala Alryyes: He does
mention the name of his teachers

01:42:34.270 --> 01:42:39.570
and he actually refers to their
names and he refers to one

01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:42.040
of them as his own brother.

01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:43.910
One thing that we need
to remember about Omar,

01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:46.300
and this is really
critically important about him

01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:51.720
and about someone else who
was also a friend of his

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:56.780
and someone whose title
on the title page is

01:42:56.780 --> 01:43:01.860
that these men's native
languages were not Arabic,

01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:03.160
right?

01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:05.520
These men were Africans
and they spoke --

01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:08.620
that's right, they
spoke local languages.

01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:12.290
So they have their own
obviously mother tongue.

01:43:12.290 --> 01:43:16.490
Arabic was the language of
scholarship and literacy

01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:19.400
in the same way shall we say
that Latin was the language

01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:24.570
of scholarship in Europe
for a very long time, right?

01:43:24.570 --> 01:43:33.320
And so that's one thing that
needs to be I think mentioned

01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:38.520
at this time and I think
fits into your question.

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:43.450
The other thing is about the
level of the register of Arabic.

01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:46.490
And yes, the register
is [inaudible], right?

01:43:46.490 --> 01:43:47.790
The register is Ahi.

01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:49.090
It's not a demotic.

01:43:49.090 --> 01:43:50.480
It's not a local dialect.

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:55.400
It's really a Fusa,
formal Arabic.

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:56.700
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan: Thanks.

01:43:56.700 --> 01:43:58.360
Oh, sorry, Adam.

01:43:58.360 --> 01:43:59.660
Please.

01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:00.990
&gt;&gt; Dr. Aldam Rothman: At the
beginning of the autobiography,

01:44:00.990 --> 01:44:05.290
Omar Said apologizes for
the quality of the writing

01:44:05.290 --> 01:44:08.620
because he says he's
basically forgotten Arabic

01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:09.920
and his own language.

01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:12.890
So there's just this
hint of loss there.

01:44:12.890 --> 01:44:14.910
He may be being overly modest.

01:44:14.910 --> 01:44:16.210
&gt;&gt; 24 years.

01:44:16.210 --> 01:44:17.510
&gt;&gt; Dr. Aldam Rothman:
There is that.

01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:19.170
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sylviane Diuof: I would
just add that for example

01:44:19.170 --> 01:44:23.090
in the other autobiography that
I mentioned from [inaudible]

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:30.370
who said actually that he was
a descendant of the prophet.

01:44:30.370 --> 01:44:35.070
He also gives a long
list of his teachers.

01:44:35.070 --> 01:44:44.050
And there are documents in other
parts of the Americas written

01:44:44.050 --> 01:44:51.540
in different types of
Arabic, in Ajami as well.

01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:54.880
And you know, it's interesting.

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:59.930
I think that to translate
is one thing.

01:44:59.930 --> 01:45:03.480
To interpret is another.

01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:07.390
And there's really a lot of
work that needs to be done

01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:10.550
on all those documents
that exist

01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:15.450
because sometimes they've
been translated years ago,

01:45:15.450 --> 01:45:22.730
decades ago, by people
who spoke Arabic

01:45:22.730 --> 01:45:29.110
but not necessarily the Arabic
that was used in West Africa.

01:45:29.110 --> 01:45:34.620
And also the interpretation
of those.

01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:41.880
Because you know, there are
quite a few old documents

01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:47.910
and those need to be interpreted
by people who can do that.

01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:52.030
And it's not necessarily
scholars who can do that,

01:45:52.030 --> 01:45:55.720
but [inaudible],
Imams, et cetera.

01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:57.020
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:
This is great.

01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:58.320
I saw three hands.

01:45:58.320 --> 01:45:59.620
We're going to start here.

01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:00.920
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sylviane Diuof: Yeah.

01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:03.120
I think here, this
gentleman has been --

01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:07.330
&gt;&gt; First of all, thank
you to all three of you.

01:46:07.330 --> 01:46:12.870
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan: Hold on,
we actually haven't teed up yet.

01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:14.170
Yeah.

01:46:14.170 --> 01:46:15.470
&gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you.

01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:16.770
Maybe this question requires
a little bit of speculation

01:46:16.770 --> 01:46:20.460
but I would pose
it to Dr. Diuof.

01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:23.780
In these days where
people are doing things

01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:27.060
like Finding Your Roots which
is one of my favorite programs,

01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:31.220
have you found in your research
that there are any families

01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:34.610
that have returned to
their practice of Islam

01:46:34.610 --> 01:46:39.620
after discovering that their
predecessor was a Muslim?

01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:44.280
Or that were actually practicing
Islam without the knowledge

01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:49.050
that their predecessor
was a Muslim?

01:46:49.050 --> 01:46:51.750
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sylviane Diuof: I
think there are probably both

01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:53.050
of those.

01:46:53.050 --> 01:46:58.620
The thing is that what we've
seen a few years ago is

01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:04.730
that people whose DNA was
for example said to be --

01:47:04.730 --> 01:47:09.620
because I have my
reservation about that --

01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:11.860
said to be Fulbe or Olsa.

01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:20.480
So people who are mostly
Muslims, then you know,

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:25.580
some of the people
actually became Muslims,

01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:33.540
or Muslims today have
their DNA traced to check

01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:36.470
if their ancestors
were Muslims as well.

01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:44.480
So it's kind of -- now you
know, again this is kind of --

01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:49.200
those are situations that are
a little iffy if you will.

01:47:49.200 --> 01:48:00.330
And religion, I don't know if
biology can give you any kind

01:48:00.330 --> 01:48:03.680
of way of becoming Muslims.

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:06.230
I mean, to me it's
all complicated.

01:48:06.230 --> 01:48:11.940
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan: So
we have a question over here.

01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:13.240
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sylviane Diuof: Yes.

01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:14.540
To the distinguished panel

01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:16.490
and to the distinguished
people here.

01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:17.790
My name is B. M. Shakeer.

01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:19.980
I'm from Fayetteville,
North Carolina.

01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:22.090
There in Fayetteville,
North Carolina

01:48:22.090 --> 01:48:25.830
when Omar Ibn Said came
there and went to the jail,

01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:28.300
he wrote the Arabic on the wall.

01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:31.340
We have the church there, the
First Presbyterian Church.

01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:35.280
Where in the history of the
First Presbyterian Church,

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:38.410
they have Omar annotated,
but they refer

01:48:38.410 --> 01:48:40.470
to him as Uncle Moran.

01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:43.720
And as to the question
that was earlier discussed,

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:46.690
whether he accepted
Christianity or not,

01:48:46.690 --> 01:48:49.970
we find that he did not
convert to Christianity.

01:48:49.970 --> 01:48:53.970
As one of the scholars said,
based on the circumstances

01:48:53.970 --> 01:48:57.080
and the situation
he found himself in,

01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:00.260
he did many things
in order to adapt.

01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:03.150
The same way that from our
ancestors when they went

01:49:03.150 --> 01:49:05.730
down by the river,
maybe they sung a song,

01:49:05.730 --> 01:49:08.850
it was coded language
in order to adapt.

01:49:08.850 --> 01:49:10.510
Now I just want to
mention one thing.

01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:15.430
The young lady was asking
a question about if any

01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:17.820
of the predecessors converted

01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:20.940
or accepted Al Islam
or became Muslims.

01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:22.870
You know, the late
Dr. Sierra Lincoln

01:49:22.870 --> 01:49:25.570
who was a theologian there
at the Duke University,

01:49:25.570 --> 01:49:28.910
he said there is something in
the African American make up,

01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:32.120
he called it the
Islamic genetic memory.

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:37.870
The Islamic genetic memory, that
somewhere in some place and time

01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:40.750
in our families, that gene

01:49:40.750 --> 01:49:44.620
or that genetic memory
is going to awaken in us.

01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:47.650
Now in my family, I'm the
only one that accepted.

01:49:47.650 --> 01:49:52.990
I heard the call and I
accepted Al Islam in 1973.

01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:57.140
Now we also have built two
edifices in Fayetteville,

01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:01.670
North Carolina honoring our
great ancestor Omar Ibn Said.

01:50:01.670 --> 01:50:04.490
We built two masjids
or houses of worship.

01:50:04.490 --> 01:50:08.390
This gentleman here, under his
leadership we built the first

01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:11.930
one as indigenous
Muslims in North Carolina.

01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:14.380
We structured Omar Ibn Said.

01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:17.150
Then when the highway
department came through

01:50:17.150 --> 01:50:22.060
and declared imminent domain,
well, we took that money

01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:24.370
and we built another masjid.

01:50:24.370 --> 01:50:27.610
Plus we have a marker
in North Carolina

01:50:27.610 --> 01:50:30.980
that recognized Omar
Ibn Said that was issued

01:50:30.980 --> 01:50:33.210
by the state of North Carolina.

01:50:33.210 --> 01:50:34.960
And these are very
important things

01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:38.340
because Omar Ibn
Said is all of us.

01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:41.570
Everyone sitting in this
room is Omar Ibn Said.

01:50:41.570 --> 01:50:44.460
What I like about your
presentation is first you talked

01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:46.660
about him as a human being.

01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:47.960
He was a human being.

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:49.800
You talked about his identity.

01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:54.020
Then you also emphasized his
intellectual enlightenment.

01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:58.680
If you don't know, Omar
was very influential

01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:02.160
in bringing public
education to North Carolina

01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:03.610
through his legislation.

01:51:03.610 --> 01:51:07.050
And we thank you very much
for allowing us to be here

01:51:07.050 --> 01:51:09.810
at this great, great
program honoring a great,

01:51:09.810 --> 01:51:13.510
great human being,
Omar Ibn Said.

01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:19.100
[ Applause ]

01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:20.400
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:
Thank you for that.

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:23.090
We might have time for one,
maybe two more questions.

01:51:23.090 --> 01:51:24.390
We have one here.

01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:25.690
&gt;&gt; I'll be very quick.

01:51:25.690 --> 01:51:26.990
Thank you, everyone
for a wonderful talk.

01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:29.110
The question is
linguistics-related.

01:51:29.110 --> 01:51:33.060
I'm curious, what forms of
material potentially are lest

01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:34.580
in the various forms of Arabic?

01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:37.110
The Ajami was brought
up just a second ago

01:51:37.110 --> 01:51:38.440
and Fusa, what have you.

01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:41.860
As well as languages
written in Arabic script

01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:44.200
or just other African languages.

01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:47.710
I'm curious what all we
have regardless of religion.

01:51:47.710 --> 01:51:50.560
So I would be curious
to see what's there.

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:53.150
Thank you.

01:51:53.150 --> 01:51:55.150
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sylviane Diuof: I think
that in the United States,

01:51:55.150 --> 01:51:57.010
I mean, there are
not many manuscripts

01:51:57.010 --> 01:52:00.300
that have been found.

01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:10.860
But in other countries you have
Ousa written in Arabic script.

01:52:10.860 --> 01:52:19.640
I think it's in Trinidad,
there's Uroba,

01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:22.790
written in Arabic script.

01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:29.560
You know, and again, the
[inaudible] is not enormous

01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:32.610
and other things may be found.

01:52:32.610 --> 01:52:38.320
But you know, you also have
people really who actually

01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:43.850
from -- I mean it's
not me who said that,

01:52:43.850 --> 01:52:48.700
because I'm not capable
of knowing that.

01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:51.330
But people whose knowledge

01:52:51.330 --> 01:52:55.490
of Arabic was actually
much better than Omar's.

01:52:55.490 --> 01:53:01.680
And who also quote
a number of books

01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:05.700
that they had read
before they were enslaved.

01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:14.610
And so you see really kind
of an elite of scholars,

01:53:14.610 --> 01:53:20.120
people who have attained a
high level of scholarship.

01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:27.920
And we find that in Brazil and
in some other countries as well.

01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:32.800
Now when there was just
very briefly this mention

01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:40.670
of conversion in Jamaica, there
is a case for example of a man,

01:53:40.670 --> 01:53:43.590
a Muslim, who converted.

01:53:43.590 --> 01:53:51.690
And what that gave him was
access to paper, to notebooks.

01:53:51.690 --> 01:53:59.400
And in one of them he wrote
a 50-page treatise on how

01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:04.870
to remain a good Muslim,
these kind of things,

01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:08.750
and how to preserve
the community.

01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:12.800
You has missionaries also

01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:19.490
who gave Bibles in
Arabic to Muslims.

01:54:19.490 --> 01:54:22.420
And that was for them --

01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:28.830
you know, that was great
because you could read.

01:54:28.830 --> 01:54:36.120
Omar also had -- some
also received Korans.

01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:42.850
And in Brazil actually the
Muslims organized themselves

01:54:42.850 --> 01:54:49.180
to have Korans in Arabic
imported from France.

01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:53.770
And people who were
enslaved bought the Korans

01:54:53.770 --> 01:54:59.760
by installments, taking years
sometimes to actually buy them.

01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:05.400
And then the organized
networks from Rio to Bia

01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:10.960
to send those Korans
to other Muslims.

01:55:11.980 --> 01:55:14.570
&gt;&gt; Dr. Eugene Flanagan:
So I see more hands up,

01:55:14.570 --> 01:55:18.230
but unfortunately we've
come to the end of our time.

01:55:18.230 --> 01:55:22.700
And I've been handed a
note that appears to be

01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:25.570
in Arabic itself, Mary Jane.

01:55:25.570 --> 01:55:29.910
But I will -- so a
couple of things.

01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:32.160
One, we'll be taking
a break in a minute.

01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:34.670
There will be lunch at the back.

01:55:34.670 --> 01:55:37.280
And also then at 12:30
we'll be showing a couple

01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:40.660
of videos I believe, one from
the Library of Congress itself

01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:44.090
and one from our high
school participants

01:55:44.090 --> 01:55:45.860
that are here today with us.

01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:50.550
So before we reconvene,
again I want to --

01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:51.850
I would appreciate
you joining me

01:55:51.850 --> 01:55:56.510
in thanking our terrific panel
and a wonderful conversation.

01:55:56.510 --> 01:56:05.190
[ Applause ]

01:56:05.190 --> 01:56:06.490
&gt;&gt; Leanne Potter:
I'm Leanne Potter

01:56:06.490 --> 01:56:11.060
and I direct the new Office
of Learning and Engagement

01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:15.640
in the Library's new Center
for Learning, Literacy

01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:18.660
and Engagement here at
the Library of Congress.

01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:20.690
A bit of background.

01:56:20.690 --> 01:56:22.810
I want to talk with
you a little bit

01:56:22.810 --> 01:56:26.030
about how students got involved

01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:29.590
with the Omar Ibn
Said collection

01:56:29.590 --> 01:56:32.160
and how these students
got involved

01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:35.420
with creating the documentary
films that you're going

01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:38.150
to have a chance to
see in just a minute.

01:56:38.150 --> 01:56:43.770
So this past fall, colleagues
from around the library gathered

01:56:43.770 --> 01:56:46.750
to talk about this acquisition.

01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:49.680
And in the course of
those conversations,

01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:53.910
we spoke about how the
library would not only make the

01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:58.200
collection available, but
also provide opportunities

01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:01.210
for lots of promotion.

01:57:01.210 --> 01:57:03.610
We talked about articles
that would be written.

01:57:03.610 --> 01:57:06.120
We talked about the texts that
would appear on the website.

01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:08.940
We talked about tweets
and so on.

01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:11.660
And in the course of that
conversation, we also talked

01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:15.340
about how might we get young
student voices involved

01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:16.820
in the conversation?

01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:20.430
And I was really thrilled that
my colleagues were as energetic

01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:22.960
at the possibility of
introducing students

01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:27.840
to the collection even before
it became available online.

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:30.330
This is very new for us.

01:57:30.330 --> 01:57:33.150
The library hasn't done
anything quite like this before,

01:57:33.150 --> 01:57:34.810
and so in just a minute,
you guys are going

01:57:34.810 --> 01:57:37.260
to see the results of
us trying something new.

01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:41.030
And I hope you'll be as
excited about it as we are.

01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:44.870
We reached out to two local
teachers, George Mayo who's

01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:46.250
over there getting his lunch,

01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:49.850
who is at Montgomery
Blaire High School

01:57:49.850 --> 01:57:51.280
in Silver Spring Maryland.

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:55.530
And we reached out to
Michelle Santos who's

01:57:55.530 --> 01:57:57.080
over here eating her lunch,

01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:00.750
who roped in her
colleague John Simms

01:58:00.750 --> 01:58:05.130
at Richard Wright Public
Charter School for Journalism

01:58:05.130 --> 01:58:07.710
and Media Arts here
in the District.

01:58:07.710 --> 01:58:09.150
I like that you guys have moved

01:58:09.150 --> 01:58:11.030
because now we're getting
voices around the room.

01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:12.330
This is good.

01:58:12.330 --> 01:58:13.920
And I sent them an email.

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:16.790
And in this initial email
that I wrote to them,

01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:20.330
I shared some information about
the Omar Ibn Said collection

01:58:20.330 --> 01:58:22.270
and the library's plan for it.

01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:25.530
And asked if they thought
that they had some students

01:58:25.530 --> 01:58:28.090
who might be interested
in working with us

01:58:28.090 --> 01:58:30.840
to create some related
documentaries.

01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:33.950
I am very happy to
report that they said yes

01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:36.720
and we're very intrigued
with possibilities.

01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:42.430
So thank you George and
Michelle and John for that.

01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:45.910
Since that initial email
at the very end of October,

01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:49.470
13 students from the two
schools have been conducting

01:58:49.470 --> 01:58:50.770
original research.

01:58:50.770 --> 01:58:53.780
In fact, I just told both
groups that they probably --

01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:56.790
no offense, folks -- know
more about Omar Ibn Said

01:58:56.790 --> 01:59:00.620
and his collection than at least
half the people in this room.

01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:03.160
These kids have been
doing their homework.

01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:04.950
Not only have they
been doing research.

01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:08.440
They have also been collecting
footage here at the library.

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:10.830
They have been learning
more about copyright.

01:59:10.830 --> 01:59:13.590
They have been conducting
interviews.

01:59:13.590 --> 01:59:16.310
They have been drafting
narratives and more in order

01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:18.850
to create the two documentary
films that we're excited

01:59:18.850 --> 01:59:21.110
to share with you momentarily.

01:59:21.110 --> 01:59:25.140
I really need to emphasize
that this was a pilot effort

01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:30.070
on our side, but absolutely not
a pilot effort on their side.

01:59:30.070 --> 01:59:33.980
This one required buy-in here
at the library and support

01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:38.210
from extraordinary colleagues
across the Library of Congress.

01:59:38.210 --> 01:59:40.890
So I really want to send a
little shout-out and thank you

01:59:40.890 --> 01:59:44.980
to my colleagues in the Africa
and Middle East division as well

01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:48.390
as the Communications
Office, my colleagues

01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:50.970
in our digitization
lab, my colleagues

01:59:50.970 --> 01:59:53.790
in the conservation lab.

01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:57.060
Our colleagues in the
acquisitions division as well

01:59:57.060 --> 02:00:00.780
as my team in the Learning
and Innovation Office.

02:00:00.780 --> 02:00:02.790
A project like this
does not just happen.

02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:04.930
It happens when folks
are willing and able

02:00:04.930 --> 02:00:06.350
to work together
and make it happen.

02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:08.550
So thank you all for that.

02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:11.940
It also required amazing
coordination and thank goodness

02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:15.140
for Colina Black who's
right there pretending

02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:16.980
to be mild-mannered.

02:00:16.980 --> 02:00:19.590
She did an exceptional
job serving

02:00:19.590 --> 02:00:22.250
as this pilot project's manager.

02:00:22.250 --> 02:00:26.180
Her enthusiasm and her
organizational skills coupled

02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:29.640
with her graciousness and
tact were absolutely vital

02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:30.940
to pull this one off.

02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:32.970
So thank you, Colina.

02:00:32.970 --> 02:00:35.270
Now on with our show.

02:00:40.510 --> 02:00:48.690
[ Music ]

02:00:48.690 --> 02:00:51.880
&gt;&gt; You asked me to
write my life.

02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:57.580
I cannot write my life, for I
have forgotten much of my talk

02:00:57.580 --> 02:00:59.070
as well as the talk
of the Arabs.

02:00:59.070 --> 02:01:04.870
Oh, brother, in the name
of Allah, I ask you not

02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:10.740
to blame me, for my eye is
weak as well as my body.

02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:13.220
&gt;&gt; Omar Ibn Said was a famous

02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:17.370
and scholarly African
American Muslim

02:01:17.370 --> 02:01:19.820
who came here in
the early 1800s.

02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:24.650
Omar Ibn Said's manuscript
shows that he was a scholar,

02:01:24.650 --> 02:01:28.080
he was a world's traveler
before he was even captured

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:29.380
and enslaved.

02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:32.110
&gt;&gt; It is the only known,
existing manuscript

02:01:32.110 --> 02:01:34.250
in Arabic written by a slave.

02:01:34.250 --> 02:01:37.490
And it's written by a
man who is still a slave.

02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:42.470
He arrived when he was 37.

02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:45.170
He died when he was over 80.

02:01:45.170 --> 02:01:48.360
Over a period of 40
years, he knew English.

02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:52.510
In Arabic he knew that nobody
could understand what he said,

02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:55.060
and therefore he
could be more truthful

02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:57.370
if he wanted, less fearful.

02:01:57.370 --> 02:01:59.400
&gt;&gt; That fact that these
materials are written

02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:03.060
in Arabic sort of changes
what we believe we know

02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:06.640
about American slavery and
about those individuals

02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:08.500
who were enslaved in America.

02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:11.340
In a typical classroom,
when students are introduced

02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:14.850
to American slavery, there is
a section in their textbook.

02:02:14.850 --> 02:02:17.060
And that section in
their textbook may

02:02:17.060 --> 02:02:19.570
or may not introduce
many details

02:02:19.570 --> 02:02:22.140
about specific individuals.

02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:26.640
So I think part of what this
collection does is it lends an

02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:30.940
original voice that we've
never heard before to a story

02:02:30.940 --> 02:02:32.720
that we thought we knew.

02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:37.060
&gt;&gt; It opens a window
into 200 years ago.

02:02:37.060 --> 02:02:38.560
What was West Africa like?

02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:42.270
Who were the people who
were on that continent?

02:02:42.270 --> 02:02:45.870
So we begin asking
new questions.

02:02:45.870 --> 02:02:48.020
The questions about the lives

02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:53.010
of those slaves before
they became slaves.

02:02:53.010 --> 02:02:54.310
[ Music ]

02:02:54.310 --> 02:03:01.040
&gt;&gt; My name is Omar Ibn
Said, my birthplace Futa

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:04.140
between the two rivers.

02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:09.000
&gt;&gt; He was born in an area
which was between two rivers,

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.580
probably what is Senegal today.

02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:17.080
And there he grows
up and he studies.

02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:19.820
So he says, "I spent
26 years studying."

02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:21.610
And you say, "Okay,
what was he studying?"

02:03:21.610 --> 02:03:24.580
He doesn't elaborate.

02:03:24.580 --> 02:03:27.780
One has to assume that
he went beyond reading

02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:30.130
and writing to doing much more.

02:03:30.130 --> 02:03:36.130
&gt;&gt; Then there came to
our country a big army.

02:03:36.130 --> 02:03:38.210
It killed many people.

02:03:38.210 --> 02:03:42.620
It took me and brought me
to the big sea and sold me

02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:45.430
in the hand of a Christian man.

02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:48.600
&gt;&gt; There was tribal
warfare in the region.

02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:50.210
And he is caught.

02:03:50.210 --> 02:03:53.400
And then he is sold
into slavery.

02:03:53.400 --> 02:04:00.320
He is sold to merchants
who were buying slaves.

02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:07.380
And he is then put on a ship
and he sails for six weeks.

02:04:08.510 --> 02:04:11.040
[ Music ]

02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:14.190
&gt;&gt; He also talked
about his experience

02:04:14.190 --> 02:04:17.360
when he was riding to, making it

02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:22.530
into a place he called
Charles-Town, and being badgered

02:04:22.530 --> 02:04:24.830
and misused and abused.

02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:27.650
To the point that
he had to escape.

02:04:27.650 --> 02:04:29.540
&gt;&gt; So they captured him
and they put him in jail.

02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:34.850
And so he stays there and
he is alone and in a room

02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:36.510
and he begins writing
on the wall.

02:04:36.510 --> 02:04:37.930
He begins writing.

02:04:37.930 --> 02:04:41.120
And he writes in Arabic because
that's the language he knew.

02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:43.740
He could not understand what
people were saying around him.

02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:45.560
&gt;&gt; And they were
curious about this guy

02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:48.000
that wrote this writing.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.390
They thought that Africans
had no culture nor history,

02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:53.690
couldn't read and write.

02:04:53.690 --> 02:04:56.490
Omar Ibn Said dispels that.

02:04:56.490 --> 02:05:00.770
He could read, he could write
and he was very scholarly.

02:05:00.770 --> 02:05:06.520
&gt;&gt; One Friday, a man
came and opened the door

02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:09.420
of the jail and I saw many men.

02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:10.830
The language was Christian.

02:05:10.830 --> 02:05:12.130
They called to me.

02:05:12.130 --> 02:05:14.950
"Is your name not Omar?

02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:16.270
Is it not Said?"

02:05:16.270 --> 02:05:23.530
I did not understand
the Christian language.

02:05:23.530 --> 02:05:28.410
&gt;&gt; He refers to them as
the Owens, and they are --

02:05:28.410 --> 02:05:33.440
one of them turns out to be
the governor of North Carolina.

02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:38.710
And he takes him in and then
he says that they were good men

02:05:38.710 --> 02:05:42.700
who believed in God,
who had a Bible

02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:45.560
and who read to him the Bible.

02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:49.100
&gt;&gt; Anywhere from
25-28% of the population

02:05:49.100 --> 02:05:51.140
that was brought
here were Muslims.

02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:53.430
The same prophets that we find

02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:55.610
in the Koran we find
in the Bible.

02:05:55.610 --> 02:05:59.320
So they were able to intertwine,
interrelate those experiences.

02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:02.770
&gt;&gt; But when he writes
his biography,

02:06:02.770 --> 02:06:07.610
he begins with a
verse from the Koran.

02:06:07.610 --> 02:06:12.180
And the verse from the Koran is
again a very interesting choice.

02:06:12.180 --> 02:06:17.190
It is the verse which
refers to domination,

02:06:17.190 --> 02:06:19.890
which refers to ownership.

02:06:19.890 --> 02:06:23.490
And in Islam, all
ownership belongs to God.

02:06:23.490 --> 02:06:25.310
God is the only owner.

02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:28.240
It can be understood
as a criticism

02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:30.290
of the whole institution
of slavery.

02:06:30.290 --> 02:06:32.890
He does this in a
subtle way of saying,

02:06:32.890 --> 02:06:35.980
"You really have no right
to own another human being."

02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:37.480
&gt;&gt; They robbed the culture.

02:06:37.480 --> 02:06:39.260
They robbed the identity.

02:06:39.260 --> 02:06:42.420
They disconnected
them from family.

02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:45.020
There was no connection.

02:06:45.020 --> 02:06:50.100
&gt;&gt; I reside in a country
because of the great harm.

02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:55.100
The infidels took me
unjustly and sold me.

02:06:55.100 --> 02:07:00.180
&gt;&gt; It's one of those stories
that will always be relevant.

02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:04.180
Today around the world
there are tens of millions

02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:06.360
of people who are enslaved.

02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:10.430
So Omar Ibn Said
humanizes the experience

02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:12.820
of a person in his own words.

02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:16.040
[ Music ]

02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:17.340
&gt;&gt; This is a voice we
had never heard before.

02:07:17.340 --> 02:07:19.540
And these materials
have been out there.

02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:22.080
What other materials exist?

02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:25.030
What other stories
can we help uncover?

02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:27.820
And how can those stories
together help us better

02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:31.050
understand an episode
of our nation's past

02:07:31.050 --> 02:07:34.110
that maybe we don't understand
as thoroughly as we ought to?

02:07:34.110 --> 02:07:37.890
&gt;&gt; There's a lot of insight
that can be pulled out of it

02:07:37.890 --> 02:07:41.100
if people take it not with
bigotry in their heart

02:07:41.100 --> 02:07:44.590
or arrogance in their heart,
but to look for the insight.

02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:47.670
You see concrete, grass
come up out of concrete

02:07:47.670 --> 02:07:49.870
or trees grow by the concrete.

02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:51.170
So out of the concrete

02:07:51.170 --> 02:07:55.710
of enslavement we found positive
Muslim personalities rising up.

02:07:55.710 --> 02:07:57.680
Things will get better,
things will be better.

02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:00.040
And that's what he
represents: hope,

02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:03.510
that things will get better.

02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:16.040
[ Music ]

02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:18.980
&gt;&gt; The manuscript of Omar
Ibn Said signifies the spread

02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:22.480
of knowledge about the African
Muslim community, specifically

02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:24.710
as it relates to the
American slave trade,

02:08:24.710 --> 02:08:26.200
religion and race relations.

02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:27.500
The other aspect

02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:30.560
of the library's collection is
the African Islamic Manuscript

02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:33.110
Collection, a series
containing such documents

02:08:33.110 --> 02:08:35.610
as the visionary
religious Arabic manuscripts

02:08:35.610 --> 02:08:38.780
of Sheik Son-Asi, a mystical
account of the creation

02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:41.850
of the world and of
mankind by Mohammed Dakar.

02:08:41.850 --> 02:08:45.970
And various translations of
the Omar Ibn Said narrative.

02:08:45.970 --> 02:08:49.420
The attainment and dissemination
of all of these required years

02:08:49.420 --> 02:08:52.050
of correspondence between
significant missionaries,

02:08:52.050 --> 02:08:57.050
ethnographers, historians
and scholarly specialists.

02:08:57.050 --> 02:09:00.570
At the core of this company was
Theodore Dwight, a New Yorker,

02:09:00.570 --> 02:09:02.200
abolitionist and founding member

02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:04.930
of the American Ethnological
Society who campaigned

02:09:04.930 --> 02:09:07.740
for a better understanding
and appreciation

02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:09.190
of African Islamic culture.

02:09:09.190 --> 02:09:14.980
&gt;&gt; He was interested in
introducing African culture

02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:21.540
to this country so people will
understand better you know,

02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:24.860
the backgrounds of
the African people

02:09:24.860 --> 02:09:28.720
and not just seeing
them as slaves.

02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:33.650
So he collected a number of
important manuscripts written

02:09:33.650 --> 02:09:37.330
by the slaves of his time.

02:09:37.330 --> 02:09:42.560
And through the help of various
people including two presidents

02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:44.010
of Liberia.

02:09:44.010 --> 02:09:50.700
So you know, therefore we have
now a collection of 42 items.

02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:55.760
And each one is unique
in its own way.

02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:58.650
&gt;&gt; Long before each of Dwight's
pieces could find a permanent

02:09:58.650 --> 02:10:01.130
place in the archives, the
individual documents passed

02:10:01.130 --> 02:10:02.820
through dozens of hands.

02:10:02.820 --> 02:10:04.730
An extensive and
interconnected chain

02:10:04.730 --> 02:10:08.630
of acquisition brought the
collection to its current home.

02:10:08.630 --> 02:10:11.380
Beginning with Theodore Dwight,
the manuscripts first went

02:10:11.380 --> 02:10:13.470
to David Bliss, a
noted missionary,

02:10:13.470 --> 02:10:17.060
founder of the prestigious
American University of Beirut

02:10:17.060 --> 02:10:19.040
and fellow founding
member of AES.

02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:21.600
Shortly after the documents
were returned to Dwight,

02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:23.450
they passed through the
offices of the first

02:10:23.450 --> 02:10:26.850
and second presidents of
Liberia, Joseph Jenkins Roberts

02:10:26.850 --> 02:10:29.020
and Stephen Allen
Benson, respectively.

02:10:29.020 --> 02:10:32.170
After the documents were
given back once again,

02:10:32.170 --> 02:10:34.650
they were studied by
numismatist Helen Wood,

02:10:34.650 --> 02:10:37.040
likely from his home
state of Massachusetts.

02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:41.350
The collection was then given
to Dr. F. M. Musa and Isaac Byrd

02:10:41.350 --> 02:10:45.230
in order to be translated
from Arabic into English.

02:10:45.230 --> 02:10:47.550
After quite a number of years
with them, the papers went

02:10:47.550 --> 02:10:50.180
to accomplished historian
John Franklin Jameson

02:10:50.180 --> 02:10:51.480
in Washington, DC.

02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:53.450
The last known individual

02:10:53.450 --> 02:10:56.440
to have the Omar Ibn Said
manuscript was Derrick Beard,

02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:00.040
a philanthropist and art
collector based in California.

02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:02.880
This process of analyzing,
translating

02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:05.290
and simply appreciating
the collection created a

02:11:05.290 --> 02:11:09.490
comprehensive web of people all
dedicated to scholarly integrity

02:11:09.490 --> 02:11:11.460
and sharing knowledge.

02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:17.220
Finally, in 2002 the full
collection began its journey

02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:18.520
to the library.

02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:25.560
&gt;&gt; The original owner Derrick
Beard was an art collector.

02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:33.950
And he first displayed the
Omar Ibn Said manuscript here

02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:38.330
at the library in
2002 at a symposium.

02:11:38.330 --> 02:11:42.660
So when the materials were
made available at Sotheby's,

02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:47.380
the library decided to acquire
them and use library funding

02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:52.040
to acquire those
manuscripts in 2017.

02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:54.070
[ Music ]

02:11:54.070 --> 02:11:55.370
&gt;&gt; When broken down,

02:11:55.370 --> 02:11:58.250
the library's basic acquisition
process is really only

02:11:58.250 --> 02:11:59.550
five steps.

02:11:59.550 --> 02:12:02.350
Identification, approval
and funding,

02:12:02.350 --> 02:12:06.200
exchange in partnerships,
copyright deposit and purchase.

02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:08.780
But it's not actually
so straightforward.

02:12:08.780 --> 02:12:11.270
&gt;&gt; It sounds like a very
simple thing to say,

02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:14.920
but this is actually a very,

02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:17.780
pretty big project
involving a lot

02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:21.230
of different offices
collaborating together

02:12:21.230 --> 02:12:25.220
over a period of time in
order to achieve that goal

02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:28.830
of eventually presenting
the collection online

02:12:28.830 --> 02:12:30.740
to the general public, to anyone

02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:33.500
who is interested
in looking at it.

02:12:33.500 --> 02:12:37.750
&gt;&gt; While, the mechanism
and infrastructure

02:12:37.750 --> 02:12:41.860
for how we make it
happen may have changed,

02:12:41.860 --> 02:12:45.670
the purpose behind
it is the same.

02:12:45.670 --> 02:12:49.350
Building the collection,
building up a relationship,

02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:51.720
and you do that through
communication.

02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:55.760
And that communication
improves with each generation

02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:58.520
and technology improvements.

02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:02.920
&gt;&gt; The library is a
research institution,

02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:06.220
meaning like we have you
know, millions and millions

02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:08.940
of materials that are
available for scholars.

02:13:08.940 --> 02:13:14.020
But we also have these materials
for education purposes.

02:13:14.020 --> 02:13:16.010
So teachers will
be able to come in

02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:19.550
and use the Omar Ibn Said
collection for their classroom.

02:13:19.550 --> 02:13:23.970
They can use this collection,
design a history class.

02:13:23.970 --> 02:13:29.340
Scholars can come in,
look at these materials

02:13:29.340 --> 02:13:30.640
from a different perspective

02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:33.080
and write their scholarly
papers or publications.

02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:38.330
And the general public can come
and just look at the collection

02:13:38.330 --> 02:13:41.260
and just simply learn
more about the history

02:13:41.260 --> 02:13:44.630
of this country, about slavery.

02:13:44.630 --> 02:13:52.160
Yeah, so you know, definitely
the collection is of great value

02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:56.670
to our people, not just now.

02:13:56.670 --> 02:13:59.920
It's also important for
generations to come.

02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:03.300
&gt;&gt; So what has happened
is this is just one set

02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:04.910
of documents that's added

02:14:04.910 --> 02:14:09.790
to that rich research
field we wanted to explore.

02:14:09.790 --> 02:14:15.890
And it also helps establish
boundaries, or it helps break

02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:19.350
down boundaries among
those disciplines to say

02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:21.520
that they really are
not that separate.

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:23.130
They all begin to meld.

02:14:23.130 --> 02:14:29.210
And the beauty of having access
to a broad array of content is

02:14:29.210 --> 02:14:32.610
that it allows the research
of a scholar, the student,

02:14:32.610 --> 02:14:35.560
to be able to pull these pieces
together, see how they do

02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:38.560
over them, how they
intertwine, how they meld

02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:45.700
and how there is likely no real
strong demarcation among all

02:14:45.700 --> 02:14:47.000
of these disciplines.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.160
&gt;&gt; You have to think about it.

02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:57.740
Theodore Dwight did not put an
emphasis on this manuscript.

02:14:57.740 --> 02:15:00.410
If he did not correspond
with others,

02:15:00.410 --> 02:15:04.570
this manuscript may
not have survived.

02:15:04.570 --> 02:15:10.130
It was his effort to retain,
to keep this manuscript,

02:15:10.130 --> 02:15:14.050
to bring in other scholars
to write about, to translate,

02:15:14.050 --> 02:15:18.380
to communicate and to
retain this collection.

02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:23.030
That made it possible for the
manuscript in a way to survive.

02:15:23.030 --> 02:15:27.000
And so as you see
there are the creators,

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.980
the one who has actually written
the manuscript, Omar Ibn Said.

02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:33.250
And then there are the enablers

02:15:33.250 --> 02:15:37.090
who enable those
materials to be made public.

02:15:37.090 --> 02:15:41.220
And the Library of Congress
is doing the same thing

02:15:41.220 --> 02:15:45.060
by creating a website making
these materials available.

02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:49.190
We enable the learning process

02:15:49.190 --> 02:15:55.510
about the society,
about Omar Ibn Said.

02:15:55.510 --> 02:16:02.060
[ Music ]

02:16:02.060 --> 02:16:03.970
&gt;&gt; Before an artifact
can go on display,

02:16:03.970 --> 02:16:06.400
it must go through a
lengthy conservation process

02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:08.310
that ensures the
artifacts can be enjoyed

02:16:08.310 --> 02:16:10.100
for generations to come.

02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:12.580
Before anything can happen,
the departments involved

02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:15.870
in preservation and presentation
get together and decide

02:16:15.870 --> 02:16:18.320
which artifacts are the
top of their priorities

02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:20.310
and how feasible
each project is.

02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:23.030
After an artifact is
given the green light,

02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:24.360
it heads to conservation

02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:27.340
where it undergoes intense
inspection and repair.

02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:30.000
Shelly Smith, head of book
conservation at the Library

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:33.510
of Congress, and Sylvia Albro,
senior paper conservator,

02:16:33.510 --> 02:16:36.330
talk to us about the
conservation process.

02:16:36.330 --> 02:16:41.520
&gt;&gt; Broadly, we treat
the collections

02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:42.880
of the Library of Congress.

02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:49.060
We make sure that they are well
cared for, that they are stored

02:16:49.060 --> 02:16:54.830
and housed properly, that
they can be accessed and used

02:16:54.830 --> 02:16:58.500
by researchers and
scholars and visitors.

02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:00.980
&gt;&gt; The conservators told us
about how they get to interact

02:17:00.980 --> 02:17:03.490
with artifacts in unique
ways in order to learn more

02:17:03.490 --> 02:17:06.360
about the historical
context of the documents.

02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:11.750
&gt;&gt; Well, I think that items
have layers and stories to tell.

02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:14.640
And there's their
immediate appearance,

02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:16.260
there's what's written
in the text

02:17:16.260 --> 02:17:17.900
in the case of a manuscript.

02:17:17.900 --> 02:17:21.390
But there's also what
it's composed of,

02:17:21.390 --> 02:17:25.170
how it was designed,
how it was put together.

02:17:25.170 --> 02:17:26.700
It all means something.

02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:29.480
And so you can tell
a different story

02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:31.540
with the technical information

02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:34.400
than necessarily what's
written in the text.

02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:36.900
&gt;&gt; Looking at the Omar
Ibn Said documents,

02:17:36.900 --> 02:17:39.210
the conservators were
able to analyze the paper

02:17:39.210 --> 02:17:40.620
that allowed them
to make predictions

02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:42.990
about the origins
of the document.

02:17:42.990 --> 02:17:45.980
The original autobiography was
written with iron gall ink.

02:17:45.980 --> 02:17:49.610
This ink is known for its
rich color and durability.

02:17:49.610 --> 02:17:51.250
It's created by a
chemical reaction

02:17:51.250 --> 02:17:54.000
between tanic acid
and iron sulfate.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.580
This causes the tanic acid
to produce a dark color

02:17:56.580 --> 02:17:57.950
when exposed to oxygen.

02:17:57.950 --> 02:18:01.770
Tanic acid is found in galls
which are growths on an oak tree

02:18:01.770 --> 02:18:03.070
in response to parasites.

02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:06.200
To extract the acid,
the galls are crushed,

02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:09.010
boiled or chemically
fermented using mold.

02:18:09.010 --> 02:18:11.780
The fermentation method will
result in the blackest ink

02:18:11.780 --> 02:18:13.080
but takes the longest.

02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:15.820
Because of the acidic
nature, the ink is known

02:18:15.820 --> 02:18:19.160
to be fairly corrosive over
time and prone to color changes.

02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:21.810
The conservators found the
ink had not corroded much

02:18:21.810 --> 02:18:25.540
of the paper so it was likely
of a very high quality.

02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:29.680
&gt;&gt; We try as much as possible
in conservation to be sure

02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:33.740
that what we do doesn't
unalterably change something.

02:18:33.740 --> 02:18:40.820
But sometimes it is necessary
to attempt a treatment procedure

02:18:40.820 --> 02:18:42.150
that has the potential --

02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:43.450
there's always a chance

02:18:43.450 --> 02:18:45.660
that something unexpected
could happen.

02:18:45.660 --> 02:18:50.210
And it involves affair amount
of guts to be able to go through

02:18:50.210 --> 02:18:54.080
and say test and test and
test but then put a piece

02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:55.780
of paper in a bath of water.

02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:58.280
You just have to jump in.

02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:00.050
&gt;&gt; The conservators
have to be very careful

02:19:00.050 --> 02:19:02.050
when interacting
with the documents.

02:19:02.050 --> 02:19:04.560
They made it clear that their
purpose is to make the documents

02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:08.100
as accessible as possible while
maintaining its integrity.

02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:10.870
After conservation has finished
their work on the artifacts,

02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:12.660
they are sent to
the digitization lab

02:19:12.660 --> 02:19:15.440
where they are photographed
and prepared to be put online.

02:19:15.440 --> 02:19:19.380
&gt;&gt; We are responsible
for digitizing items

02:19:19.380 --> 02:19:22.500
from the Cultural
Heritage Collections

02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:26.990
to make them available
online so that people

02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:30.290
around the world can see them.

02:19:30.290 --> 02:19:32.340
&gt;&gt; The lab has a variety
of equipment in order

02:19:32.340 --> 02:19:34.290
to present the artifacts
with the best lighting

02:19:34.290 --> 02:19:36.830
and most accurate
quality available.

02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:39.670
Their equipment ensures that
the files accessible online are

02:19:39.670 --> 02:19:43.280
accurate in replicating what the
documents may be like in person.

02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:48.190
&gt;&gt; New color checker, because
our job is to capture items

02:19:48.190 --> 02:19:51.110
at true to color form.

02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:53.990
Color accuracy is
very important.

02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:57.510
So each color swatch
here has an end point

02:19:57.510 --> 02:20:02.810
which is a number value that we
try to set up the camera toward.

02:20:02.810 --> 02:20:05.750
&gt;&gt; Similar to conservation, the
lab has to be very careful not

02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:08.370
to damage any documents, so
they use special machinery

02:20:08.370 --> 02:20:11.120
to handle them and get
the best picture possible.

02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:14.070
This is the rare book
modulator that has a scanner

02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:16.380
which holds pages flat,
pressed against the glass.

02:20:16.380 --> 02:20:18.470
But the table underneath
the glass moves

02:20:18.470 --> 02:20:20.950
in such a precise manner
that the glass is able

02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:22.290
to apply little to no pressure

02:20:22.290 --> 02:20:24.820
on the book itself,
reducing any damage.

02:20:24.820 --> 02:20:27.340
&gt;&gt; The Omar Ibn Said
documents were so old

02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:28.940
that the digitization
process had

02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:30.960
to take place inside
the conservation lab

02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:32.260
to avoid any damage.

02:20:32.260 --> 02:20:35.840
The library works to ensure
that all artifacts remain intact

02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:38.550
so that they're accessible to
scholars and the general public.

02:20:38.550 --> 02:20:41.320
&gt;&gt; A lot of scholars
and researchers,

02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:44.230
a lot can't come
here to the library.

02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:47.820
And we have a lot of things
here, one of a kind things

02:20:47.820 --> 02:20:53.120
that given -- sometimes
the fragility

02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:56.360
of an item determines
whether it can be served

02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:57.660
to the public or not.

02:20:57.660 --> 02:21:01.070
&gt;&gt; After digitization, the
artifacts are posted online

02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:03.470
for scholars and the
general public to view.

02:21:03.470 --> 02:21:05.900
The library uses a
technique called metadata

02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:08.100
to attach keywords
to various artifacts

02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:10.890
so that anyone can search for a
topic on the library's website.

02:21:10.890 --> 02:21:13.080
&gt;&gt; Some of the things
that we've handled

02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:18.160
in the past are top treasure
items here at the library,

02:21:18.160 --> 02:21:21.930
such as documents like
in the US, for example.

02:21:21.930 --> 02:21:25.420
Which would entail the rough
draft of the Declaration

02:21:25.420 --> 02:21:30.610
of Independence,
Gettysburg address and so on.

02:21:30.610 --> 02:21:33.990
&gt;&gt; To bring out something
that's so iconic

02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:36.300
and see people's reaction to it

02:21:36.300 --> 02:21:40.020
and see them interact
with history.

02:21:40.020 --> 02:21:45.540
And there's something that's
so immediate and intimate

02:21:45.540 --> 02:21:51.450
about a person seeing
a document that is

02:21:51.450 --> 02:21:54.570
so much a part of
our American life.

02:21:54.570 --> 02:21:57.220
&gt;&gt; No matter whether it's the
Declaration of Independence

02:21:57.220 --> 02:21:59.740
or the Omar Ibn Said
manuscripts,

02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:02.100
the Library of Congress
is filled with artifacts

02:22:02.100 --> 02:22:03.910
which are each a
piece in the puzzle

02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:05.700
of America's rich history.

02:22:05.700 --> 02:22:07.890
Today you saw an inside
look at the process

02:22:07.890 --> 02:22:10.810
through which these artifacts
are preserved for scholars,

02:22:10.810 --> 02:22:15.510
researchers and the general
public for generations to come.

02:22:15.510 --> 02:23:34.500
[ Music ]

02:23:40.510 --> 02:23:51.040
[ Music ]

02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:54.960
&gt;&gt; Omar Ibn Said was a wealthy
Islamic scholar who was born

02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:58.760
and educated in an African
region then called Utatolo.

02:23:58.760 --> 02:24:02.540
He was born in the late
1700's and received 25 years

02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:04.250
of schooling in Africa.

02:24:04.250 --> 02:24:08.310
He studied in Bundu under his
brother Sheik Mohammed Said.

02:24:08.310 --> 02:24:11.000
Said was mostly known for
his Arabic autobiography.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.930
Despite his inability
to speak English,

02:24:13.930 --> 02:24:18.190
his autobiography describes how
he was captured by a great army

02:24:18.190 --> 02:24:19.780
and placed on a great
ship headed

02:24:19.780 --> 02:24:21.080
to Charleston, South Carolina.

02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:24.330
Almost half of all enslaved
Africans were brought

02:24:24.330 --> 02:24:25.720
to Charleston before being sold.

02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:30.880
Said managed to escape his cruel
master and fled to Fayetteville,

02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:33.060
North Carolina where
he was recaptured

02:24:33.060 --> 02:24:34.750
and sent to a prison camp.

02:24:34.750 --> 02:24:37.190
Omar Ibn Said was discovered
and eventually taken

02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:40.150
into the household of
Jim Owen and John Owen

02:24:40.150 --> 02:24:43.370
who was the governor of
North Carolina at that time.

02:24:43.370 --> 02:24:47.110
He remained with the Owens
until his death in 1854.

02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:48.520
He became the first known slave

02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:51.480
to write an autobiography
in Arabic in the US.

02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:55.830
His manuscripts show a long
tradition of written culture

02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:58.140
in Africa at that time.

02:24:58.140 --> 02:25:01.400
They also provide a tremendous
tool for research on Africa

02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:05.350
in the 18th and 19th century.

02:25:05.350 --> 02:25:09.670
&gt;&gt; We wanted to know what
the process was coming

02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:11.870
from Muslim countries
to America.

02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:13.480
When did it start?

02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:17.950
And the earliest we could trace
it back to was from Africa.

02:25:17.950 --> 02:25:20.660
It was Muslims from
Africa who came

02:25:20.660 --> 02:25:25.840
who were the first
Muslims in America.

02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:30.820
And so we invited
different professors

02:25:30.820 --> 02:25:36.210
to cover this conference
on Muslims in America.

02:25:36.210 --> 02:25:41.230
And so we had Sylviane
Diuof from Senegal who came.

02:25:41.230 --> 02:25:45.120
She's actually one of
the writers in this book.

02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:49.170
We had Derrick Beard who came

02:25:49.170 --> 02:25:52.030
and say a few words,
and I love him.

02:25:52.030 --> 02:25:55.310
And then we had professors
from Asia, Pakistan,

02:25:55.310 --> 02:25:57.260
who talked about
the Asian migration.

02:25:57.260 --> 02:25:59.340
We had professors
from the Middle East.

02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:03.020
We spoke about Muslims from
the Middle East coming.

02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:07.490
But the earliest
were from Africa

02:26:07.490 --> 02:26:09.720
and Derrick Beard
was a collector.

02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:12.680
He was not a scholar,
but a collector.

02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:18.960
And he owned the
manuscript of Omar Ibn Said.

02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:21.110
He was the owner.

02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:25.430
And he said he had found it,
he had purchased it and it was

02:26:25.430 --> 02:26:27.760
in his collection, his
family's collection.

02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:31.560
And that was 2002.

02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:34.920
And when he talked about
it and he displayed it

02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:38.700
for all the people who had come
to the conference, he said,

02:26:38.700 --> 02:26:41.210
"It should be here at
the Library of Congress.

02:26:41.210 --> 02:26:43.610
It should be part of the
library's collections."

02:26:43.610 --> 02:26:45.720
And we all said, "Yes,
of course it should be."

02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:50.330
But at that point he was not
selling and we were not buying.

02:26:50.330 --> 02:26:54.760
But that's how we
found out it existed.

02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:58.820
&gt;&gt; It provided historical
information

02:26:58.820 --> 02:27:05.040
and cultural information about
the existence of Africans

02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:07.520
who came here enslaved.

02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:10.890
And they were Muslims.

02:27:10.890 --> 02:27:16.040
You don't really hear
much, at least I didn't

02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:26.440
when I was growing up, about
the Muslim contributions

02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:27.840
in the United States.

02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:33.760
We're still learning
more about Omar Ibn Said

02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:37.810
because he wrote his
own autobiography.

02:27:37.810 --> 02:27:43.930
And when we talk about
enslaved Africans here

02:27:43.930 --> 02:27:47.200
and what they contributed
to the United States,

02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:56.020
you don't really realize
who individuals were.

02:27:56.020 --> 02:28:03.620
And we learned a lot just from
this one man, and a little bit

02:28:03.620 --> 02:28:08.360
about his life in the past.

02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:16.400
But we have other histories that
are being researched and found

02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:21.810
and we get more information.

02:28:21.810 --> 02:28:24.660
And I thought that
was very important.

02:28:24.660 --> 02:28:28.830
&gt;&gt; In 2017, Derrick
Beard, the previous owner

02:28:28.830 --> 02:28:31.290
of the manuscripts, reached
out to the Library of Congress

02:28:31.290 --> 02:28:33.570
to inform them of
his declining health.

02:28:33.570 --> 02:28:36.040
He also informed them
of his willingness

02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:38.340
to sell his Oma Ibn Collection

02:28:38.340 --> 02:28:41.600
to the well-known auction
house Sotheby's located

02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:43.290
in London, England.

02:28:43.290 --> 02:28:48.250
&gt;&gt; All these materials
were in fact in England.

02:28:48.250 --> 02:28:54.100
And so they were then shipped
to us here in a big, big crate.

02:28:54.100 --> 02:28:58.310
I mean, it was a huge crate of
wood with metal all wrapped up.

02:28:58.310 --> 02:29:03.650
And we had screws on the box.

02:29:03.650 --> 02:29:09.980
And it arrived to great fanfare
to Washington and we took one

02:29:09.980 --> 02:29:14.130
of the major rooms here
next to us in Rare Books

02:29:14.130 --> 02:29:15.470
which is a beautiful room.

02:29:15.470 --> 02:29:19.300
And everybody gathered,
25 chiefs, directors,

02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:23.320
important people from
around the library.

02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:28.690
Everybody came and we
started unscrewing the box.

02:29:28.690 --> 02:29:30.560
And people were taking turns

02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:33.910
and they were taking
photographs and so on.

02:29:33.910 --> 02:29:37.230
And this is how it arrived.

02:29:37.230 --> 02:29:39.850
&gt;&gt; Before the library
acquired these manuscripts,

02:29:39.850 --> 02:29:43.480
Derrick Beard traveled to many
places granting various academic

02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:45.910
institutions, art
galleries, museums

02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:48.180
and even historians
an opportunity

02:29:48.180 --> 02:29:49.800
to examine the documents.

02:29:49.800 --> 02:29:51.490
&gt;&gt; We are called the
Library of Congress

02:29:51.490 --> 02:29:53.330
and of course this
is how it started.

02:29:53.330 --> 02:29:57.330
But we are also the National
Library of the United States.

02:29:57.330 --> 02:30:04.030
So to have this here means
that A, it was purchased

02:30:04.030 --> 02:30:06.300
with taxpayers' dollars.

02:30:06.300 --> 02:30:09.980
It was purchased by Americans.

02:30:09.980 --> 02:30:11.280
It is America money.

02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:13.440
It is not a private
collector's money.

02:30:13.440 --> 02:30:16.580
It is the money coming
from our tax dollars

02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:18.940
that purchased this manuscript.

02:30:18.940 --> 02:30:21.740
And it is available for every
American to come and see

02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:25.000
and to use and to do research.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:28.180
&gt;&gt; Mr. Beard granted a Yale
professor the permission

02:30:28.180 --> 02:30:30.740
to make copies of
the autobiography

02:30:30.740 --> 02:30:34.060
and publish a book titled,
A Muslim American Slave,

02:30:34.060 --> 02:30:36.470
the Life of Omar Ibn Said.

02:30:36.470 --> 02:30:39.960
&gt;&gt; In Islam, all
ownership belongs to God.

02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:43.070
Only God is an owner.

02:30:43.070 --> 02:30:45.140
No one owns anything.

02:30:45.140 --> 02:30:48.450
We come, we live
and then we die.

02:30:48.450 --> 02:30:51.140
We really are not owners.

02:30:51.140 --> 02:30:54.210
But why does he start his
biography with [inaudible]?

02:30:54.210 --> 02:31:00.210
Really, he is telling the
people that ownership is God's.

02:31:00.210 --> 02:31:01.510
It's not yours.

02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:04.790
You have no right to
own and certainly not

02:31:04.790 --> 02:31:07.450
to own another human being.

02:31:07.450 --> 02:31:10.160
So what I am simply
saying here is

02:31:10.160 --> 02:31:14.430
that Omar Ibn Said's
autobiography opens up a world.

02:31:14.430 --> 02:31:17.850
A world we are looking at,

02:31:17.850 --> 02:31:21.910
a history which has really
not been written yet.

02:31:21.910 --> 02:31:26.550
There is so much that
can be discovered

02:31:26.550 --> 02:31:30.250
from existing manuscripts
in Africa, okay?

02:31:30.250 --> 02:31:31.840
This one was written here.

02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:34.530
However, he comes from a
long tradition of those

02:31:34.530 --> 02:31:36.630
who wrote manuscripts there.

02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:41.820
See? So Senegal has a large
collection of manuscripts.

02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:44.260
Mali has a wonderful
collection of manuscripts.

02:31:44.260 --> 02:31:50.050
Nigeria is enormously
rich with manuscripts.

02:31:50.050 --> 02:31:53.820
And those manuscripts are
about everything from medicine

02:31:53.820 --> 02:31:59.700
to the stars, astronomy
and cosmology, to culture,

02:31:59.700 --> 02:32:06.500
traditions, food,
anything you want.

02:32:06.500 --> 02:32:09.200
They need to be preserved.

02:32:09.200 --> 02:32:13.540
So in a way Omar Ibn
Said is leading the way

02:32:13.540 --> 02:32:17.780
and taking us back to
West Africa and saying,

02:32:17.780 --> 02:32:23.660
"I'm bringing you this, but
look at what my ancestors did

02:32:23.660 --> 02:32:26.770
and what they wrote and
what they contributed."

02:32:26.770 --> 02:32:29.560
And those things need
to be preserved as well.

02:32:29.560 --> 02:32:33.560
We need to go back and we need
to go to Nigeria, we need to go

02:32:33.560 --> 02:32:35.780
to Mali, we need
to go everywhere.

02:32:35.780 --> 02:32:38.300
And we need to digitize
these manuscripts.

02:32:38.300 --> 02:32:44.590
&gt;&gt; You know, it reveals a lot
about, like we said earlier,

02:32:44.590 --> 02:32:48.740
the history and the culture of
the two continents which are

02:32:48.740 --> 02:32:52.630
so far apart and yet they
are being brought together

02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:53.930
by this man.

02:32:53.930 --> 02:32:58.410
And so when we're looking at
history, studying history,

02:32:58.410 --> 02:33:01.340
American history, we actually
also have to look at the rest

02:33:01.340 --> 02:33:03.590
of the world because
we're all connected.

02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:07.920
So to me that's the
importance of this collection.

02:33:07.920 --> 02:33:11.770
And so I'm very excited to be
able to work with all the items

02:33:11.770 --> 02:33:13.870
and make sure they
are properly digitized

02:33:13.870 --> 02:33:18.080
and make sure they are
presented on our website

02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:21.680
so more people will be
able to access them.

02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:25.190
&gt;&gt; In July of 2018, Derrick
Beard sadly passed away.

02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:27.990
But with the help of the Library
of Congress, they've continued

02:33:27.990 --> 02:33:31.160
to preserve the story of
Omar Ibn Said with the help

02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:33.120
of their conservation team.

02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:35.550
Since the acquisition
of these manuscripts,

02:33:35.550 --> 02:33:37.610
they've made a replica
of these documents

02:33:37.610 --> 02:33:41.140
which maintains its authentic
texture and appearance.

02:33:41.140 --> 02:33:42.900
&gt;&gt; So we use a device
similar to these,

02:33:42.900 --> 02:33:45.860
but we hand carry a camera
to the conservation division

02:33:45.860 --> 02:33:49.380
and that's what we have done
to do the Omar Said papers.

02:33:49.380 --> 02:33:51.470
They were done on-site
in conservation

02:33:51.470 --> 02:33:52.790
because they couldn't travel

02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:55.010
to this building
given their fragility

02:33:55.010 --> 02:33:56.790
and conditions that
they were in.

02:33:56.790 --> 02:33:59.420
So as conservation
was treating those,

02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:01.920
they would quickly call us and
say, "Hey, we have 10 ready."

02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:04.560
We'd go over and shoot
them and create the files.

02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:08.730
The handling was done by
them on-site and we would set

02:34:08.730 --> 02:34:11.980
up our camera and shoot
right there on the premises.

02:34:11.980 --> 02:34:15.900
So as we had ten documents
or maybe 20 ready to go,

02:34:15.900 --> 02:34:19.140
I'd say within an hour
to two hours we were able

02:34:19.140 --> 02:34:23.430
to capture all of them
from front to back.

02:34:23.430 --> 02:34:25.900
And so you have the
digitization side,

02:34:25.900 --> 02:34:27.460
because it's all
instant capture,

02:34:27.460 --> 02:34:30.800
our newest technology
is very, very fast now.

02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:33.530
So the handling of the item
could take a lot longer

02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:37.030
than the actual capturing
process.

02:34:37.030 --> 02:34:39.040
[ Inaudible ]

02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:40.340
And it does in this case.

02:34:40.340 --> 02:34:42.170
What we tried to
do is salvage it

02:34:42.170 --> 02:34:49.140
by getting really good digital
files, and later historians

02:34:49.140 --> 02:34:52.250
or whoever can take those
images and work with them

02:34:52.250 --> 02:34:55.010
on their end using Photoshop

02:34:55.010 --> 02:34:57.620
to reestablish what the
colors might have been.

02:34:57.620 --> 02:35:00.690
So there's a lot of that that
goes on outside of our realm.

02:35:00.690 --> 02:35:02.310
This is why it's very
important to send them

02:35:02.310 --> 02:35:04.470
up to a color checker
like I showed you.

02:35:04.470 --> 02:35:07.770
Because that ensures that you're
getting the color accuracy

02:35:07.770 --> 02:35:09.310
in today's color.

02:35:09.310 --> 02:35:12.000
But it can be recreated
based on those numbers

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:13.580
that we achieve on
those targets.

02:35:13.580 --> 02:35:17.770
The life cycle of our
technology runs about ten years.

02:35:17.770 --> 02:35:21.140
So up until ten years ago
we were using old limier

02:35:21.140 --> 02:35:23.360
technology, which
doing a newspaper

02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:25.440
like you just saw
would be a pass

02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:28.930
of about 5-7 minutes per sheet.

02:35:28.930 --> 02:35:30.230
Today it's two seconds.

02:35:30.230 --> 02:35:31.530
&gt;&gt; Right.

02:35:31.530 --> 02:35:35.040
&gt;&gt; With no compromising quality
or anything of that nature.

02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:39.340
&gt;&gt; It can cause endless
discussion amongst researchers

02:35:39.340 --> 02:35:42.640
when someone says, "I think
this is in this person's hand."

02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:44.430
And someone may disagree
and think

02:35:44.430 --> 02:35:46.390
that it looks more
like another person.

02:35:46.390 --> 02:35:50.620
But when you've got a manuscript
like this that has the main body

02:35:50.620 --> 02:35:53.520
of the manuscript but then
it clearly has marginality

02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:55.890
that has been written by
someone else, it has pagination

02:35:55.890 --> 02:35:57.290
that may have been
written by someone else,

02:35:57.290 --> 02:35:58.950
it has a cover that's
been added that has

02:35:58.950 --> 02:36:02.920
yet another style of hand on it.

02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:06.520
It's educated guesses
based on evidence.

02:36:06.520 --> 02:36:09.350
And the more data points
you have, the better.

02:36:09.350 --> 02:36:11.890
So the more examples that
you have, the better.

02:36:11.890 --> 02:36:19.330
But mostly it is just
a good -- absolutely.

02:36:19.330 --> 02:36:21.600
&gt;&gt; In addition to
-- you see a lot

02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:24.240
of microscope difference
between inks.

02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:25.540
&gt;&gt; Right.

02:36:25.540 --> 02:36:29.080
&gt;&gt; And you can see a lot of UV.

02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:33.350
And we also have infrared
photography that we can apply,

02:36:33.350 --> 02:36:35.940
and that's very useful
if somebody's tried

02:36:35.940 --> 02:36:38.990
to make a correction
in the script.

02:36:38.990 --> 02:36:40.290
&gt;&gt; Right.

02:36:40.290 --> 02:36:43.280
&gt;&gt; You can usually see a
difference in one of those kinds

02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:47.040
of lighting conditions.

02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:49.060
[ Music ]

02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:53.620
&gt;&gt; Abolitionist people, they
were studying these cultures

02:36:53.620 --> 02:36:57.310
in West Africa because
they became convinced

02:36:57.310 --> 02:37:02.870
that the only way of stopping
the slave trade was having the

02:37:02.870 --> 02:37:06.970
Muslim cultures intervene.

02:37:06.970 --> 02:37:12.720
So this book is his writing
of his meeting of a lot

02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:16.100
of different people's
journeys into West Africa.

02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:18.960
Think how large that could be.

02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:20.850
So all these different
people's journeys

02:37:20.850 --> 02:37:22.400
and what they discovered.

02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:25.250
And he comes to a conclusion
at the end of his book:

02:37:25.250 --> 02:37:28.290
the only way that
we're going to be able

02:37:28.290 --> 02:37:30.980
to really say something
meaningful

02:37:30.980 --> 02:37:36.420
about these cultures is
if we learn the language

02:37:36.420 --> 02:37:42.100
and live there for a
substantial period of time.

02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:46.520
&gt;&gt; So my background is in
literature and language.

02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:50.510
So I was very interested
in the African story

02:37:50.510 --> 02:37:57.010
about how this is the only known
slave narrative that was written

02:37:57.010 --> 02:38:01.180
by a slave who was in
captivity in Arabic.

02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:06.170
So I was very interested
in that aspect and the kind

02:38:06.170 --> 02:38:14.450
of authenticity that went to the
manuscript and also the kinds

02:38:14.450 --> 02:38:16.910
of questions that that
raised about others like him,

02:38:16.910 --> 02:38:21.660
about Arabic speakers who
were slave sand their stories.

02:38:21.660 --> 02:38:24.910
So that was one of
my access points.

02:38:24.910 --> 02:38:31.560
And I think also just
the nuance that it added

02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:36.030
to my understanding or my
learning about American slavery,

02:38:36.030 --> 02:38:38.230
I think that was
also interesting.

02:38:38.230 --> 02:38:40.720
Because I had not
heard about him.

02:38:40.720 --> 02:38:44.710
I didn't know a lot
about the history

02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:47.760
of Muslim slaves in America.

02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:53.080
So I think you know, for me
it was good to be exposed

02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:55.030
to something that I
didn't know anything about.

02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:58.860
And frankly now I really feel
like I should learn more.

02:38:58.860 --> 02:39:02.500
And like I said, I'm going
back to kind of being proud

02:39:02.500 --> 02:39:06.260
of the institution,
being proud to work here.

02:39:06.260 --> 02:39:09.580
Because I think that
it's wonderful

02:39:09.580 --> 02:39:16.400
to present another voice
and present another example.

02:39:16.400 --> 02:39:23.550
And to really show diverse
voices, even diversity

02:39:23.550 --> 02:39:25.910
within diversity, so to speak.

02:39:25.910 --> 02:39:33.690
So my hope is that bringing
this collection forward,

02:39:33.690 --> 02:39:40.920
that many people who perhaps
had never heard of the Library

02:39:40.920 --> 02:39:43.580
of Congress or had never been
to the Library of Congress

02:39:43.580 --> 02:39:47.080
or had never used it for
research will be able

02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:52.840
to in some ways see themselves
here and be able to see

02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:56.780
that there is a value in
history, in their history.

02:39:56.780 --> 02:40:01.460
And will be encouraged
to come here or go online

02:40:01.460 --> 02:40:04.670
and further their own research,
whether that's, like I said,

02:40:04.670 --> 02:40:06.670
for their academic
projects or even

02:40:06.670 --> 02:40:09.720
for their personal research.

02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:14.670
So I really hope that they
can also see the value

02:40:14.670 --> 02:40:15.970
in their own stories.

02:40:15.970 --> 02:40:18.980
&gt;&gt; Throughout the process of
creating this film, my peers

02:40:18.980 --> 02:40:20.280
and I gained a wealth

02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:21.870
of knowledge concerning
the Islamic background

02:40:21.870 --> 02:40:24.280
of many Africans
enslaved in America.

02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:26.330
These were human beings who
were treated as animals.

02:40:26.330 --> 02:40:29.370
Human beings with their own
rich culture, set of beliefs,

02:40:29.370 --> 02:40:31.220
way of life and families.

02:40:31.220 --> 02:40:32.520
It is our hope that
the publishing

02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:34.090
of this document will
help change the perception

02:40:34.090 --> 02:40:37.510
of Islam's history in America.

02:40:37.510 --> 02:41:09.090
[ Music ]

02:41:09.090 --> 02:41:12.730
&gt;&gt; Leanne Potter: All
right, so we actually --

02:41:12.730 --> 02:41:16.700
look at this, we've
got 15 minutes.

02:41:16.700 --> 02:41:20.290
We can ask questions, you
can go to the bathroom.

02:41:20.290 --> 02:41:22.430
You can do whatever
you need to do.

02:41:22.430 --> 02:41:24.300
We're going to get the
other panel started

02:41:24.300 --> 02:41:25.610
in about 15 minutes.

02:41:25.610 --> 02:41:27.320
But I really would love
it if you'd stick around,

02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:30.920
and if you have some questions

02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:34.450
for our young documentary
filmmakers,

02:41:34.450 --> 02:41:40.070
I hope you'll take advantage
of this chance to talk to them.

02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:42.770
And I really need
to give a shout-out

02:41:42.770 --> 02:41:44.940
to all of my colleagues.

02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:50.990
I had no idea you were
extraordinary film talents.

02:41:50.990 --> 02:41:52.290
That was great fun.

02:41:52.290 --> 02:41:53.590
Those of you who were
not pictured in the film,

02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:54.890
look around, chances are
good you're sitting next

02:41:54.890 --> 02:41:56.190
to somebody who was.

02:41:56.190 --> 02:41:57.490
Really awesome.

02:41:57.490 --> 02:41:58.790
All right.

02:41:58.790 --> 02:42:00.090
So questions?

02:42:00.090 --> 02:42:01.390
Yeah? Here's a question,
two things.

02:42:01.390 --> 02:42:04.110
&gt;&gt; My question is, have any of
your ideas about history changed

02:42:04.110 --> 02:42:08.380
in the process of
doing your work?

02:42:08.380 --> 02:42:11.160
&gt;&gt; Student: So I
can answer that.

02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:13.930
At least for me, I
really was able to look

02:42:13.930 --> 02:42:15.230
at history in a different way.

02:42:15.230 --> 02:42:20.840
You know, usually we learn
history through textbook pages,

02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:25.400
maybe through some films in
class, a lot of lectures.

02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:28.820
I would say this is the first
time I was able to learn history

02:42:28.820 --> 02:42:32.970
in this kind of way and really
feel like connected to Omar.

02:42:32.970 --> 02:42:34.580
It wasn't just reading pages.

02:42:34.580 --> 02:42:38.790
I was so passionate about it
and it was really interesting

02:42:38.790 --> 02:42:43.290
to be kind of so involved
with the history itself.

02:42:43.290 --> 02:42:47.020
And I feel like we should
try to incorporate that more

02:42:47.020 --> 02:42:49.610
in our classrooms today.

02:42:49.610 --> 02:42:53.100
&gt;&gt; Student: Also, learning
such a personal story,

02:42:53.100 --> 02:42:56.980
it added another layer of depth
to what my prior knowledge was

02:42:56.980 --> 02:42:58.920
about slavery in America.

02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:03.090
Before it was more like you
kind of get a list of facts,

02:43:03.090 --> 02:43:04.920
like various aspects of slavery.

02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:08.620
But rarely did we ever hear a
personal story besides maybe

02:43:08.620 --> 02:43:10.040
Frederick Douglas.

02:43:10.040 --> 02:43:14.090
And so being able to learn and
experience hands-on the life

02:43:14.090 --> 02:43:18.050
of Omar Ibn Said was
really impactful.

02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:23.380
&gt;&gt; Leanne Potter:
Other questions?

02:43:24.500 --> 02:43:25.800
Yeah, Jane.

02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:28.460
And actually, Davon, you
guys, come on up as well.

02:43:28.460 --> 02:43:30.740
We'll pull up chairs
and pass the mics.

02:43:30.740 --> 02:43:34.210
That was a good question,
by the way, wasn't it?

02:43:34.210 --> 02:43:35.510
All right.

02:43:35.510 --> 02:43:36.810
Jane.

02:43:36.810 --> 02:43:38.110
&gt;&gt; A practical question
which is, are you going

02:43:38.110 --> 02:43:44.670
to post your videos online so
that we can watch them again?

02:43:44.670 --> 02:43:46.060
&gt;&gt; Student: Yes.

02:43:46.060 --> 02:43:47.360
Yes.

02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:50.490
&gt;&gt; Is that coming up soon
or are they already online?

02:43:50.490 --> 02:43:53.490
&gt;&gt; Student: So our video
is on YouTube, correct?

02:43:53.490 --> 02:43:54.790
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah.

02:43:54.790 --> 02:43:56.090
&gt;&gt; Okay.

02:43:56.090 --> 02:43:57.390
&gt;&gt; Student: It's on YouTube

02:43:57.390 --> 02:43:58.690
under the Blair Network
Communications Channel.

02:43:58.690 --> 02:43:59.990
&gt;&gt; All right.

02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:01.290
&gt;&gt; Student: And that's
where our full video is.

02:44:01.290 --> 02:44:02.590
&gt;&gt; Wonderful.

02:44:02.590 --> 02:44:03.890
&gt;&gt; Leanne Potter: We will
share that link, definitely.

02:44:03.890 --> 02:44:05.190
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah.

02:44:05.190 --> 02:44:08.940
And also ours is on Richard
Wright PCS on YouTube also.

02:44:08.940 --> 02:44:11.150
&gt;&gt; Leanne Potter: Yes,
and we will share those.

02:44:11.150 --> 02:44:14.830
Awesome. All right,
another question?

02:44:14.830 --> 02:44:17.810
&gt;&gt; We have one over here.

02:44:17.810 --> 02:44:19.110
&gt;&gt; Leanne Potter: Oh good.

02:44:19.110 --> 02:44:20.410
Okay.

02:44:20.410 --> 02:44:21.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

02:44:21.710 --> 02:44:24.910
&gt;&gt; I just want to give you all
a shout-out for a job well done.

02:44:24.910 --> 02:44:30.820
I wanted to ask, what was like
the most difficult part in terms

02:44:30.820 --> 02:44:32.140
of like the production?

02:44:32.140 --> 02:44:35.010
I know the research was like
really, really extensive.

02:44:35.010 --> 02:44:39.140
But in terms of like just
putting together the whole

02:44:39.140 --> 02:44:43.380
entire thing, what was
like the most detailed part

02:44:43.380 --> 02:44:46.610
or the most difficult
part for you?

02:44:46.610 --> 02:44:50.140
&gt;&gt; Student: So filmmaking is an
incredibly complicated process.

02:44:50.140 --> 02:44:52.640
So I want to give a shout-out
to my sister school too.

02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:54.710
You guys were also incredible.

02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:56.010
&gt;&gt; Student: Thank you.

02:44:56.010 --> 02:44:57.310
&gt;&gt; Student: We know
how hard it is

02:44:57.310 --> 02:45:01.220
to put together a really good
film, especially of this length.

02:45:01.220 --> 02:45:05.770
For us it was just a
whole journey of learning

02:45:05.770 --> 02:45:08.680
about something we had no
background knowledge about,

02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:10.230
Omar Ibn Said.

02:45:10.230 --> 02:45:12.540
I was really surprised to hear
a lot of the things I heard,

02:45:12.540 --> 02:45:17.420
including how there was such
a large population of Muslims

02:45:17.420 --> 02:45:18.720
that were brought
to this country.

02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:23.290
I had never heard a voice
from that population before.

02:45:23.290 --> 02:45:27.650
And so the hardest part was
definitely taking this vast

02:45:27.650 --> 02:45:30.070
amount of information
that we had.

02:45:30.070 --> 02:45:32.070
Thank you so much to
everyone at the Library

02:45:32.070 --> 02:45:34.830
that gave us the
opportunity to be exposed

02:45:34.830 --> 02:45:36.130
to all of that information.

02:45:36.130 --> 02:45:41.020
And to put it together into
something that made sense

02:45:41.020 --> 02:45:43.960
and something that really
communicated what we were trying

02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:45.970
to communicate, and going deeper

02:45:45.970 --> 02:45:48.200
than just the facts
to the message.

02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:52.550
So I don't know if that's a
specific thing, but that's kind

02:45:52.550 --> 02:45:54.330
of my favorite part
of filmmaking

02:45:54.330 --> 02:45:55.630
and the most difficult part.

02:45:55.630 --> 02:45:59.180
&gt;&gt; Leanne Potter:
Another question, great.

02:45:59.180 --> 02:46:02.460
&gt;&gt; What was it that
initially enticed you all

02:46:02.460 --> 02:46:05.480
to get involved in this project?

02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:12.990
&gt;&gt; Student: Oh, well I knew
for one that I had never worked

02:46:12.990 --> 02:46:17.770
on a project almost with
an institution rather

02:46:17.770 --> 02:46:19.190
than about an institution.

02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:22.510
In the past, most of
my filmmaking has been

02:46:22.510 --> 02:46:25.260
about emailing like
20-30 people,

02:46:25.260 --> 02:46:27.710
hoping that maybe
two get back to me.

02:46:27.710 --> 02:46:30.260
And with this it was
just given to me.

02:46:30.260 --> 02:46:32.130
I was like, "Oh, we have
all these researchers,

02:46:32.130 --> 02:46:36.360
all these experts here for
you to answer your questions."

02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:39.520
And I was given the
opportunity to explore things.

02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:42.990
Normally I would never
think I would have access

02:46:42.990 --> 02:46:45.750
to the conservation lab,
to the digitization lab.

02:46:45.750 --> 02:46:50.140
So I think what really
interested me was the ability

02:46:50.140 --> 02:46:52.170
to have a hands-on experience.

02:46:52.170 --> 02:46:53.470
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah, same.

02:46:53.470 --> 02:46:54.770
We had the same experience.

02:46:54.770 --> 02:46:56.140
We walked in, they
asked us to do a film.

02:46:56.140 --> 02:46:58.070
It was like, "Wow, let's do it."

02:46:58.070 --> 02:47:00.520
Because it was about
literally someone that none

02:47:00.520 --> 02:47:01.820
of us really knew about.

02:47:01.820 --> 02:47:03.120
I had never heard
of Omar Ibn Said.

02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:04.420
I had never even
heard of him before.

02:47:04.420 --> 02:47:07.920
And just to be at the Library
of Congress, the biggest library

02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:10.220
to learn about Omar
Ibn Said was amazing.

02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:14.360
This is the most fun film
I'll be in in my life.

02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:16.180
Because I'm not really
a history person,

02:47:16.180 --> 02:47:19.160
just to dig into the
history and make it a film,

02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:21.380
this is the first time
I've did it before.

02:47:21.380 --> 02:47:22.680
This is amazing.

02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:26.410
It was a very great experience,
definitely for all of us,

02:47:26.410 --> 02:47:28.720
I can say, we at Richard Wright.

02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:34.950
&gt;&gt; Student: And also to hear
an institution like the Library

02:47:34.950 --> 02:47:39.320
of Congress come to us
students and say, "We want you

02:47:39.320 --> 02:47:42.230
to do something for us,"
was kind of like, "Wow.

02:47:42.230 --> 02:47:46.550
What?" We've never had
someone so prestigious

02:47:46.550 --> 02:47:50.480
and well-known ask
us young people

02:47:50.480 --> 02:47:52.380
to do something so incredible.

02:47:52.380 --> 02:47:55.010
And we're not used to that.

02:47:55.010 --> 02:47:57.710
I think a lot of people kind
of overlook young people,

02:47:57.710 --> 02:48:00.790
think that we can't
do amazing things.

02:48:00.790 --> 02:48:05.580
So I like really appreciate that
the Library of Congress kind

02:48:05.580 --> 02:48:08.290
of thought about us and
really put their faith in us

02:48:08.290 --> 02:48:10.610
to make a good product.

02:48:10.610 --> 02:48:11.910
&gt;&gt; Student: Definitely.

02:48:11.910 --> 02:48:13.250
Sorry, go ahead.

02:48:13.250 --> 02:48:14.550
Go ahead.

02:48:14.550 --> 02:48:15.850
&gt;&gt; Student: You go
first, go first.

02:48:15.850 --> 02:48:17.150
&gt;&gt; Student: Really?

02:48:17.150 --> 02:48:18.450
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah, you're good.

02:48:18.450 --> 02:48:19.750
&gt;&gt; Student: Is this on?

02:48:19.750 --> 02:48:21.050
Okay. One thing for me
that definitely inspired me

02:48:21.050 --> 02:48:24.310
to do it -- okay, so one, my
stepdad is actually Muslim.

02:48:24.310 --> 02:48:27.750
So he teaches me a lot about
it, so that made me interested.

02:48:27.750 --> 02:48:29.050
And then with the help

02:48:29.050 --> 02:48:30.350
of my school I'll
actually be travelling

02:48:30.350 --> 02:48:32.330
to Africa this summer.

02:48:32.330 --> 02:48:36.990
I'm going to Egypt and Ethiopia.

02:48:36.990 --> 02:48:40.700
And so beyond that and just
learning Arabic and going

02:48:40.700 --> 02:48:45.310
to Africa and having a Muslim
stepdad, that was so much

02:48:45.310 --> 02:48:47.040
around my life that
just dealt with that.

02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:50.240
And I was like, "I need
to get on this project."

02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:52.060
So that's definitely
one of the major things

02:48:52.060 --> 02:48:54.180
that made me want to get on it.

02:48:54.180 --> 02:48:55.480
So go ahead.

02:48:55.480 --> 02:48:56.980
&gt;&gt; Student: I wanted to add
on to what Chauncey said.

02:48:56.980 --> 02:48:59.060
Someone else who
had a ton of faith

02:48:59.060 --> 02:49:02.510
in us was our teacher, Mr. Mayo.

02:49:02.510 --> 02:49:06.130
[ Applause ]

02:49:06.130 --> 02:49:10.420
I know that I definitely --
this was a huge undertaking,

02:49:10.420 --> 02:49:12.240
very daunting for sure.

02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:15.650
And Mr. Mayo from the beginning
has had so much faith in us

02:49:15.650 --> 02:49:18.620
and has been such an amazing
and encouraging teacher.

02:49:18.620 --> 02:49:21.650
That when this opportunity
presented itself,

02:49:21.650 --> 02:49:23.450
we weren't like scared
or nervous.

02:49:23.450 --> 02:49:25.600
We were so incredibly excited.

02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:27.900
So thank you, Mr. Mayo.

02:49:29.510 --> 02:49:32.120
[ Applause ]

02:49:32.120 --> 02:49:35.440
&gt;&gt; Leanne Potter: Okay,
any other questions?

02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:36.740
&gt;&gt; Just a quick one.

02:49:36.740 --> 02:49:39.680
I'm wondering if you all
are familiar with Yaro Mamou

02:49:39.680 --> 02:49:44.230
who was enslaved in Montgomery
County a few years before Omar

02:49:44.230 --> 02:49:45.530
Ibn Said achieved his freedom

02:49:45.530 --> 02:49:50.260
and was pretty much
an Islamic scholar

02:49:50.260 --> 02:49:53.040
in the same mold
as Omar Ibn Said.

02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:57.240
It might be interesting
to do a comparison study.

02:49:57.240 --> 02:49:59.580
&gt;&gt; Student: We're not
familiar with that story,

02:49:59.580 --> 02:50:01.840
but that sounds really
interesting.

02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:03.140
&gt;&gt; Student: Yeah.

02:50:03.140 --> 02:50:04.440
&gt;&gt; Student: No, I haven't
heard of it either.

02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:05.740
I've never heard of this person.

02:50:05.740 --> 02:50:09.450
You know, every day we find out
new not only African American

02:50:09.450 --> 02:50:15.340
but black Africans that pretty
much have contributed to history

02:50:15.340 --> 02:50:16.640
and general black history.

02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:19.010
So there's a lot of people
I've never heard about,

02:50:19.010 --> 02:50:21.350
so I'm willing to do more
research on a lot of people.

02:50:21.350 --> 02:50:24.100
But there's a lot that
we don't know other

02:50:24.100 --> 02:50:27.070
than Martin Luther King, Malcolm
X and the regular normal people.

02:50:27.070 --> 02:50:29.330
We still have a lot
more research to do

02:50:29.330 --> 02:50:31.450
on black history in general.

02:50:31.450 --> 02:50:33.520
So this month at my
school we're working

02:50:33.520 --> 02:50:36.500
on doing something
different than Malcolm X

02:50:36.500 --> 02:50:38.360
and Martin Luther
King and Rosa Parks.

02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:39.660
We'll do something
bigger than that

02:50:39.660 --> 02:50:40.960
because we need to go deeper.

02:50:40.960 --> 02:50:43.480
There's more people that
actually live in the DNV area,

02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:49.130
that contributed
to black history.

02:50:49.130 --> 02:50:50.430
&gt;&gt; Leanne Potter: Outstanding.

02:50:50.430 --> 02:50:51.730
You guys are just terrific.

02:50:51.730 --> 02:50:53.030
And I need to say first
of all, a huge thank you

02:50:53.030 --> 02:50:56.520
for making this pilot successful
from our vantage point.

02:50:56.520 --> 02:50:57.940
Thank you again to
all my colleagues

02:50:57.940 --> 02:51:00.350
who participated in
making this work.

02:51:00.350 --> 02:51:03.300
And really you guys need to
know that the impact you had

02:51:03.300 --> 02:51:09.430
on us was really significant
because it is so reaffirming

02:51:09.430 --> 02:51:13.550
when young people see the work
that happens here as something

02:51:13.550 --> 02:51:17.140
that is valuable and important
and interesting and exciting.

02:51:17.140 --> 02:51:19.730
I have had more colleagues who
have gotten to know you guys

02:51:19.730 --> 02:51:21.860
in the last few weeks stopping
me in the tunnels talking

02:51:21.860 --> 02:51:23.190
about how great you are.

02:51:23.190 --> 02:51:26.750
And how much fun it's been
for them to work with you,

02:51:26.750 --> 02:51:31.350
because we need to know that the
next generation cares as deeply

02:51:31.350 --> 02:51:33.220
about this kind of
work as we do.

02:51:33.220 --> 02:51:35.570
And so we just feel
really good around you.

02:51:35.570 --> 02:51:37.280
So come back any time.

02:51:37.280 --> 02:51:38.580
We have little certificates
for you.

02:51:38.580 --> 02:51:41.920
We have them for
your teachers too.

02:51:41.920 --> 02:51:45.640
And we decided to call this
the Pilot Student Documentary

02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:48.360
Project celebrating the
Omar Ibn Said collection.

02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:51.510
&gt;&gt; Student: Oh, thank
you so much.

02:51:51.510 --> 02:51:54.040
[ Applause ]

02:51:54.040 --> 02:51:56.010
&gt;&gt; Dr. Anchi Hoh: I am Anchi
Hoh, program specialist

02:51:56.010 --> 02:51:59.090
at the African and
Middle Eastern Division

02:51:59.090 --> 02:52:02.390
and also project manager
for the Omar Ibn Said

02:52:02.390 --> 02:52:03.690
collection project.

02:52:03.690 --> 02:52:09.130
I'm delighted to introduce this
afternoon's panel titled The

02:52:09.130 --> 02:52:13.610
Role of the Library in
Acquiring, Preserving,

02:52:13.610 --> 02:52:15.500
Digitizing, Cataloging

02:52:15.500 --> 02:52:19.740
and Making Accessible the
Omar Ibn Said Collection.

02:52:19.740 --> 02:52:22.650
This morning you have
learned about the story

02:52:22.650 --> 02:52:26.010
of Omar Ibn Said
and his biography.

02:52:26.010 --> 02:52:31.870
Now our afternoon panel will
tell you part two of the story

02:52:31.870 --> 02:52:33.260
from the library's perspective.

02:52:33.260 --> 02:52:42.150
As project manager, in the past
nine months I was very excited

02:52:42.150 --> 02:52:44.460
to work with a group
of specialists

02:52:44.460 --> 02:52:49.570
from the Library's several
offices to preserve, catalog

02:52:49.570 --> 02:52:52.420
and digitize the Omar
Ibn Said collection

02:52:52.420 --> 02:52:55.330
and to see it eventually mounted

02:52:55.330 --> 02:52:59.620
to the library's website
for public access.

02:52:59.620 --> 02:53:06.240
Under a very tight deadline, our
team was able to work seamlessly

02:53:06.240 --> 02:53:09.360
and complete the project
ahead of schedule.

02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:14.050
So this afternoon you will
hear, you have the opportunity

02:53:14.050 --> 02:53:19.180
to learn firsthand from
the library's conservation,

02:53:19.180 --> 02:53:22.560
cataloging and digitization
specialists

02:53:22.560 --> 02:53:25.480
who will share their
experience working

02:53:25.480 --> 02:53:29.640
with this amazing Omar
Ibn Said collection.

02:53:29.640 --> 02:53:33.010
We have six specialists
participating

02:53:33.010 --> 02:53:34.460
in this panel discussion.

02:53:34.460 --> 02:53:37.330
And I will introduce
them briefly.

02:53:37.330 --> 02:53:45.010
They are Sylvia Albro,
conservation curator.

02:53:45.010 --> 02:53:49.580
Shelly Smith, head of
book conservation section.

02:53:49.580 --> 02:53:53.990
Sam Manivong, digital
library specialist.

02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:59.400
Domenico Sergi, supervisory
digital imaging specialist.

02:53:59.400 --> 02:54:02.500
Christa Maher, digital
project coordinator.

02:54:02.500 --> 02:54:05.480
And Dave Reser, metadata
librarian.

02:54:05.480 --> 02:54:10.290
You'll find the panelists'
bios in the program handouts.

02:54:10.290 --> 02:54:13.850
This panel will be
moderated by Beacher Wiggins,

02:54:13.850 --> 02:54:15.680
director for acquisitions

02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:19.020
and bibliographic
access at the Library.

02:54:19.020 --> 02:54:23.410
Beacher has a long and
glorious career at the library.

02:54:23.410 --> 02:54:27.600
Over the past four and a half
decades he has been serving

02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:30.870
in a number of important
leadership positions

02:54:30.870 --> 02:54:32.170
at the library

02:54:32.170 --> 02:54:35.110
and in professional
organizations including the

02:54:35.110 --> 02:54:38.140
American Library
Association, ALA,

02:54:38.140 --> 02:54:41.530
and the International Federation
of Library Associations

02:54:41.530 --> 02:54:44.060
and Institutions, IFLAI.

02:54:44.060 --> 02:54:48.160
He leads major projects such
as Leap Frame, an initiative

02:54:48.160 --> 02:54:50.310
on track to transform the future

02:54:50.310 --> 02:54:53.760
of librarianship in
the digital world.

02:54:53.760 --> 02:55:00.560
He is a recipient of the
2013 ALA Melville-Dewey Medal

02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:06.400
for distinguished contribution
to library technical services.

02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:11.180
It would be very remissive of me
not to point out Beacher's role

02:55:11.180 --> 02:55:15.170
in the Omar Ibn Said
collection project.

02:55:15.170 --> 02:55:16.470
You learned this morning

02:55:16.470 --> 02:55:19.290
that Marieta Harper
our area specialist

02:55:19.290 --> 02:55:23.730
in the African section first
identified the collection.

02:55:23.730 --> 02:55:28.050
Then it was due to Beacher's
remarkable leadership

02:55:28.050 --> 02:55:30.790
and great support that
enabled the library

02:55:30.790 --> 02:55:34.730
to acquire the Omar Ibn
Said manuscript collection.

02:55:34.730 --> 02:55:39.040
The result is that today his
manuscript becomes a part

02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:42.730
of the library's permanent
collection preserved

02:55:42.730 --> 02:55:47.420
and made accessible
to not only us today,

02:55:47.420 --> 02:55:51.010
but also to generations to come.

02:55:51.010 --> 02:55:54.820
So before the panel
discussions begin,

02:55:54.820 --> 02:55:58.230
I wanted to just
briefly let you know

02:55:58.230 --> 02:56:01.040
that following this panel
discussion we invite you

02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:05.740
to view the sampling display
of the Omar Ibn Said collection

02:56:05.740 --> 02:56:09.580
in the Rosenwald Room on the
second floor of this building

02:56:09.580 --> 02:56:11.940
across from the Rare
Book Reading Room.

02:56:11.940 --> 02:56:16.630
We will guide you
there, so not to worry.

02:56:16.630 --> 02:56:19.180
So we will begin the panel

02:56:19.180 --> 02:56:24.010
with a brief video titled
Preserving Omar Ibn Said's

02:56:24.010 --> 02:56:28.810
Words: A Slave's Narrative.

02:56:28.810 --> 02:56:32.330
Produced by Sean Miller, Library
of Congress photographer.

02:56:32.330 --> 02:56:34.110
So where's Sean?

02:56:34.110 --> 02:56:36.020
Sean is right there.

02:56:36.020 --> 02:56:37.840
Panel discussion will follow.

02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:40.510
Thank you.

02:56:40.510 --> 02:56:46.040
[ Music ]

02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:51.220
&gt;&gt; Because it speaks of
a specific individual.

02:56:51.220 --> 02:56:54.240
His thoughts, his
feelings, his story.

02:56:54.240 --> 02:57:00.280
Omar Ibn Said is a scholar
in what is today Senegal.

02:57:00.280 --> 02:57:03.120
And he was sold into slavery.

02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:09.920
He ran away and was
caught as a runaway slave.

02:57:09.920 --> 02:57:14.370
And in jail he began
writing on the walls.

02:57:14.370 --> 02:57:16.930
And that's when people
began wondering

02:57:16.930 --> 02:57:20.100
who he was, what he was writing.

02:57:20.100 --> 02:57:26.190
This autobiography is the only
known autobiography as a slave

02:57:26.190 --> 02:57:29.560
in Arabic in the United States.

02:57:29.560 --> 02:57:32.780
When he was writing, he knew

02:57:32.780 --> 02:57:36.390
that his owners could
not read it.

02:57:36.390 --> 02:57:40.310
So Arabic is in a way a language

02:57:40.310 --> 02:57:42.000
in which he could
be more truthful,

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.580
more candid about
his real feelings.

02:57:46.470 --> 02:57:52.750
Using the original of course
is what every researcher would

02:57:52.750 --> 02:57:54.050
like to do.

02:57:54.050 --> 02:57:57.260
However, the paper is very
brittle, very delicate.

02:57:57.260 --> 02:58:01.130
So it was important
to make facsimiles

02:58:01.130 --> 02:58:04.750
so that people would get
a sense of the item and

02:58:04.750 --> 02:58:07.890
yet not damage it
by looking at it.

02:58:07.890 --> 02:58:11.930
And preservation did a fantastic
job trying to preserve it

02:58:11.930 --> 02:58:14.400
and to maintain it so that
it can continue existing

02:58:14.400 --> 02:58:16.700
for generations to come.

02:58:17.730 --> 02:58:22.860
&gt;&gt; So what we're really hoping
to achieve with this documentary

02:58:22.860 --> 02:58:26.920
that we're doing, Richard
Wright, we hope to really appeal

02:58:26.920 --> 02:58:28.220
to the younger audience.

02:58:28.220 --> 02:58:30.440
Because we want them to know
more about their black history.

02:58:30.440 --> 02:58:33.120
For me it's amazing
because I had never heard

02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:34.760
of Omar Ibn Said at all.

02:58:34.760 --> 02:58:38.610
So to me it's just like
an amazing experience.

02:58:38.610 --> 02:58:43.060
&gt;&gt; A collection such as this
one questions the very principle

02:58:43.060 --> 02:58:45.680
of enslaving another
human being.

02:58:45.680 --> 02:58:50.070
Hopefully it will be a tool
of education, of learning,

02:58:50.070 --> 02:58:51.910
of better understanding others,

02:58:51.910 --> 02:58:55.550
of understanding the
history of Africa as well.

02:58:55.550 --> 02:58:59.380
It is this very personal
way of writing

02:58:59.380 --> 02:59:02.430
and of talking that reaches us.

02:59:02.430 --> 02:59:05.890
It reaches everyone
across the 200 years.

02:59:05.890 --> 02:59:08.510
And speaks to people today.

02:59:08.510 --> 02:59:12.510
[ Music ]

02:59:12.510 --> 02:59:21.500
[ Applause ]

02:59:25.060 --> 02:59:27.560
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Good
afternoon, everyone.

02:59:27.560 --> 02:59:32.610
It takes hearing how long --
I have one somewhere, don't I?

02:59:32.610 --> 02:59:37.210
How long one has been around to
hear it voiced openly like that,

02:59:37.210 --> 02:59:39.070
four and a half decades
sounds like a lot.

02:59:39.070 --> 02:59:40.370
And I guess it is.

02:59:40.370 --> 02:59:43.570
But I've enjoyed
every minute of it.

02:59:43.570 --> 02:59:50.110
I did play a role as the manager
for the acquisition process,

02:59:50.110 --> 02:59:53.620
and most of you have seen and
heard about that this morning.

02:59:53.620 --> 02:59:56.650
But I'd be remiss if I
didn't mention the division

02:59:56.650 --> 02:59:57.950
that played the role.

02:59:57.950 --> 03:00:01.880
Usually I manage the division
and the division, the chief

03:00:01.880 --> 03:00:05.100
and the specialists then
do the acquisitions work.

03:00:05.100 --> 03:00:09.410
So I wanted to acknowledge the
Alaway Division, the Africa,

03:00:09.410 --> 03:00:12.220
Latin American and
Western European division

03:00:12.220 --> 03:00:16.480
and in particular one of
the acquisitions librarians,

03:00:16.480 --> 03:00:20.810
Aaron Friet Smith who
worked to make this happen.

03:00:20.810 --> 03:00:23.910
Because we get what
the library wants

03:00:23.910 --> 03:00:27.470
and what the specialists tell us
is important for filling voids.

03:00:27.470 --> 03:00:31.940
And yes, Marieta did every
time she saw me in the hall

03:00:31.940 --> 03:00:34.050
for the past five years or so,

03:00:34.050 --> 03:00:35.690
"I've got this thing
that we have to get."

03:00:35.690 --> 03:00:37.770
I'd say, "Okay, let
me know and we'll see

03:00:37.770 --> 03:00:39.090
if we can find something."

03:00:39.090 --> 03:00:41.040
So we're so happy
to be a part of that

03:00:41.040 --> 03:00:43.080
on the AVA side of the house.

03:00:43.080 --> 03:00:46.660
So now let's turn to
Shelly and Sylvia,

03:00:46.660 --> 03:00:49.690
and why don't you tell
us some of what you did?

03:00:49.690 --> 03:00:51.220
And I think you might
have something

03:00:51.220 --> 03:00:53.960
to share with us as you talk.

03:00:53.960 --> 03:00:55.260
&gt;&gt; Shelly Smith: We do.

03:00:55.260 --> 03:00:59.000
Conservation is pretty visual,
so we included some photographs

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.110
to kind of illustrate
some of our processes.

03:01:01.110 --> 03:01:04.180
So first of all, I would like
to say that this really was just

03:01:04.180 --> 03:01:06.430
such a big team effort.

03:01:06.430 --> 03:01:09.750
This fabulous team up here
and many other team members

03:01:09.750 --> 03:01:11.380
that are here in the audience.

03:01:11.380 --> 03:01:12.680
Way to go team.

03:01:12.680 --> 03:01:19.220
Good job. So I am the head of
the Book Conservation Section

03:01:19.220 --> 03:01:22.370
and I was asked to oversee and
coordinate the preservation

03:01:22.370 --> 03:01:24.670
and conservation activities
that would be required

03:01:24.670 --> 03:01:27.630
to make the Omar Ibn
Said collection available

03:01:27.630 --> 03:01:30.480
for whatever use,
whether that be research

03:01:30.480 --> 03:01:32.550
or exhibition or other.

03:01:32.550 --> 03:01:36.360
Now luckily, before the
collection even arrived,

03:01:36.360 --> 03:01:41.020
we were able to see a few
images of several items

03:01:41.020 --> 03:01:43.390
in the collection that were
from the auction catalog

03:01:43.390 --> 03:01:45.380
that was produced by Southaby's,
and that's what you see

03:01:45.380 --> 03:01:48.440
on the screen right now,
are these couple of images

03:01:48.440 --> 03:01:49.890
that were from Southaby's.

03:01:49.890 --> 03:01:54.250
This was really helpful to
get a very basic understanding

03:01:54.250 --> 03:01:56.450
of what the scope
of this project was.

03:01:56.450 --> 03:02:01.750
We knew it was 42 items, but
not having seen any of them,

03:02:01.750 --> 03:02:04.720
we didn't know what that
would really entail.

03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:09.200
And that's because conservation
can take quite some time

03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:10.500
from start to finish.

03:02:10.500 --> 03:02:13.650
Especially so many
of the activities

03:02:13.650 --> 03:02:16.630
that we do ideally
should happen in sequence

03:02:16.630 --> 03:02:19.510
and can't really
happen concurrently.

03:02:19.510 --> 03:02:23.800
So to be able to know up front
if this was a six-month project

03:02:23.800 --> 03:02:28.050
or a multi-year project,
which is not inconceivable,

03:02:28.050 --> 03:02:30.000
was of course very helpful.

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:35.650
So this initial brief
view of the collection

03:02:35.650 --> 03:02:38.690
at least gave us the
confidence that the schedule

03:02:38.690 --> 03:02:41.070
that the library was
hoping for, to get this done

03:02:41.070 --> 03:02:44.260
in approximately 18
months, was possible.

03:02:44.260 --> 03:02:49.540
And if 18 months seems like a
long time, just the conservation

03:02:49.540 --> 03:02:54.670
and preservation parts of this
included detailed assessment,

03:02:54.670 --> 03:02:56.830
documentation, and
that includes written

03:02:56.830 --> 03:02:59.490
and photographic documentation
which is a very important part

03:02:59.490 --> 03:03:01.820
of the conservation process.

03:03:01.820 --> 03:03:06.220
Treatment of course and
housing, making the facsimiles,

03:03:06.220 --> 03:03:10.670
assisting with digitization and
being a part of the multiplicity

03:03:10.670 --> 03:03:15.650
that would all be happening
around this project as well.

03:03:15.650 --> 03:03:19.520
So as I mentioned,
in an ideal world,

03:03:19.520 --> 03:03:22.450
a lot of these activities
would happen in sequence.

03:03:22.450 --> 03:03:23.920
But because of the timeline,

03:03:23.920 --> 03:03:27.780
because the library wanted
these materials to be available

03:03:27.780 --> 03:03:31.390
as soon as possible, it
meant that a lot of this had

03:03:31.390 --> 03:03:32.710
to happen concurrently.

03:03:32.710 --> 03:03:36.850
There were a lot of things
happening all at the same time.

03:03:36.850 --> 03:03:41.220
So by far I think the most
meaningful thing that I did

03:03:41.220 --> 03:03:43.960
to contribute to the
success of this project was

03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:48.260
that I asked Sylvia
Albro, this really talented

03:03:48.260 --> 03:03:54.170
and qualified conservator, to
take care of the assessment

03:03:54.170 --> 03:03:56.330
and the treatment and
the documentation.

03:03:56.330 --> 03:03:57.630
So I'm going to hand
it over to Sylvia

03:03:57.630 --> 03:03:58.930
to talk about those things.

03:03:58.930 --> 03:04:01.470
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Albro:
Thank you, Shelly.

03:04:01.470 --> 03:04:03.470
We were definitely a duo.

03:04:03.470 --> 03:04:06.750
And I want to reiterate
our thanks to the African

03:04:06.750 --> 03:04:09.880
and Middle Eastern Division
for managing this project

03:04:09.880 --> 03:04:13.140
and for really the joy
of participating in it.

03:04:13.140 --> 03:04:17.860
Because we know that his voice,
the voice of Omar Ibn Said,

03:04:17.860 --> 03:04:19.390
spoke for a lot of people.

03:04:19.390 --> 03:04:22.830
And we all felt very
privileged to be part of trying

03:04:22.830 --> 03:04:25.970
to get that voice out.

03:04:25.970 --> 03:04:30.140
Now I cannot see the
screens as well as you can.

03:04:30.140 --> 03:04:37.950
But I will just point out that
-- I will talk to this screen

03:04:37.950 --> 03:04:40.970
but I'll try to say left
and right so that people

03:04:40.970 --> 03:04:43.160
who are watching that
screen will know what I'm

03:04:43.160 --> 03:04:44.460
talking about.

03:04:44.460 --> 03:04:47.430
If we go back to the slide
that was right before Shelly,

03:04:47.430 --> 03:04:50.750
that one, we can see
on the right-hand side

03:04:50.750 --> 03:04:54.620
that was the condition of
the manuscript when it came

03:04:54.620 --> 03:04:56.070
to the conservation lab.

03:04:56.070 --> 03:04:58.400
And after it arrived,
of course the African

03:04:58.400 --> 03:05:01.280
and Middle Eastern
Division made sure that all

03:05:01.280 --> 03:05:04.540
of the objects arrived from
Southaby's and they also went

03:05:04.540 --> 03:05:07.250
through them all and labeled
them and numbered them.

03:05:07.250 --> 03:05:11.200
So for the whole project we had
their titles and their numbers.

03:05:11.200 --> 03:05:17.160
And I also had the opportunity
to read the translation

03:05:17.160 --> 03:05:20.630
and it was so wonderful
to meet the author today

03:05:20.630 --> 03:05:21.930
of the translation.

03:05:21.930 --> 03:05:25.600
And so because before
attempting work on any object

03:05:25.600 --> 03:05:28.820
at the Library of this value,
you want to know what you have

03:05:28.820 --> 03:05:30.680
and what you're working with.

03:05:30.680 --> 03:05:32.440
And it was important
to know what was said.

03:05:32.440 --> 03:05:33.990
I don't read Arabic.

03:05:33.990 --> 03:05:36.890
But the materials of
this project also speak

03:05:36.890 --> 03:05:38.190
their language.

03:05:38.190 --> 03:05:41.800
And a conservator has to become
kind of very familiar with them,

03:05:41.800 --> 03:05:43.290
sort of intimate
with the materials.

03:05:43.290 --> 03:05:45.120
So at the beginning, you can see

03:05:45.120 --> 03:05:48.160
that there were some
damages visible.

03:05:48.160 --> 03:05:51.100
The way that the cover
which was put on 20 years

03:05:51.100 --> 03:05:54.430
after Omar had written
the script --

03:05:54.430 --> 03:06:00.110
20 years later it was
stab-sewn on the side.

03:06:00.110 --> 03:06:04.770
And all of the original
paper was breaking

03:06:04.770 --> 03:06:08.310
where those stitches were.

03:06:08.310 --> 03:06:11.610
And so together with
the curators,

03:06:11.610 --> 03:06:14.560
we looked at the item
and we made a plan.

03:06:14.560 --> 03:06:18.930
It was a joint decision
that we would take it apart

03:06:18.930 --> 03:06:22.280
so that it would
eventually open fully.

03:06:22.280 --> 03:06:25.740
With the stitching on the
side added later like that,

03:06:25.740 --> 03:06:27.850
the manuscript did
not open safely

03:06:27.850 --> 03:06:30.570
and it cracked all
along that fold.

03:06:30.570 --> 03:06:35.690
So Shelly, the book conservator,
we moved the stitching.

03:06:35.690 --> 03:06:40.200
And one of the things
that we found

03:06:40.200 --> 03:06:41.730
when we removed the stitching is

03:06:41.730 --> 03:06:45.420
that actually there was
another layer of stitching

03:06:45.420 --> 03:06:47.690
that held the manuscript
through the fold

03:06:47.690 --> 03:06:48.990
that had been invisible.

03:06:48.990 --> 03:06:53.620
And that was much closer to the
execution of the manuscript.

03:06:53.620 --> 03:06:56.210
So we had to take
both threads out.

03:06:56.210 --> 03:06:59.420
They both were made of cotton,
but they were very different.

03:06:59.420 --> 03:07:01.160
And we saved them of course.

03:07:01.160 --> 03:07:05.910
And later in the project
we found that this thread

03:07:05.910 --> 03:07:10.450
that had been used
to sew the cover

03:07:10.450 --> 03:07:13.140
to the manuscript was the
same thread that was found

03:07:13.140 --> 03:07:16.370
on the translations
by Isaac Byrd.

03:07:16.370 --> 03:07:19.950
So it was important to save
that and make that connection.

03:07:19.950 --> 03:07:23.090
Whereas the thread that was
used to sew through the fold

03:07:23.090 --> 03:07:26.500
of the manuscript was the
same as one that was found

03:07:26.500 --> 03:07:29.340
on the manuscripts that
had been commissioned

03:07:29.340 --> 03:07:31.650
from Arabic scribes
in West Africa.

03:07:31.650 --> 03:07:33.870
So there was a connection
with that thread

03:07:33.870 --> 03:07:36.120
and those manuscripts.

03:07:36.120 --> 03:07:38.710
So let's go to the next slide.

03:07:38.710 --> 03:07:41.790
And you can see on
one of the pages part

03:07:41.790 --> 03:07:43.470
of the page was missing.

03:07:43.470 --> 03:07:47.100
So we were looking at
the ink and the paper.

03:07:47.100 --> 03:07:49.090
We have actually
done a lot of work

03:07:49.090 --> 03:07:52.250
on iron gall ink preservation
here at the Library of Congress.

03:07:52.250 --> 03:07:54.820
Some of my colleagues
are very expert in this.

03:07:54.820 --> 03:07:57.590
We were beneficiaries
of their research.

03:07:57.590 --> 03:08:02.150
And so we looked at the
document using ultraviolet light

03:08:02.150 --> 03:08:03.860
which is a tool.

03:08:03.860 --> 03:08:06.720
You can see what the manuscript
looked like on the right

03:08:06.720 --> 03:08:08.020
under ultraviolet light.

03:08:08.020 --> 03:08:11.690
And that shows us what
the deterioration process

03:08:11.690 --> 03:08:12.990
of the ink is.

03:08:12.990 --> 03:08:15.400
This ink was actually
in very good condition.

03:08:15.400 --> 03:08:19.020
And as the students so
amply talked about --

03:08:19.020 --> 03:08:20.840
I won't go into iron
gall ink again,

03:08:20.840 --> 03:08:23.640
because they gave a
very good explanation.

03:08:23.640 --> 03:08:27.470
It turned out to be in really
reasonably good condition.

03:08:27.470 --> 03:08:30.610
And the paper was
of good quality.

03:08:30.610 --> 03:08:33.940
It's made of rag which is
a cotton-linen mixture.

03:08:33.940 --> 03:08:36.680
It's a wove paper
without a watermark.

03:08:36.680 --> 03:08:39.390
And it's a machine-made paper.

03:08:39.390 --> 03:08:42.130
We think that it was made in
America but we can't prove

03:08:42.130 --> 03:08:48.040
that because there's no
watermark or blind stamp on it.

03:08:48.040 --> 03:08:51.450
So it did not require any
kind of chemical treatment.

03:08:51.450 --> 03:08:54.760
It simply required
repair of the pages.

03:08:54.760 --> 03:08:56.720
We did take extensive
photographs

03:08:56.720 --> 03:08:58.020
so that we can use them

03:08:58.020 --> 03:09:00.550
to monitor whether the
ink deteriorates further

03:09:00.550 --> 03:09:01.850
in the future.

03:09:01.850 --> 03:09:07.480
There were a few areas in the
script that were heavily applied

03:09:07.480 --> 03:09:10.580
and there it was breaking
through the paper.

03:09:13.600 --> 03:09:18.490
So here you see the different
steps, the different tools

03:09:18.490 --> 03:09:21.070
and the different papers
used to mend the manuscript.

03:09:21.070 --> 03:09:23.500
There were at least
six different kinds.

03:09:23.500 --> 03:09:27.480
I primarily used lightweight
Japanese papers that were toned

03:09:27.480 --> 03:09:30.970
to match the different
colors of the paper.

03:09:30.970 --> 03:09:33.680
And two different adhesives.

03:09:33.680 --> 03:09:36.620
Reed starch paste which is
a traditional conservation

03:09:36.620 --> 03:09:39.840
adhesive was used in
areas with no ink.

03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:43.670
But where there was mending that
was required in inked areas,

03:09:43.670 --> 03:09:46.830
we used a non-aqueous
adhesive applied

03:09:46.830 --> 03:09:49.830
that all mends are
reversible in the future.

03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:54.480
But that will not cause any
kind of reaction with the ink.

03:09:54.480 --> 03:09:59.780
And here I'd like to make
a comment about a couple

03:09:59.780 --> 03:10:03.210
of graduate students that
helped me on this project.

03:10:03.210 --> 03:10:06.940
They worked on some of
the other items that were

03:10:06.940 --> 03:10:09.630
in the collection in
addition to the Omar Ibn Said.

03:10:09.630 --> 03:10:15.140
And here we see Marie Keita
Mora who's repairing some

03:10:15.140 --> 03:10:18.380
of the publisher's
scripts that were part

03:10:18.380 --> 03:10:20.590
of the 41 other items
in the collection.

03:10:20.590 --> 03:10:24.030
We also had Mary
Elizabeth Watson who's here,

03:10:24.030 --> 03:10:27.520
and Grace Walters
who also assisted.

03:10:33.060 --> 03:10:37.590
The cover did require
a chemical treatment.

03:10:37.590 --> 03:10:40.150
The paper was very
different than the text paper.

03:10:40.150 --> 03:10:42.500
It actually had a lot
of straw threads in it.

03:10:42.500 --> 03:10:46.380
It was kind of the equivalent
of sort of a paper bag quality

03:10:46.380 --> 03:10:49.730
and it actually had
discolored Omar's text

03:10:49.730 --> 03:10:52.240
at the front and back pages.

03:10:52.240 --> 03:10:56.400
And it had a very
low pH, under four.

03:10:56.400 --> 03:10:59.260
We tried to aim for a
neutral pH with paper

03:10:59.260 --> 03:11:01.410
to be stable for the future.

03:11:01.410 --> 03:11:04.980
The ink was tested
thoroughly and it was able

03:11:04.980 --> 03:11:07.440
to undergo aqueous treatment.

03:11:07.440 --> 03:11:13.250
And we did that with an alkaline
water bath, mixed with alcohol.

03:11:13.250 --> 03:11:15.830
And you can see there
it's being immersed.

03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:20.570
And after it came out and
it was dried, it was resized

03:11:20.570 --> 03:11:25.500
with gelatin to help with
the future handling stability

03:11:25.500 --> 03:11:29.580
of this paper.

03:11:32.310 --> 03:11:33.720
Let's see.

03:11:33.720 --> 03:11:37.380
Oh. Okay, here you can see a
picture of before treatment

03:11:37.380 --> 03:11:39.460
on the left where
you can see that some

03:11:39.460 --> 03:11:42.660
of the pages had
separated, and you can see

03:11:42.660 --> 03:11:44.590
where mending was required.

03:11:44.590 --> 03:11:47.400
And then after treatment
on the right.

03:11:47.400 --> 03:11:51.630
And I thought I would show
page one of Omar's script

03:11:51.630 --> 03:11:53.390
because of course
the cover is put

03:11:53.390 --> 03:11:57.520
on in the English
orientation, but the text opens

03:11:57.520 --> 03:11:59.610
in the opposite direction.

03:11:59.610 --> 03:12:03.800
So that is actually
the first page.

03:12:11.120 --> 03:12:14.670
The cover required a little
bit of mending on the spine

03:12:14.670 --> 03:12:17.320
and on the corners
and that was also done

03:12:17.320 --> 03:12:19.620
with a tinted Japanese paper.

03:12:19.620 --> 03:12:21.950
And as I said, we
try to do repairs

03:12:21.950 --> 03:12:25.220
that don't look like
they're repairs.

03:12:25.220 --> 03:12:28.620
We try to keep the
manuscript looking as authentic

03:12:28.620 --> 03:12:30.020
and original as possible.

03:12:30.020 --> 03:12:33.480
We don't want our
thumbprint to be on there.

03:12:33.480 --> 03:12:37.510
So we hope that it
just enables handling

03:12:37.510 --> 03:12:42.700
without making any
alterations to the authenticity.

03:12:45.180 --> 03:12:53.100
And one last thing, imaging
can tell you material things

03:12:53.100 --> 03:12:55.760
about the manuscript that
you don't immediately see

03:12:55.760 --> 03:12:57.330
in visible light.

03:12:57.330 --> 03:13:00.100
And some of the other
manuscripts

03:13:00.100 --> 03:13:02.520
in this collection are
very interesting in terms

03:13:02.520 --> 03:13:04.750
of what their paper has to say.

03:13:04.750 --> 03:13:08.430
For instance, on the right you
can see a blind stamp in one

03:13:08.430 --> 03:13:11.480
of the papers that was used

03:13:11.480 --> 03:13:15.320
by the commissioned
West African scribes

03:13:15.320 --> 03:13:18.660
to write their documents, that
Theodore Dwight collected.

03:13:18.660 --> 03:13:20.420
And it shows that the paper

03:13:20.420 --> 03:13:24.550
that he used actually
came from Massachusetts.

03:13:24.550 --> 03:13:28.120
So it's a whole collection of
very interesting blind stamps

03:13:28.120 --> 03:13:30.140
in these 41 documents
that are going

03:13:30.140 --> 03:13:33.380
to make an excellent
research project for someone.

03:13:33.380 --> 03:13:36.550
And then what you see on the
lower left is another one

03:13:36.550 --> 03:13:38.650
of the 41 documents
in the collection.

03:13:38.650 --> 03:13:43.520
It's a travel payer, a
very beautiful document

03:13:43.520 --> 03:13:47.410
with Arabic writing in a
circle that is a talisman

03:13:47.410 --> 03:13:48.710
that a traveler would take.

03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:52.250
And that paper happened to have
an Italian watermark in it,

03:13:52.250 --> 03:13:53.550
which is very interesting.

03:13:53.550 --> 03:13:58.430
It's known that the paper trade
was wide from Europe to Africa.

03:13:58.430 --> 03:14:02.980
But here's an example of the
watermark that proves that.

03:14:02.980 --> 03:14:05.800
&gt;&gt; Shelly Smith: And then I'm
just going to say a last couple

03:14:05.800 --> 03:14:09.130
of words about creating
the facsimiles for this

03:14:09.130 --> 03:14:11.840
which was another part
of our responsibilities.

03:14:11.840 --> 03:14:14.590
So one of the things
that we were doing

03:14:14.590 --> 03:14:18.790
as the project was going on, as
Sylvia was doing the treatment

03:14:18.790 --> 03:14:22.020
on all the items, as items
were finishing treatment,

03:14:22.020 --> 03:14:25.140
we then worked with
our colleagues

03:14:25.140 --> 03:14:29.150
from the digitization services
to in several batches start

03:14:29.150 --> 03:14:30.460
to digitize those things.

03:14:30.460 --> 03:14:32.980
So that those files could be
created so that they could go

03:14:32.980 --> 03:14:35.440
on to the next step in the
process, so that we didn't wait

03:14:35.440 --> 03:14:38.090
until the very end for
all this to happen.

03:14:38.090 --> 03:14:41.860
So I helped with the safe
handling of the material

03:14:41.860 --> 03:14:44.350
to get them under the camera.

03:14:44.350 --> 03:14:47.860
They resulted in these really
fantastic high-resolution images

03:14:47.860 --> 03:14:50.670
that you can see of course
on the library's webpage.

03:14:50.670 --> 03:14:53.550
But I was able to then
manipulate them a little bit

03:14:53.550 --> 03:14:57.190
into some slightly
different images.

03:14:57.190 --> 03:14:59.820
I had to change things
a little bit in order

03:14:59.820 --> 03:15:02.020
to produce the facsimile.

03:15:02.020 --> 03:15:03.450
Now as far as the facsimile,

03:15:03.450 --> 03:15:06.240
this isn't something
that we normally do.

03:15:06.240 --> 03:15:10.240
We just in talking
with our colleagues

03:15:10.240 --> 03:15:13.980
in the custodial divisions, we
knew that there would be a lot

03:15:13.980 --> 03:15:17.030
of interest and that
people would really want

03:15:17.030 --> 03:15:18.500
to handle the original
manuscript.

03:15:18.500 --> 03:15:21.710
And that it was fragile.

03:15:21.710 --> 03:15:24.840
It had been well handled over
its lifetime and we wanted

03:15:24.840 --> 03:15:27.100
to try to minimize that
as much as possible.

03:15:27.100 --> 03:15:30.760
But to make a facsimile
to allow researchers

03:15:30.760 --> 03:15:35.520
to really get the sense
of the artifact itself,

03:15:35.520 --> 03:15:37.140
we thought would be
really important.

03:15:37.140 --> 03:15:44.530
And so I had never
done this before,

03:15:44.530 --> 03:15:50.000
but I was optimistic
that I could do this.

03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:53.130
And in finding different
kinds of handmade paper

03:15:53.130 --> 03:15:57.910
that were very similar to the
original and experimenting

03:15:57.910 --> 03:16:02.880
with printing methods, I was
able to make several copies

03:16:02.880 --> 03:16:06.300
that will be available
both for use in the Africa

03:16:06.300 --> 03:16:09.500
and Middle Eastern Division
and in the Rare Books

03:16:09.500 --> 03:16:11.120
and Special Collections
Division.

03:16:11.120 --> 03:16:14.150
And then finally we
house the items and most

03:16:14.150 --> 03:16:16.630
of those were in
-- oh sorry, yes.

03:16:16.630 --> 03:16:18.250
Oh, so before and afters, right?

03:16:18.250 --> 03:16:22.640
So on the left is the original

03:16:22.640 --> 03:16:25.290
and on the right
is the facsimile.

03:16:25.290 --> 03:16:28.460
And on the next one
is an opening.

03:16:28.460 --> 03:16:30.590
And then again on the
left is the original

03:16:30.590 --> 03:16:32.410
and on the right
is the facsimile.

03:16:32.410 --> 03:16:34.800
Trying to keep the
sense of the original

03:16:34.800 --> 03:16:38.220
with the facsimile
as much as possible.

03:16:38.220 --> 03:16:41.040
We housed all 42 of the items.

03:16:41.040 --> 03:16:43.420
Most of them were in
acid-free paper folders

03:16:43.420 --> 03:16:48.650
that our conservation staff
member Mary Elizabeth Watson

03:16:48.650 --> 03:16:52.860
constructed two fantastic
custom-made cloth-covered

03:16:52.860 --> 03:16:55.500
clamshell boxes for
both the main manuscript

03:16:55.500 --> 03:16:58.260
and for one of the facsimiles.

03:16:58.260 --> 03:17:00.150
There, finally.

03:17:00.150 --> 03:17:02.280
[ Laughter ]

03:17:02.280 --> 03:17:03.580
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: All right.

03:17:03.580 --> 03:17:06.380
You may have covered some of
this, but as all of us know,

03:17:06.380 --> 03:17:10.360
the reason that we collect any
of this content is to share it

03:17:10.360 --> 03:17:12.550
and have researchers
have access to it.

03:17:12.550 --> 03:17:15.510
So a couple of questions,
and you hit on some of this.

03:17:15.510 --> 03:17:19.870
The first one is, are there
any observations that either

03:17:19.870 --> 03:17:25.270
of you have in terms of how
what you did affect a researcher

03:17:25.270 --> 03:17:28.410
in looking at and
accessing this?

03:17:28.410 --> 03:17:30.870
I picked up some of that
as you were talking.

03:17:30.870 --> 03:17:34.100
But in case you wanted
to highlight any of that?

03:17:34.100 --> 03:17:37.640
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Albro: Well, as I
said, there is material evidence

03:17:37.640 --> 03:17:40.260
that can contribute
to the story.

03:17:40.260 --> 03:17:44.750
And if we in any way can
document that and include

03:17:44.750 --> 03:17:48.680
that with the collection so
that when scholars come to look

03:17:48.680 --> 03:17:50.940
at it, they have
also that evidence,

03:17:50.940 --> 03:17:54.790
I think it can contribute
to their appreciation

03:17:54.790 --> 03:17:56.760
or to their investigations.

03:17:56.760 --> 03:18:00.040
And some of that includes
information about the paper,

03:18:00.040 --> 03:18:05.240
information about these sewing
threads and sewing construction.

03:18:06.270 --> 03:18:11.510
Origins of some of the paper
when we know and any kind

03:18:11.510 --> 03:18:13.870
of alterations that
have been made.

03:18:13.870 --> 03:18:17.190
We save everything, we
document everything.

03:18:17.190 --> 03:18:19.340
And we're always
available for consultation.

03:18:19.340 --> 03:18:20.640
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: And
where do you store this?

03:18:20.640 --> 03:18:21.940
How will anyone know?

03:18:21.940 --> 03:18:24.200
Has this been passed on?

03:18:24.200 --> 03:18:27.430
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Albro: Well, we write
an extensive treatment report

03:18:27.430 --> 03:18:29.800
and that will accompany
the item.

03:18:29.800 --> 03:18:33.340
In some cases it's
also kept in our files.

03:18:33.340 --> 03:18:35.400
We have a lot of
digital photographs

03:18:35.400 --> 03:18:37.280
of before and after treatment.

03:18:37.280 --> 03:18:39.840
Those are also available
if necessary.

03:18:39.840 --> 03:18:43.360
And we printed out a lot of
our information and included it

03:18:43.360 --> 03:18:47.710
in the files with the
conserved documents when it went

03:18:47.710 --> 03:18:49.670
to the Rare Book Division.

03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:53.710
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: And is
there a methodology that you use

03:18:53.710 --> 03:18:59.670
when you get something like
the Omar Ibn Said documents

03:18:59.670 --> 03:19:02.950
to determine how you want
to do your conservation?

03:19:02.950 --> 03:19:06.730
Do you get a team to
pull that together?

03:19:06.730 --> 03:19:08.440
&gt;&gt; Shelly Smith:
Usually it's a balance.

03:19:08.440 --> 03:19:10.040
You did the treatment.

03:19:10.040 --> 03:19:13.440
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Albro: We
definitely consult

03:19:13.440 --> 03:19:17.190
with the curatorial department
that's associated with the item.

03:19:17.190 --> 03:19:19.390
In this case it was
the AMA team.

03:19:19.390 --> 03:19:22.280
And we write a proposal.

03:19:22.280 --> 03:19:23.650
We look at it together.

03:19:23.650 --> 03:19:26.300
We think of three
things in particular:

03:19:26.300 --> 03:19:31.330
the value of the item of
course, the condition the item

03:19:31.330 --> 03:19:34.380
and how the item is
going to be used.

03:19:34.380 --> 03:19:37.870
So those are three factors
that we discuss and we look

03:19:37.870 --> 03:19:40.500
at the item together, and
we come up with a plan.

03:19:40.500 --> 03:19:43.370
And we write up our proposal.

03:19:43.370 --> 03:19:46.190
It gets signed off
on if it's approved.

03:19:46.190 --> 03:19:47.890
And as we're going
through the treatment,

03:19:47.890 --> 03:19:51.350
we often have questions
and we regularly consult.

03:19:51.350 --> 03:19:54.820
It's the richness of the library
that we have so many specialists

03:19:54.820 --> 03:20:00.030
in so many areas that can
really inform what we do.

03:20:00.030 --> 03:20:01.330
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Great.

03:20:01.330 --> 03:20:02.630
Thank you.

03:20:02.630 --> 03:20:03.930
Now we'll move on.

03:20:03.930 --> 03:20:08.160
Those of us at the
library know that one

03:20:08.160 --> 03:20:14.450
of Dr. Hayden's goals is to have
the library's content digitized

03:20:14.450 --> 03:20:16.220
and made accessible
to the world.

03:20:16.220 --> 03:20:18.290
She doesn't want it just
to be here on Capital Hill.

03:20:18.290 --> 03:20:23.310
So now we turn to the
digitization aspect of it.

03:20:23.310 --> 03:20:29.820
And we'll ask Domenic to
give us a background run

03:20:29.820 --> 03:20:32.140
through what happened to get us

03:20:32.140 --> 03:20:34.400
to this point for
the digitization.

03:20:34.400 --> 03:20:35.700
Domenic?

03:20:35.700 --> 03:20:37.160
&gt;&gt; Domenico Sergi: Okay,
thank you, Beacher.

03:20:37.160 --> 03:20:39.310
My name is Domenic and I am head

03:20:39.310 --> 03:20:41.730
of the digital scan
center here at the library.

03:20:41.730 --> 03:20:47.640
And this project came up
rather suddenly, I think.

03:20:47.640 --> 03:20:49.550
I certainly wasn't
prepared for it.

03:20:49.550 --> 03:20:52.250
But working with
conservation and Sam here

03:20:52.250 --> 03:20:55.370
with the digital
conversion team.

03:20:55.370 --> 03:20:57.040
Yes. I'm sorry, is that better?

03:20:57.040 --> 03:21:01.050
Should I start over?

03:21:01.050 --> 03:21:04.410
So we were working closely
with the conservation staff

03:21:04.410 --> 03:21:08.200
and Sam here to my right

03:21:08.200 --> 03:21:10.890
who coordinated all the
digital ID's for the items.

03:21:10.890 --> 03:21:14.340
So that way we keep all
the pagination correctly

03:21:14.340 --> 03:21:16.370
because some of the
items were backwards

03:21:16.370 --> 03:21:18.180
in how they were paginated.

03:21:18.180 --> 03:21:20.220
The orientation being
a foreign language,

03:21:20.220 --> 03:21:22.940
it has to be presented
correctly.

03:21:22.940 --> 03:21:25.040
So with their guidance
we were able

03:21:25.040 --> 03:21:29.200
to do all of that in one sweep.

03:21:30.270 --> 03:21:33.410
Shelly and company made
our end really easy.

03:21:33.410 --> 03:21:37.050
So we showed up at their
lab with our equipment set

03:21:37.050 --> 03:21:40.440
up on site and they
did all of the handling

03:21:40.440 --> 03:21:42.890
as these items were treated.

03:21:42.890 --> 03:21:46.560
They'd call us over, we'd
come over, image them,

03:21:46.560 --> 03:21:48.930
and take the images
and then put them

03:21:48.930 --> 03:21:51.420
into our post-processing effort.

03:21:51.420 --> 03:21:55.120
Which entails the cropping,
rotating and pagination.

03:21:55.120 --> 03:22:00.900
And the setting up of the
camera is unique in that we have

03:22:00.900 --> 03:22:04.300
to shoot color checkers
for color accuracy.

03:22:04.300 --> 03:22:08.550
It's important when you're doing
facsimiles or if these are used

03:22:08.550 --> 03:22:12.540
in publications that
the colors are correct.

03:22:12.540 --> 03:22:17.530
We shoot -- in this particular
case we did these at 600 PPI

03:22:17.530 --> 03:22:21.270
so that we could get down
to the grain of the paper.

03:22:21.270 --> 03:22:24.840
It's also for scholars to have
the ability of studying them

03:22:24.840 --> 03:22:28.150
for the inks that
were used or have had.

03:22:28.150 --> 03:22:31.650
Our goal is always to
keep the images true

03:22:31.650 --> 03:22:34.840
to the authenticity
of the object.

03:22:34.840 --> 03:22:38.680
So we show all edges,
gathers, how they're sewn,

03:22:38.680 --> 03:22:40.680
it's all in the image.

03:22:40.680 --> 03:22:43.510
And that's it.

03:22:43.510 --> 03:22:46.860
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
Did a particular set

03:22:46.860 --> 03:22:51.250
of documents present any
particular challenges you

03:22:51.250 --> 03:22:55.000
thought about, the
digitization process?

03:22:55.000 --> 03:22:58.380
&gt;&gt; Domenico Sergi: Well, some
of the challenges were you have

03:22:58.380 --> 03:23:01.130
to make sure the lighting was
set up correctly for contrast,

03:23:01.130 --> 03:23:03.760
for example, so that
there are minimal shadows.

03:23:03.760 --> 03:23:06.790
Some of the items may have
had a little bit of lifting

03:23:06.790 --> 03:23:11.420
or they were dog-eared in one
corner which may cause a shadow.

03:23:11.420 --> 03:23:13.600
So we correct for all of that.

03:23:13.600 --> 03:23:15.930
The images online
look really nice.

03:23:15.930 --> 03:23:20.290
The website is beautiful and
we've really enjoyed working

03:23:20.290 --> 03:23:23.340
on this whole effort
with everybody involved.

03:23:23.340 --> 03:23:25.110
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
No new equipment

03:23:25.110 --> 03:23:27.490
or machinery was
needed to pull this off?

03:23:27.490 --> 03:23:29.410
&gt;&gt; Domenico Sergi: No, no new.

03:23:29.410 --> 03:23:33.830
In 2009 we did a pretty big
acquisition of new equipment.

03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:38.160
We've moved to new technology
which is instant capture now.

03:23:38.160 --> 03:23:42.860
And we're using cameras that
range from 70 megapixels,

03:23:42.860 --> 03:23:45.570
80 on up to 100 megapixels.

03:23:45.570 --> 03:23:48.590
For this particular project
we used the 80 megapixel

03:23:48.590 --> 03:23:50.290
and shot these items at a 1-to-1

03:23:50.290 --> 03:23:55.020
of their original
size at 600 PPI.

03:23:55.020 --> 03:23:56.470
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Thank you.

03:23:56.470 --> 03:24:01.920
Now, moving on to Sam, tell
us a bit about what you did.

03:24:01.920 --> 03:24:04.570
And I'll have a couple of
questions for you as well.

03:24:04.570 --> 03:24:06.160
&gt;&gt; Sam Manivong:
Okay, good afternoon.

03:24:06.160 --> 03:24:08.760
My name is Sam Manivong.

03:24:08.760 --> 03:24:13.500
Anchi mentioned that I am the
digital library specialist.

03:24:13.500 --> 03:24:15.160
I'm also [inaudible].

03:24:15.160 --> 03:24:19.650
I was kind of late
to come on board.

03:24:19.650 --> 03:24:21.160
And thanks to my
supervisor, Mike [inaudible]

03:24:21.160 --> 03:24:23.560
who assigned me to this project.

03:24:23.560 --> 03:24:25.420
And one of my colleagues
who left

03:24:25.420 --> 03:24:28.210
for a new position --
that's why I am here.

03:24:28.210 --> 03:24:31.940
So my role basically,

03:24:31.940 --> 03:24:36.100
essentially involved interacting
with all of you guys.

03:24:36.100 --> 03:24:38.680
And thank you for
making my job easier.

03:24:38.680 --> 03:24:45.770
For my role, basically I
assign the collection ID.

03:24:45.770 --> 03:24:47.100
I think it's kind of catchy.

03:24:47.100 --> 03:24:52.700
I put Omar Said 1831
as the collection ID.

03:24:52.700 --> 03:24:55.190
And I assigned the digital ID

03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:58.420
and work pretty closely
with Dominic's team.

03:24:58.420 --> 03:25:03.190
And also my role is to make
sure that we have service space

03:25:03.190 --> 03:25:08.830
to house these digital files
for public access as well

03:25:08.830 --> 03:25:13.180
as long-term storage in
case anything happens.

03:25:13.180 --> 03:25:18.080
We have plan B to back it up.

03:25:18.080 --> 03:25:29.580
In addition, I also work with
Dominic's staff, Ronnie Hawkins,

03:25:29.580 --> 03:25:35.450
Michelle Miner as
well as Andrew Cook.

03:25:35.450 --> 03:25:42.810
This staff, they have really
good experience and make sure

03:25:42.810 --> 03:25:46.210
that all the images
follow FADGI.

03:25:46.210 --> 03:25:49.360
So FADGI stand for
Federal Agency Digital

03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:51.390
Guideline Initiative.

03:25:51.390 --> 03:25:55.160
So all the images are met

03:25:55.160 --> 03:26:00.150
for the future longevity
of the collections.

03:26:00.150 --> 03:26:04.500
In addition I also developed
the permanent URL and I worked

03:26:04.500 --> 03:26:10.530
with Dave Reser to update the
IRS record for 856 and 985

03:26:10.530 --> 03:26:15.730
and for each item that
has a permanent URL.

03:26:15.730 --> 03:26:22.560
And I think that's
about it, right?

03:26:22.560 --> 03:26:23.860
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Okay.

03:26:23.860 --> 03:26:27.950
Did you do anything particularly
new from this experience

03:26:27.950 --> 03:26:33.160
in working with a selection that
you hadn't encountered before?

03:26:33.160 --> 03:26:36.830
&gt;&gt; Sam Manivong: Well, before I
didn't know who Omar Said was.

03:26:36.830 --> 03:26:42.390
And with that I learned
just the name itself.

03:26:42.390 --> 03:26:46.170
I Googled it and
learned from the project.

03:26:46.170 --> 03:26:51.260
And I think it's really,
really important that we talk.

03:26:51.260 --> 03:26:57.470
As you can see, the young high
school students coming to talk

03:26:57.470 --> 03:27:01.250
to us this afternoon
about his journey.

03:27:01.250 --> 03:27:05.160
And this is his permanent home
at the Library of Congress.

03:27:05.160 --> 03:27:06.460
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: And
what was a typical day

03:27:06.460 --> 03:27:09.190
like for you working
on this project?

03:27:09.190 --> 03:27:12.650
&gt;&gt; Sam Manivong: For this
project we have a hard deadline.

03:27:12.650 --> 03:27:16.220
So I am amazed that
we met the deadline.

03:27:16.220 --> 03:27:19.900
And basically Anchi kept
us intact and made sure

03:27:19.900 --> 03:27:24.670
that we followed
the target deadline.

03:27:24.670 --> 03:27:28.090
And we all met that.

03:27:28.090 --> 03:27:30.870
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
Okay, very good.

03:27:30.870 --> 03:27:33.860
Thank you.

03:27:33.860 --> 03:27:39.980
Christa, why don't you give us
a brief overview of your role

03:27:39.980 --> 03:27:44.200
in helping the library to
present the collection?

03:27:44.200 --> 03:27:45.500
&gt;&gt; Christa Maher: Sure.

03:27:45.500 --> 03:27:46.800
My name is Christa Maher.

03:27:46.800 --> 03:27:50.910
I'm a digital media project
coordinator here at the library.

03:27:50.910 --> 03:27:56.700
And what I do generally is
help different groups that work

03:27:56.700 --> 03:27:59.770
to get these collections
online, talking to each other.

03:27:59.770 --> 03:28:02.250
So I come in usually
at the tail end

03:28:02.250 --> 03:28:05.290
after all these folks have
done their work and Dave

03:28:05.290 --> 03:28:07.640
and the catalogers
have done their work.

03:28:07.640 --> 03:28:11.380
And I make sure that what we're
sending over to our colleagues

03:28:11.380 --> 03:28:14.450
in the Office of the Chief
Information Officer in OCIO,

03:28:14.450 --> 03:28:18.820
that they have what they need to
build the online presentation.

03:28:18.820 --> 03:28:22.490
That the content files that
Dominic created and Sam put

03:28:22.490 --> 03:28:25.230
in the presentation space
are where they need to be,

03:28:25.230 --> 03:28:27.730
that they're named according
to the metadata that we have

03:28:27.730 --> 03:28:30.000
in the catalog records.

03:28:30.000 --> 03:28:33.410
And basically put
in a lot of tickets.

03:28:33.410 --> 03:28:37.610
And I make sure that kind of
the timing is working out.

03:28:37.610 --> 03:28:41.630
As others have alluded to, there
was a kind of tight deadline

03:28:41.630 --> 03:28:43.740
for getting this
collection online,

03:28:43.740 --> 03:28:47.340
partly because of the wonderful
program we've had today.

03:28:47.340 --> 03:28:52.370
But also just because
of the work needed

03:28:52.370 --> 03:28:55.380
on the conservation
side which was impacting

03:28:55.380 --> 03:28:57.890
when things could go to be
digitized, which was impacting

03:28:57.890 --> 03:29:02.310
when Sam could QA the materials
and put them on the website.

03:29:02.310 --> 03:29:05.710
So I'm really happy that
it came out so beautifully.

03:29:05.710 --> 03:29:08.940
It's such a wonderful
collection.

03:29:08.940 --> 03:29:10.940
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Okay.

03:29:10.940 --> 03:29:17.380
How would you say users
can access LOC.gov site

03:29:17.380 --> 03:29:22.700
to find related materials to
this based on what you did?

03:29:22.700 --> 03:29:24.000
&gt;&gt; Christa Maher: Sure.

03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:25.770
So this is a wonderful
collection, but it's one

03:29:25.770 --> 03:29:28.710
of many, many, many
wonderful digital collections

03:29:28.710 --> 03:29:31.170
that the library has
been putting online

03:29:31.170 --> 03:29:35.530
for at least the
past 20-25 years.

03:29:35.530 --> 03:29:38.520
We have other collections
that have recently gone

03:29:38.520 --> 03:29:40.310
up that are in Arabic.

03:29:40.310 --> 03:29:43.630
We have other collections
that --

03:29:43.630 --> 03:29:46.070
actually we have some
WPA collections created

03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:47.370
in the 1930's.

03:29:47.370 --> 03:29:50.000
They're interviews
both audio and written

03:29:50.000 --> 03:29:52.800
with formerly enslaved people.

03:29:52.800 --> 03:29:57.450
And really using the
rich catalog record data,

03:29:57.450 --> 03:30:02.800
users can use LOC.gov
interface to find more

03:30:02.800 --> 03:30:05.780
like this suggestion at
the bottom of every page.

03:30:05.780 --> 03:30:11.820
Faceted subject terms like you'd
find in an online shopping site.

03:30:11.820 --> 03:30:14.990
And the full-text
transcriptions that we have.

03:30:14.990 --> 03:30:19.220
I mean, I think it's wonderful
that we have this collection,

03:30:19.220 --> 03:30:22.060
but it's even better
that we have it online.

03:30:22.060 --> 03:30:23.360
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
Okay, very good.

03:30:23.360 --> 03:30:25.730
And was there anything
particularly striking

03:30:25.730 --> 03:30:30.550
about your working with
this particular collection?

03:30:30.550 --> 03:30:34.010
You've been speaking
my language so far.

03:30:34.010 --> 03:30:35.310
[ Laughter ]

03:30:35.310 --> 03:30:36.610
&gt;&gt; Christa Maher: I
haven't mentioned any mark

03:30:36.610 --> 03:30:37.910
field numbers.

03:30:37.910 --> 03:30:40.430
I could do that.

03:30:40.430 --> 03:30:44.290
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
We'd say that for days.

03:30:44.290 --> 03:30:45.590
&gt;&gt; Christa Maher: For days.

03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:47.420
I think this was a
really good example

03:30:47.420 --> 03:30:50.020
of how well our colleagues
worked together

03:30:50.020 --> 03:30:51.320
across the institution.

03:30:51.320 --> 03:30:53.580
And that's always
fun to be part of.

03:30:53.580 --> 03:30:55.110
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
Very good, thank you.

03:30:55.110 --> 03:30:59.880
And now we will wrap up
our discussion portion

03:30:59.880 --> 03:31:02.510
with Dave Reser who
I think at the time

03:31:02.510 --> 03:31:05.340
that he was doing this was
a part of our operation.

03:31:05.340 --> 03:31:06.690
But he's since moved on.

03:31:06.690 --> 03:31:08.670
But he will always be ours.

03:31:08.670 --> 03:31:11.730
And so now he will talk
about the other aspect

03:31:11.730 --> 03:31:15.350
of the cataloging and
metadata of that side.

03:31:15.350 --> 03:31:20.390
So Dave, fill us in on
your role in making this.

03:31:20.390 --> 03:31:22.540
&gt;&gt;David Reser: My metadata
history here is only three

03:31:22.540 --> 03:31:24.770
decades, not four
and a half decades.

03:31:24.770 --> 03:31:26.070
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Hey,

03:31:26.070 --> 03:31:28.660
everybody can't have
four and a half decades.

03:31:28.660 --> 03:31:31.760
&gt;&gt; David Reser: So the role
that I bring to this along

03:31:31.760 --> 03:31:36.640
with some catalogers is to
take obviously the images

03:31:36.640 --> 03:31:39.620
that have been made that Sam
has carefully stored away.

03:31:39.620 --> 03:31:43.380
And Christa is telling us what
we need to have in those records

03:31:43.380 --> 03:31:45.740
in order to get them
up on the website.

03:31:45.740 --> 03:31:50.100
So it's basically
traditional cataloging.

03:31:50.100 --> 03:31:53.550
So we had two spectacular
senior catalogers

03:31:53.550 --> 03:31:55.180
who helped us out with this.

03:31:55.180 --> 03:31:56.480
One is here today.

03:31:56.480 --> 03:31:59.000
So Debra Wynn might
want to raise her hand.

03:31:59.000 --> 03:32:01.390
She's in the rare
materials section,

03:32:01.390 --> 03:32:04.460
actually reports to Beacher.

03:32:04.460 --> 03:32:08.190
And one of the things
that she divided this work

03:32:08.190 --> 03:32:12.850
with another cataloger who's
not here today, Alan Mayberry.

03:32:12.850 --> 03:32:17.470
And the way we split the content
was the Arabic stuff was done

03:32:17.470 --> 03:32:22.060
by Alan who is a specialist
in Near East materials

03:32:22.060 --> 03:32:27.970
and has done all kinds of Arabic
script manuscripts and all kinds

03:32:27.970 --> 03:32:32.630
of things for the African
and Middle Eastern Division.

03:32:32.630 --> 03:32:35.380
And so Debra focused
on the English things

03:32:35.380 --> 03:32:39.120
which were not only the typed
script published materials

03:32:39.120 --> 03:32:46.550
but the handwritten holograph,
the content that was there.

03:32:46.550 --> 03:32:51.910
The real challenge of course
was that, as Shelly mentioned,

03:32:51.910 --> 03:32:54.850
this project required a lot of
things to be done concurrently

03:32:54.850 --> 03:32:57.440
that really have to
be don sequentially.

03:32:57.440 --> 03:33:01.820
And so I had some catalogers
raring and ready to go,

03:33:01.820 --> 03:33:04.010
but nothing for them to catalog.

03:33:04.010 --> 03:33:06.760
Because it was undergoing
a very important work

03:33:06.760 --> 03:33:09.910
in the conservation
and then the scanning.

03:33:09.910 --> 03:33:14.030
So that typically is done at
the very front of the process

03:33:14.030 --> 03:33:17.580
and then we come back after all
that information is available

03:33:17.580 --> 03:33:19.320
to us on the digital images

03:33:19.320 --> 03:33:21.750
and we update the
records with that content.

03:33:21.750 --> 03:33:25.430
So at this time we have to
kind of turn that on its ear,

03:33:25.430 --> 03:33:30.420
catalog as best we could with
the information we had in order

03:33:30.420 --> 03:33:34.680
for Christa to test development
of the website itself.

03:33:34.680 --> 03:33:38.000
Actually Alan did a few records

03:33:38.000 --> 03:33:43.190
that were just not even
halfway done, which was fine.

03:33:43.190 --> 03:33:45.760
Because it was all that
was needed to pull it

03:33:45.760 --> 03:33:48.600
in to make sure that we
could display the content

03:33:48.600 --> 03:33:52.750
and then he could come
back as Debra did to finish

03:33:52.750 --> 03:33:56.690
of those records when
it was actually possible

03:33:56.690 --> 03:33:58.900
to see some of that material.

03:33:58.900 --> 03:34:02.460
I think one of the real
interesting things for me

03:34:02.460 --> 03:34:04.600
in this -- I've been
involved in a lot of projects

03:34:04.600 --> 03:34:07.210
that were digital
content before.

03:34:07.210 --> 03:34:09.690
But because of the
backward nature of this one,

03:34:09.690 --> 03:34:11.300
I got to see more up front.

03:34:11.300 --> 03:34:14.160
I was telling Shelly
and Sylvia this morning,

03:34:14.160 --> 03:34:15.850
I had no idea all this stuff

03:34:15.850 --> 03:34:18.730
that actually happened
at their stage.

03:34:18.730 --> 03:34:23.910
And it was the project
meetings that Anchi was having

03:34:23.910 --> 03:34:28.330
with us monthly that it
actually allowed us to get clued

03:34:28.330 --> 03:34:32.030
in a little bit that we're
still waiting months to be able

03:34:32.030 --> 03:34:33.740
to have the thing to catalog.

03:34:33.740 --> 03:34:36.240
But they took pictures
of the things.

03:34:36.240 --> 03:34:39.520
And so those conservation
images that they had

03:34:39.520 --> 03:34:44.150
to document the before and after
process was something we were

03:34:44.150 --> 03:34:45.940
able to give to the catalogers.

03:34:45.940 --> 03:34:49.660
They didn't need to see
Dominic's spectacular images.

03:34:49.660 --> 03:34:51.320
The photographs that were taken

03:34:51.320 --> 03:34:54.260
in conservation were
really great for us.

03:34:54.260 --> 03:34:58.780
And although I can't
read my own handwriting,

03:34:58.780 --> 03:35:03.110
Debra is quite expert
at looking at 17th-

03:35:03.110 --> 03:35:05.270
and 18th-century handwriting.

03:35:05.270 --> 03:35:08.160
But we actually got
to supplement

03:35:08.160 --> 03:35:11.050
that as Dr. Rothman
said this morning,

03:35:11.050 --> 03:35:13.320
he actually did transcribe all

03:35:13.320 --> 03:35:14.920
of the handwritten
English things.

03:35:14.920 --> 03:35:18.440
So we were able to get those to
Debra even before she was able

03:35:18.440 --> 03:35:19.940
to see the images as well.

03:35:19.940 --> 03:35:26.260
So some of those things that
initially make this kind of hard

03:35:26.260 --> 03:35:28.290
from a workflow perspective.

03:35:28.290 --> 03:35:32.510
There were a million things
that could happen along the way.

03:35:32.510 --> 03:35:36.400
It all actually got
completed before we had to.

03:35:36.400 --> 03:35:40.170
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: It
sounds like things got tossed

03:35:40.170 --> 03:35:44.840
on their heads but you stepped
in as catalogers are able

03:35:44.840 --> 03:35:47.410
to do and make it happen.

03:35:47.410 --> 03:35:53.380
Was there a reason for
choosing the level of cataloging

03:35:53.380 --> 03:35:55.840
that was applied
to the collection?

03:35:55.840 --> 03:35:58.550
&gt;&gt; David Reser: I think this
is a big discussion we have

03:35:58.550 --> 03:36:01.580
with Christa every time we talk
about a new digital collection.

03:36:01.580 --> 03:36:05.190
We have to have the metadata
for the items in the collection.

03:36:05.190 --> 03:36:07.990
We have choices on how we can do

03:36:07.990 --> 03:36:10.820
that in order to
feed our website.

03:36:10.820 --> 03:36:14.910
There are some that are better
than others in certain cases

03:36:14.910 --> 03:36:17.860
that we can make finding
aids that just document

03:36:17.860 --> 03:36:20.620
or list the items
and we can make kind

03:36:20.620 --> 03:36:23.450
of non-mark stub
records that can feed

03:36:23.450 --> 03:36:26.260
that online presentation.

03:36:26.260 --> 03:36:30.030
But usually the best method
if we have the resources is

03:36:30.030 --> 03:36:32.790
to actually do traditional
library cataloging

03:36:32.790 --> 03:36:34.670
in our online catalog.

03:36:34.670 --> 03:36:38.530
And because this was -- even
though the timeframe was short,

03:36:38.530 --> 03:36:44.200
it was only 42 items so it was
the kind of thing we were able

03:36:44.200 --> 03:36:45.990
to get to very good catalogers

03:36:45.990 --> 03:36:48.930
who knew what they
were really up against.

03:36:48.930 --> 03:36:53.150
So it was almost a no-brainer
to decide that we would stick

03:36:53.150 --> 03:36:55.990
with regular mark
records in our catalog.

03:36:55.990 --> 03:36:59.620
And it's also I think
from my perspective,

03:36:59.620 --> 03:37:02.520
in thinking about this
as a digital collection,

03:37:02.520 --> 03:37:04.980
obviously these are materials
that are going to end

03:37:04.980 --> 03:37:08.540
up as physical items
in our Rare Book

03:37:08.540 --> 03:37:10.250
and Special Collections
division.

03:37:10.250 --> 03:37:13.100
So putting them in
our library catalog

03:37:13.100 --> 03:37:16.210
where we can then record the
inventory that we have for each

03:37:16.210 --> 03:37:19.340
of these items as well
is a very critical piece.

03:37:19.340 --> 03:37:22.340
And so that kind of helps
drive that decision as well.

03:37:22.340 --> 03:37:24.390
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Okay, well
my second question was going

03:37:24.390 --> 03:37:27.350
to be along the lines
of what are some

03:37:27.350 --> 03:37:30.330
of the challenges you faced,
but I think you hit on those.

03:37:30.330 --> 03:37:32.000
Are there any others
that you didn't bring

03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:33.970
because you were
going back and forth

03:37:33.970 --> 03:37:37.080
in a nontraditional workflow?

03:37:37.080 --> 03:37:39.360
&gt;&gt; 1y: It's kind of related.

03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:42.840
The catalogers who worked
with us in this one,

03:37:42.840 --> 03:37:47.380
the challenge became with Alan
Mayberry got assigned to work

03:37:47.380 --> 03:37:53.960
on the Arabic materials but he
had retired a few weeks before.

03:37:54.990 --> 03:38:00.010
When your expert retires, but
again we're incredibly fortunate

03:38:00.010 --> 03:38:05.220
that Alan and Debra
are a couple.

03:38:05.220 --> 03:38:09.140
And so it just turned out that
he was staying here for a while

03:38:09.140 --> 03:38:11.880
after retirement to volunteer.

03:38:11.880 --> 03:38:17.700
So he was able to do some of
the cataloging after he retired

03:38:17.700 --> 03:38:20.550
and do some volunteer
work for us.

03:38:20.550 --> 03:38:22.260
They are also bicoastal.

03:38:22.260 --> 03:38:26.310
So Alan's living part-time
in Portland, Oregon.

03:38:26.310 --> 03:38:30.510
And so we had to schedule
the work that he was doing

03:38:30.510 --> 03:38:34.340
on the cataloging on his
trips back here as well.

03:38:34.340 --> 03:38:37.790
So it was always good that
Debra and Alan could be

03:38:37.790 --> 03:38:41.170
in communication as couples are.

03:38:41.170 --> 03:38:44.620
And help us with
solving that problem.

03:38:44.620 --> 03:38:48.030
And Alan's come back at least
twice to volunteer since then

03:38:48.030 --> 03:38:51.850
and he was able to complete the
records after the conservation

03:38:51.850 --> 03:38:55.280
and scanning and actually got to
look at the materials as well.

03:38:55.280 --> 03:38:58.750
So that wrapped things
up nicely.

03:38:58.750 --> 03:39:00.050
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Very good.

03:39:00.050 --> 03:39:01.350
Thank you, Dave.

03:39:01.350 --> 03:39:05.280
Are there any more comments
before we open it for questions,

03:39:05.280 --> 03:39:09.710
based on anything anybody
else said after you spoke?

03:39:09.710 --> 03:39:14.320
Okay, with that then
we open the floor

03:39:14.320 --> 03:39:17.030
for any questions
from the attendees.

03:39:17.030 --> 03:39:20.150
I see a hand there.

03:39:21.360 --> 03:39:22.660
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

03:39:22.660 --> 03:39:23.960
Thank you very much.

03:39:23.960 --> 03:39:28.840
I just bought the book now
and I noticed on page 60 --

03:39:30.790 --> 03:39:38.470
on page 58, the Arabic
pagination is numbered five.

03:39:38.470 --> 03:39:44.820
And then on the following page
the Arabic pagination is 14.

03:39:44.820 --> 03:39:47.150
So nine pages are missing.

03:39:47.150 --> 03:39:51.220
Were they found missing
or is that intentional?

03:39:51.220 --> 03:39:56.330
And correction, when I
looked at the Library

03:39:56.330 --> 03:39:59.910
of Congress film video, it says

03:39:59.910 --> 03:40:03.890
that he wrote a 15-page
autobiography

03:40:03.890 --> 03:40:07.070
when that's not true if
some pages are missing.

03:40:08.360 --> 03:40:11.030
&gt;&gt; Shelly Smith: I think
you're referring to the images

03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:14.180
that you can see here where
there's five on one page

03:40:14.180 --> 03:40:16.150
and on the other page.

03:40:16.150 --> 03:40:23.030
So the manuscript is
constructed of numerous pages

03:40:23.030 --> 03:40:25.490
that are nested within
each other.

03:40:25.490 --> 03:40:31.240
So as you turn the pages,
you have say five and six,

03:40:31.240 --> 03:40:33.940
and then you would
have the next page

03:40:33.940 --> 03:40:36.110
in the sequence would
be six and seven.

03:40:36.110 --> 03:40:41.280
But the conjugate to that
is far later in the section,

03:40:41.280 --> 03:40:47.880
so the conjugate to page five
would be page 20-something.

03:40:47.880 --> 03:40:51.010
Does that make sense?

03:40:51.010 --> 03:40:52.310
[ Laughter ]

03:40:52.310 --> 03:40:54.040
[ Inaudible ]

03:40:54.040 --> 03:40:55.760
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Albro: There
are not any missing pages.

03:40:55.760 --> 03:40:58.220
There are not any missing pages.

03:40:58.220 --> 03:40:59.850
That's important to note.

03:40:59.850 --> 03:41:03.580
And since that second
sewing structure sewed

03:41:03.580 --> 03:41:05.730
through the fold, we knew

03:41:05.730 --> 03:41:08.880
that the entire manuscript
was just one section.

03:41:08.880 --> 03:41:12.200
It was numbered in
pencil and the name

03:41:12.200 --> 03:41:17.490
of the first translator whose
name was Alexander Costhial was

03:41:17.490 --> 03:41:20.980
written in the same pencil
inside the front cover.

03:41:20.980 --> 03:41:25.050
So I would suspect that
he numbered the pages.

03:41:25.050 --> 03:41:29.460
And there weren't
any missing pages.

03:41:29.460 --> 03:41:32.820
&gt;&gt; Shelly Smith: There is one
page in the center that's torn

03:41:32.820 --> 03:41:35.860
and so there is a portion
of that page that's missing.

03:41:35.860 --> 03:41:38.510
But that was a blank page.

03:41:38.510 --> 03:41:45.300
[ Inaudible ]

03:41:45.300 --> 03:41:49.360
Well, you're talking about
the front and the back.

03:41:49.360 --> 03:41:50.960
Some people call that a page.

03:41:50.960 --> 03:41:54.500
Some people call that a leaf.

03:41:54.500 --> 03:41:56.800
It's terminology.

03:42:00.040 --> 03:42:01.340
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Yes, ma'am?

03:42:01.340 --> 03:42:02.640
&gt;&gt; Yes, I have two questions.

03:42:02.640 --> 03:42:05.310
Number one, do you have any
links with the webpage back

03:42:05.310 --> 03:42:09.650
to Omar's origination
in Senegal?

03:42:09.650 --> 03:42:12.550
And does the library have
any working relationships

03:42:12.550 --> 03:42:16.200
with libraries and
universities in Senegal in terms

03:42:16.200 --> 03:42:22.100
of his passage back and forth?

03:42:22.100 --> 03:42:25.380
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: I'll let
Mary Jane respond to that.

03:42:25.380 --> 03:42:30.050
I do not know of any.

03:42:30.050 --> 03:42:31.350
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Thank you.

03:42:31.350 --> 03:42:37.090
No, we do not have any
specific relationship

03:42:37.090 --> 03:42:39.660
with the University of Senegal.

03:42:39.660 --> 03:42:44.230
However, we did go to Senegal

03:42:44.230 --> 03:42:54.290
to brief West Africa Research
Center for our acquisitions.

03:42:54.290 --> 03:43:00.810
And so in fact in Dakar we
are working cooperatively

03:43:00.810 --> 03:43:07.990
with the West Africa Research
Center that actually collects

03:43:07.990 --> 03:43:14.850
and purchases books for the
African collections here.

03:43:14.850 --> 03:43:21.720
So there are 11 countries in
West Africa who are participants

03:43:21.720 --> 03:43:27.290
in a project to purchase for
the Library of Congress as well

03:43:27.290 --> 03:43:32.180
as for other institutions
publications from countries

03:43:32.180 --> 03:43:36.480
such as Mali, Gambia, Togo
and other countries, Guinea.

03:43:36.480 --> 03:43:47.520
And to catalog them in Dakar
and then to send them to us.

03:43:47.520 --> 03:43:56.220
So this is a collaborative
agreement that we have

03:43:56.220 --> 03:44:00.060
with Ala Alryye and
Angela Kinney who's working

03:44:00.060 --> 03:44:06.290
with Ala Alryye, is very
much involved in this.

03:44:06.290 --> 03:44:14.200
And I went to Dakar to brief
the bibliographic representative

03:44:14.200 --> 03:44:16.080
there, to give them
the guidelines

03:44:16.080 --> 03:44:18.290
to purchase our materials.

03:44:18.290 --> 03:44:19.590
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
Yes, that is true.

03:44:19.590 --> 03:44:22.350
And I guess I view these as part

03:44:22.350 --> 03:44:24.370
of our acquisitions
relationships.

03:44:24.370 --> 03:44:26.640
And the way we acquire
materials is

03:44:26.640 --> 03:44:29.500
through vendor agreements
and what not.

03:44:29.500 --> 03:44:31.130
But I don't consider
that agreement

03:44:31.130 --> 03:44:35.360
with a standing institution
in the sense of what we did

03:44:35.360 --> 03:44:37.400
to get the Said collection.

03:44:37.400 --> 03:44:41.310
So my fault for not answering
your questions along the

03:44:41.310 --> 03:44:44.270
acquisitions line, which
I certainly could have.

03:44:44.270 --> 03:44:47.390
And did we answer
both your questions?

03:44:47.390 --> 03:44:48.690
&gt;&gt; Yes.

03:44:48.690 --> 03:44:49.990
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
Okay, thank you.

03:44:49.990 --> 03:44:52.110
And this gentleman.

03:44:52.110 --> 03:44:55.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you so
much for the presentation.

03:44:55.570 --> 03:44:59.670
It was really a wonderful
job that you have done.

03:44:59.670 --> 03:45:04.730
We are working on -- what you
have done is very professional.

03:45:04.730 --> 03:45:09.840
We have collections that
date back maybe 800 years

03:45:09.840 --> 03:45:11.720
in a town in Ethiopia.

03:45:11.720 --> 03:45:16.840
And most of those books
are left in nature.

03:45:16.840 --> 03:45:18.620
Some of them are intact.

03:45:18.620 --> 03:45:22.340
We were wondering,
like you've mentioned

03:45:22.340 --> 03:45:24.800
that you have acquired
new machines.

03:45:24.800 --> 03:45:26.100
We don't have the budget.

03:45:26.100 --> 03:45:32.360
Is there any like way that it
could be done on a normal budget

03:45:32.360 --> 03:45:35.030
with volunteers so
that we can expose this

03:45:35.030 --> 03:45:36.490
to the rest of the world?

03:45:36.490 --> 03:45:39.630
And some of those
scripts were written

03:45:39.630 --> 03:45:46.950
by African Ethiopian women which
were very rare at that time.

03:45:46.950 --> 03:45:52.380
So it would definitely
present a very good history

03:45:52.380 --> 03:45:55.810
which is not known
up to this moment.

03:45:55.810 --> 03:46:00.910
So what do you advise and what
do you think can be done not

03:46:00.910 --> 03:46:04.540
through like the Library
of Congress in style

03:46:04.540 --> 03:46:08.880
and profession, but by a
community who wants to preserve

03:46:08.880 --> 03:46:13.070
that part of history and bring
it to the rest of the world?

03:46:13.070 --> 03:46:15.370
Thank you.

03:46:18.060 --> 03:46:20.050
&gt;&gt; David Reser: I guess
I'll take that question.

03:46:20.050 --> 03:46:25.420
So the technology that
you were speaking of,

03:46:25.420 --> 03:46:26.720
what do you have available?

03:46:26.720 --> 03:46:33.570
&gt;&gt; We have this like -- we only
have one machine and it is just

03:46:33.570 --> 03:46:37.090
like pictures, the document.

03:46:37.090 --> 03:46:40.300
And some of them are
in binders and some

03:46:40.300 --> 03:46:43.310
of them are in loose pages.

03:46:43.310 --> 03:46:48.460
But we don't have much and we
have like, cameras, but it's not

03:46:48.460 --> 03:46:51.830
like an organized
like technology setup

03:46:51.830 --> 03:46:53.730
that we have in place now.

03:46:53.730 --> 03:46:56.720
&gt;&gt; David Reser: Well, aside from
the really high-end equipment

03:46:56.720 --> 03:47:00.540
that we use here, there
are several other cameras

03:47:00.540 --> 03:47:03.880
on the market that
are more affordable

03:47:03.880 --> 03:47:08.550
and do a good enough
job to document.

03:47:08.550 --> 03:47:10.720
Especially if you're
going for the content

03:47:10.720 --> 03:47:14.080
which is on these documents.

03:47:14.080 --> 03:47:17.870
Using a flatbed scanner may
not be the best approach

03:47:17.870 --> 03:47:21.820
because of the bound
ones you're mentioning.

03:47:21.820 --> 03:47:24.810
It just applies too
much pressure and stress

03:47:24.810 --> 03:47:26.820
on the documents, especially

03:47:26.820 --> 03:47:30.220
with the lid coming
down over it.

03:47:30.220 --> 03:47:35.690
But I would research
other cameras.

03:47:35.690 --> 03:47:40.210
Canon, Sony, they make
many, many makes and models

03:47:40.210 --> 03:47:43.380
that can give you a high
enough resolution to be able

03:47:43.380 --> 03:47:47.270
to document these things
and keep them and share them

03:47:47.270 --> 03:47:49.550
with the right people.

03:47:49.550 --> 03:47:53.040
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: And I guess
he has contact information,

03:47:53.040 --> 03:47:56.170
you can email him and get more
information following this.

03:47:56.170 --> 03:47:57.470
&gt;&gt;David Reser: Right.

03:47:57.470 --> 03:47:58.770
Like he's saying, you
can stay in touch with us

03:47:58.770 --> 03:48:04.020
and we can make recommendations
for you as well.

03:48:06.580 --> 03:48:08.510

[ Inaudible ]

03:48:12.160 --> 03:48:14.980
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper:
There's another agency

03:48:14.980 --> 03:48:17.230
that you can get in touch with.

03:48:17.230 --> 03:48:20.450
The AU, African Union,
has a program

03:48:20.450 --> 03:48:31.150
to assist different countries in
Africa in actually making copies

03:48:31.150 --> 03:48:37.220
of materials and help with that.

03:48:37.220 --> 03:48:44.960
And there's another
library association,

03:48:44.960 --> 03:48:49.690
African Librarians Association,
which they have ways

03:48:49.690 --> 03:48:54.730
to connect other
African countries

03:48:54.730 --> 03:48:58.170
with cataloging projects.

03:48:59.280 --> 03:49:07.940
So they are the organizations
that actually do it.

03:49:13.050 --> 03:49:16.190
&gt;&gt; Hello. I'd just like to
know if I can ask the lady

03:49:16.190 --> 03:49:20.770
from Senegal how much did
the gentleman acquire it for,

03:49:20.770 --> 03:49:24.240
the one who was the
only man bidding on it?

03:49:24.240 --> 03:49:27.400
And then how much
did the Library

03:49:27.400 --> 03:49:31.320
of Congress acquire
it for at Sotheby's?

03:49:31.320 --> 03:49:32.620
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
Well, we're not likely

03:49:32.620 --> 03:49:33.920
to share that information?

03:49:33.920 --> 03:49:37.390
But just know that we
worked hard to get it.

03:49:37.390 --> 03:49:43.910
I don't think this is
the forum for that.

03:49:43.910 --> 03:49:45.490
You're welcome.

03:49:45.490 --> 03:49:48.600
Mary Jane, then Jane.

03:49:48.600 --> 03:49:49.900
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Okay.

03:49:49.900 --> 03:49:51.200
First of all I want
to thank you,

03:49:51.200 --> 03:49:52.500
not only for this
wonderful panel

03:49:52.500 --> 03:49:55.890
but for all the incredible
work that you've been doing

03:49:55.890 --> 03:49:59.090
for the past six
months, one year.

03:49:59.090 --> 03:50:02.190
And I'm going to put
you on the spot now.

03:50:02.190 --> 03:50:07.530
I'm going to ask you, I know you
enjoyed working with each other.

03:50:07.530 --> 03:50:11.450
Would you do it again?

03:50:11.450 --> 03:50:15.980
And would you do it let's
say for a smaller project?

03:50:15.980 --> 03:50:18.930
Do you think this is
something that works,

03:50:18.930 --> 03:50:21.890
working together
the way you have?

03:50:21.890 --> 03:50:26.280
And would it be different if
it was thousands and thousands

03:50:26.280 --> 03:50:30.240
of documents that
needed to be processed?

03:50:30.240 --> 03:50:35.160
And so, the question
is to all of you.

03:50:35.160 --> 03:50:40.170
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: I can't
imagine who's going to say no.

03:50:40.170 --> 03:50:41.470
&gt;&gt; Shelly Smith: Exactly.

03:50:41.470 --> 03:50:42.770
We'd do it again.

03:50:42.770 --> 03:50:45.260
I think we've already started.

03:50:45.260 --> 03:50:46.560
Absolutely.

03:50:46.560 --> 03:50:53.630
I mean, I think that every
project is slightly different

03:50:53.630 --> 03:50:59.180
and yes, we all talked about
how the timeline was difficult

03:50:59.180 --> 03:51:03.130
because so many things
ideally should have happened

03:51:03.130 --> 03:51:04.650
and then moved on
to the next thing.

03:51:04.650 --> 03:51:07.010
And there wasn't time
to do that in this case.

03:51:07.010 --> 03:51:10.570
But doesn't that
happen all the time?

03:51:10.570 --> 03:51:13.850
I mean, I feel like even --
there is no perfect project.

03:51:13.850 --> 03:51:23.030
And what makes it worthwhile and
a good experience is the quality

03:51:23.030 --> 03:51:25.940
and the expertise and
the joy of working

03:51:25.940 --> 03:51:29.620
with our excellent colleagues.

03:51:33.040 --> 03:51:34.970
&gt;&gt;David Reser: I think the other
thing that's quite different

03:51:34.970 --> 03:51:38.010
about this one, so
I did face this

03:51:38.010 --> 03:51:42.110
in just any other digital
project when we first started.

03:51:42.110 --> 03:51:44.850
And it wasn't until you
get into it more that --

03:51:44.850 --> 03:51:49.090
I didn't realize that you
were going to do the work

03:51:49.090 --> 03:51:51.550
with the high school
students that made it just

03:51:51.550 --> 03:51:53.740
that much more spectacular.

03:51:53.740 --> 03:51:56.940
I didn't know that Shelly was
going to do a PR campaign,

03:51:56.940 --> 03:51:59.710
that you couldn't turn around
in Washington without knowing

03:51:59.710 --> 03:52:02.720
about this collection
and this program today.

03:52:02.720 --> 03:52:06.420
So the type of emphasis
that went

03:52:06.420 --> 03:52:10.790
into this particular collection
just really made it special.

03:52:11.800 --> 03:52:13.550
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Anybody?

03:52:13.550 --> 03:52:17.570
&gt;&gt; Christa Maher: I guess
I'll just echo what Dave said.

03:52:17.570 --> 03:52:20.080
I was approaching this
very much like one

03:52:20.080 --> 03:52:23.500
of the four dozen new
collections we tend

03:52:23.500 --> 03:52:24.800
to put on every year.

03:52:24.800 --> 03:52:29.810
So I think coming into it I
thought, "Well, this was a lot

03:52:29.810 --> 03:52:31.770
of overhead for 42 items."

03:52:31.770 --> 03:52:34.390
We're putting up
Woodrow Wilson's papers

03:52:34.390 --> 03:52:37.660
and that's 400 reels
of microfilm.

03:52:37.660 --> 03:52:39.710
But I think having
the opportunity

03:52:39.710 --> 03:52:45.090
to really do this deep dive
I think did make an impact.

03:52:45.090 --> 03:52:46.390
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Very good.

03:52:46.390 --> 03:52:47.690
Thank you.

03:52:47.690 --> 03:52:48.990
&gt;&gt; Sam Manivong: I'd like
to add one more point.

03:52:48.990 --> 03:52:50.290
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Sorry.

03:52:50.290 --> 03:52:51.590
&gt;&gt; Sam Manivong: To answer
the question, I'd say yes,

03:52:51.590 --> 03:52:53.140
definitely I'd do it again.

03:52:53.140 --> 03:52:59.530
I felt that as of today our
presentation as we all know

03:52:59.530 --> 03:53:04.870
as P1, at this point, this
system being quite mature.

03:53:04.870 --> 03:53:07.950
And as Christa put
in the tickets,

03:53:07.950 --> 03:53:13.460
I felt things were moving faster
than the last couple of years.

03:53:13.460 --> 03:53:18.580
This would be my first
project for 2019 this year,

03:53:18.580 --> 03:53:20.120
and it went really well.

03:53:20.120 --> 03:53:22.450
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Jane?

03:53:22.450 --> 03:53:23.750
Jane?

03:53:23.750 --> 03:53:26.540
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

03:53:26.540 --> 03:53:29.340
Just a quick question to Sylvia.

03:53:29.340 --> 03:53:32.690
I'm sorry to ask you to repeat
yourself, but your story

03:53:32.690 --> 03:53:36.020
about the threads was
absolutely fascinating.

03:53:36.020 --> 03:53:40.270
And you mentioned that the cover
stitching is the same thread

03:53:40.270 --> 03:53:43.710
as that used in other
Isaac Bird translations.

03:53:43.710 --> 03:53:47.680
But I didn't catch what you
said about the earlier threading

03:53:47.680 --> 03:53:50.190
that you had found
underneath that and what

03:53:50.190 --> 03:53:53.220
that connected to
in your research.

03:53:53.220 --> 03:53:56.150
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Albro:
Okay, thank you.

03:53:56.150 --> 03:54:00.980
The earlier thread which is very
different from the thread used

03:54:00.980 --> 03:54:06.200
to attach the cover, was
used to sew through the fold

03:54:06.200 --> 03:54:09.630
of Omar Ibn Said's manuscript.

03:54:09.630 --> 03:54:14.720
But we noticed since we were
working on all 42 objects

03:54:14.720 --> 03:54:20.450
in the same spate of time, that
the same thread had been used

03:54:20.450 --> 03:54:26.170
to sew the solicited manuscripts
that were from West Africa

03:54:26.170 --> 03:54:28.510
that were primarily --

03:54:28.510 --> 03:54:30.980
the calligraphy was

03:54:30.980 --> 03:54:37.960
by an individual identified
as Mohammed Decker.

03:54:37.960 --> 03:54:41.690
And so we'll have to have
the historians explain more

03:54:41.690 --> 03:54:43.390
about who he was.

03:54:43.390 --> 03:54:49.340
But Theodore Dwight wrote to
the president of Liberia asking

03:54:49.340 --> 03:54:53.200
if he could procure some
manuscripts from the part

03:54:53.200 --> 03:54:57.650
of West Africa that Omar Ibn
Said was from in an attempt

03:54:57.650 --> 03:55:00.990
to understand more about what
the culture of the people

03:55:00.990 --> 03:55:02.470
who lived in that area were.

03:55:02.470 --> 03:55:08.390
And so those manuscripts are
also multi-page manuscripts

03:55:08.390 --> 03:55:09.950
and they're in this collection

03:55:09.950 --> 03:55:13.250
and they also required
some conservation.

03:55:13.250 --> 03:55:16.260
Because pages were falling out.

03:55:16.260 --> 03:55:19.550
But they were sewn
with the same thread.

03:55:19.550 --> 03:55:23.410
So to me that means that the
person that collected these

03:55:23.410 --> 03:55:28.760
in the US probably
sewed all of those.

03:55:28.760 --> 03:55:33.220
But we have photographs
before the treatment

03:55:33.220 --> 03:55:37.320
and we've saved the threads,
and some that didn't have

03:55:37.320 --> 03:55:39.900
to be disbound were
not disbound.

03:55:39.900 --> 03:55:45.100
We only took out the thread if
it was preventing the manuscript

03:55:45.100 --> 03:55:50.020
from opening or if pages
were falling out and broken.

03:55:50.020 --> 03:55:54.200
So we would not typically
remove a thread unless it has

03:55:54.200 --> 03:55:59.510
to in order to facilitate
the use of the manuscript.

03:56:01.170 --> 03:56:02.770
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: It just
seemed to me one of the things,

03:56:02.770 --> 03:56:05.490
just to underscore,
you describing

03:56:05.490 --> 03:56:10.290
that again just shows
you cannot minutely plan

03:56:10.290 --> 03:56:12.780
for how long it will
take you to do your work,

03:56:12.780 --> 03:56:15.720
no matter what it
looks like initially.

03:56:15.720 --> 03:56:19.170
I'm not sure we picked
up on that,

03:56:19.170 --> 03:56:22.030
but the more we discuss it,
that's just critical to know

03:56:22.030 --> 03:56:28.210
with all the things that
we get for the library.

03:56:28.210 --> 03:56:34.350
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: My
guess may be Derrick Beard,

03:56:34.350 --> 03:56:41.270
because of his ability
and experience

03:56:41.270 --> 03:56:51.570
with collecting various
artifacts, rare books, items,

03:56:51.570 --> 03:56:55.950
he may be the person
that did that.

03:56:55.950 --> 03:56:58.230
But this is my wild guess.

03:56:58.230 --> 03:57:01.880
Because of his rich background

03:57:01.880 --> 03:57:05.670
in collecting antiques
and so forth.

03:57:05.670 --> 03:57:08.460
And someone like that
from his background --

03:57:08.460 --> 03:57:17.140
I didn't read everything
that this man had the ability

03:57:17.140 --> 03:57:20.710
or knowledge of to do that.

03:57:20.710 --> 03:57:27.010
Because he did a lot of
sharing of the manuscripts,

03:57:27.010 --> 03:57:32.020
not only Omar Ibn Said but
the others in the group.

03:57:32.020 --> 03:57:34.360
And that's a guess.

03:57:34.360 --> 03:57:37.180
But I think that's
an educated guess.

03:57:37.180 --> 03:57:39.150
&gt;&gt; Sylvia Albro: Well, these
things are always puzzles.

03:57:39.150 --> 03:57:40.760
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: Yeah.

03:57:40.760 --> 03:57:42.770
&gt;&gt; Domenico Sergi: I don't think
it could be Beard, Marieta,

03:57:42.770 --> 03:57:47.830
and the reason why is because
we know that the cover was sewed

03:57:47.830 --> 03:57:58.310
on by Cothiel 20 years after
the manuscript was made.

03:57:58.310 --> 03:58:02.540
And so that would have been
in the mid-19th century.

03:58:02.540 --> 03:58:08.410
So that thread that was hidden
inside couldn't have been put

03:58:08.410 --> 03:58:09.710
on after the cover.

03:58:09.710 --> 03:58:12.550
It had to go on before.

03:58:12.550 --> 03:58:17.400
So it does tell you
perhaps the time

03:58:17.400 --> 03:58:19.810
that those other
manuscripts were collected.

03:58:19.810 --> 03:58:23.720
But there's also documentation
about those that's in writing.

03:58:23.720 --> 03:58:26.870
So it's just a material clue.

03:58:26.870 --> 03:58:32.390
But I think material clues
have their own contribution.

03:58:34.150 --> 03:58:36.280
[ Inaudible ]

03:58:36.280 --> 03:58:38.410
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins: Deb?

03:58:38.410 --> 03:58:42.280
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm usually
in the back room.

03:58:42.280 --> 03:58:44.040
I don't use these things.

03:58:44.040 --> 03:58:47.500
Just one thing that
reminded me about this,

03:58:47.500 --> 03:58:50.270
because being a cataloger
and being able to go

03:58:50.270 --> 03:58:54.740
through these things item
by item, I had to do a lot

03:58:54.740 --> 03:58:58.270
of research because all
these names, this Cothiel

03:58:58.270 --> 03:59:00.920
and Isaac Byrd and
Mohammed Decker --

03:59:00.920 --> 03:59:02.820
I had to make name authorities

03:59:02.820 --> 03:59:04.790
for every one of
these people too.

03:59:04.790 --> 03:59:06.550
And I had to go back to do that.

03:59:06.550 --> 03:59:07.850
To do my job correctly,

03:59:07.850 --> 03:59:09.830
I'm looking for authoritative
sources.

03:59:09.830 --> 03:59:13.500
So I was reading a lot of the
literature just to be able

03:59:13.500 --> 03:59:15.010
to catalog the materials.

03:59:15.010 --> 03:59:17.860
So in the process
of doing that --

03:59:17.860 --> 03:59:22.000
that's what I love about
this job at the library,

03:59:22.000 --> 03:59:24.770
is that for everything
that comes across my desk,

03:59:24.770 --> 03:59:29.690
if my supervisor lets me,
I can really dig in deep

03:59:29.690 --> 03:59:32.860
and learn a lot and
take a lot of time.

03:59:32.860 --> 03:59:38.830
But with this one there was a
deadline, but fortunately --

03:59:38.830 --> 03:59:40.330
and that's what was
really interesting

03:59:40.330 --> 03:59:43.760
about this collection, is
that this item has been known.

03:59:43.760 --> 03:59:46.410
This manuscript has
been out there.

03:59:46.410 --> 03:59:48.370
There's a lot that's
been written about it.

03:59:48.370 --> 03:59:51.930
So it was really fun to see
the panelists this morning go,

03:59:51.930 --> 03:59:53.810
"Oh, I read your book.

03:59:53.810 --> 03:59:55.170
Oh, I saw that."

03:59:55.170 --> 04:00:01.230
So it was a really nice forum
that you guys planned today.

04:00:01.230 --> 04:00:04.320
I mean, it really helped
put things in perspective.

04:00:04.320 --> 04:00:08.210
And I was really happy to see
so many people here and involved

04:00:08.210 --> 04:00:09.790
and interested in
this collection.

04:00:09.790 --> 04:00:12.880
So thanks for making my day.

04:00:15.040 --> 04:00:18.620
&gt;&gt; Beacher Wiggins:
And there's a colleague

04:00:18.620 --> 04:00:21.690
that I never see at the library.

04:00:21.690 --> 04:00:23.990
&gt;&gt; That's a joke.

04:00:25.940 --> 04:00:30.320
&gt;&gt; I have found this
day to be fascinating.

04:00:30.320 --> 04:00:34.720
And I think our colleagues in
Africa, in African libraries,

04:00:34.720 --> 04:00:36.950
will also find it fascinating.

04:00:36.950 --> 04:00:39.650
Quite often people want
to know what happens here

04:00:39.650 --> 04:00:41.490
at the Library of Congress.

04:00:41.490 --> 04:00:44.250
They want to know how
collections are done,

04:00:44.250 --> 04:00:45.720
what the cataloging process is.

04:00:45.720 --> 04:00:49.260
There are these details
that they want to know.

04:00:49.260 --> 04:00:53.260
And with the webcasts that
are going to be available,

04:00:53.260 --> 04:00:55.840
this is our opportunity
to show them.

04:00:55.840 --> 04:00:59.970
It's been fascinating to hear
the scholarship in the morning

04:00:59.970 --> 04:01:03.900
and to hear these
details this afternoon.

04:01:03.900 --> 04:01:10.410
And to hear the experts and to
see the experts explaining this.

04:01:10.410 --> 04:01:13.810
It's wonderful that
it's all tied in.

04:01:13.810 --> 04:01:17.630
And I don't think that we often
have an opportunity to see that.

04:01:17.630 --> 04:01:19.630
So thank you so much.

04:01:19.630 --> 04:01:23.830
And I just want to say that
we are really appreciative

04:01:23.830 --> 04:01:29.350
in the African and Middle
Eastern Division for the vision,

04:01:29.350 --> 04:01:32.110
the diplomacy and all
of those great words

04:01:32.110 --> 04:01:38.510
that you could say
about Mary Jane Deeb.

04:01:46.340 --> 04:01:52.550
Well, if not, as my staff
always do, they keep me honest.

04:01:52.550 --> 04:01:58.090
So I omitted a few people who
were involved in the front end

04:01:58.090 --> 04:01:59.450
of making this happen.

04:01:59.450 --> 04:02:03.290
So the ones I didn't mention
I'll just mention now.

04:02:03.290 --> 04:02:05.660
So for the Southeby's London

04:02:05.660 --> 04:02:09.000
and the seller negotiations
there was Daisy Taggy

04:02:09.000 --> 04:02:12.990
and Iliona Mitchell-Podicky,
and Jen Boncevik

04:02:12.990 --> 04:02:16.680
who I'm looking directly
in the face now.

And the rest of the team
we have acknowledged.

04:02:20.600 --> 04:02:23.880
But it takes a team
to make this work.

04:02:23.880 --> 04:02:26.650
So we want to make sure
we acknowledge everyone.

04:02:26.650 --> 04:02:30.470
So this is to me a fitting
note to be ended on.

04:02:30.470 --> 04:02:33.560
We've had two complementary
statements.

to say or question?

tell us how to get
