00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.709
 I ordered with more than 100,000 condoms in 2010 for the Winter Olympics in Vancouver, it is clear 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:14.750
 - A little extra physical activity goes on during the games. But, does this sexual excitement 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.070
 Before the competition affect the athletic performance? 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.860
 Many ancient civilizations, including the Greeks, believed that the semen was divine and 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.530
 Contained the power of man. Today, some athletes hold the belief that sexual frustration, driven 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.180
 By abstaining from sex, aggression eventually increases - which is valuable for many sports. Testosterone, 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.789
 In particular, are responsible for the aggression and sexual desire of men and women, and 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.379
 There has long been a belief that ejaculation directed the testosterone from the body. Mohammed 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.059
 Ali, for example, does not make love for six weeks before fighting. 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.449
 But modern science sees things differently. In fact, many studies have shown exactly 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.449
 Conversely: Increase testosterone after sex. Go without for more than 3 months, testosterone 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.629
 Drops to levels that close to the baby. So from a biological perspective, sex may actually be sex 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.639
 Increased performance, especially in the sport where a little additional aggression can be 

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:08.480
 Determine the factor - such as cross skating, short track speed skating, or of course hockey. 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.750
 So what about sex body fatigue out? The truth is that the average sex session 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.290
 Just burn about 50 calories equivalent ... from running up a few flights of stairs. in a 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.520
 On the contrary, studies have found that night sex has no noticeable effects before 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.780
 On strength, energy, endurance, or any other fitness variables. However, sex has been documented 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.440
 To trigger the release of pain blockers in the brain. These chronic adjustment can help 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.500
 Pain, with lasting effects up to more than 24 hours. 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.600
 The biggest unknown lies in the psychological effects, which are much harder to study, and 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.140
 Has already played a bigger role in major competitions. The best athletic performance is achieved for 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.190
 With a certain balance of vigilance and anxiety. Of course, stay up all night hunting sexual 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.830
 Unconscious tips scale against vigilance the next day. On the other hand, sex can be 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.240
 A great stress statement for nervous athletes. While other characters simply desire more 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.960
 Focus and focus, in this case, to a good night of sleep is ideal. 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.290
 At the end of the day, science says: It depends how the sex affects each individual. If you need to 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.400
 That extra kick of testosterone, you may just want to get the game - early night. 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.900
