00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.630
Next, hit time is affected

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.320
by having to access the TLB
before we access the cache.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.000
Remember that the processor starts
out with the virtual address.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.400
We use some part of that virtual
address to index into the TLB and

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.490
find the frame number.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.790
We then combine that with the page
offset and now that we have the physical

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.460
address, we can use it to access
our cache and get the data from it.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.110
So really,
if the TLB takes one cycle and

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.330
the cache takes one cycle, we need two
cycles from when the processor gives us

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.810
the address until we
actually get the data.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.120
Because really the TLB access and

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.450
the cache access have to
happen one after the other.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.280
A cache that is accessed using a
physical address is called a physically

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.160
accessed cache, a physical cache, and
also it is called physically indexed or

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.590
physically tagged or PIPT cache.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.090
The overall hit latency of that cache
really is the TLB hit latency and

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.840
the cache hit latency.
