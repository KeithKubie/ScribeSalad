anything else since

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040
 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.820
good this isn't that good part writing a

has to do with being original trying to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710
has to do with being original trying to
 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.710
has to do with being original trying to
do something that feels fresh when

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
do something that feels fresh when
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.930
do something that feels fresh when
there's been so many movies made and and

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940
there's been so many movies made and and
 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.210
there's been so many movies made and and
also particularly in Hollywood a

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220
also particularly in Hollywood a
 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.800
also particularly in Hollywood a
tendency to try and remake the same

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810
tendency to try and remake the same
 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.050
tendency to try and remake the same
movies over and over again so it's

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060
movies over and over again so it's
 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.600
movies over and over again so it's
writing a movie that's original that

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610
writing a movie that's original that
 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.590
writing a movie that's original that
becomes really difficult and there's

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600
becomes really difficult and there's
 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.940
becomes really difficult and there's
something very formal about the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
something very formal about the
 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.650
something very formal about the
enterprise of writing a screenplay it

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
enterprise of writing a screenplay it
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.070
enterprise of writing a screenplay it
can't be longer than two hours so the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
can't be longer than two hours so the
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.050
can't be longer than two hours so the
kind of story you tell whatever it is it

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060
kind of story you tell whatever it is it
 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.780
kind of story you tell whatever it is it

possible within that one and a half to
 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.570
possible within that one and a half to
two hour period and that forces certain

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580
two hour period and that forces certain
 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.570
two hour period and that forces certain
kind of conventions on you places where

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580
kind of conventions on you places where
 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.760
kind of conventions on you places where

furniture something like that and and
making it all come alive when you just

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560
making it all come alive when you just
 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.170
making it all come alive when you just
start putting together all the pieces of
