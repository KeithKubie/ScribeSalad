00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.190
We have to buy my grandma a new pan

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.840
Please leave that in the video

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.870
Hey guys I'm Nate. I'm Zack from the YouTube channel JerryRigEverything

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.479
Today we're back at the dome and we're gonna be doing a few experiments that involve lithium batteries in some molten aluminum

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.200
And one of those batteries is still inside of this iPhone. We've got our aluminum. We've got our furnace. Let's get started

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.160
This is why I like filming inside the dome. That doesn't look half as good when you're outside

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.560
All right our furnace is nice and hot, our aluminum is nice and melted down inside

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.640
Zach what's the plan?

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.000
So we have some lithium batteries that we're gonna toss in the aluminum because lithium is very reactive

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And I'm excited to see what happens with that

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.870
But I also have this iPhone here in one of my previous videos that has a bunch of scratch marks on it

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.969
I scratched it up with diamonds because the diamonds are super hard level ten on Most scale one thing

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.779
I'm curious about though is that the back of this iPhone is made from aluminum

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.449
And I'm curious to see how that reacts with the molten aluminum inside of the furnace. So we'll take our crucible out...

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.400
We'll set it on the rock and then Zach is going to be putting his iPhone down inside the melted aluminum

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520
We'll see if it survives or not

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920
I bet it doesn't

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.820
All right

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.400
Yeah, I'd say now just drop it in and run away

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.970
Oh [laughs]. It's sick.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.710
Oh looks good

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.870
Is the screen still working? I doubt it [laughs] though it went off very quickly. [laughs]

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.459
That is sweet I did not expect the outer aluminium to catch fire

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.160
I wonder if it's like the... It's anodized so that might be doing it. The anodizing? Yeah.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.040
I don't know what that process and chemical is, but that's probably more flamable than raw aluminium. Yeah

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.709
Aw dude, the whole thing's melting

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.640
That's almost like a sweet smell to it... Ooh, the camera lens is on fire

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.080
All right Zach now you get to fix it. 
[Zach] Yeah... 
You have a tutorial on how to repair this?

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.600
What we've got here is an iPhone that has been burned to a crisp

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.789
Everywhere half of the back melted off and pooled into our aluminum

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.200
That was already in the crucible

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.489
And we've just exposed and destroyed all of the internal workings of it one interesting thing is that the glass lens right here well

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.759
Sapphire lens of the iPhone is drizzled out and it's melted all over the upper part of the aluminum panel

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.819
So that's you can see that how it melted their sapphire

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.668
Is that low of a melting point? so Apple Sapphire isn't as pure as regular sapphire, okay

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.669
I did some tests on that on my channel

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.668
But that would be curious to see what the melting point of sapphire actually is

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.480
Because I mean aluminum has its temperature it does

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.810
And then all of the glass on the screen is now gone as well, so you can see the aluminum back plate of the screen

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.389
That's sitting between the LCD and the internals of the phone

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.809
But as far as the glass goes on the front gone.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.720
On the back one thing that I thought was curious since we're dipping

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.780
lithium-ion batteries inside of aluminum the pouch style batteries that are inside of iPhones have

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.780
Different anode cathode layers to them and you can see all these layers holding up and around

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.459
the battery itself.

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.790
Which is interesting that

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.320
These survived while the aluminum panel didn't it's similar to the other lithium batteries that we're gonna try putting in the aluminum

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.369
They have the same idea except. They're rolled up circular coil yeah.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.190
One iPhone completely destroyed by being half submerged into molten aluminum now

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.290
Let's move on to trying our other lithium batteries and see what happens with those in similar situations

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.690
All right, we've got our aluminum heated back up, and we've got some of these lithium batteries

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.829
And we're gonna try dropping those into our crucible, so I'm gonna drop mine in negative side first

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.020
And he's gonna drop his positive side first aluminum is conductive this amount of voltage probably won't do anything

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.299
But it's worth a shot one other thing

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.680
I'm curious about is what this shell on the outside the battery is made of if it's aluminum

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.560
It should dissolve just like the iPhone case did

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.329
But if it's steel or something else it should remain intact right it might be steel, but I'm not positive

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Only one way to find out

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.189
That looks sweet you can see the glowing bits inside

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.339
There's not as much slag as I thought that would be I think probably a lot of stuff has burned up and

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.559
It's possible some stuff. That's not so flammable has fallen to the bottom

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.410
true

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.400
One two drop.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.780
[Explosion] oh shoot [laughs]

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.280
What in the world dude, it's like a sparkler

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.710
It's like one of those fountain things you light up on the 4th of July. That's amazing.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.939
No, wait it's exactly like a firework. That is so cool. Ohh

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.300
See I've burned lithium batteries before, I kind of knew what it was gonna do I had no idea what that was gonna end like.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.300
was great

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.939
Looks like that's both of them it exploded both women everywhere. I'm out. Oh

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.659
Oh One of the batteries missed it might have been mine, I didn't see mine splash you knows what I was running away

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:16.480
Oh, I'm not sure one of us failed replay the slow-motion. Yep, all right your turn

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.430
Nice it's in its flaming it's gonna pop!

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.480
And now

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.090
We'll get to the second stage where it where it sparkles, sparks and...

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.170
Jet of, I wish the iPhone would have done that that was sweet Jet of pink fire

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.239
That's epic so if your carcass is still in the molten aluminum right so the explosion was probably just the carcass splitting

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.139
let's tear this open and see like what exactly what happened with the heat I

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.559
Don't think the shell is aluminum in otherwise it would have melted

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.120
Yeah, all right

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.120
So it looks like just one of the ends

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.780
blew out on both of these this it's a positive side or the negative side?

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:08.589
I think it's the positive side that breaks off because I've dismantled these before and they have sort of a cap on the positive side

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.850
Underneath the wrapper so you can kind of see the cap right here

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.220
That was pretty sweet dropping those batteries down into the crucible, but I think we can go more. Don't you?

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.699
We might as well, so we've got a whole bunch of these batteries left

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.820
We're gonna try throwing them into this pot pan pan

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:30.879
And then we're gonna pour our molten aluminum all over them and hopefully they'll all ignite who's doing the pouring you or me?

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.459
How brave do you feel? I think you should be doing the pouring I'll be doing the pouring perfect all right.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.010
Cool that is

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.150
Toasty I see that probably every time it always impresses me when it's glowing orange like that

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:53.800
Alright, so I would say you have like probably five seconds before six explosions start tossing molten aluminum your direction

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.120
That is probably very true

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:01.959
So I will definitely try to pour and back off as fast as I can I'm gonna go stand over here

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.540
Away from you. That's a good choice

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.730
three! two! one!

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:16.809
Oh it spilled out of the container alot, yeah boiled over one two three five

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.789
I Lost track I think that's five

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.540
They should start hissing here, that's six

00:08:37.449 --> 00:08:45.059
This is amazing its just like a firework show well that was a bit too close that was at least 15 feet that was quite a shot ohh

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.170
That was more like 25 feet

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:56.399
That was the finale right there that went off and that was the end Wow one final big explosion that was great

00:08:57.189 --> 00:08:58.449
Ha Ha

00:08:58.449 --> 00:09:00.479
A whole bunch of battery carcasses

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:07.169
And again still something worth quite a bit of liquid in fact. That's aluminum for you with it's very high specific heat

00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:11.609
It does not like to transition easily between one state and another

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.670
That was beautiful.

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:24.779
Got a big chunk out.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:32.159
We've still got some some nice pink flame here. I think that's some of the lithium still burning right there. That's sort of magenta color

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:38.399
Lithium batteries dropped into molten aluminum sometimes inside an iPhone.

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:44.369
It worked out pretty well, The reaction was much more intense with the batteries themselves, but it was still it shouldn't see what's inside of an iPhone

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.099
Using metal to dissolve the metal around it really not the most conventional way to open up a phone

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.829
And I think it's probably a little beyond all repair. Yeah even for him, but that was a lot of fun.

00:09:55.829 --> 00:10:03.089
We got some great and almost violent reactions from those lithium batteries exploding the last one especially it shot sparks

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:09.719
25 feet those pretty nuts fortunately it didn't seem to send any molten aluminum flying it was just like little bits of sparks

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.600
From the batteries themselves, but it looked really cool.

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:13.980
