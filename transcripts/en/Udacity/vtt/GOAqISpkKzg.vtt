00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So now we're ready for a quiz to see if you understand nested lists.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
For this quiz, you're given a variable named "countries,"

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and it's defined with a list of information about some of my favorite countries.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And for each country, there's a list containing 3 things:

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the name of the country, the capital, and its population in millions.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I should point out, of course, for those of you in Romania or in smaller countries,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that when it comes to countries, bigger is not always better.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
First, try to write code that will print out the capital of India.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We can find India as the second country in our countries list.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And the capital is the second element of that list.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You obviously could solve this by just printing out "Delhi."

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I don't want you to solve it that way.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I want you to solve it by finding an expression that uses the countries variable

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to find the right value.
