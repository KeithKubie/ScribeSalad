&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.796
&gt;&gt; It's my pleasure to introduce
the author who respects food,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.673
who respects his customers and
respects local Washington DC.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.673
Spike Mendelsohn has written The
Good Stuff Cookbook, it's as warm

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.410
and friendly, family friendly as
his restaurants, so please welcome

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.113
to the National Book
Festival, Spike Mendelsohn.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.240
[ Applause ]

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.023
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.406
&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you very much.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.806
It's an honor to be here.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.830
You know, if you asked me a couple
of years ago if I thought I'd be

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.256
up here being presented as an author
I'd probably say, you know, no.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.083
You know, I'm a chef at heart
and I've been very lucky

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.346
in the past couple of years.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.146
For those who don't know,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.356
I obviously film the reality
TV show called Top Chef.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.536
Are there any Top Chef
fans out there?

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.870
Wooh! You know, we have
an all star season.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.473
We just got them filming,
so that was really exciting.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.580
I just got back yesterday
from New York.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.913
It was really, really intense

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.633
and it should be a great
season for you guys.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.370
But, you know, after filming
the show, I wanted to open

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.083
up a restaurant that, you know,
was very fast, casual and kind of,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.510
you know, gave [audio cut]
that watched the show,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.256
so I didn't really want to open
up a fine dining restaurant with,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.610
you know, tasting menus
and you know 20 seats.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.530
I really wanted to open up
a restaurant that I can kind

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.196
of invite everybody in and focusing
on classic American food and,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.816
you know, just doing it really,

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.150
really well like taking
the hamburger

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.616
and just making it something
a little bit healthier to eat,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.683
something really super fresh.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.093
And, you know, with a lot
of luck and a great location

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.473
on Capitol Hill, you
know, we did that.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.293
We opened up Good Stuff Eatery
about 2 and a half years ago.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.163
You know for the-- who-- how
many people have been there?

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.770
Yeah? Wooh.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.410
That's only half of you, so the
rest-- the other half of you,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.476
I expect you to walk up
the hill a little later

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.010
and check the place out.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.806
You know, and the great part
about this concept is is

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.433
that it really kind of--
you know, I was new to DC.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.830
I was very worried
leaving New York City

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.343
to come open up a restaurant in DC.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.356
You know, I didn't have
too many roots here.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.533
My sister had lived on the
Hill for a couple of years.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.793
But the greatest thing about DC and
Capitol Hill especially is the sense

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.056
of community I've developed
over the last 2 and half years.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.573
[Inaudible] You know, I owe most of
my success obviously to my customers

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.910
and the people that support
me on the Hill and it's just--

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.310
it's been an amazing
ride and, you know,

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.360
we came out with the idea doing
The Good Stuff Cookbook because,

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.206
you know, at Good Stuff Eatery it's
very family focused, it's very farm

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.543
to table focused and it's just
like a great feeling and great vibe

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.130
when you go to the restaurant.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.210
And I kind of just want to
share that with everybody

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.070
that didn't have a chance to come
to DC and come to the restaurant,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.830
and that's why we came up
with the Good Stuff Cookbook.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.830
So, you know, it's
the whole entire menu

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.133
at Good Stuff plus
another 150 recipes.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.200
The great thing about the book is
I draw, you know, our inspiration

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.413
from a lot of my friends and you see
that because a lot of recipes there

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.673
that [audio cut] to it and I
think that's the greatest thing

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.130
about the book.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.596
And, you know, it's
also-- it's very--

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.756
you know, the cookbook that we came
out with was very easy to shop for.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.113
So, any of you can find
any of these ingredients

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.740
at any local supermarket and,
you know, at a minimal price

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.313
and just come up with
a great fun meal.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.113
And, you know, the most
important thing about the book is

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.530
to get people involved
and invite friends over

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.276
and for everyone's
hands to get dirty.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.383
So we're really happy with the Good
Stuff Cookbook and now I'm an author

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.926
so I could check that
one off on my list.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.396
You know, are there any
questions out there?

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.790
I mean, I'd like to keep this
open to questions and-- yes.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.443
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.576
&gt;&gt; It turns into soup.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.270
I'm so happy you asked
me that question.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.003
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.236
&gt;&gt; Okay, I was told to direct to
the microphone where there's two

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.170
on each side for questions.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.170
Although the question was--

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.170
she's saying that my recipe

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.760
for my toasted marshmallow milkshake
does not work in the cookbook.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.400
But-- no, no, I was just kidding.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.626
You know the funny thing
is that it's kind of--

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.180
if you're using a Vita-Prep at home,
you're creating friction and heat

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.396
because it's not really made
to kind of spin milkshakes.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.623
At the restaurant we use the
old school Hamilton Beach

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.913
that has a prong that doesn't
kind of create friction.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.156
You know, the best thing I
could tell you is probably leave

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.993
out the milk and just work
it just with the ice cream,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.500
like melted ice cream and
then the toasted marshmallows

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.166
and then just blend that together
and then it won't get it soupy.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.450
Yeah, okay.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.050
&gt;&gt; I enjoy cooking but my interests
and my creativity waxes and wanes.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.300
How do you maintain your
creativity and interest?

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.540
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.896
You know, I maintain my creativity
and interest and I just keep it--

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.713
and for me, for myself, I keep
it really, really seasonal

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.956
and I get inspired by
many different things.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.786
You know, I was in Europe
for the last week and I got

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.286
to go eat around everywhere.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.076
And everywhere I kind of went I
got inspired by a certain type

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.950
of ingredients or flavor, so I
was like, "Oh, maybe I could--

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.253
you know, maybe I can do that at
Good Stuff Eatery, or maybe I can do

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.900
that with a pizza or apply that."

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.336
But you know, I also-- you know, I'm
standing here alone but, you know,

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.730
I have a huge support group in
the restaurant and it composes

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.276
of my parents, my sister and
a couple of my best friends

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.323
that I kind of forced to
move from New York City

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.810
to come open my restaurants with me.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.610
And you know, it's just kind of--

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.276
sitting around the table
shooting ideas out,

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.760
and I think we mostly relate
on our experiences of travel.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.963
You know, when we're coming out
with new menus and we're trying

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.003
to be creative, we always kind
of look back on, you know,

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.043
first like where we've worked, what
molded us to be that type of chef

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.776
and then through, you know, our
travels through Europe or Asia

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.636
or even New York for
instance and kind

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.976
of what we've picked
up along the way.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.973
So, you know, for me it's just like
life is just an inspiration everyday

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.513
and I kind of apply that towards
food and what I do, so thank you.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.660
Yeah.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.993
&gt;&gt; Where is the hat?

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.773
&gt;&gt; The hat, the hat.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.040
I have to ditch the hat.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.306
I'm trying to grow out
my hair a little bit.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.293
[Laughter] I hope it looks good.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.160
I don't know.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.363
You know it's-- I've been wearing
a hat straight for maybe about 2

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.490
and a half years and I just went
on the all star show and I kind

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.463
of wanted to move myself
out of the hat

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.250
because I do get that
question a lot.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:07.116
But I still have plenty of fedoras

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.446
and I will be wearing
throughout my life but I just feel

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.316
like I need my head to
breathe a little bit this day,

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.390
so I got a lot going on [inaudible].

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.546
&gt;&gt; I'm embarrassed I haven't
been to your restaurant yet

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:19.963
but I've read all about it,
and can you talk a little bit

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.183
about the meat that you use--

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.250
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:27.983
&gt;&gt; Do you get it locally
and [inaudible]--

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.583
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.783
So, you know, we get everything at
Good Stuff within a hundred miles.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.433
You know, our meat is out of the
farm in Virginia, it's grass fed.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.053
You know, I have a-- you know,
that's the greatest thing here also

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.836
for me and I think I owe a
lot of my success to it is

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:43.053
that I have really great
relationship with all my farmers

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.116
and my purveyors and the
people that supply me the food.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.003
And, you know, we're
not buying cheap things,

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:56.803
so you know they really allow me
to work on the prices of the food

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.443
that I get from them and then

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.360
so I can offer something
reasonably priced for the clientele.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.126
So-- yeah, and my meat's
my own blend.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:05.346
You know, I spent maybe about 3
months traveling to different farms,

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.620
visiting different butchers and
kind of creating my own meat.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.050
It's a little bit of short
rib chuck and sirloin.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.180
It's about 75 percent
to 25 percent fat.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:25.036
And it's uniquely ours so--
you know, I really enjoy it.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:26.856
I think it's tasty.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.590
I think it's got great flavor.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:30.723
The most important thing
to me about our meat is

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.056
that you can just really
apply salt and pepper to it,

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.390
give it a really nice sear,

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.790
proper cooking technique
and it's just delicious.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.030
I'm not one of the guys who like,
you know, folding shallots or butter

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.506
or blue cheese into the meat
or any kind of that, you know,

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.726
sauteing onions, just
a personal preference,

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.400
but our meat comes from Virginia.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.413
Which way am I going here?

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.166
&gt;&gt; Hi, I actually work at the
Library of Congress and we go

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.050
to Good Stuff and my co-worker
go to Good Stuff and We,

00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.900
the Pizza almost everyday
or twice a week--

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.440
&gt;&gt; We, The Pizza, have you
guys heard about We, The Pizza?

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.640
Yeah? No? Okay.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.310
&gt;&gt; And my question is when we
walk in there, it's blaring.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:13.836
I love your music selection, and
it's like blaring Jay-Z and--

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.370
&gt;&gt; And We, The Pizza?

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:17.370
&gt;&gt; And so-- and We, The Pizza, yeah.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:19.970
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.370
&gt;&gt; And then Good Stuff has bought
R and B. What was the inspiration

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:23.770
or why did you choose
to use that music in?

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.103
&gt;&gt; Well, the probably blazing
Jay-Z 'cause I haven't been there

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.770
for a couple of weeks but--

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:29.970
[ Laughter ]

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:31.503
&gt;&gt; Oh, I just told
him that, I'm sorry.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.236
&gt;&gt; No, I'm kidding.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:35.170
I just went to the Jay-Z concert.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:37.970
I love him.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.903
But, you know, the idea of--
well, for those who don't know,

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.036
we just opened-- I recently
opened a new restaurant called We,

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.836
The Pizza about a month ago.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.570
It's focusing on New York
style pizza, homemade gelato,

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.236
homemade sodas, again encompassing
like really fresh ingredients,

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:49.903
and we do sell by the
slice which people seem

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:51.503
to be really excited
about on the Hill.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.483
But the great question about
the music is that, you know,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.430
at Good Stuff we actually
started with a rock and roll.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.186
We play a little bit of reggae
and, yeah, we play some R

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.660
and B sometimes too but I really
think it's important to kind

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.326
of set the ambiance of a
restaurant so when people walk in,

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.540
they're getting an experience.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.700
&gt;&gt; Sometimes again trouble
for how loud our music is

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.213
if I don't control it, but I just
feel like it just uplifts people

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.183
and makes it interesting and
there's a great environment.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.630
We chose a different
style of music for We,

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:26.396
The Pizza because it was my business
partner, Michael Colletti and I

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:26.996
and he's really into hip hop
and we really wanted the store

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.996
to be a little bit hipper
than Good Stuff here,

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.986
like Good Stuff here was
a contemporary farmhouse,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:35.950
so it's very homey, it's
very family oriented.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.063
We, The Pizza is the same thing.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:40.583
It's really actually inspired
a lot more by our charities

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:48.203
and the work we do around the
community, but we just wanted a kind

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.016
of a different feeling
like, you know,

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.550
we just thought pizzas a little
bit hipper than burgers and--

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.816
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love it.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.883
It's so much better.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.150
&gt;&gt; Do you love it, yeah?

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah I love it, yeah.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:01.616
&gt;&gt; Do you get down with
the rocking, you like--

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.016
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I actually
do, I actually do.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.550
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:07.683
&gt;&gt; So, thank you.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.550
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:11.883
&gt;&gt; I'm a student at American
University here in DC,

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.950
and I'm taking an agriculture
course, so I have kind

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.683
of an academic question for you.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.216
Why is it important to eat locally
and know where your food comes from?

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.683
'Cause we're talking a lot about
how we buy food in grocery stores

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.803
and we don't necessarily
know where it's from

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:25.513
and that's a major
component of your restaurant.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.080
So why is that important I guess?

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.730
&gt;&gt; Well see, I mean first off,
I think we've come a long way,

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.496
you know, from where we were
maybe like 20 years ago.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:38.823
We seem to be like a very food
germ society and people really kind

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:42.443
of wanna know where
their food comes from.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:44.490
They kind of wanna
build that relationship.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:46.463
I think first and foremost, you
have to support your local farmers

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.196
and the people that grow these
locally grown healthy foods.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:58.323
You know, the thing about buying
food from supermarkets is not bad

00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.326
and it's never gonna go away
obviously, but I mean a lot

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:02.770
of the stuff is really not seasonal,

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.390
a lot of the stuff is
sprayed with pesticides.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.970
I mean for instance, you know,

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:14.036
I much rather buy locally grown
tomatoes that have full flavor

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:14.860
than the ones that they pick
in California that are green,

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:18.110
they spray with ethanol, they go
in a truck, they ripen all the way

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:22.183
down here and it's really not done
in like-- in a natural process.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.196
And I'll tell you, you know,
a tomato that's locally grown,

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:35.790
that's organic, the flavor is
not even comparable to a tomato

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:37.710
that gets, you know, picked
green and sprayed with ethanol

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.723
and then traveled, and
bruised and, you know,

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.760
I just feel like people are, you
know, kind of really wanna form

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.266
that relationship and
it's definitely better

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:50.463
for the local farmers here and
supporting the local businesses.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.690
So I think that's why
you wanna try--

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.613
not that you'll be able to shop
everything locally but you kind

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:58.880
of wanna try do as much as possible.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.080
So, does that answer
the question, yeah?

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.680
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.350
&gt;&gt; Cool. There's no one there.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.350
&gt;&gt; Oh--

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:10.350
&gt;&gt; I begin to--

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.483
&gt;&gt; There should be but
there's no one there yet.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.283
&gt;&gt; I'd be interested to know
what does influence the CIA had

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.350
on your career.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.950
&gt;&gt; Sure, huge influence.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.416
You know, I was a little--
I was kind of lucky.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.646
I was a kid growing up in
the restaurant business.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.980
I come from a long line of
restaurateurs from Montreal.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.356
You know, we even-- my parents
moved to Spain when I was 13

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:36.456
and had 16 restaurants in the
World's Fair there and I truly grew

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.213
up in a restaurant family.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.196
You know, I was dishwashing at 13
years old, I was a fry cook at 14,

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.036
I worked all around the kitchen
and it came to a point in my life

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.956
that I kinda-- just kinda
want to refine my skills

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.766
and see what I had compared to
people that really wanted to be

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.543
in the business and that's why I
applied at the CIA and I went there.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.016
You know what the CIA did for me
just kind of brought it together

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:00.990
and it really inspired me the most
because before I went to school,

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:05.370
I had just grown up in the business
and you watch your parents growing

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:09.676
up in the business and they work
all the holidays, all the weekends,

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:12.463
they have very limited time off.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:14.923
It's kind of like a scary
career choice as a child.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.806
You kind of want to do everything
but be in the restaurant business.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.266
When I went to the CIAA, it
kind of really solidified

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.546
that I had a natural talent.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.020
You know, I was not better
than anybody but I was

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.253
so much more experienced in the
kitchen than a lot of the students

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.136
that were in my class and you
kind of just reflect on yourself

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.303
and you're like whoa, wow.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:36.903
You know, I do-- I do have
one talent that I'm good at

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:39.923
and I'm a little bit ahead of the
game so that really inspired me.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:44.123
The CIA really inspired me
to go after the, you know--

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.106
to work for the best places,
work for the best chefs.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.230
After my experience in
the CIA, I went to work

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.463
for Thomas Keller in Napa.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.556
I went to work in Vietnam for a year
for a very famous Vietnamese chef.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.146
I went to work for Sirio Maccioni,

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.176
which is a famous Italian
restaurateur in New York City.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.783
So it kind of just
really motivated me.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.646
And, you know, you go to
school to get a degree but most

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:12.600
of your training and your experience

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:14.203
and the way your career is gonna
develop is working in restaurants

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.063
and it just gave me
a really great base

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.136
and it gave me a huge
networking pool.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.996
There's not a day that goes by that
I don't run into somebody that went

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.823
to the CIA or I don't get a call
from someone that went to the CIA

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:33.676
and that's kind of really what
it brought to the table for me.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.300
Yes?

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.923
&gt;&gt; I'd like to know where you stand
on if you have to make the choice

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.076
between local and organic,
because you can't always be sure

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.156
that you're getting both.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:48.490
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.423
&gt;&gt; I'm leading towards
wanting to buy organic

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.193
because I don't want the pesticides,
but if you shop locally at markets,

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.056
at local farm markets, I am not
quite sure how you find out for sure

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.316
that they're pesticide-free?

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.106
I don't know how to
ask that question.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.640
&gt;&gt; No, sure.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.840
I'm not quite sure I know
how to answer that one.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.176
But no, it's just-- you
know, it's funny this--

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.570
the organic way that
we're on, it's--

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.673
there's a purpose for
it and it's for--

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.800
I feel that you can apply that
to proteins and you know a lot

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.156
of obviously vegetables and stuff.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:20.533
But, you know, if you had that--

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.506
like I don't think you
necessarily have to kind

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.106
of pick one or the other.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.573
I think locally grown
product is grown properly,

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.900
you know what I mean.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.326
It's healthy, it's fresh, it's
seasonal, there's nothing wrong

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.873
with that product and apply to--

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:38.606
I think they're two
completely different things

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:45.206
and you can apply organic foods,
you know, most of the time

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.920
but you don't really necessarily
have to buy it all the time.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:49.480
Buying stuff that's
really farm fresh

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:51.280
and locally grown is really great

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.630
and you're really supporting
the community by doing that too.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:56.530
So--

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.596
&gt;&gt; Okay, thanks.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:00.530
&gt;&gt; That's it.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:02.730
You guys are done?

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:04.530
Come on.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:05.596
&gt;&gt; No, I have another question?

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:07.596
&gt;&gt; Top Chef all star questions?

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:10.530
No one?

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.530
&gt;&gt; I have a Top Chef question?

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:14.663
Can you talk a little bit
about that experience?

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.530
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:17.596
&gt;&gt; You know, was that horrible?

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:20.996
&gt;&gt; It was so horrible.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:22.730
You know the-- actually
the top chef experience--

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.996
it was funny, I was working in New
York City for about 3 or 4 years.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.196
You know, I had traveled
across the world for my career,

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.196
I learned all sorts of
different cuisines and, you know,

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.130
all of a sudden this reality TV show
comes out and a lot of my friends

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.520
and family are telling me like oh
my god, you have to do this show.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.673
I wasn't really quite confident
100 percent with the show

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:39.976
in its first couple of seasons.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.216
I kind of waited till the 4th season
until it started growing some legs

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:49.470
and I saw it being really recognized
and appreciated by my peers

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.463
and the chefs that I respect.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.010
But I mean I could sit up
here and tell you that,

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.720
that show completely
changed my life.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:57.926
It's funny that it took a reality
show to kind of super launch me

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.886
into like my career but it
did and it's a great venue

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:09.743
for any young aspiring chef
that really want to [inaudible],

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:10.286
you know, make a name for himself.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:12.900
The funny thing about the
business is that there are

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.540
so many young chefs these days

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:20.250
that are getting recognized
prematurely like myself.

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:22.210
You know, it used to be you had to
pay your dues for at least like 20,

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:24.940
15 years in the kitchen before
you even start getting recognized

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.666
or appreciated as a chef.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.330
I mean you look at Thomas Keller,
like one of my favorite chefs,

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.603
a gentleman that I worked for
and I look up to, you know,

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:37.003
really didn't start
making a name for himself

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.673
until he was 40 years old, you
know, with the French Laundry

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:41.860
and he had worked, you know--
broken his back for many,

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:45.473
many years to get to that point.

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.273
So, I feel very fortunate that
I kind of got that jump start

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:51.376
in my career, you know, on a show.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:56.423
Also, it was just a
smart way to do business.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:57.350
You know, if I wanted to kind of
market my restaurant and get a lot

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:01.463
of publicity, I-- you know, I
just kind of "branding" myself

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:04.166
with the Top Chef, open up a fast
casual restaurant on the Hill and,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.320
you know, a little bit of
luck and you have success.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.756
So, I owe everything to that show.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.320
Oh, 10 minutes.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.320
Just--

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.230
&gt;&gt; How long is the day at Top
Chef, like when you're competing--

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.143
&gt;&gt; How long is the day?

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:26.276
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like one of
the days when you're

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:28.943
like have the final
competitions, when they had you

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:30.743
and you had judges table
and stuff, I mean how--

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.610
what time you wake up and what
time you're just finally over?

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:33.703
&gt;&gt; Well, you wake up at like 6--

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.106
6:30 in the morning and
usually don't get to bed till

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.526
about 2 or 3 in the morning.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.660
It's a full day-- it's I mean.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.110
You know, the greatest thing about
the show that it's, you know,

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:46.623
I get a lot of question is it real?

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.356
Are you coached?

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:51.956
It's 100 percent reality.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.980
We're not coached at all, but what
they do is they give us a really

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.400
tough schedule and
sleep deprivation.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.933
So it's-- you know, once
you get started and you're

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.126
in the competition,
you're going out at--

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:04.566
you know, for as long as you last.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:06.983
The show itself probably takes
about a month and a week to film

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.323
and that's before the finals.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:16.256
They stop short of the final
4 or 5 depending on, you know,

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:17.813
what they're deciding on doing and
then they cut and edit the show

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.300
and then maybe within a week left

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.533
of the show they get everybody back
together and they film the final.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:28.750
You know, just for the sake of it,
there's a lot of-- you know pe--

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:32.733
the bloggers out there and
a lot of spoilers out there

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.393
and they don't wanna kinda
ruin the results, so.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.753
&gt;&gt; Okay, it's on.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:44.896
I'm sitting here thinking
you must have started

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.630
when you were 12 years old.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.830
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.296
&gt;&gt; So, what do you have-- what do
you think you'll do in the future?

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:52.320
Because you're so young now and
you've got a long life ahead.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.520
&gt;&gt; I'd like to get to the
moon at some point or so--

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.893
&gt;&gt; Would you-- okay.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.026
And open a restaurant?

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.560
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.893
&gt;&gt; You know it's a-- I think that's
a great thing about, you know,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.960
that I'm lucky about my business
that I could kind of keep it fresh

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.353
and I can kind of take on new
projects and keep it interesting.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.633
You know, I have Good
Stuff Eatery and We,

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.076
The Pizza now on Capitol Hill, I'd
be really happy to see a couple more

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.730
of Good Stuff Eateries open
up across the United States

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.503
so I'm working on that
and eventually I really--

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:28.143
you know, I'm enjoying
the fast casual concepts.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:34.290
You know, I kind of plucked my
way out of the kitchen working

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.666
from morning to night
and it kind of, you know,

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.140
all of a sudden I'm
becoming a restaurateur

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:43.233
and I'm designing restaurants,
I'm designing menus,

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.510
I'm paying attention to branding, so
it's been a huge learning experience

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:49.556
for me in the past
2 and a half years,

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:51.490
something I never really did before.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:54.690
Usually I just cook food

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.090
and let everyone else
take care of that stuff.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.150
Now, I'm getting to build my
brands and build a whole restaurant

00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.946
from the ground up which is
really interesting to me.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:06.580
What I would like to do is I would
like to get back at some point back

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.410
in the kitchen with an apron on and
working the line everyday and kind

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:14.780
of being creative, that's
kind of what I love to do.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:16.706
It's kind of what I
miss about the business,

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.240
not that I'm looking
back in any way.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.463
I feel very fortunate I've gone
to travel all across United States

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.496
and I'm having a lot
of fun with my contest.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:31.050
But I kinda wanna open up like
a nice cute 40-seat restaurant

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.246
when it's appropriately time,
so that's probably what I'll do.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.423
And for the meantime, I'm trying
to work a lot with the charities.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.803
I'm trying to really support
Michelle Obama's Let's

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:43.410
Move Campaign.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:45.010
You know, we're planning
rooftop gardens

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:46.743
at KIPP Academies everywhere in DC.

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:49.730
I get to go do demos with kids
and teach them about healthy food

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.890
and how to cook and
I really am enjoying

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:54.576
that part of my life right now.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:57.176
So I want to do a little
bit more of that

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.576
and then probably open
another restaurant soon.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.900
&gt;&gt; With Top Chef, how different
is what we see on TV compared

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.476
to your experience both
with the other contestants

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.776
and between you and the judges?

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:15.900
&gt;&gt; Well, you know,
they only use maybe--

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.100
I think it's like 5 percent
of the filming that they take.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.760


00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.380
It's pretty accurate.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.406
I have to admit.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.180
It's a-- they do a really great
job of capturing the story

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:34.633
but sometimes you miss some things
like for instance if, you know,

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.420
maybe-- you know, say there's a
lot of great constructive criticism

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.633
on one of your dishes or you know--

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.713
but they only air the part
that Tom Colicchio said, well,

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.656
this dish was flavorless,
you know I--

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:55.530
it's just, sometimes it takes some
of the judge's words out of context

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:56.216
and they use them and then it just
doesn't look too great about you.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:02.303
They're like, "Whoa, Spike cooked a
flavorless dish, he should go home."

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:03.240
You know, so it's-- you don't get
to hear the whole entire story

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.060
because sometimes there are
things that happen in the kitchen

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:12.993
that the camera just misses
and-- the [inaudible] oh my god.

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.176
The saga continues.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:20.910
You know, I think you took it.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.980
I think you took the [inaudible]
it's, you know, it's a-- it just--

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:31.863
I didn't get a chance to
watch the reunion show.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.396
I think I'm sure you got
asked a couple of questions.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:35.996
I'd be interested to
watch and see what he said

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:39.130
but he looks pretty guilty to me.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.560
Yes.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:44.826
&gt;&gt; Hi, I just wanna know your
favorite dish and do you plan

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.426
on expanding into Virginia at all?

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.183
&gt;&gt; Yes, I would definitely be
very happy to expand to Virginia.

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:54.676
I'm just looking for
a great location.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:00.490
You know, I have heard the
Shake Shack is coming to Dupont

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:01.640
and I hope none of you
go there by the way.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.640
If I see any of you there--
and my favorite dish?

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:08.676
Can I go with cuisine probably?

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:12.830
My favorite dish is kind of hard.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:14.880
You know, my favorite cuisine
is probably Vietnamese cuisine.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.780
I got to live in Vietnam for about
a year and study the cuisine.

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.726
I had also opened up a
restaurant in New York City

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.266
that was Vietnamese-French fusion.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.173
But I'm a simple eater.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.126
When it comes to the-- the kind
of food that I like to eat,

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.753
it's very minimal,
very simple ingredients

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:37.543
and that's pretty much it.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:38.123
I mean I like-- you know, if I
could pick one, I love [inaudible].

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.943
You know, it's a spicy
broth beef soup.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:45.033
I just think it's great, it's got
lots of herbs in it, green sprouts.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.830
A lot of different textures, it's
got a lot of great aroma to it

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.436
and it's like a great meal so--

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.843
&gt;&gt; And one last question
related to Top Chef.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:01.923
Do contestants really
listen to their--

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:04.130
to the judges' criticism
or does it just go

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.403
in one ear and out the other?

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.336
&gt;&gt; I think most of the
time, with me it goes

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.736
through one ear and out the other.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.376
You know, I respect all the judges

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.710
on the panel especially
the guest chefs.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.643
And I'm just joking
with you, there's--

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:20.230
the thing is that it's
such an intense show

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:22.873
and sometimes the odds are so
against you and it's so difficult

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.173
that it's just like, you know, you
can just mess up just a little bit

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:31.290
and they're gonna make
it a huge deal

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.683
on television because they have to.

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:40.543
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is very subjective but
as an audience, a lot of the times

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:41.430
or most of the time from my
perspective, I tend to hear comments

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.056
from the panel and I just
roll my eyes like whatever.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:47.563
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.030
Well, yeah, when Padma says
anything I'm like whatever.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:51.430
[ Laughter ]

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.856
&gt;&gt; It's like you took
like a half a bite.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:55.736
No, I'm kidding.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:57.043
I love Padma and she's
come a long way.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.096
You know-- you know, when
she first started the show,

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.430
it was a little iffy.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.140
I think she's really educated
herself and worked hard to kind

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:10.433
of talk food and know about food
but sometimes like it's just--

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:10.983
it's really, really weird
what comes out of her mouth.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:14.930
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.530
&gt;&gt; Sure. I think we've got
time for two more questions.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:19.130
We're in overtime.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:20.683
Do we have time for
two more questions?

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:23.350
One more question.

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.750
Okay, you're gonna have to
pick the person [inaudible].

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.950
Come on, just two more
questions, there's just two people.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.150
&gt;&gt; Real fast.

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:31.150
&gt;&gt; Real fast.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:32.483
&gt;&gt; I've been watching Just Desserts

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:35.683
and it's got a totally
different flavor or feel to it.

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.483
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's good.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:38.616
&gt;&gt; Are pastry chefs
really that much--

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:41.150
&gt;&gt; Crazy.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.150
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:45.883
&gt;&gt; Pastry chefs are crazy.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:47.816
I think that's gonna be a hit
show because they are nuts

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:48.950
and I think we'll be
able to see that soon.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.150
Yes.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.083
&gt;&gt; I actually have three
questions so I'm gonna say them all

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:54.616
and you pick the one
you wanna answer.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:57.150
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.750
&gt;&gt; The first one was what
was the hardest thing you had

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.016
to do on Top Chef or endure?

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:03.016
What was the funniest
thing you encountered?

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:05.883
And how-- since you've been
both a contestant and a judge

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:08.350
in this season, how do the chefs
compare between the two seasons

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:08.283
that you were on and you judged?

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:11.350
&gt;&gt; Oh, I think I like the
last question the most.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:16.016
You know, it's-- I guess it's
a school yard pick mentality.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:20.136
I mean it's-- some seasons
you're gonna end up with a bunch

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:21.113
of great chefs that are gonna
really make a great show and mold

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:24.493
and then sometimes you're gonna end

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.020
up with a season that's
just a little slightly flat.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:28.966
Do you know what I mean with that?

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:31.233
I mean they're still--
I love the show.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.300
I love watching it but sometimes I
think the New York season was maybe

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:34.966
the flattest season of all for me.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:37.743
I don't know if you guys remember
it, it was Hosea that won.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.256
I just didn't think
there was much to it.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.786
I think they could have done
a lot better job with New York

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.606
and they have with
the all-star show, so.

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.803
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:51.870
&gt;&gt; It should be good.

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.470
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.003
&gt;&gt; And so I just want to finish off
by thanking everybody for coming,

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.220
I really appreciate it, for
the support and everything.

&gt;&gt; It's been an honor to be here,

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:08.270
thank you very much
[inaudible] for having me.

And for those who haven't come to
We, The Pizza or Good Stuff Eatery,

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:13.180

end up there.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:17.630
