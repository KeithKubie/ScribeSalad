about 15 years ago we asked the

00:08:12.049 --> 00:08:12.059
about 15 years ago we asked the
 

00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:13.790
about 15 years ago we asked the
following question my background is

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800
following question my background is
 

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.389
following question my background is
mechanical engineering and over time my

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:17.399
mechanical engineering and over time my
 

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:19.819
mechanical engineering and over time my
work moved from macroscopic properties

00:08:19.819 --> 00:08:19.829
work moved from macroscopic properties
 

00:08:19.829 --> 00:08:23.779
work moved from macroscopic properties
of materials to nanoscale properties of

00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:23.789
of materials to nanoscale properties of
 

00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:26.869
of materials to nanoscale properties of
materials so in 2002 when I was head of

00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879
materials so in 2002 when I was head of
 

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:28.309
materials so in 2002 when I was head of
the department of material science and

00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319
the department of material science and
 

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:32.029
the department of material science and
engineering we created a nano lab and I

00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039
engineering we created a nano lab and I
 

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.490
engineering we created a nano lab and I
had a colleague of biologists a very

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:34.500
had a colleague of biologists a very
 

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.589
had a colleague of biologists a very
celebrated biologists who came to that

00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599
celebrated biologists who came to that
 

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:39.110
celebrated biologists who came to that
event and he said why are you working in

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120
event and he said why are you working in
 

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.059
event and he said why are you working in
dead materials you should be working in

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:41.069
dead materials you should be working in
 

00:08:41.069 --> 00:08:43.639
dead materials you should be working in
living materials I thought it was a very

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:43.649
living materials I thought it was a very
 

00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:46.879
living materials I thought it was a very
insightful suggestion and then few

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:46.889
insightful suggestion and then few
 

00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:48.710
insightful suggestion and then few
months later when I met him he said

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720
months later when I met him he said
 

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.990
months later when I met him he said
you're not going to excite me with all

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000
you're not going to excite me with all
 

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.840
you're not going to excite me with all
the fancy stuff unless you show me what

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:53.850
the fancy stuff unless you show me what
 

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.980
the fancy stuff unless you show me what
impact it has on human health or disease

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:56.990
impact it has on human health or disease
 

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.300

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:13.970
controlled manner and you can see how
 

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:16.629
controlled manner and you can see how
the red blood cells stretches then we

00:29:16.629 --> 00:29:16.639
the red blood cells stretches then we
 

00:29:16.639 --> 00:29:18.849
the red blood cells stretches then we
increase the force to as high as 150

00:29:18.849 --> 00:29:18.859

with 68 Pico Newton's it loses its

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:55.820
with 68 Pico Newton's it loses its
 

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.390
with 68 Pico Newton's it loses its
ability to stretch if you now move it to

00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:58.400
ability to stretch if you now move it to
 

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.730

150 Pico Newton's it still has no

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:00.740
150 Pico Newton's it still has no
 

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:03.190
150 Pico Newton's it still has no
ability to stretch so we can do a lot of

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200
ability to stretch so we can do a lot of
 

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.130
ability to stretch so we can do a lot of
computational biology on this and based

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:06.140
computational biology on this and based
 

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.040
computational biology on this and based
on that we can come up with predictions

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:09.050
on that we can come up with predictions
 

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.930
on that we can come up with predictions
of what they what is the extensive

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:10.940
of what they what is the extensive
 

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.670
of what they what is the extensive
stiffening or the reduction in

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:12.680
stiffening or the reduction in
 

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.730
stiffening or the reduction in
deformability so we found that it can be

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:15.740
deformability so we found that it can be
 

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.060
deformability so we found that it can be
as high as 10 to 100 contrary to what

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:19.070
as high as 10 to 100 contrary to what
 

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:21.010
as high as 10 to 100 contrary to what
was believed before based on cruder

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:21.020
was believed before based on cruder
 

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.990
was believed before based on cruder
techniques where it was believed it was

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000
techniques where it was believed it was
 

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.360
techniques where it was believed it was
maybe a factor of two or three so that

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:25.370
maybe a factor of two or three so that
 

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:26.980
maybe a factor of two or three so that
was the first outcome of these

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:26.990
was the first outcome of these
 

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:29.710
was the first outcome of these
experiments so the next question is what

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:29.720
experiments so the next question is what
 

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.190
experiments so the next question is what
does it being for safe cerebral malaria

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.200
does it being for safe cerebral malaria
 

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.390
does it being for safe cerebral malaria
how can we demonstrate it I mean

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:34.400
how can we demonstrate it I mean
 

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.730
how can we demonstrate it I mean
obviously we can't image at the cell

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:36.740
obviously we can't image at the cell
 

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.770
obviously we can't image at the cell

consequences for the progression of the
 

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.870
consequences for the progression of the
disease so this is an experiment that we

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880
disease so this is an experiment that we
 

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.840
disease so this is an experiment that we
did a few years ago this is again a

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:52.850
did a few years ago this is again a
 

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.700

what you see let me see if I can I have

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:07.460
what you see let me see if I can I have
 

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.150
what you see let me see if I can I have
a better laser pointers Philippines so

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:10.160
a better laser pointers Philippines so
 

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:17.110
a better laser pointers Philippines so
what you see here is that not yet me let

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120
what you see here is that not yet me let
 

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.720
what you see here is that not yet me let
me just stop it stop there that's why so

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:19.730
me just stop it stop there that's why so
 

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:21.910
me just stop it stop there that's why so
what you see here this particular cell

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:21.920
what you see here this particular cell
 

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:26.590
what you see here this particular cell
and this particular cell each has a

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:26.600
and this particular cell each has a
 

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.810
and this particular cell each has a
malaria parasite in this everything

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:28.820
malaria parasite in this everything
 

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.480
malaria parasite in this everything
around it is healthy so based on what I

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:31.490
around it is healthy so based on what I
 

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.150
around it is healthy so based on what I
showed you earlier these two cells are

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:34.160
showed you earlier these two cells are
 

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.920
showed you earlier these two cells are
now too stiff because of the parasite

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:35.930
now too stiff because of the parasite
 

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:37.900
now too stiff because of the parasite
they cannot squeeze through the tube all

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:37.910
they cannot squeeze through the tube all
 

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:39.940
they cannot squeeze through the tube all
the other cells around them should be

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:39.950
the other cells around them should be
 

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.910
the other cells around them should be
able to squeeze so that's the hypothesis

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:41.920
able to squeeze so that's the hypothesis
 

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:49.140
able to squeeze so that's the hypothesis
let's see if that works thank you so you

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:49.150
let's see if that works thank you so you
 

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:51.420
let's see if that works thank you so you
can see these two salt here and we're

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:51.430
can see these two salt here and we're
 

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.270
can see these two salt here and we're
going to add more cells around it

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:53.280
going to add more cells around it
 

00:31:53.280 --> 00:32:09.050
going to add more cells around it
shortly stop it can you click it again

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:09.060
 

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:20.340
okay just leave it thank you so you can

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:20.350
okay just leave it thank you so you can
 

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:21.900
okay just leave it thank you so you can
see a whole bunch of cells they can all

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:21.910
see a whole bunch of cells they can all
 

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:24.690

go to accept these two suppose you get

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:24.700
go to accept these two suppose you get
 

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.400
go to accept these two suppose you get

to a particular blood vessels the
outcome could be very different so this

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:31.450
outcome could be very different so this
 

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.120
outcome could be very different so this
is there is no chemistry here there is

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:33.130
is there is no chemistry here there is
 

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:40.230
is there is no chemistry here there is
no biology here purely mechanics so the

following questions that somebody have

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:01.810
following questions that somebody have
 

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:05.340
following questions that somebody have
malaria do they have fever because of

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:05.350
malaria do they have fever because of
 

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.830
malaria do they have fever because of
malaria do they have plasmodium

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840
malaria do they have plasmodium
 

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.450
malaria do they have plasmodium
falciparum malaria do they have

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:09.460
falciparum malaria do they have
 

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:11.430
falciparum malaria do they have
Plasmodium vivax malaria because the

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440
Plasmodium vivax malaria because the
 

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.240
Plasmodium vivax malaria because the
mortality rates are very different what

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:15.250
mortality rates are very different what
 

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.340
mortality rates are very different what
is the parasitaemia what fraction of the

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:17.350
is the parasitaemia what fraction of the
 

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:18.690
is the parasitaemia what fraction of the
red blood cells are infected with

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:18.700
red blood cells are infected with
 

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.270
red blood cells are infected with
parasites quantitatively because that's

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:21.280
parasites quantitatively because that's
 

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.680
parasites quantitatively because that's
an indicator of the quantitative

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:22.690
an indicator of the quantitative
 

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:24.360
an indicator of the quantitative
indicator of the progression of the

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:24.370
indicator of the progression of the
 

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:31.730
indicator of the progression of the
disease what I think so so this is some

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:31.740
disease what I think so so this is some
 

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.260
disease what I think so so this is some
that's the question can we answer it

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:34.270
that's the question can we answer it
 

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:36.600
that's the question can we answer it
with a microfluidic device this is the

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:14.609
in the video you're going to see a
normal oxygen conditions and a few

00:46:14.609 --> 00:46:14.619
normal oxygen conditions and a few
 

00:46:14.619 --> 00:46:16.589
normal oxygen conditions and a few
seconds into the video will slowly start

00:46:16.589 --> 00:46:16.599
seconds into the video will slowly start
 

00:46:16.599 --> 00:46:18.510
seconds into the video will slowly start
to decrease the oxygen partial pressure

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:18.520
to decrease the oxygen partial pressure
 

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.480
to decrease the oxygen partial pressure
as the partial pressure decreases you

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:21.490
as the partial pressure decreases you
 

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:23.220
as the partial pressure decreases you
will see increased sickling of the cells

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:23.230
will see increased sickling of the cells
 

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:27.059
will see increased sickling of the cells
and then will after some time will

00:46:27.059 --> 00:46:27.069
and then will after some time will
 

00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:29.370
and then will after some time will
slowly start to reintroduce oxygen and

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:29.380
slowly start to reintroduce oxygen and
 

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:32.910
slowly start to reintroduce oxygen and
you'll see the unsealing and in fact a

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:32.920
you'll see the unsealing and in fact a
 

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.010
you'll see the unsealing and in fact a
time for unsick lling it turns out is

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:35.020
time for unsick lling it turns out is
 

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.069
time for unsick lling it turns out is
one-tenth of the time of cycling and

00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079
one-tenth of the time of cycling and
 

00:46:37.079 --> 00:46:39.390
one-tenth of the time of cycling and
there are a lot of things one can do

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.400
there are a lot of things one can do
 

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:43.250
there are a lot of things one can do
with respect to this so this video now

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:43.260
with respect to this so this video now
 

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:45.630
with respect to this so this video now
so this we start with normal oxygen

00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:45.640
so this we start with normal oxygen
 

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.000
so this we start with normal oxygen
conditions now we take oxygen partial

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:48.010
conditions now we take oxygen partial
 

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:50.940
conditions now we take oxygen partial
pressure you can see we reduce a partial

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:50.950
pressure you can see we reduce a partial
 

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:53.069
pressure you can see we reduce a partial
pressure you can see sickling now so

00:46:53.069 --> 00:46:53.079
pressure you can see sickling now so
 

00:46:53.079 --> 00:46:54.779
pressure you can see sickling now so
this is the patient's blood outside the

00:46:54.779 --> 00:46:54.789
this is the patient's blood outside the
 

00:46:54.789 --> 00:46:57.750
this is the patient's blood outside the
body it starts to cycle and then in a

00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760
body it starts to cycle and then in a
 

00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.370
body it starts to cycle and then in a
few seconds we're going to reintroduce

00:46:59.370 --> 00:46:59.380
few seconds we're going to reintroduce
 

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:03.500
few seconds we're going to reintroduce
this is fed up of course this video a

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:03.510
this is fed up of course this video a
 

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:09.029
this is fed up of course this video a
few seconds we reintroduce oxygen and it

00:47:09.029 --> 00:47:09.039
few seconds we reintroduce oxygen and it
 

00:47:09.039 --> 00:47:11.910
few seconds we reintroduce oxygen and it
springs back to its original shape so

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920
springs back to its original shape so
 

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.589
springs back to its original shape so
what is the consequence of that in the

00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599
what is the consequence of that in the
 

00:47:13.599 --> 00:47:15.660
what is the consequence of that in the
human body I want to demonstrate that

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:15.670
human body I want to demonstrate that
 

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:18.599
human body I want to demonstrate that
with the next video before I show the

00:47:18.599 --> 00:47:18.609
with the next video before I show the
 

00:47:18.609 --> 00:47:22.380
with the next video before I show the
video and we let me describe what what

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:22.390
video and we let me describe what what
 

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:24.839
video and we let me describe what what
this experiment is so we create our

00:47:24.839 --> 00:47:24.849
this experiment is so we create our
 

00:47:24.849 --> 00:47:28.440
this experiment is so we create our
obstacle course so we rounded it off

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:28.450
obstacle course so we rounded it off
 

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:30.769
obstacle course so we rounded it off
because there are sharp corners cause

00:47:30.769 --> 00:47:30.779
because there are sharp corners cause
 

00:47:30.779 --> 00:47:33.989
because there are sharp corners cause
problems damage to the south so we got

00:47:33.989 --> 00:47:33.999
problems damage to the south so we got
 

00:47:33.999 --> 00:47:35.940
problems damage to the south so we got
cleverer after the first experiment so

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:35.950
cleverer after the first experiment so
 

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:37.979
cleverer after the first experiment so
we rounded this off we send the red

00:47:37.979 --> 00:47:37.989
we rounded this off we send the red
 

00:47:37.989 --> 00:47:39.569
we rounded this off we send the red
blood cells through here from the sickle

00:47:39.569 --> 00:47:39.579
blood cells through here from the sickle
 

00:47:39.579 --> 00:47:42.599
blood cells through here from the sickle
cell patient now then we start to reduce

00:47:42.599 --> 00:47:42.609
cell patient now then we start to reduce
 

00:47:42.609 --> 00:47:45.210
cell patient now then we start to reduce
oxygen partial pressure and what you

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:45.220
oxygen partial pressure and what you
 

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.970
oxygen partial pressure and what you
will see here is what happened cells can

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:47.980
will see here is what happened cells can
 

00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:49.739
will see here is what happened cells can
go through this quite a bit when the

00:47:49.739 --> 00:47:49.749
go through this quite a bit when the
 

00:47:49.749 --> 00:47:51.690
go through this quite a bit when the
oxygen level is when you have normoxia

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:51.700
oxygen level is when you have normoxia
 

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.450
oxygen level is when you have normoxia
conditions when you I hypoxia condition

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:54.460
conditions when you I hypoxia condition
 

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.789
conditions when you I hypoxia condition
the ability of the cell to go through

00:47:56.789 --> 00:47:56.799
the ability of the cell to go through
 

00:47:56.799 --> 00:47:59.009
the ability of the cell to go through
these obstacle courses significantly

00:47:59.009 --> 00:47:59.019
these obstacle courses significantly
 

00:47:59.019 --> 00:48:03.960
these obstacle courses significantly
diminishes show them this video clip so

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:03.970
diminishes show them this video clip so
 

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:05.430
diminishes show them this video clip so
you can see cells going through without

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440
you can see cells going through without
 

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.349
you can see cells going through without
any problem under not normal oxygen

00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:07.359
any problem under not normal oxygen
 

00:48:07.359 --> 00:48:12.420
any problem under not normal oxygen
conditions by the way we benefited quite

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:12.430
conditions by the way we benefited quite
 

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:15.539
conditions by the way we benefited quite
a bit from dr. Greg Kato who's the

00:48:15.539 --> 00:48:15.549
a bit from dr. Greg Kato who's the
 

00:48:15.549 --> 00:48:18.569
a bit from dr. Greg Kato who's the
hematologists at state and UPMC in this

00:48:18.569 --> 00:48:18.579
hematologists at state and UPMC in this
 

00:48:18.579 --> 00:48:19.920
hematologists at state and UPMC in this
collaboration over the last few years

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:19.930
collaboration over the last few years
 

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:26.430
collaboration over the last few years
and you'll see slowly one by one they

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:26.440
and you'll see slowly one by one they
 

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.859
and you'll see slowly one by one they
start to get obstructed at they even at

00:48:28.859 --> 00:48:28.869
start to get obstructed at they even at
 

00:48:28.869 --> 00:48:31.049
start to get obstructed at they even at
the entryway and you'll see in a few

00:48:31.049 --> 00:48:31.059
the entryway and you'll see in a few
 

00:48:31.059 --> 00:48:34.920
the entryway and you'll see in a few
seconds more and more of this happens in

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:34.930
seconds more and more of this happens in
 

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:39.180
seconds more and more of this happens in
this experiment this is in vitro and so

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:39.190
this experiment this is in vitro and so
 

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:40.680
this experiment this is in vitro and so
this gives us a tool we are actually

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:40.690
this gives us a tool we are actually
 

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:42.569
this gives us a tool we are actually
working within several different

00:48:42.569 --> 00:48:42.579
working within several different
 

00:48:42.579 --> 00:48:45.380
working within several different
hospitals around the country on

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:45.390
hospitals around the country on
 

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:49.729
hospitals around the country on
different for example controlling

00:48:49.729 --> 00:48:49.739
different for example controlling
 

00:48:49.739 --> 00:48:53.749
different for example controlling
hypotonic city for the red blood cell

00:48:53.749 --> 00:48:53.759
hypotonic city for the red blood cell
 

00:48:53.759 --> 00:48:56.489
hypotonic city for the red blood cell
adding water these are that a lot of

00:48:56.489 --> 00:48:56.499
adding water these are that a lot of
 

00:48:56.499 --> 00:48:57.900
adding water these are that a lot of
these tools have been around for quite

00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:57.910
these tools have been around for quite
 

00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:00.630
these tools have been around for quite
some time how effective are they are

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640
some time how effective are they are
 

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.120
some time how effective are they are
they really and can we quantify them

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:03.130
they really and can we quantify them
 

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:05.279
they really and can we quantify them
with these kinds of experiments so for a

00:49:05.279 --> 00:49:05.289
with these kinds of experiments so for a
 

00:49:05.289 --> 00:49:06.630
with these kinds of experiments so for a
number of experiments that are ongoing

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640
number of experiments that are ongoing
 

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.749
number of experiments that are ongoing
right now with respect to these

00:49:09.749 --> 00:49:09.759
right now with respect to these
 

00:49:09.759 --> 00:49:14.220
right now with respect to these
particular expertise so one of the

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:14.230
particular expertise so one of the
 

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:15.269
particular expertise so one of the
things we can get out of these

00:49:15.269 --> 00:49:15.279
things we can get out of these
 

00:49:15.279 --> 00:49:17.099
things we can get out of these
experiments is delay time of self

00:49:17.099 --> 00:49:17.109
experiments is delay time of self
 

00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:19.950
experiments is delay time of self
cycling versus density fraction from the

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:19.960
cycling versus density fraction from the
 

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:23.099
cycling versus density fraction from the
patient's blood and also sickling sickle

00:49:23.099 --> 00:49:23.109
patient's blood and also sickling sickle
 

00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:27.210

and other kinds of therapeutic

00:49:29.609 --> 00:49:29.619
and other kinds of therapeutic
 

00:49:29.619 --> 00:49:32.260
and other kinds of therapeutic
intervention so this is

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:32.270
intervention so this is
 

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:33.730
intervention so this is
just a summary there is a lot more

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:33.740
just a summary there is a lot more
 

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.580
just a summary there is a lot more
detail that I won't go into let me come

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:36.590
detail that I won't go into let me come
 

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:40.260
detail that I won't go into let me come
to the last few minutes of my talk and

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:40.270
to the last few minutes of my talk and
 

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:44.230
to the last few minutes of my talk and
finish with two examples so going from

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240
finish with two examples so going from
 

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.950
finish with two examples so going from
the cell levels down to the organ level

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960
the cell levels down to the organ level
 

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.320
the cell levels down to the organ level

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:50.330
one of the organs in the human body
 

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:52.030
one of the organs in the human body
that's affected by cell deformability

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:52.040
that's affected by cell deformability
 

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.030
that's affected by cell deformability
which is sort of a filter for defective

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040
which is sort of a filter for defective
 

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.880
which is sort of a filter for defective
cells especially red blood cells is the

00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:57.890
cells especially red blood cells is the
 

00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:01.300
cells especially red blood cells is the
theme and whether it's malaria or sickle

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:01.310
theme and whether it's malaria or sickle
 

00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:04.000

cell disease the mechanics of the screen

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:04.010
cell disease the mechanics of the screen
 

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:07.030
cell disease the mechanics of the screen
plays a huge role and it's a very

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040
plays a huge role and it's a very
 

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:11.530
plays a huge role and it's a very
complex topic but the screen has the

00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:11.540
complex topic but the screen has the
 

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:13.570
complex topic but the screen has the
smallest fitness test the most stringent

00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:13.580
smallest fitness test the most stringent
 

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:15.460

that you're pushing the fluid with a

01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:12.320
that you're pushing the fluid with a
 

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.670
that you're pushing the fluid with a
pressure so there is a forward force

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:14.680
pressure so there is a forward force
 

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.560

balances out the drag the gravitational

01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.280
balances out the drag the gravitational
 

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.980
balances out the drag the gravitational
force so only in the horizontal

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:35.990
force so only in the horizontal
 

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:39.700
force so only in the horizontal
direction you have forces net forces so

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:39.710
direction you have forces net forces so
 

01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:41.020

can take two particles of the same
material but slightly different size so

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:54.950
material but slightly different size so
 

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:56.890
material but slightly different size so
I can take a slightly smaller particle

01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:56.900
I can take a slightly smaller particle
 

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:58.630

and a five or ten micron particle and
 

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.510
and a five or ten micron particle and
them together the two particles will

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:04.520

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.570
them together the two particles will
experience two different forces from the

experience two different forces from the
 

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:09.820
experience two different forces from the
acoustic wave the larger particle will

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:09.830

go in one direction the smaller particle

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:11.810
go in one direction the smaller particle
 

01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:13.510
go in one direction the smaller particle
will go another direction I can separate

01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520

them now I can do the following

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:16.430
them now I can do the following
 

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.190
them now I can do the following
experiment I have two particles of the

01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200

material the physical properties are

01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640
material the physical properties are
 

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.580
material the physical properties are
different because the physical

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:24.590
different because the physical
 

01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:26.230
different because the physical
properties are different the radiation

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240
properties are different the radiation
 

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.210
properties are different the radiation
pressure will be different and therefore

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:28.220
pressure will be different and therefore
 

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:30.280
pressure will be different and therefore
one particle will go in one direction

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:30.290
one particle will go in one direction
 

01:02:30.290 --> 01:02:31.930
one particle will go in one direction
another particle will go in another

01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:31.940
another particle will go in another
 

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:35.110
another particle will go in another
direction I can separate them so we did

01:02:35.110 --> 01:02:35.120

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.240
direction I can separate them so we did
that we did that with an efficiency of

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:37.250
that we did that with an efficiency of
 

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:40.300
that we did that with an efficiency of
more than ninety five percent so once we

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:40.310
more than ninety five percent so once we
 

01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:41.800
more than ninety five percent so once we
did that then we thought okay that is

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:41.810
did that then we thought okay that is
 

01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:44.320
did that then we thought okay that is
the case we can do something better if I

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:44.330
the case we can do something better if I
 

01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:46.570
the case we can do something better if I
have healthy white blood cells and if

01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:46.580
have healthy white blood cells and if
 

01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:48.700
have healthy white blood cells and if
you have cancer cells there's both the

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:48.710
you have cancer cells there's both the
 

01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:50.080
you have cancer cells there's both the
difference in size and different

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:50.090
difference in size and different
 

01:02:50.090 --> 01:02:51.730

property I should be able to separate

01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:51.740
property I should be able to separate
 

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.430
property I should be able to separate
the cancer cells from the red blood cell

01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:54.440
the cancer cells from the red blood cell
 

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.680
the cancer cells from the red blood cell
so we first started with cultured cells

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:56.690
so we first started with cultured cells
 

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:58.420
so we first started with cultured cells
to see if the experiment works with a

01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:58.430
to see if the experiment works with a
 

01:02:58.430 --> 01:03:01.720
to see if the experiment works with a
hypothesis works so we took breast

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:01.730
hypothesis works so we took breast
 

01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:04.270
hypothesis works so we took breast
cancer cells cultured cells like mcf-7

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:04.280
cancer cells cultured cells like mcf-7
 

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.390
cancer cells cultured cells like mcf-7
and we took cervical cancers of HeLa

01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:07.400
and we took cervical cancers of HeLa
 

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.780
and we took cervical cancers of HeLa
cells and we spiked the concentration

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:10.790
cells and we spiked the concentration
 

01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:12.400

mix them sent them through this we could

01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:18.380
mix them sent them through this we could
 

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:19.780
mix them sent them through this we could
separate the cancer cells from the

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:19.790
separate the cancer cells from the
 

01:03:19.790 --> 01:03:22.630
separate the cancer cells from the
healthy cells quite accurately still it

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640
healthy cells quite accurately still it
 

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.040
healthy cells quite accurately still it
doesn't solve the problem because it

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:24.050
doesn't solve the problem because it
 

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.720
doesn't solve the problem because it
doesn't solve the problem of circulating

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:25.730
doesn't solve the problem of circulating
 

01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:27.849
doesn't solve the problem of circulating
tumor cells because you want to find one

01:03:27.849 --> 01:03:27.859
tumor cells because you want to find one

in 100,000 south then we went to Hershey

01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:30.740
in 100,000 south then we went to Hershey
 

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.620
in 100,000 south then we went to Hershey
hospital in Pennsylvania because we had

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:32.630
hospital in Pennsylvania because we had
 

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:34.390
hospital in Pennsylvania because we had
some initial connections and

01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400
some initial connections and
 

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.210
some initial connections and
collaborations there and we got blood

01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:37.220
collaborations there and we got blood
 

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.940
collaborations there and we got blood
samples from three breast cancer

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:39.950
samples from three breast cancer
 

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:43.960
samples from three breast cancer
patients and we took blood from the

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:43.970
patients and we took blood from the
 

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:46.270
patients and we took blood from the
patients and data series of experiments

01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:46.280
patients and data series of experiments
 

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.589
patients and data series of experiments
of course they diagnosed the cancer

01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599
of course they diagnosed the cancer
 

01:03:47.599 --> 01:03:49.900
of course they diagnosed the cancer
using other techniques and we were able

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:49.910
using other techniques and we were able
 

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:52.210
using other techniques and we were able
to capture the circulating tumor cells

01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:52.220
to capture the circulating tumor cells
 

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.760
to capture the circulating tumor cells
out of this and we could capture one in

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:54.770
out of this and we could capture one in
 

01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:57.370
out of this and we could capture one in

not ready for prime time but we this is

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:05.150
not ready for prime time but we this is
 

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:07.270

what we demonstrated last year so this

01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280
what we demonstrated last year so this
 

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.099
what we demonstrated last year so this
is essentially the technique let me show

01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:09.109
is essentially the technique let me show
 

01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:13.780

going this way healthy white blood cells

01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240
going this way healthy white blood cells
 

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.420
going this way healthy white blood cells
going in this direction we can turn the

still it may not be good enough but
 

01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:54.579
still it may not be good enough but
equally we've been able to show that we

equally we've been able to show that we
 

01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:56.410
equally we've been able to show that we
are able to capture these cells and

01:04:56.410 --> 01:04:56.420
are able to capture these cells and
 

01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.450
are able to capture these cells and
these cells at least based on the

01:04:58.450 --> 01:04:58.460
these cells at least based on the
 

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.069
these cells at least based on the
experiments we have so far I cannot

01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079
experiments we have so far I cannot
 

01:05:00.079 --> 01:05:02.290

confirm that hundred percent based on
 

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.849
confirm that hundred percent based on
the experiments we have so far it seems

01:05:03.849 --> 01:05:03.859
the experiments we have so far it seems
 

01:05:03.859 --> 01:05:06.280
the experiments we have so far it seems
that the cells are not affected by our
