00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.680
 hello these are conspiracies alberto 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.660
 in the first episode we saw how 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.029
 we can use the def tools to put 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.890
 hand to the code of a web page is like 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.720
 we can save it directly in the file 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.180
 source via a feature of 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.980
 chrome called workspaces in this 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.290
 instead we'll see how we can 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.760
 emulate other devices and how 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.010
 we can connect remotely for 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.690
 example to this the cell phone here and 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.010
 then paying the code that is there 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.010
 actually turning over 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:53.160
 let's see then what our neighbor is 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.440
 task what we are asked to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.570
 make less responsive or to do 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.910
 so that it works properly too 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.730
 on mobile devices 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.790
 in fact if we go to decrease the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.500
 window size we can 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.869
 see that the menu items go 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.060
 below the bar which is not 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.540
 exactly the behavior that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.060
 we also want we are asked to 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.610
 check a certain functionality 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.770
 that is activated with the changes of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.000
 orientation directly on the screen 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.780
 but we see this in a second 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.630
 time to make less responsive 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.810
 so let's use media quiri that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.750
 briefly they are expressions that 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.070
 we can add to our css code 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.229
 it is based on a certain 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.660
 condition apply new ones 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.110
 property in this case we have one 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.890
 class was that applies a border of a 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.320
 pixel is when ours 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.479
 device has a maximum width 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.850
 of 600 pixels 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.630
 this class will also apply one 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.750
 then 100 percent width 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.340
 back to our application is like 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.770
 we want to do 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.860
 we want to make sure that when the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.019
 screen width and for example of 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.590
 at most 500 pixels all elements 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:20.880
 of the menu will be hidden inside 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.370
 of a drop-down menu so let's go into the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.989
 source code 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.610
 then we have the html page 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:32.549
 so my name is the drop-down menu 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.620
 we also activate the viewport meta tag which 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.450
 causes the application to come 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.600
 all rendered inside the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:47.269
 screen and then here with my media query 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.269
 that active 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.750
 refresh the page now is not 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.800
 still nothing changed though us 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:02.209
 we decrease the width of the screen 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:06.380
 here is the drop-down menu with 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:10.459
 all the elements inside then 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.069
 decrease the chrome window is one 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.650
 of the ways in which we can verify i 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.989
 changes of how ours works 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.390
 application according to the different ones 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.150
 screen size a size 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.280
 another way we have and this in i 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.180
 developer tools if I don't go out first 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.390
 activate the console 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.819
 we have a new panel that does 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.440
 they call ration where we can precisely 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.730
 emulate our device 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.680
 in this case for example can 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.690
 decide to emulate the dimensions of the 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:45.890
 screen with a resolution of 320 x 480 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.410
 if I apply it, I must see that here 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.950
 the screen has been reduced precisely from 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.670
 320 x 480 and can scroll mine 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.670
 application inside 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.140
 anyway let's see how now 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.950
 how the app works in a 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.540
 real device starting from android 4 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.519
 we have the possibility to waive the 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.930
 code that runs directly on ours 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.750
 android device 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.840
 to do this we can use 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.799
 this extension of chrome allows 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.940
 to make the remote connection 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.829
 this extension adds this to us 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.840
 button with aldo that if 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:31.550
 we apply and start this 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:35.180
 charge here is the attack on 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:39.700
 my phone with chrome has opened 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:45.550
 inside you see this is recognized 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.550
 and if I'm going to make a target action 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.180
 here it is here to do it 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.710
 now 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.650
 here is where I can upload with then 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:13.539
 I start directly on the website 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:17.500
 as you can see now chrome is a page 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:24.400
 google pico open both for mine 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:29.699
 application and you see that here is already the 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:35.310
 menu as we wanted it here I can do 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:35.310
 inspect and the tools are opened 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:43.479
 related to the application I have 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:45.819
 opened at this time among other things a 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.340
 very interesting feature that was 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:51.129
 introduced now in chrome canary e 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:54.639
 soon we will also see in the version of 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:06:01.590
 chrome and the screencast that allows me 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:04.779
 to see in real time what 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.240
 what appears in my device 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:13.270
 see right now I'm standing 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:15.729
 scrolling the page on the desktop e 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:22.240
 the behavior is replicated on 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:24.130
 good cell phone now we can go to 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.029
 see the other tusk that was there 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:30.190
 requested or that relating to 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:34.509
 small screen orientation 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:37.860
 problem i'm the requa i don't have the 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.860
 orientation sensor that comes to me 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:51.000
 recognized by chrome so one thing 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:51.000
 what can I do is come back with here 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:07:02.160
 and simulate orientation with this one 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:04.830
 property of the sensor here what 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.950
 practically happens when I ride 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.570
 when I turned the phone and if 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.000
 I take slides canelli put 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:15.030
 in the belt the belt comes to me 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.250
 emptied when the phone is turned of 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.950
 90 degrees 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:23.880
 in this case I can try to simulate 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:29.610
 the celer ometro and to turn of 90 degrees 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:31.800
 the range then hungry and rich program 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.120
 as you see now, my word appears to me 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.420
 the alert for the belt was 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.420
 empty 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.500
 said this 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:48.180
 see which the next request 

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:51.689
 now they are pointing out to us that 

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:54.120
 this button only downloads one 

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:55.740
 shuriken at a time in the belt 

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.180
 now we want to make sure that every 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.349
 once we press it they don't come 

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:04.680
 loaded one hundred at a time 

00:08:00.349 --> 00:08:06.629
 so now I don't remember where the 

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.460
 code that is executed when however 

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:15.779
 this button one thing I can do 

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:19.199
 is to highlight it so only here in the 

00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:23.150
 panel elements I can go to events 

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:27.719
 listeners equa to the click event 

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:29.879
 if I open this item I can see 

00:08:27.719 --> 00:08:32.270
 that the code that is executed yes 

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:32.270
 find it here 

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:38.719
 this is the function that is inside the 

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:42.690
 my gs file and see what it does 

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:48.630
 perform this function I can go 

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:54.810
 directly to modify it except business 

00:08:48.630 --> 00:09:00.440
 I also change the element instead of 

00:08:54.810 --> 00:09:04.890
 take one take on android 

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:07.320
 now the page we will know the 

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.890
 button loads 100 items 

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.890
 in the belt 

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:22.360
 we will see that it is the last change that 

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:24.010
 we did will have an impact on 

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.510
 performance of our application in 

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:27.700
 particular we will observe dips of 

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:29.830
 therefore we will see which tools 

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:33.120
 we have available to identify 

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.120
 and solve this kind of problems
