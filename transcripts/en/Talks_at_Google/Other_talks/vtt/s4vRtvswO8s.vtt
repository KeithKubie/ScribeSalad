CHADE-MENG TAN: My friends,
thanks for being here.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.760
We are honored today to
host somebody who I

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.070
look up to, Ping Fu.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.550
Ping Fu is an admired 3D pioneer
and a remarkably

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.860
successful entrepreneur.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.670
As co-founder and CEO of
Geomagic, she was named Inc.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.280
Magazine's entrepreneur
of the year in 2005.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.080
Before co-founding Geomagic,
she managed the team that

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.760
created NCSA Mosaic, which
later became the Netscape

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.760
browser, which of course gave
us the internet boom.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.580
So Ping was there right
at the beginning of

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.470
the internet boom.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.990
And with a name like Ping, sort
of expect to be involved

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.620
in internet.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.950
Sorry.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.410
Engineer joke for those
on YouTube.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.050
Ping was also named an
Outstanding American by

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.980
Choice, and she advises the
White House on innovation and

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.830
entrepreneurship.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.610
But more than her success and
her talents, what I most

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.890
admire about Ping is how she
deals with adversity after

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.910
adversity in her life with
amazing resilience and, more

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.560
importantly, kindness
and compassion.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.950
Her new book, her latest book,
is an autobiography, "Bend,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.030
Not Break," available in Google
Play and all other

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.760
major bookstores.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.250
In the next hour, Ping and I
will talk about the exciting

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.770
world of 3D technology and
Ping's fascinating life story.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.173
And with that, let's
welcome Ping Fu.

00:01:45.173 --> 00:01:48.957
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:48.957 --> 00:01:51.220
CHADE-MENG TAN: Thank
you for being here.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.070
So happy to have you.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.240
PING FU: Pleasure to be here.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.875
CHADE-MENG TAN: So let me begin
with a question, Ping.

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:58.950
You live a fascinating life.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.060
But if you were to boil down
your life story to a few

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.461
sentences, how will
you describe it?

00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:12.000
PING FU: Well, my life is really
truly a American story,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.250
American dream story.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.826
I would say I lived
three lives--

00:02:17.826 --> 00:02:21.250
CHADE-MENG TAN: For
the price of one.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.590
PING FU: --for the price
of one, yes.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.900
Maybe I'm writing the next
chapter of the life.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.540
I lived in China during Cultural
Revolution, and then

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.026
being exiled, and I arrived
in the United States as

00:02:35.026 --> 00:02:39.740
fresh-off-boat, poor
immigrants try to

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.270
look for a new life.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.610
And I did gone through all the
new immigration story, and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.740
then later start a business and
become an entrepreneur.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.265
So that's why I said there's
three chapters of my life.

00:02:54.265 --> 00:03:00.600
But really, it shows the human
spirit of adoptability to

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.596
change and of the power
of resilience.

00:03:04.596 --> 00:03:05.940
CHADE-MENG TAN: You're
very modest.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.580
You describe your life as fairly
normal, but your life

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.930
is extraordinary.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.600
And I'll give you a sense of
how extraordinary it is.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.660
So when I read your book, the
first few chapters made me

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.910
want to cry.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.310
Your early life, to me,
was horrendous.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.820
You were taken away from your
parents at the age of eight

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.410
and then you had to fend for
yourself and your baby sister,

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.040
Hong, at the time, at
eight years old.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.260
And then you were gang-raped
at 10.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.860
You were hungry, you were
beaten, were abused, endlessly

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.600
abused for years.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.360
And then as an adult, you were
thrown into prison for

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.730
documenting female
infanticide.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.030
And then you were exiled
from your own country.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.550
And then, as if that's not bad
enough, you were writing in

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.410
the United States and your first
experience in the US was

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.740
getting kidnapped.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.610
And what I want to
know is this--

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.970
So first, I'd like to invite you
to tell us, the audience,

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.529
about your early experience
in your own words.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.940
And more importantly, I want
to know how you managed to

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.360
preserve your goodness, your
kindness, your compassion

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.123
despite such a horrible
experience.

00:04:31.123 --> 00:04:32.180
PING FU: Thank you, Meng.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.140
That's a very mindful
question.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.870
So let me first bring
you back to 1966.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.970
That was at the time of China's
infamous Cultural

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.490
Revolution.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.930
Mao decided to turn the country
upside down so all

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.950
school were closed.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.560
I was eight years old.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.220
I was raised by my aunt and
uncle who I thought was my

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.070
biological parents.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.450
And I had five older siblings,
and I was the youngest one in

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.770
the family.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.140
So one day, I heard noise
down in our courtyard.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.120
I already knew the country's
kind of turned upside down, so

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.280
I saw they came for my mother,
who was my aunt, But

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.980
they came for me.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.200
And that was the day that the
Red Guard coming to our house

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.000
and told me that my mother
was not my mother.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.740
And I was screaming and crying
and I said, no, no, no.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.460
You're lying.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.720
I tell my mother,
you're lying.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.820
I am your child.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.390
Just a week ago, you told
me I was your favorite.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.450
And I wasn't even given the
chance to give her a hug when

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.830
I was ripped away from the only
family that I knew and

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.260
put on a train from Shanghai
South Station to send to

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.580
Nanjing which is where my
biological parents lived.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.180
And I arrived just a little
bit too late.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.790
When I arrived in Nanjing, all
I saw was big dusts on the

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.940
street, thousands of
people, chaos.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.650
You can smell blood.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.000
And my biological parents were
put on a truck being taken

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.520
away, sent far, far
away in exile.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.530
And my mother, on the back of
truck, screamed out my name,

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.600
Ping, please take care
of your sister.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.810
And a little bit later of that
day, I was put into a

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.460
dormitory, led to the second
floor of a room.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.380
There, I found my little
sister, four years old.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.060
And the room was dusty,
full of garbage, not

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.935
even having a bed.

00:06:43.935 --> 00:06:49.320
The only shining place was this
concrete floor where she

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.550
kick her legs and polished
that place.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.000
And she was crying probably
for hours, here

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.910
eyes were red shot.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.280
I thought she was going
to go blind.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.630
That was my first day.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.600
I lost the parents
who raised me.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.100
I lost the parents who bore
me, and I became surrogate

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.670
mother to my little sister.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:15.260
Then little did I know, Cultural
Revolution would last

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.890
for 10 years.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:21.210
And I was in that ghetto, and
one room was no bed, no

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.200
bathroom, no wash basin,
for the next 10 years.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.140
I've gone through a lot
of atrocity that you

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.260
will see in the book.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.300
And then when I was 10 years
old, my sister was thrown into

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.730
a water canal outside
the wall.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.150
And I jumped in to
try to save her.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.520
I did save her, but I
didn't spare myself.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:50.390
I was gang-raped by a group
of teenagers, broken,

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.930
cut up with a knife.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.990
I still have 40 stitches
on my body.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.240
Almost died.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.140
But the physical injury was not
the most hurtful thing.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:09.390
What was most hurtful was the
emotional abuse that followed.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.080
At 10, I really didn't
understand anything.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.230
I just thought I was
beaten badly.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:21.030
But the rumor went around, and
I had a nickname, Broken

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.320
Shoes, which means that you are
so worn out that nobody

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.600
would want you.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.280
So at 10, I was a
ruined woman.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.929
And I had no adults to
turn to, I had no

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.510
psychologist to talk to.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.659
I have no one to help me.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.120
And many times, I thought
about dying.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.770
I thought about this life
is not worth living.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.430
But I had this little sister
that I have to take care of.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.800
I couldn't just die.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.810
I have responsibilities.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.960
I think if I didn't have her, I
probably would have treat my

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.090
life much lighter.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.370
So let me force forward to end
of Cultural Revolution and

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:05.170
then that was literally
12 years later.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:10.160
China reopened university
in 1977.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.520
And I studied to try
to pass national

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.320
exam to go into college.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.240
I did pass, I do go
into college.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.590
I was known as the girl whose
lights never turned off.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.230
My life turned around, China
start to change.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.210
When I was in college, I studied
Chinese literature.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.670
I actually wanted to be
astronaut, but I didn't have a

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.550
choice, so I went to study
Chinese literature.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.540
CHADE-MENG TAN: Close enough.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.280
PING FU: Yeah, definitely.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:45.060
So kind of the last semester
before I graduate, I thought I

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.930
was going to go to graduate
school, so I

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.720
went to do a thesis.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.500
And China was imposing one child
policy, and I heard that

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.810
there was widespread killing
of baby girls in the

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.830
countryside.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.470
So I decided to choose
that as a topic.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:05.460
And that research being aired
in some of Chinese newspaper

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.180
where Chinese government was
calling for stop killing, but

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.040
that was the first documentation
from China that

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.590
admitted widespread killing
was happening.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:21.080
And that news being picked up by
international newspaper and

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.400
UN posts sanction for human
rights violation.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.310
So this was an embarrassment
for the new government.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.610
At the time, Deng Xiaoping has
already taken over China.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.820
Culture Revolution was over.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.370
So this was an embarrassment to
the new government, and I

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.110
got in trouble and got
thrown in jail.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.200
But that was only three days.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.820
I was lucky that Deng Xiaoping
had asked what

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.580
happened to the reporter?

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.780
And they said, well, we
throw her in jail.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.540
And he said, why?

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.430
This is not Cultural
Revolution anymore.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.060
But he didn't give any other
instructions, so nobody knew

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.030
what to do with me.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:04.970
And I was let out and then two
weeks later, I was given a

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.280
passport and told to leave the
country and never to come back

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.330
again, and not to file political
asylum because my

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.600
parents and my sister
were in China.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.130
And I applied many university,
many countries, and I end up

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.310
in United States.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:27.550
So your question is, how did
I live a life like that and

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:31.145
remain to see good
and to be kind.

00:11:31.145 --> 00:11:32.600
CHADE-MENG TAN: Yes,
preservation of goodness.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.470
PING FU: The preservation
with goodness.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.760
So when I was a little, my
uncle, who I thought was my

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:45.290
father, had taught me many of
those human principles.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:49.500
He told me that you don't do
things to other people that--

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.610
you don't want to treat other
people not the way how you

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.380
want to be treated.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.730
He also told me that if you
are straight, you're not

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.190
worried about your
shadow is not.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:05.160
And another thing that he had
me memorize is what's called

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.850
three friends of winter, and
bamboo is one of it, which is

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.830
what I wrote in my book.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.990
And he told me that Ping, you
need to be bamboo, bending

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.700
with prevailing wind,
but never breaking.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.030
And when I was going through
Cultural Revolution, I know

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.480
that if I don't focus
on goodness, then I

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.250
couldn't live my day.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:33.220
So even in the darkest time,
there are human kindness from

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.040
different places.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.840
I would find food left
out at my door.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.670
Even though people don't dare
to be associated with us,

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.910
people were secretly
trying to help us.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:47.340
There would be beauty always in
the ugliness, if you wanted

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.850
to seek for it.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:53.450
I also found being good helps
me to survive, because when

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:56.940
you're good to others, it makes
it very hard for others

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.530
to be cruel to you.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.392
So I just continued
focus on that.

00:13:02.392 --> 00:13:05.140
CHADE-MENG TAN: Thank you.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:10.240
So you came to America after
surviving kidnapping.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.940
I remember readying that you
came only knowing three words

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.630
of English, which is hello,
help, and thank you.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.080
PING FU: Very useful.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:19.510
Three words.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:20.390
CHADE-MENG TAN: You
should have also

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.850
added where's the toilet.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.640
That's what I would've added.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.730
And you came basically
crippled in language.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.750
And then when you went to
graduate school, you switched

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.450
over to computer science.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.340
And what you say was because you
realized mistakenly at the

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.950
time you were told that
computer science is a

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.500
different language, and that
you think it seems I'm

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.280
crippled in English, but if I
learn a new language, then

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.310
I'll be on a fair, level
playing field.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.550
For those of you wondering why
all the Chinese immigrants are

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.364
software engineers--

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:54.212
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:54.212 --> 00:13:55.930
PING FU: That's the reason.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.760
CHADE-MENG TAN: There's
the secret.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.580
What is even more fascinating
was that you went to class--

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.110
you were in a master's class in
computer science, and you

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.740
went to college not knowing
the basic mathematical

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.170
concepts like fractions.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.170
And you wrote that you saw a
professor writing on the

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.630
blackboard numbers and then line
between, you were like

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.390
what's that?

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:22.530
So how was it like back then
to be in that situation?

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.155
PING FU: That's a very
good question.

00:14:24.155 --> 00:14:28.360
So like Meng said, I came here,
I thought I was going to

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.010
study comparative literature.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.060
My English was too poor.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.310
And I can't study science
because I didn't go through

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.360
K-12 education.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.620
I asked around, and somebody
said, oh yeah, there's a new

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.100
field called computer science.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.040
And I said, what's that?

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.510
They said, well, it's man-made
language and you learn that to

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:48.720
make stuff.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.610
I said, oh great.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.040
I'm good with language and
I know how to make stuff.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.420
And that's how I got into
computer science.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.580
And because I didn't go through
formal education, I

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:03.700
didn't study mathematics in
classroom, when I went to

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.400
study computer science,
the first

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.130
class I took was calculus.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:12.210
I was OK with the new
concept when the

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.360
professor was teaching.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.790
If it's new, I can follow.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.800
And when he put fractions on the
blackboard, I'd just never

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.900
seen anything like that.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.450
And when I asked the professor,
he said, go back to

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:25.790
high school.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.580
And I took it very literally.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.130
I went to get high
school math.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:29.980
I couldn't find it.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.130
I went back to get middle
school class.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.150
I couldn't find it.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.730
I found it on second
grade math book.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:43.710
So I actually borrowed entire
math book from first grade to

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:49.140
high school, and study at
night and study calculus

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.430
during the day.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:53.390
And the smart student in the
class said Ping, you really

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.340
don't need that much.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.760
You just go get a calculator.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.420
As long as you understand the
concept, rest of the things

00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:59.210
you can use calculator.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.350
That was very helpful.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.810
Back then, we actually don't
really have computer.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.690
Yet today, you can
do anything.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:11.880
But that also tells you like you
can learn a lot of things

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.980
even if you didn't have it.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.190
And that's what I did.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.840
I didn't study everything
in the book.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.530
I just went to look for
whatever I needed.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:28.140
And plus calculator plus asking
people, and got by.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:33.380
First semester, I almost
failed my math class.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.270
But by the second semester,
the professor thought-- a

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:40.180
second math class, not the
first second semester.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.740
The second calculus,
I think it was

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.920
multi-variable calculus.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.760
The professor thought that I was
the sister of the Olympic

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.600
math champion.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.574
I thought I arrived.

00:16:53.574 --> 00:16:55.455
CHADE-MENG TAN: That's
fascinating.

00:16:55.455 --> 00:16:56.710
Thank you.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:02.670
PING FU: So one point about your
question is, from time to

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.780
time, I would feel like I'm the
most stupid person in the

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.630
room, even though a lot
of people think

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.310
I'm wickedly smart.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:14.040
Because often, I would have
people talking in the room and

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.760
I was sitting there and knowing
I was the only thing

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.500
have absolutely no clue what
they're talking about.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.084
There's just no context
in back of my head.

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:27.720
And in some way, it's good
because I have to learn so I

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.000
have this infinite curiosity.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.390
And it also keep me humble no
matter how smart I could be.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:39.610
But I constantly feel I have
this stupidity in me.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.640
CHADE-MENG TAN: Speaking
about humble--

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.750
so let's fast forward
to today.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.990
And today, you are one of the
most admired people around,

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:48.820
maybe in the world.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.590
You are very successful.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:54.700
You are successful entrepreneur
and engineer.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.860
You were named the entrepreneur
of the year.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.460
And you give advice to
President Obama.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.910
I also give advice, but
the difference is

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:04.850
that he invited you.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:05.940
He didn't invite me.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.430
I'm just kidding.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.490
I just spam your email.

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:10.830
PING FU: He comes to you.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.480
CHADE-MENG TAN: I'm
just kidding.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.390
So you are amazingly successful,
up to including

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.600
being a presidential adviser.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.040
So how do you feel about your
success today, especially in

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.841
the context of your
overall life?

00:18:25.841 --> 00:18:27.410
PING FU: That's a
good question.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:32.690
I think originally, I did get my
head blown up a little big

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:33.860
like balloons.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.040
But what I realized, success is
kind of like balloon-- they

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.805
disappear very quickly.

00:18:38.805 --> 00:18:42.010
It's kind of like raise
and getting a salary.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.510
First, day you get excited.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.880
Next day, you forget about it.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.390
So I don't really think about
success, because I don't even

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.200
know how to define it.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.290
I think about contribution.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.470
I think it's easy to think
about contribution.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.990
And the contribution can be for
yourself, for your loved

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.170
ones, for your community, for
the people who you know, or

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.760
for people who you don't know.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.430
And you don't have to contribute
everything every

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.590
day, but if you can contribute
something some days, that

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.870
makes everybody feel good.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.440
CHADE-MENG TAN: Thank you.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.740
I like how you define your
success as a contribution

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.340
rather than--

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.490
PING FU: Rather than
a success.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.800
CHADE-MENG TAN: --source
of glory.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.130
So I have to ask you
about your shoes.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.080
These shoes are very cool.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.835
So let's tell everybody
about your shoes.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.000
PING FU: So this is
a 3D printed shoe.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:44.890
It actually is a MoMA piece, and
it's displayed in Modern

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.220
Museum of Art in New York.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.715
And it's a mashup
of many things.

00:19:49.715 --> 00:19:56.860
So the top of my shoe has
Google logo, airplanes,

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:59.800
chains, guns, anything.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.570
You can just put it on.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.900
The bottom of the shoe is
actually a play on materials.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.340
So instead of being solid,
you put a lot of geometry

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.370
structure in there to
make it both strong,

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:15.260
lightweight, and flexible.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.830
And then the material
is linen.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:21.290
So linen is biodegradable
unlike plastic, and it's

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.270
incredibly strong because
it's natural fiber.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.590
And then the shape
of the shoe--

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:30.770
let me take it off-- is
the arch of my feet.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:36.170
And also, we have done fluid
dynamic to make sure that it

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:39.900
is fitting not only to the shape
of my feet, but also how

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:44.560
I walk, my body weight, and
whether or not my feet tilt

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.950
from in or out.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:50.110
So this is the same principle
being made before Lady Gaga

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:53.430
shoe if you're wondering how he
could be able to dance on

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:56.970
the stage with 12 inches
heel without falling.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:02.540
It's because it's perfectly
balanced to her

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.760
body and her movement.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:10.320
I started Geomagic to try to
create software that produced

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.750
one of the kind product that
start with us, the person, not

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.660
building a product start
with a product.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.940
And if you don't know about 3D
printing, 3D printing is very

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.380
similar to 2D printing.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.890
It uses the same
inkjet nozzles.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:31.400
Instead of coming
out with ink, it

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.260
comes out with material.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.960
And it prints one
layer at a time.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.680
If you just take one layer,
it's just like 2D printing

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.650
other than it's depositing
material.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:45.410
And then it use various curing
method to harden the material.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.130
Then you do it one
layer at a time.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:52.690
Therefore, you can build very
intricate internal structures,

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.210
because you've build it
one layer at a time.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:01.520
I think in very short distance
to future, you will all have a

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.900
3D printer at home.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.280
And you would all have a
3D scanner at home or

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.740
3D camera at home.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.370
That would be really, really
cool, because if you think

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:15.700
about publishing industry, the
desktop publishing completely

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.210
changed how publishing
is being done.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:22.920
And desktop manufacturing or
desktop fabrication will

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.440
completely change how
things are made.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:33.770
This can go from airplane parts
to Invisalign to shoes,

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:38.500
even to the bioprinting like
we already today can print

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:43.180
bone scaffold, organs, leather
without killing

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.020
animals, meat maybe.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.550
We can produce [INAUDIBLE]
proteins without having to

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:54.070
have slaughter houses and
erasing costs that taking up a

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.840
lot of energy.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.650
CHADE-MENG TAN: Wow.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:57.900
That is cool.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.380
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.630
PING FU: Here's the Bugdroids.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.340
Those are all created
by kids from school.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:12.960
They take your standard Android
figurine and then they

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.560
put design on it and then push
a button, gets printed.

00:23:21.884 --> 00:23:25.280
CHADE-MENG TAN: So when you
went out to do this, you

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:31.230
wanted to do personal factories,
PF, your initials.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.800
So did you feel that you
achieved personal factories

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.755
yet, or is that in the future?

00:23:35.755 --> 00:23:39.500
PING FU: I think now it's
at the taking off point.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.120
When I started Geomagic--

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.030
that's about 15 years ago--

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:48.170
I saw a demonstration from 3D
Systems founder Chuck Hull.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.410
He was showing a machine called

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:51.530
stereolithography machine.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.000
And today, we call them
3D printer or additive

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.700
manufacturing or personal
factory.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.940
It blew my mind, so I said,
I want to do this.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.550
And that was at internet high.

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.996
Everybody was--

00:24:04.996 --> 00:24:08.030
Jack Welch was talking about
destroyyourself.com.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:11.360
And I worked with Marc
Andreessen and started Mosaic,

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.600
become Netscape.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.760
Everybody was surprised.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.450
Why would you start a
manufacturing company?

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.050
It's not sexy.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.380
It takes 15 years, and now it's
the hottest industry.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.780
CHADE-MENG TAN: There are two
things I really appreciate

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.520
having you talk about
in the context of

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.690
being a business leader.

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:33.150
And it's not success.

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.340
It's not even contribution.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.090
One of the things I really
appreciate you talking about

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.130
is this quote.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:42.320
It is all about love.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.140
And the other is very similar
to the first thing, which is

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.140
you always try to make the
compassionate choice.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.290
You've got two choices.

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:54.050
You always made a choice that's
more compassionate.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:58.080
And in your words, you say,
choose always choosing to love

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.160
and to understand.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.190
So can you talk more about love
and compassion in the

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.584
context of business
leadership?

00:25:05.584 --> 00:25:08.880
PING FU: OK.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:14.220
So in terms of a business, one
of the things I said about the

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:19.870
business in the 2000s, which is
after internet crash come

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:23.200
and everybody said this is an
incredibly difficult time to

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.460
run business, is what I
observed, a Renaissance

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:30.060
movement of social consciousness
for business.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.320
And I do think that down market
contributed to that.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.690
And Google is a great company
that embodies social

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.520
consciousness and business
can live together.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:45.840
So I remember a lot of time, I
get MBA student come in to

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.920
interview and they would ask me,
what's your exit strategy?

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.130
I would say the exit sign
is clearly marked.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.420
And the people would ask me,
what is your goal for next

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.460
five years?

00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.910
Where you want Geomagic to be?

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:03.570
I said I only want one thing,
which is people come in to

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.840
work here, they love what
they do and they love

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.470
who they work with.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.660
And that's why I say it's
all about love.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.510
If you don't love what you do,
you're wasting your life.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.410
If you don't know who you're
working with, you're not

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:19.120
enjoying what you're doing.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:25.030
And love and business are
so intimately related.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:29.310
I cannot see any great companies
doesn't love their

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:33.640
people and their people doesn't
love their company.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.750
So that's that.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.080
And then to come back to talk
about compassion and

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.610
understanding--

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:42.670
and this is a part of--

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.030
I've been searching business.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:49.730
And startup business and big
business are quite different.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:52.600
People talk about business
models, they talk how to run

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.920
business, management principles,
and all of those

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.000
being written a lot.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.200
But I wake up in the morning, I
tell myself every day I want

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.420
to practice compassion
and understanding.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:10.100
I go around, talk to employees,
or I go outside to

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.420
try to understand in the society
what problem can we

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.190
solve and what value
can we create?

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.770
And that's the understanding
part.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:21.810
As a CEO, my job is to
bring in outside

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:25.590
world into the company.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:29.320
And no business and service
should exist if they are not

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.010
there to solve problems.

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:34.310
So my job is to bring outside
world into the company.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:38.130
But I also need to fundamentally
understand what

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:43.070
we can actually do to help the
world, or what kind of talent

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:48.360
our people have, or what they
can create, and also how we

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.210
can understand each other, how
they understand a problem.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:55.250
And every day, I tell myself
that's the two things I need

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:55.950
to practice.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:59.090
If I can practice that,
I can help to

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:02.870
create a great business.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:06.420
Whatever the management or
business principle people want

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:10.820
to bring in or people think
that's good, that's fine.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:16.510
You said at Google, if
it's fun, we do it.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:20.640
CHADE-MENG TAN: I think I said
because it's fun or because

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.690
it's cool is good enough
reason to do anything.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:26.286
PING FU: Good enough reason
to do anything, yes.

00:28:26.286 --> 00:28:31.730
CHADE-MENG TAN: So if you're
running a bigger company,

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.820
let's say something the size of
Google, 30,000 employees,

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.280
will you still be employing
the same philosophy?

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.850
And if so, how do you
imagine doing that?

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:44.630
PING FU: A very good question.

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:49.400
With startup company, because
startup company is in the

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:53.860
place to search a repeatable and
scalable business, they're

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:58.520
not in known market, they're
not having known customers.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:03.310
Larger company have a known
market and known customers,

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:06.690
and also with a small startup
company, you know every one.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.490
You don't need a
lot of process.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:11.740
So you could actually trust
your people and hope that

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.895
there's going to be good
business to come.

00:29:13.895 --> 00:29:19.440
When you become Google's size,
you can't just trust and hope.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.910
You really need to do trust
and track, right?

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:26.270
So that's where the big data,
the measurement comes in.

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:29.250
I would still practice the
same compassion and

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:29.830
understanding.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.450
But maybe I need to understand
different things.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:37.060
Maybe I need the tools to help
me with data to understand

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.080
things rather than just
talking to people.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.590
That's not enough.

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:44.610
But I would still do the
same philosophy.

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:47.870
And it just needs different
tools to help and to achieve

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.705
the same understanding
and compassion.

00:29:50.705 --> 00:29:52.370
CHADE-MENG TAN: Very cool.

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:55.130
So right now, Ping, what
do you want to be

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:58.205
when you grow up?

00:29:58.205 --> 00:29:58.825
PING FU: Great.

00:29:58.825 --> 00:29:59.790
It's all about love.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:03.087
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:03.087 --> 00:30:09.440
PING FU: So I am design next
stage of my life, I think.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.120
It would be great at every
stage, you can say what do you

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:16.990
want to be when you grow up Not
very long ago, I met this

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:20.320
fortune teller from India.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.770
And he was telling me that he
had read many, many people's--

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:29.260
he reads hand, including Dalai
Lama and Deng Xiaoping and so

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:29.850
on so forth.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:31.410
I don't know that's
true or not, but I

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:32.850
just assume it's true.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:36.130
And so he ready my hand
and he said to me--

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:38.610
and this was actually
five years ago.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:45.260
He says, when you grow up,
you will be a teacher.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.285
And so this may be
what I will do.

00:30:48.285 --> 00:30:50.470
And I don't actually think
I would be a teacher.

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:55.000
I think I probably will be a
midwife to give birth for good

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.180
ideas or good things that
come from other people.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.200
That's probably what I'll do.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.465
I'll be midwife.

00:31:01.465 --> 00:31:03.260
CHADE-MENG TAN: Cool.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.740
And teacher at the same time.

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:10.380
So I want to leave about half
an hour for you to ask Ping

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:11.270
some questions.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.030
But do we have a mic for--

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:13.330
STEPHANIE: Yeah.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.270
CHADE-MENG TAN: OK.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.250
So while Stephanie's passing out
a mic, I want to ask you

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:22.210
one more question, which is
Ping, how are you going to

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:23.770
save the world?

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:26.700
And how do I and how
do we, Google, help

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.220
you save the world?

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.540
PING FU: Wow, that's
a big question.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:37.850
So when I started Geomagic, I
wanted to save the world by

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:43.650
combining hand craftsmanship
with IT technology.

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:48.820
And I wanted to bring back much
of what we human have

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.690
created in thousands of years,
the treasures, the memory, the

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:56.520
collective treasure, to bring
it to the future generation.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.700
I feel that's our
responsibility.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.300
And I still feel that this is
the space I want to be in and

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:07.500
this is what I will do
to save the world.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.800
From a Google point of view, I
always admired Google Search.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.930
But I do have a request.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:17.260
I know you do incredible
job in organizing world

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.860
information and delivering
needed

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:25.020
information to me in my fingertip.

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.770
But there's still remaining
in the text and

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:30.110
image and 2D world.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:35.440
And I want you to help to create
search information

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.010
which will search
shapes in 3D.

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:47.870
Say if I want save the world to
deliver customized product

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:53.540
to you, customized medicine to
you as a human, but how do we

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:59.570
search all those things that
are not just text and image

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:03.070
and files that display on
flatscreen or can be printed

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:05.290
on flat piece of paper?

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:10.080
And use that to create whether
or not I broke my bone, I want

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:14.800
to customize the cast to be
made, that I can put it on.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.120
Or if I want to buy a pair of
shoes, that shoe doesn't have

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:19.700
to be made.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.530
I can just upload my shape
of my feet and

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.440
say, this is the shape.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.780
This is what I want, and
make one for me, right?

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:30.370
So the search is a part of the
product design itself.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:35.500
The search actually is embedded
in what I want.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.330
It's not advertisement.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:42.790
The value is embedded before the
product is even developed.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.760
Why that's important--

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:50.910
today, we produce 80% of goods
that's never needed.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:54.075
If you produce 100%,
you sell 20%.

00:33:54.075 --> 00:33:57.510
Other 80% are more
or less wasted.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:58.950
Either reduce the price
or whatever.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:00.560
So that's one thing.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.610
And then we also ship
them across the sea,

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:04.680
which is not green.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.340
We also use a lot
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:11.969
And we waste a lot of time,
and we're very frustrated.

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:15.389
So I think if the search
can be embedded

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:18.429
in the design itself--

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:22.050
and imagine in the future,
everything you buy or

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.320
everything you use-- doesn't
even have to be you buy.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:30.699
Everything you use in terms of
product is a software code.

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:32.400
And then your search
is embedded in

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.454
that software code.

00:34:35.454 --> 00:34:37.760
CHADE-MENG TAN: So for those of
you want to help Ping save

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.159
the world, please feel
free to talk to her.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:44.389
One more comment I want to make
before we pass the mic is

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:46.510
what you said earlier reminded
me of something.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:49.600
There was a four star general
in the US Army whose name

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.179
escapes me right now.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:54.880
But his advice for people who
asking for advice about life,

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.450
his advice is don't stop
falling in love.

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:01.930
For a four star general to say
that, that blew my mind.

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:04.560
And so what you just said
reminded me of that.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.140
And with that, anybody want
to ask a question?

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.390
The mic is over there.

00:35:14.771 --> 00:35:16.610
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for coming here.

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.652
Your story's very
inspirational.

00:35:19.652 --> 00:35:24.840
I do want you to talk about the
times when it was not so

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:30.080
easy to look at world so
positively, and it was not so

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:34.670
easy to think about compassion
or love.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.840
So how did you pick
yourself up?

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.922
And it's easier to say that
there's a bright side and

00:35:41.922 --> 00:35:45.780
there is love in the darkest
moment, and there's probably

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.030
something, right?

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.690
So how do you pick
yourself up?

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:56.160
And when you see [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.970
who are struggling with those
kind of things, what do you

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:01.950
say to them?

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.930
PING FU: So that's a
very good question.

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:10.340
When the world is cruel to you,
when the things are dark,

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.780
when you're really in a
rat hole, how do you

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.030
pick yourself up?

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.340
I think there are two
things at play.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:24.950
One part I like to say that I
may be born with good genes.

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:29.600
We do all have our DNA and
everybody gets born with

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.560
different kind of personality.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:37.630
The other part is, I did find
that sometimes, when you go

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:41.590
through very deep atrocity and
you come out on the other

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.750
side, it gives you
that optimism.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:50.620
Because for me, every time
the door is closed,

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.130
something else happens.

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:54.670
So I believe behind every closed
door, there's open

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:59.930
space because my life tells
me, teaches that.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:01.370
When I don't have enough
English, I

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:02.550
study computer science.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:05.170
Look where I am today.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:08.700
When I got kick out of China,
I did not know what kind of

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.990
life I would have in America.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:13.230
Look where I am today.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:17.550
But in those dark moment, part
of it is also I did that for

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:19.510
survival because if I'm
not going to be

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:22.520
kind, I'll get beaten.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.460
So I have no choice.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.340
But when I was kind,
I find other people

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.540
returning the kindness.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.780
And the other thing is, I did
not have any right back then.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:37.760
I was forced in stage to scream
I was nobody and I'm

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.430
worse than the [INAUDIBLE]
beneath your feet.

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:42.460
I was eight.

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.795
So after I said that many time,
I start to believe that.

00:37:44.795 --> 00:37:48.050
I start to believe I
did not have right.

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:50.100
When you believe you don't have
a right, you're pretty

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.930
vulnerable.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:56.730
And when I was vulnerable, I
find other people help me.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:59.700
So sometimes it isn't that
you're strong, you're

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:04.430
successful, you're great,
that you see goodness.

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:07.400
A lot of time it is when
you're in the dirt.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.750
When you really need help, that
little bit kindness that

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:14.050
people show you become
this big.

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:15.400
And that's what I grab on.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.650
That's what I just
latch to it.

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:22.330
And then I also truly
understand how

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:24.430
important that is to me.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:26.820
And that's why I practice
compassion,

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.750
because I've been there.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:31.790
I've been in those places
where that little bit

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.250
compassion saved my life.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:38.650
I don't even know the person who
show me that knows that.

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.150
When I landed in America,
I had $80 travelers

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:43.925
check in San Francisco.

00:38:43.925 --> 00:38:47.980
The American man behind me gave
$5 to the ticket counter

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.280
so that I could guy my ticket
to go to university.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.690
I have no money.

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:56.030
I don't know for him $5
mean a lot to him.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:58.900
But for me, that was
a life to me.

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:03.550
So I learned through my life,
when in doubt, always err on

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.630
the side of generosity.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:09.650
AUDIENCE: So how do you feel all
the trauma that you had as

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:14.150
a child, how did that affect you
adversely when I guess you

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.850
grew up [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:17.660
relationships and everything,
because you obviously had very

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:22.710
unusual relationships as a
child, losing most of your

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.980
relatives, and then coming
here not knowing anybody.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:28.030
And obviously that maybe had
some adverse effects.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:31.530
And I know there's a lot of
debate about kids with tough

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:34.560
childhoods, how that affects
them later in life, positively

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.720
and negatively.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.930
Some people say actually
there's very little

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:40.726
correlation between what
happened to them as a child

00:39:40.726 --> 00:39:43.800
and what happens to them as an
adult in their relationships.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.130
And other schools of thought
say it has a

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:47.236
very profound effect.

00:39:47.236 --> 00:39:49.402
So how did it affect
you personally?

00:39:53.144 --> 00:39:56.030
PING FU: So I think Nietzche
said what doesn't break you

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:57.290
makes you stronger.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:00.950
And I do believe practice makes
you stronger like sports

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:03.380
or programming.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.390
I just have a lot more
practice over a

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:08.000
certain skill set.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.170
But then I like what you said
that it could also affect you

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:12.780
a different way.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.620
I do not wish anyone to
live the life I have.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:19.660
I do not believe that by living
through the type of

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.050
life that I lived made
me successful.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:25.210
I don't think there's
a causality.

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:27.800
But I do believe that because
I lived through this kind of

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:31.120
life, I overpracticed
certain things.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.510
For example, by not going to
school, I overpracticed

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:35.750
self-learning.

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:39.010
And self-learning is a very
important aspect of

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:41.350
entrepreneurship because there's
no book to teach you

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:43.890
how to be a CEO.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:48.930
I practiced how to deal with
adversity which helped me to

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:51.760
help the company to survive,
for example.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:58.510
But there's also the normal
human relationship.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.820
I didn't have it.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:05.940
So maybe I could be overly
critical or less sensitive to

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.220
other people.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:11.220
I don't think whatever
is a big deal.

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.140
And that's not right.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.920
This is why I'm practicing
compassion every day or

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.540
practicing understanding every
day because I feel that's

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:20.650
important because I have
a different context.

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.260
I saw other people grew up.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.740
And this became more
important.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:28.930
when I became a mother, because
my daughter grew up in

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:34.780
completely protected environment
and never know a

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.600
day of atrocity.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:40.000
So how do I bring up a daughter
who's just had

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.470
everything and make sure that
she will become independent?

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:51.930
What I realized is it is not
the what happened to you

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:53.320
that's important.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:58.760
It is how you deal with the
emotional intensity when

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.510
things happen to you.

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:03.760
So for example, something could
be very simple, would

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.740
give my daughter this much
emotional intensity, would

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:09.390
give me nothing.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:11.620
And it would take a lot
to give me this

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.120
big emotional intensity.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:18.360
But emotional intelligence or
fluency is the same skill.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.180
It's independent of the event.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:25.090
But it is dependent on how
you react to it and how

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:26.570
you think about it.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:29.270
So that's my realization.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:34.700
It's we all have our own
response to life event to us.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.430
And we can control what life
is going to throw at us.

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:38.555
Life is messy.

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:40.740
Life is going to throw
anything at anybody.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.510
Everybody's life is a story.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.430
So it's how we deal with it.

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:47.250
That's important.

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:50.435
And that's what I try to express
in this book also.

00:42:50.435 --> 00:42:51.680
CHADE-MENG TAN: So
how do you do it?

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.210
How do you teach young people,
teenagers, about

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:57.720
dealing with emotions?

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.410
PING FU: So it's not about not
to have emotion, which I

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:03.550
actually have very little.

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:07.460
I kind of try to learn to have
emotion whereas people around

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:11.510
me, are kind of like, whoa,
I saw this drama.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.470
But over the time, I feel like I
need to have some drama too,

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.230
otherwise I'm not feeling it.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:18.540
I need to feel it.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.930
So it is actually more of--

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:25.400
it's more of how you
react to it.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.210
You wrote a lot in your book
about how to deal with

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:30.680
emotion, how to think about
it, which I think is very,

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:31.720
very helpful.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.776
You have a lot of practical
advice that I need

00:43:33.776 --> 00:43:35.900
to learn from you.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:39.270
And I'm kind of coming from
a different side.

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:43.690
People living normal upbringing,
have loving

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:49.520
parents and loving spouse and
loving friends may have a lot

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.710
of emotions that they
have to deal with.

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:56.890
So they need a Google search
yourself kind of help.

00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:58.140
I'm kind of on the other side.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.240
I'm kind of like I haven't
seen fractions

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.990
and I have too little.

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:06.410
So I buy books every
time I see people.

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:11.530
Like I bought all Rumi's
poetry on love.

00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:14.640
Last night, I went to
A Year of Love, A

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.230
Night of Rumi dinner.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:19.460
I find it fascinating because
I was trying to learn how to

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:23.015
develop my emotion versus
managing the emotion.

00:44:26.132 --> 00:44:26.930
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.120
First of all, thank you for
sharing your stories.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.845
Quick question for you is,
looking back at your life, if

00:44:32.845 --> 00:44:35.250
you think of a personal decision
you made that was

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:37.980
under your control, is there
something that you can think

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.380
of that you would change or take
back that you personally

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:44.425
had a choice and control on
if you had a chance today?

00:44:44.425 --> 00:44:48.120
PING FU: That's a very
good question.

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:53.630
What I come to realization is
what happened to me, I have

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.860
absolutely no control.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:00.390
But what I do have control is
how I feel about it and what

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:03.060
is my experience to it.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.320
So even bad things happen
to you, you could have a

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.400
different experience, and you
can feel differently.

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.400
So those two things I feel
like I do have control.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.860
So I learned to really
appreciate every day that

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:19.660
comes to me where I pretty much
have total control over

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.060
what kind of day I have.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.730
And I want to have an
interesting day.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:27.830
I'm not saying I just want
to have a happy day.

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:30.670
All emotions are interesting,
just like food,

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:31.920
you want all taste.

00:45:34.045 --> 00:45:36.250
I saw a question over there.

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:37.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:41.683
survived adversity to say that
there was one moment where

00:45:41.683 --> 00:45:44.205
they felt themselves become an
adult, whether it was death of

00:45:44.205 --> 00:45:45.783
a parent, whether--

00:45:45.783 --> 00:45:47.390
you've lived through so much.

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:50.253
Is there one moment where you
felt yourself losing childhood

00:45:50.253 --> 00:45:51.460
and become an adult?

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:56.161
Or was it just a series of very
harsh nightmarish event?

00:45:56.161 --> 00:46:00.140
PING FU: So at eight years old
when I lost both set of

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:04.040
parents and became the surrogate
mother to my

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.980
daughter, I was forced to be
adult in that instance.

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:11.810
I spent my life to try to be
child rather than adult.

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:13.880
But I think my adulthood
is overdeveloped.

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.712
So I'm trying to
work that away.

00:46:16.712 --> 00:46:18.580
CHADE-MENG TAN: So how are you
going to be a child again?

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.490
PING FU: When I get old, I'll
be child regardless

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:22.290
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:24.980
my friends going to deteriorate,
and I'm going to

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:28.430
depend on other people.

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:33.640
I usually say at the two ends of
your life, you're a child.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.090
And that's why it's so important
for us to show

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:39.130
compassion to older people,
because they

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:41.620
become child again.

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.720
AUDIENCE: First, congratulations
on the sale to

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:44.702
3D Systems.

00:46:44.702 --> 00:46:46.670
I just saw that.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:48.843
Question for you [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:48.843 --> 00:46:53.630
how you planned a career and
when you decided to change it,

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:57.690
how did you decide when you were
coming out of Mosaic and

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:00.582
starting up with [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:00.582 --> 00:47:04.440
starting up on 3D printing
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.880
when you were debating how to
make these decisions, how do

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.655
you decide and teach yourself
everything about an entirely

00:47:09.655 --> 00:47:11.920
different industry and get
up to speed on it?

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:15.070
And you said you learned
to learn.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.420
But how did you learn
to learn?

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.330
PING FU: That's a very
good question.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:21.375
So I do believe that you--

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:26.950
not everybody like to change
their life all the time.

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:29.070
If you spent all your life
to do same thing, that's

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:30.130
perfectly fine.

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:31.310
You can perfect something.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:34.790
Like I was having this
conversation with Yo-Yo Ma not

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:36.027
too long ago.

00:47:36.027 --> 00:47:40.040
He become the best cello
player musician and

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.550
everything.

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:44.630
He envies me changing my
life every 10 years.

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:48.310
But I envy him to be
this grand master.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:52.140
So it's perfectly fine to be
incredibly good at one thing.

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:56.660
And I like to change my life
every 10 or some years because

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.890
I feel like life is like
a mountain range.

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:03.790
At every peak, the view
is different.

00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:08.060
But if you like that kind of
life, one of the things I like

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:11.970
to leave with you is you
can't always go up.

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:15.030
You have to go down to
go to another peak.

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:19.130
So I did go through job to job
to take a pay cut, to take

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:20.440
different positions.

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:24.950
But what I pursue is
a different view.

00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:27.500
And you also don't know if that
view is really the view

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.500
you thought it's going to be.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:34.230
So first thing is, you need to
know who you are, yourself,

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:35.840
the authentic self.

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.400
I know I like change,
I like variety.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.640
I know I view life as
a mountain range.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.825
So I know who authentic
self is.

00:48:43.825 --> 00:48:44.800
That's one.

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.060
The second thing that you need
to know is what you are

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.390
passionate about.

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:51.160
You could be passionate
about something that

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.350
you're great at.

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:54.830
Then you can be grand
master of something.

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:57.150
You could also be passionate
about something that you're

00:48:57.150 --> 00:49:00.680
truly interested, but you don't
know anything about it.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.210
Then you go learn about it.

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:06.443
So that's kind of what I decided
when I make change and

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:08.596
how and what.

00:49:08.596 --> 00:49:10.730
CHADE-MENG TAN: It sounds to
me like the previous thing,

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:13.390
that you're always doing
what you love.

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:15.580
PING FU: I always do
what I love, yes.

00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:19.480
That's why I say it's
all about love.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.780
AUDIENCE: Thank you,
Ping, for coming.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.140
I think your courage to deal
with the challenge of that is

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:25.870
truly amazing.

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:27.630
I have two questions.

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:30.870
One is, how's your sister
doing these days?

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:32.860
I hope she's doing well.

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:35.530
And the second one is,
do you travel back

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:37.260
to China these days?

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.200
Do you find it difficult with
all those miserable memories?

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.304
And how do you deal with it?

00:49:41.304 --> 00:49:43.080
PING FU: Very good question.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.850
So good thing is my sister
is doing very well.

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:50.420
I brought her to United States
two years after I came to

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.640
United States.

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:54.640
She literally went to depression
when I left since I

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.860
brought her up as our mother.

00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:00.340
And she is entrepreneur
herself.

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.180
She studied architecture.

00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:08.310
And now, she's doing specialty
retail in Scottsdale, Arizona.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:12.580
She has two very great
shops over there.

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:15.590
So that's my sister.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.243
Second question was--

00:50:17.243 --> 00:50:17.950
AUDIENCE: Travel
back to China.

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:19.770
PING FU: Oh, travel
back to China.

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:23.350
I did not go back to China for
10 years until I become US

00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:28.080
citizen because I didn't feel
safe to go back to China.

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.090
I did go back to China after
I became US citizen.

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:35.550
The very first time I went back
to China, I felt lost,

00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:38.580
because China has completely
changed and it wasn't the

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:40.680
China that I remembered.

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:44.670
And it was speaking of '90s when
China was kind of in the

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:47.310
chaos of economic development.

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:52.670
I came back and really just felt
I'm American now, and I

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:54.770
wasn't going to go back.

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:57.020
But that again changed
when China

00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:00.150
developed and I developed.

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:04.220
So when I started Geomagic over
the time, I actually now

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.340
have a subsidiary in China.

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:11.330
And also, when China come to the
global scene, when China

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:14.750
become economic powerhouse,
people ask me about China.

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:16.040
I have a Chinese face.

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.400
It doesn't matter
what I think.

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.990
People see me, they ask me about
China, I go OK, I better

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:22.630
go back to study China.

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:26.540
So I spent quite a bit of time
to study Chinese history,

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:29.510
because now the books is also
available, more objective

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:31.580
material is available.

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:34.072
I almost got a Ph.D. in that.

00:51:34.072 --> 00:51:37.660
So I studied Chinese history,
Chinese literature, Chinese

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:41.040
politics, economics, everything
just so that when

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.870
people ask me China,
I can say something

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:43.940
intelligent about it.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:47.260
Now, there is one thing about
not going to school is that

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.550
you never know when to stop.

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:52.030
There's no exam and you
don't really know

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:53.420
when you know enough.

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:57.390
And then my stack of book,
I called them my stack of

00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:02.040
[INAUDIBLE] just keep growing
and shrinking like this.

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:05.520
So when I do that, I changed
my view of China because I

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.840
really cannot judging a country
with more than 2,000

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:13.020
years of history with my
15 years atrocity or my

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:14.030
experience.

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.670
I just happened to live
in the darkest

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:18.730
period of modern China.

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:22.590
It's kind of like you can't
define Germany with Holocaust.

00:52:22.590 --> 00:52:26.026
You can't define China with
Cultural Revolution.

00:52:26.026 --> 00:52:29.010
AUDIENCE: As soon as I tell my
wife about your shoes, I know

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:30.010
she's going to want them.

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:34.485
So the question is, where are
we today compared to when do

00:52:34.485 --> 00:52:37.180
we think those type of shoes and
such will be available to

00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:40.920
mainstream consumers at an
affordable cost so that people

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.680
have them readily available
in their houses and such?

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.550
PING FU: So it depend on how
many Google dollars you have

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:48.150
in your pocket.

00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:50.920
And depend on whether or not
Google subsidize shoes like

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.170
they subsidize books.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.010
You can buy those shoes today.

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:04.550
We have a storefront called
Freshfiber which is the brand

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:09.690
name for those shoes and
also iPhone cases.

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:15.140
And you can also find them on
this site called cubify.com.

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:18.590
So the 3D Systems
little personal

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:22.330
printer today is $1,200.

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:23.480
It's called a Cube.

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.270
It's kind of like cubism.

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:28.220
And then the website is
called cubify.com.

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:33.310
The shoes currently is at
a price about $200.

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:37.440
So it depends on the Google
dollars you define, whether or

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.660
not it's affordable or not.

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:42.500
It's kind of in the price
of Nordstrom.

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:49.185
And if you want to customize,
it's still less than $1,000.

00:53:49.185 --> 00:53:52.880
I know shoes in Barney cost
more than that they

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.130
don't have on sales.

00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:01.510
And also your question, when
does it will reach consumer

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:02.440
massive level.

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:06.686
My prediction would be
within five years.

00:54:06.686 --> 00:54:08.290
CHADE-MENG TAN: If no more
question, I have one last

00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:10.290
question for you, Ping.

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:13.410
For the past hour, if there's
only one thing the audience

00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:16.710
brings back from this past hour,
what do you want that

00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:18.586
one thing to be?

00:54:18.586 --> 00:54:20.580
PING FU: One thing for
the audience--

00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:21.530
CHADE-MENG TAN: To bring home.

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:23.080
PING FU: --to bring home.

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:24.510
CHADE-MENG TAN: Beside
those shoes.

00:54:27.372 --> 00:54:29.450
PING FU: Message, right,
not shoes?

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:32.160
OK.

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:35.130
I would say remember life
is a mountain range.

00:54:38.545 --> 00:54:41.450
CHADE-MENG TAN: My friends,
"Bend, Not Break," available

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:43.150
in Google Play and
major bookstores.

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:44.770
And my friend, Ping Fu.

00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:45.070
Thank you.

00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:50.153
[APPLAUSE]
