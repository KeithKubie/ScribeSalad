00:00:10.714 --> 00:00:13.090
JASON SILVA: So there's
a fascinating Ted talk

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.550
by the brilliant
Esther Perel, author

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.280
of "Mating in
Captivity," where she

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.710
explores the secret to desire
in long-term relationships.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.150
Because this, of course,
is the holy grail.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.460
Falling in love is easy.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.160
The honeymoon period,
anybody would take that ride.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.150
But what happens upon
the moment that routine

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.690
becomes part of your
reality, the person

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.920
you're with every single day.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.460
How do you retain that
passion, that fire?

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.380
This is again the mystery
of long-term desire.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.680
And Ester Perel, she went
around the world asking couples,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.360
when are you most
drawn to your partner?

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.700
And what she found
across the board,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.440
everyone said the same thing.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.370
They found their partner
the most attractive when

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.830
they were able to see their
partner as a self sustaining

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.620
entity.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.620
It's this idea that they
were able to perceive

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.630
their partner the way that
other people perceive them,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.730
as a complete individual; as
a complete self-sustaining

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.470
person.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.740
Not the other half of
you, but as a solid whole.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.660
And so this idea that attraction
requires a kind of distance,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.367
that even desire requires
a crossing over, she says.

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:20.200
And I thought that was
absolutely brilliant,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.050
because how can incorporate
that into our own relationships?

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.550
How can we create space between
us and the ones we love,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.260
so that we can reclaim
that crossing over?

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.750
So that we can see them as
that self-sustaining entity,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.350
and fully appreciate them
as the fully rounded,

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.909
complete being that they are.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.950
I think she's on to
something, that Esther Perel,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.960
and for that reason, I
think she's brilliant.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.551
And I think everybody
should watch that TED Talk.

00:01:42.551 --> 00:01:45.040
Because If we could
hack the secret

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.120
to desire in the
long term, that could

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.466
solve a lot of our problems.

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:58.540
