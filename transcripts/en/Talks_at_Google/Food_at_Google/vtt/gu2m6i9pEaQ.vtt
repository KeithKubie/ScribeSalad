&gt;&gt;Catherine Eng: Hi everyone.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.050
Welcome.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.050
I'm Catherine Eng.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.740
I'm on the Authors at Google team, at Google
Los Angeles.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.519
I'm very, very excited to welcome chef David
Chang and Peter Meehan today at Google Los

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.519
Angeles.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.509
David Chang is the executive chef and owner
of the Momofuku Restaurant Group which spans

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:25.910
eight restaurants from New York City to Sydney
and soon Toronto.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.300
Since opening the Noodle Bar in 2004, Dave
has been honored with numerous awards from

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.350
Food and Wine Magazine, Bon Appetit, GQ Man
of the Year, and of course, three James Beard

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.300
awards, and two Michelin stars.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.270
Dave's first cookbook, Momofuku, was published
in 2009.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.809
And he launched Lucky Peach, a quarterly food
journal, last summer.

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.480
Peter Meehan is also here today.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.750
He writes about food.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.899
He wrote for the New York Times for four years
and has written for numerous food and travel

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.890
publications.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.750
Peter collaborated with Dave on Momofuku,
the cookbook and he and Dave launched Lucky

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.300
Peach last year.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.680
In conjunction with McSweeney's.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.050
Today's conversation will be moderated by
our own chef Michael Brown.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.140
And if you haven't already, make sure you
grab a copy of Lucky Peach and try one of

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.060
Momofuku Milk Bar's cookies that we're serving
today.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.320
And without further ado, I give you David
and Peter.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.320
[applause]

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.060
&gt;&gt;Dave: Thanks for havin'us.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.950
Thanks guys.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.920
Strange, I was telling Kat that we've been,
I think.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.870
I think I've been to every Google office in
North America.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.030
[laughter] And this is by far the most, you
have the beach right here.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.680
This is amazing.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.630
But we're really honored to be here and always
happy to share our stories.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.280
And there's so many things to talk about.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.530
In terms of what we do and Peter and I do.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.670
And one of the stories we'd like to share
with you, a couple years ago, when we started

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.840
to do Lucky Peach, it was actually supposed
to be an app.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.189
Still may be an app, but it was in purgatory
and Peter decided to make a magazine out of

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:22.319
the stuff that never made it to the, you know,
the final cut.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.550
So, this whole weird magazine sort of happened.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.209
&gt;&gt;Peter: Everyone thought it was a terrible
idea.

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.209
&gt;&gt;Dave: It was a terrible idea.

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.209
It still is a terrible idea.

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.650
&gt;&gt;Peter: This is true.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.040
&gt;&gt;Dave: Anyway, one of the things that people
always want us to talk about is our time in

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.040
Kyoto.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.060
In Japan in general.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:48.190
But our time in Kyoto, because it's a part
of Japan in the culinary world that not that

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.280
many people know about.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.170
Kyoto probably has the oldest and richest
culinary culture in the world.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.269
You know, I was fortunate enough four years
ago to be invited by the Chef Murata-san.

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.430
He is like this kingly figure in Japanese
cuisine.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.519
Scares the hell out of me.

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.890
Peter thinks he's a really nice guy.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.890
He is a nice guy.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.849
But he commands this presence.

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:23.680
Anyway, he invited myself, two chefs from
the UK, Claude Bosi, Sat Bains, that are actually

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.859
in the current issue of Lucky Peach.

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.819
And Mike Anthony, the chef at Gramercy Tavern.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.239
And Mauro Colagreco, a chef from Mirazur in
Menton, France.

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.159
On the border of France and Italy.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.959
In the region of Nice.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.719
Anyway, we got to cook at various restaurants
and that was such a honor.

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.510
Because Kyoto is extraordinarily insular.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.410
They're not necessarily xenophobic but they
don't wanna share their, historically they

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:02.069
haven't shared what they've learned over literally
thousands, fifteen hundred years of cooking.

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:10.159
And you get to work at these restaurants where
they do stuff that you have never seen before.

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.670
And we had access to it and were learning
this stuff.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.109
And we were the first foreigners to actually
see what was going on.

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.430
Working in a restaurant that is over 1,000
years old.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.530
I don't, it's crazy.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.220
If you're in a 300 year old restaurant, that's
considered young.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.140
To meet a chef, you know, Murata's like the
head of this whole group there.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.770
To meet a chef where he's a 15th generation
chef.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.100
His family's been cooking for over 1,000 years.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.380
And to meet a farmer that they work with who's
also a 15th generation farmer.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.660
His family's been farming for over 1,000 years.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.440
And you know, I didn't do my homework.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.190
But I can't imagine, maybe there's a handful
of farmers in the world that have that lineage.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.870
And it was quite fascinating.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.030
He's somebody that forgets more about farming
than we'll ever know about farming.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.890
And we're there in December, and it's snowing,
and had the best strawberry I ever had in

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:08.890
my life.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:09.890
I don't know how the hell he did it.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:10.890
But he just knew.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.610
And he knew, this farmer knew, how each strawberry
was gonna taste in the different parts of

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.150
his greenhouse.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.520
So there's this extraordinarily rich culinary
tradition and they allowed us in.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.640
And I told Pete, you know, if we get a chance,
let's go to Kyoto.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.490
And we got permission from Murata to film
at Kikunoi.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.490
And

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.240
&gt;&gt;Peter: Eat at Kikunoi.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.900
My main memory of Kikunoi was that Dave and
I are usually dressed like this.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.010
So I just rolled to Kikunoi kinda dressed
like this.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:51.500
And I didn't realize what a formal and beautiful
restaurant it was.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.160
And he wore this like, hand tailored suit
you'd get in a GQ photo shoot.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.830
And then Murata kinda

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.510
&gt;&gt;Dave: Laughed at you.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.510
&gt;&gt;Pete: Yeah.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.290
So that was my takeaway from dinner.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.130
&gt;&gt;Dave: But it's, there's so many interesting
things about Kyoto 'cause it's'a bit different.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.430
I'm sure some of you have spent time in Tokyo.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.360
Having lived there in Japan in various parts.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.370
But whenever I get to Kyoto, it's almost like
a break from the insanity that is Tokyo.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.420
And actually I've been to your Tokyo offices
[laughs] in Google.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.040
But it's crazy.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.240
Because the chefs there are like alpha males
in this society.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.330
It's very weird.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.970
I've never been to a culture where being a
cook is like the highest honor.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:43.680
Because it's just been passed down and it's
something that's so hard for any of us or

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.870
a cook for us, to understand and comprehend
that cooking has remained this high craft

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.890
form.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.880
And you know, it's not bankers.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.540
It's not people who work at Google who are
really like the superstars of Kyoto.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.380
It's very strange to see it as chefs.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:06.180
And you know, eating a meal there, at Kikunoi.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.350
Has anyone been to Kyoto and been to Kikunoi?

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.810
OK.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.280
So.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.771
It's pretty intense and one of the cool things
that they do at Kikunoi is that they have

00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:17.940
a fish shop.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:24.550
They purchase fish, and on the compound of
Murata's compound at Kikunoi where all the

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.740
cooks live, 27 cooks.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.941
His mother and his two daughters, all live
in the compound.

00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:37.410
And part of the compound they have a, what
looks like a very nice aquarium but it is

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.180
almost, it's really not good to be a fish.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.500
It's a process called "ikejime."

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.300
We talk about it a little bit in the last,

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.300
&gt;&gt;Pete: Issue Two.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.740
&gt;&gt;Dave: Issue Two of Lucky Peach.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.060
And there we question.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:54.530
And this is the first time where I started
to question food and the status quo of food.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.140
'Cause you just assume that fish is fresh.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.080
When you get it at the supermarket or.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.280
&gt;&gt;Pete: And fresh is best.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.610
&gt;&gt;Dave: And fresh fish is best.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.750
You assume that catching a fish right out
of the water, it's going to be the best fish.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.110
You hear all the time, like, I want the freshest
fish.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.380
Or you're at a sushi restaurant and you hear
some yahoo being like, "This fish isn't fresh

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.380
enough."

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.610
Like, to, you don't even think about what
the concept of "fresh" is.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.390
It's been handed down to you.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:27.400
Even if your innate instinct is to like, shy
away from it because it may smell bad or something.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.480
Maybe that is fresh.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.820
"Fresh" is certainly not, it's very relative.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:37.579
But at the same time it's pretty objective
if you think about how the Japanese view what

00:08:37.579 --> 00:08:38.589
"fresh" is.

00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:42.080
And this is probably the main thing that I
learned.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.480
One of the major things that I've learned
in Kyoto was questioning what is "fresh".

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.270
Because there, they have these fish in the
tanks.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:55.550
Either, and they're gonna perform ikejime
is the severing of the brain cortex and all

00:08:55.550 --> 00:09:02.509
the nervous system from the fish and basically
long story cut short, it slows and controls

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:04.800
the rigor mortis process.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.319
So, Japanese chef, in Kyoto, where you serve
it sashimi or something.

00:09:10.319 --> 00:09:11.949
Mostly as sashimi.

00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:16.550
You can control the flavor and the texture
of the fish.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.890
And there's a optimal time.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:19.890
And it's not usually

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.279
&gt;&gt;Pete: Right out of the water.

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:23.279
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yeah.

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.279
Not out of the water.

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:28.899
If you eat, most of the time if you eat sushi,
or crudo in a restaurant.

00:09:28.899 --> 00:09:31.730
Its'at least four or five days old.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.620
Sometimes it can go all the way to two weeks.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.899
But you wanna age the fish.

00:09:35.899 --> 00:09:40.410
And there's a moment where that fish is going
to be at its peak.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:46.690
And you can, using different culinary techniques,
you can either preserve that fish to ensure

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.769
that sweet spot.

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:54.830
Or you know, basically it threw my entire
notion of what "fresh" is.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:59.129
I always knew that if you have to ask the
question "What is a fresh fish?"

00:09:59.129 --> 00:10:00.129
It's not fresh.

00:10:00.129 --> 00:10:05.610
&gt;&gt;Pete: But the thing is, that fresh isn't
actually a metric for deliciousness.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:09.170
And that's what you learned at, with Murata-san
at Kikunoi.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.100
Where you learned about ikejime where you
like, spike the fish in the brain and then

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.550
you drive a wire through its spine.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.430
&gt;&gt;Dave: And it seems really gruesome.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:21.060
But it's actually an extraordinarily humane
way to kill a fish.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.222
&gt;&gt;Pete: That versus, you know, cutting open
the gills and letting it bleed out on ice

00:10:24.222 --> 00:10:25.222
and asphyxiate.

00:10:25.222 --> 00:10:27.339
So it's a faster way of death.

00:10:27.339 --> 00:10:32.100
But it short-circuits the natural, you know,
the more common, the rigor mortis process

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.510
that fish go through here.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:38.930
So it's a way of controlling the texture of
the fish which is really important in a raw

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:43.370
fish preparation . Because otherwise, you
know, you have no other way of manipulating

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.370
it.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:52.010
And then the other thing we saw when we were
in Tokyo at a Sawada, he ages, this is this

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.240
insane sushi restaurant where we had this
brilliant meal.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.730
But he ages his tuna ten days in the refrigerator.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.050
And it was the most amazing tuna we'd ever
had.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:07.670
And he doesn't like modern refrigerators 'cause
they have fans in them.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.500
So he has like a huge block of ice.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.790
&gt;&gt;Dave: it's as old school as you get.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:11.790
&gt;&gt;Pete: It's a big, yeah.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.790
You know, 'cause

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.790
&gt;&gt;Dave: If he could have

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:14.790
&gt;&gt;Pete: That would dry out his fish.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:20.089
&gt;&gt;Dave: If he could have no electricity in
his restaurant, he would do that.

00:11:20.089 --> 00:11:22.910
Behind his sushi line, which was just him
and his wife, six seats.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:28.010
It's just charcoal and block ice refrigeration.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:34.149
And I think it's the, for me, it's my favorite
sushi restaurant in the world.

00:11:34.149 --> 00:11:36.050
And that's a whole 'nother issue.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.050
Topic.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:41.570
But a lot of people question his rice, 'cause
he doesn't use aged rice.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.610
He uses fresh rice.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:48.800
But Sushi Sawada, if you ever get to Tokyo,
please try to make a reservation 'cause it's

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.410
just fantastic.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:57.540
But overall, Pete and I get to, we're in this
really amazing situation.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.880
Very fortunate to travel all over the place.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.662
To come to places like Google or to go to
places like Japan.

00:12:03.662 --> 00:12:07.449
And to get access to places where most people
wouldn't get access.

00:12:07.449 --> 00:12:08.529
You know.

00:12:08.529 --> 00:12:11.459
We're very fortunate in that regard.

00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:18.759
Or we get to go to Copenhagen and get to cook
with Rene Redzepi all day long at Noma. which

00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:23.199
is for the third year in a row won the best
restaurant of the year and number one restaurant

00:12:23.199 --> 00:12:26.220
in the world from Restaurant Magazine.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:32.470
So it's part of it is just for us to have
fun and to document this process.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.499
And then sharing this information with people
that might be interested.

00:12:35.499 --> 00:12:38.300
Which is what Lucky Peach was and continues
to be.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.649
You know, Pete just wrapped up the latest
issue called America.

00:12:42.649 --> 00:12:44.220
We did an issue on American food.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:50.670
And somehow we continue to get the ability
to do whatever the hell we want.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.959
I mean, Pete you can talk about the latest
issue.

00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:58.420
&gt;&gt;Pete: Yeah, we, Daniel Patterson from Coi
in San Francisco suggested the theme.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.529
Like American cuisine, whatever that is.

00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:07.069
So we typically we agree on a theme and then
we get in a fight about how to approach it

00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:09.649
and then take that out in a couple different
ways.

00:13:09.649 --> 00:13:13.990
But this new one, I don't know, we've gotten
really lucky with contributors.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:19.040
David Simon who did Treme and The Wire, contributed
an essay.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.459
Wrote about Cambodian donut shops in California.

00:13:21.459 --> 00:13:25.639
&gt;&gt;Dave: And really the question is, what is
American food?

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:31.040
I mean, so, we took a weird perspective on
it.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.050
I, we did a lot of different takes on it but
one of them was based on the movie "Diner."

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.569
Barry Levinson directed it in 1984.

00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:42.370
And I think it's Steve Gutenberg's finest
hour.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:50.529
And it's, you know, it's sort of a look into
Americana in the 1950's and we did an entire

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:53.160
issue out of it, basically.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.980
So we get to have fun and creatively we get
to do whatever we want in that regard.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.980
But part of it was, we get to explore questions.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.339
I think I recently described, or was telling
somebody about Lucky Peach.

00:14:04.339 --> 00:14:07.029
It's a "culinary investigation of the mundane."

00:14:07.029 --> 00:14:15.679
Because I think the best ideas, culinary ideas
or non-culinary ideas, happen to be the ones

00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:18.350
that are staring you right in the face.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:23.119
People, I'm always trying to find this reaction
from somebody that reads something or tastes

00:14:23.119 --> 00:14:24.220
something and they, I want them to go like
this.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.449
They're like "Why didn't I think of that?

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.589
That's so simple!

00:14:27.589 --> 00:14:30.410
Why didn't I do that?"

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:35.569
That's what we're sort of after, that sort
of illusive, very simple but deceivingly complex

00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:37.740
idea or food.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:45.240
And you know, trying to, Peter does an amazing
job in capturing that, I think.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:52.709
And we try to do it on the food end and going
back to the American theme, we were trying

00:14:52.709 --> 00:14:56.339
to figure out what the hell American food
is.

00:14:56.339 --> 00:15:00.160
So, it's just, it's neither here nor there.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.119
I think that people don't even know how to
describe it.

00:15:03.119 --> 00:15:09.540
So I think it's, there's this generation of
chefs, are really trying to figure out what

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.250
California food, not Californian food, but
what American food is.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.240
Like California has a distinct cuisine.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.819
The southern, the south of America, southern
states in America have a distinct cuisine.

00:15:18.819 --> 00:15:20.850
Even New England has a distinct cuisine.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.149
But nobody wants to cook it.

00:15:22.149 --> 00:15:26.319
Nobody wants to delve into it and figure out
what the history is behind it.

00:15:26.319 --> 00:15:29.990
And how do we represent what we do in America?

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.990
And find our own voice.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:36.850
And I, it's a little bit troublesome when
we imitate so much of what's going on outside

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.440
of America and try to bring it back to America.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.779
And I think that we have enough talent, we
have enough resources, and we have enough

00:15:43.779 --> 00:15:52.579
savvy consumers like yourselves that come
to our restaurants to, you know, further the

00:15:52.579 --> 00:15:54.260
American culinary talent.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.050
Like, American cuisine is this melting pot.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.290
And we're not reflecting that enough.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.839
So, it's our challenge.

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:06.589
It's our struggle to sort of push that a little
bit further and to find out what that is.

00:16:06.589 --> 00:16:09.720
So, I mean, you can't really decide what it
is.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:15.920
I mean, we recently opened a restaurant in
Sydney and you know, I posed a question to

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.350
the journalists, like "What is Sydney cuisine?"

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.970
And they're like "It's everything."

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.970
And I was like, "Well."

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:25.040
'Cause they were trying to pigeonhole us into
what kind of food we were gonna cook.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.480
And I said, "Instead of trying to figure out
what kind of food we're going to cook and

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.560
categorizing it so it can be in some Zaga
guide or some blog.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.110
Like this is Asian food, this is French food.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:39.360
I think the most important thing that we need
to be concerned about is, how delicious is

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.269
it?

00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:44.819
Who cares what kind of food it is, as long
as it's really tasty?

00:16:44.819 --> 00:16:48.529
Does it bring joy to you when you leave the
restaurant and you think about it?

00:16:48.529 --> 00:16:51.059
That to me is the most important thing."

00:16:51.059 --> 00:16:53.339
And I think that's what we need to find in
America.

00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:58.029
Is like, what is delicious in America and
how do we support that and how do we further

00:16:58.029 --> 00:16:59.029
that.

00:16:59.029 --> 00:17:00.029
So.

00:17:00.029 --> 00:17:03.149
&gt;&gt;Pete: I'm gonna defer to him on questions.

00:17:03.149 --> 00:17:07.179
&gt;&gt;Michael: Well, first of all, I mean, this
is an amazing opportunity to have both of

00:17:07.179 --> 00:17:08.179
you here.

00:17:08.179 --> 00:17:11.449
And talking about Lucky Peach, I've started
reading Lucky Peach.

00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:16.199
And the first thought I got was just how candid
the writing was.

00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:19.660
You could really speak to chefs.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:26.189
You know, it was a great voice, when you're
talking about the PTSD part about our, our,

00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:28.240
consistently stressful lives.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.460
And what it takes to really get into making
it or not in this industry.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:41.110
So, I think I could say on behalf of a lot
of chefs, "Thank you for this publication."

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:47.940
First question we have is, Lucky Peach envelopes
a lot of great writing, a lot of art, a lot

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.529
of graphics.

00:17:49.529 --> 00:17:50.650
What was the inspiration for that?

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:58.070
And did you find that it's hard to maintain
a color, full color publication when there's

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.490
truly not a lot of that still happening now?

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:01.880
&gt;&gt;Pete: Yeah.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:08.760
We were making, we were shooting video to
put into an app, and that is in some sort

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.520
of limbo sarcophagus right now.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.399
But I like buying records and books and physical
media.

00:18:16.399 --> 00:18:20.380
So, and we have friends at McSweeney's who
we had wanted to work with for years, and

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.740
when they heard about it, we cooked up this
idea for a magazine.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.950
And it just worked somehow.

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:26.950
And it continued.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.419
&gt;&gt;Dave: We really wanted to do new media.

00:18:29.419 --> 00:18:31.480
&gt;&gt;Pete: You really wanted to do new media.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.549
I wanted to do dead media.

00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:34.549
[inaudible]
[laughter]

00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:35.549
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yeah.

00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:37.200
It's funny how that works out.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:42.690
We literally are doing the oldest, most deadest
form of media possible.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.050
&gt;&gt;Pete: Yeah.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:45.050
Yeah.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:49.039
&gt;&gt;Michael: The term "fusion cuisine" went
through a "dirty word" phrase with foodies

00:18:49.039 --> 00:18:55.120
and now it's in vogue again thanks to the
great chefs like you and Roy Choi and Sang

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.120
Yoon.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.970
What do you make of this change?

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:03.049
How come everybody still who's the leaders
in this fusion, this new fusion is Korean.

00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:05.450
How does that work out.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:09.700
&gt;&gt;Dave: I don't know.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:14.200
You know it's great to see in LA, like, people
always come back to New York and are like

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.230
"Man, their Asian food was so fucking awesome."

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.149
And it is.

00:19:19.149 --> 00:19:21.200
You can eat so well here.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.050
Even if you just go to Chinatown or Korea
Town.

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:29.529
Or, I think, I don't know why the Vietnamese
or Southeast Asian food, there's no "Thai

00:19:29.529 --> 00:19:31.179
Town" or "Vietnamese Town" here.

00:19:31.179 --> 00:19:32.179
[audience murmurs]

00:19:32.179 --> 00:19:33.179
Is there?

00:19:33.179 --> 00:19:34.179
&gt;&gt;Pete: Yeah, very small.

00:19:34.179 --> 00:19:37.140
&gt;&gt;Dave: [inaudible] I know there's an amazing
one out in Orange County.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.149
Like past Alto there.

00:19:38.149 --> 00:19:39.149
But

00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:40.789
&gt;&gt;female audience member: There's all kinds
of "towns" around here.

00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:41.789
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yeah.

00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:45.910
So you guys have the ethnic food down in spades.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:53.260
And I just think that it's just reached a
point where a lot of cooks want to just do

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.909
what they wanna do.

00:19:54.909 --> 00:19:59.559
And not necessarily for the customer, but
what's delicious and what's interesting to

00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:01.130
them.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.290
You see that with Roy.

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.260
You see that obviously with Sang.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:09.360
You see that in California with the Mission
Street Chinese guys.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.900
And I think the more we have of that, the
more it, it's not necessarily fusion.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:20.600
It certainly is "fusion" in, I mean, I just
hate the concept of people trying to categorize

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:25.520
something that, you know, isn't.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:32.610
Basically, Roy, if you take one of anybody
that's cooking, whatever type of food, using

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.860
some type of Asian ingredients.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.450
If you take a chef from New York that's French.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:42.610
You know, Jean-Georges is using more Asian
ingredients than say, Roy is.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:47.669
But because Roy is Korean, he's labeled as
this Korean-American chef that's doing this

00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:49.210
fusion cuisine.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.510
But nobody's every gonna ever say anything
against Jean-Georges who, I admire.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.860
I'm not talking crap about Jean-Georges.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:59.580
I'm talking about how he's perceived and how
he's marketed to the public.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:05.860
He's this great French chef that has this
repertoire of Asian ingredients in his arsenal.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.450
He's cooking French food with an Asian twist.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.480
And one sounds better than the other.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:18.440
And one seems like this weird hodge-podge,
mutant food.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.330
But the reality, it's the same thing.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.330
Right?

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.000
People are using ingredients from different
cultures.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.399
One's accepted.

00:21:25.399 --> 00:21:27.309
And one is a "fledgling concept."

00:21:27.309 --> 00:21:33.120
So I’m all for change, as long as it sort
of furthers, again, trying to make something

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.320
better.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:40.640
And I think it again, just the word "fusion"
and the word of trying to categorize stuff,

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.250
ultimately fails.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:43.250
So.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:48.550
&gt;&gt;Michael: in Lucky Peach Number Two, you
allude to the "sweet spot."

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.010
Also known as when someone's at their best
moment.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.470
Do you still worry about that?

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.990
Is that still part of your daily thought process?

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.649
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yeah.

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:57.649
Yeah.

00:21:57.649 --> 00:22:00.650
[chuckles] You know, I like sports a lot.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:07.590
And when, like the Lakers are on, and they're
like "Oh, Kobe Bryant is turning 34, this

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:08.650
is his last year as a Laker.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:10.789
The Lakers didn't make it to the finals.

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:12.870
He's over, it's done."

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.590
And I'm like "Fuck man."

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:15.880
[laughs] You know?

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:26.460
But I don't think that people like to embrace
the concept of not death, per se, but just

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.220
slow descent to where they're not gonna be
as good as they once were.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:36.030
And I tend to be, I tend to focus on that
quite a bit.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:42.630
And I think it's liberating in a way because
if you know that everything has its peak and

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:43.670
everything.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.380
Everything begins and everything dies.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.700
And somewhere along the way you're going to
be better at something than you were in the

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.700
past.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:54.850
And you know, I think a lot of people, particularly
chefs, never really think about it.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.620
Chefs, we're the most stubborn.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.299
We're just so fucking stubborn it's ridiculous.

00:23:00.299 --> 00:23:02.650
And we think we're going to get better.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.100
We're just always going to get better.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.220
And I see that in athletes.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.090
You know, it's like the quarterback Bret Favre.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:14.940
Who never wants to retire 'cause he thinks
he's as good as he was when he was 28 years

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:15.940
old.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:16.940
It's not the case.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.010
And no matter what.

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:23.340
Even if you're in the humanities, you're going
to not be as good as a judge when you were

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.529
when you were like 50 years old.

00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:26.039
When you're 80 years old, you might not--.

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:31.750
I mean it's just, accepting that fact I think
makes you smarter.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:35.559
Makes you more efficient in terms of how you
think and how you approach and how you're

00:23:35.559 --> 00:23:36.559
creative.

00:23:36.559 --> 00:23:43.960
And maybe you may not be as creative, or you
may not endeavor to do as many things as you

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.070
did when you were younger.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.809
But you're a smarter player.

00:23:46.809 --> 00:23:48.270
You're a smarter chef.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:51.049
And you may be a better leader.

00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:52.450
So instead of being, literally

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:57.850
&gt;&gt;Pete: I really think the relativity of that,
how you can change as you mature is the reason

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.730
I don't agree with you that there is a sweet
spot in life.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.170
&gt;&gt;Dave: See, this is where we, uh.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:04.170
&gt;&gt;Pete: we just

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:05.170
[laughter]

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:06.850
&gt;&gt;Dave: I mean, it all started with.

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:10.179
&gt;&gt;Pete: You thought ramen was a bad idea for
an issue.

00:24:10.179 --> 00:24:11.630
&gt;&gt;Dave: But I'm wrong all the time.

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:13.250
I admit it.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.049
You never do.

00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:17.460
&gt;&gt;Pete: As am I.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.460
[laughs]

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:23.850
&gt;&gt;Dave: Like, there's a theory that there
will never be another 400 baseball hitter

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:25.539
ever again.

00:24:25.539 --> 00:24:26.809
And I don't think there ever will.

00:24:26.809 --> 00:24:29.909
But Peter maintains this notion that it's
going to happen.

00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:31.600
I think that it's never going to happen.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:38.289
Not that there isn't the talent to do so,
it's just, never going to happen.

00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:45.730
And, you know, I just, I would rather focus
on what we can do now rather than what is,

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:51.120
you know, what is conceivably possible, and,
we're not gonna get into the baseball thing

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.120
today right now.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.120
[laughter]

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.880
&gt;&gt;Michael: I mean, I really love that you
guys disagree.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.880
You know?

00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:01.840
'cause it really comes out in the magazine
and it really brings up you know, discussion

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.200
and argument.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.049
And you know, I love that dynamic about Lucky
Peach and you guys.

00:25:08.049 --> 00:25:09.570
Going back to the ramen talk.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:14.490
You know, ramen noodles originated from China
and there are types of noodles.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.320
Soups and dishes in Asian culture.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.320
Different.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:22.250
But none seem to have captured the American
imagination and appetites as well as ramen

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.440
except maybe pho.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.580
Why do you think that is?

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.830
What is it about ramen that really, is, romantic.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:34.500
&gt;&gt;Pete: I mean, I think the impetus to do
an issue on ramen is 'cause there is a great

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.700
story.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.120
And it's relatively recent.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.549
Like the last hundred years.

00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:42.820
Or when ramen was invented as a dish and became
prominent.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:48.870
And Momofuku Ando, the man who invented instant
noodles has like a super compelling story.

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.620
So there was just a lot of stories behind
it to tell.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.059
Which is the reason we did the issue.

00:25:54.059 --> 00:25:55.890
But why ramen is so popular?

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:56.940
I don't know 'cause it's cheap?

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.509
And you can eat it in college?

00:25:58.509 --> 00:26:00.140
And you know what it is?

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:05.559
And I think there's a gateway drug aspect
and you know what ramen is.

00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:12.389
And now you can go to a ramen shop and get
a real bowl of ramen instead of just a brick.

00:26:12.389 --> 00:26:13.389
And.

00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:14.389
&gt;&gt;Michael: There's also a very social atmosphere
as well.

00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:17.409
You can share and talk about it and make noises
eating it.

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:18.409
&gt;&gt;Dave: That's the thing in America.

00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:21.840
People in America don't know how to eat noodles.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.520
&gt;&gt;Pete: No, I learned that in Tokyo with Dave.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:30.850
Because I ate professionally for a brief time
in my life so I thought I was good at eating

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:31.850
noodles.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:32.850
&gt;&gt;Dave: it's embarrassing to watch Peter eat
noodles.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:33.850
&gt;&gt;Pete: And, um.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:34.850
&gt;&gt;Dave: I'm surprised he knows how to used
chopsticks.

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:36.789
&gt;&gt;Pete: And yeah, we went to ramen shops.

00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:41.169
And I just didn't realize you're supposed
to, like, huff the noodles

00:26:41.169 --> 00:26:42.169
&gt;&gt;Dave: You're not supposed to talk

00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:43.169
&gt;&gt;Pete: while they're like, really hot.

00:26:43.169 --> 00:26:45.200
And I was taking my time.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.030
And, like, it was just too shameful.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:52.799
I was getting like, I was like, little 40-pound
Japanese women were just crushing these bowls

00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:53.799
of ramen.

00:26:53.799 --> 00:26:56.320
I was like "It's so hot, I just need another
minute."

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.759
[laughter] There's a, we don't actually know
how to eat ramen for as much as we like it,

00:26:59.759 --> 00:27:00.759
it turns out.

00:27:00.759 --> 00:27:03.149
&gt;&gt;Dave: And I would slowly move my seat further
away from Peter.

00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:04.149
[Peter laughs]

00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:07.370
&gt;&gt;Dave: I'm like "I don't know who this guy
is."

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.889
But yeah, you have to eat it smoking, boiling,
hot.

00:27:10.889 --> 00:27:16.159
Or the noodles are gonna overcook and I, that's
just never gonna change.

00:27:16.159 --> 00:27:21.169
Like, in the first issue we talk about this
I call him the M and M of ramen.

00:27:21.169 --> 00:27:23.070
Ivan Orkin.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:31.330
And this, this New York guy serving basic
Jewish comfort food in the form of ramen to

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:32.710
Japanese people.

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:36.029
It's extraordinarily good ramen and he's trying
to open up something in America.

00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:39.000
And you know we're talking about how it's
gonna work.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.210
And I say, "Dude, your ramen.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:46.399
You're gonna have to change your noodles because
Americans are not going to eat it as they

00:27:46.399 --> 00:27:47.399
should.

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:49.030
And they're gonna complain that the noodles
are soggy.

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:53.840
Because by the time they get to the temperature
that they wanna eat it at, it's gonna be overcooked."

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.440
So he's like "What should I do?"

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.019
I was like "I don't have an answer."

00:28:00.019 --> 00:28:01.019
So, yeah.

00:28:01.019 --> 00:28:02.019
&gt;&gt;Pete: Yeah.

00:28:02.019 --> 00:28:04.159
&gt;&gt;Dave: It's one of those frustrating things.

00:28:04.159 --> 00:28:05.159
Little things.

00:28:05.159 --> 00:28:10.990
&gt;&gt;Michael: What do you guys think is the most
punk rock thing happening now in food?

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:19.260
&gt;&gt;Dave: Um, for me I think it's'this guy Alex
Stupak in New York.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:24.820
[coughs] He was a pastry chef at Alinea when
it opened up.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:29.040
Extraordinarily influential at that restaurant
and the success it had.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.889
And he left to become the pastry chef at wd-50.

00:28:32.889 --> 00:28:39.620
Wylie Dufresne's important, such an important
restaurant in New York.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:46.100
And he was at the vanguard of not just being
one of the best chefs, but pastry chefs.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:51.029
But one of the few people in the world that
actually created new techniques.

00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:56.120
And just in general I think in any field there's
few people that actually create something

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.120
new.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.120
Alright?

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:03.289
And he was one that created new techniques
that other chefs would use.

00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:05.419
And he's a good friend of ours.

00:29:05.419 --> 00:29:09.360
And he was always talking about "I just wanna
cook Mexican food.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.470
I think it's fascinating."

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:16.470
I think because of the internet or whatever
we sort of, I hate using the word "postmodern."

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:27.050
But the cooking world reached this weird state
of, like, what he was doing wasn't "punk rock"

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:28.050
anymore.

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:34.940
Like creating new techniques and sort of being
at the vanguard, was for him, being rebellious.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:40.590
Breaking down rules and creating his own rules
and when he saw that there were legions of

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:45.309
cooks copying him, and following his rules,
he just thought it was over.

00:29:45.309 --> 00:29:48.590
And in a way he was completely correct.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:54.730
And I thought the coolest thing he could've
ever done was tell everybody "I'm gonna quit

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:58.350
cooking modern cuisine and I'm gonna make
Mexican food."

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:00.990
And people thought he was out of his mind.

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:06.389
He opened up a restaurant called Empellón,
in the West Village and that slowly turned

00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:07.740
into Taqueria.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.700
And he recently opened his place called Empellón
Cocina.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.340
And it's his take on Mexican food.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.649
It's more dish-heavy.

00:30:16.649 --> 00:30:18.590
And I think it's just fantastic.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:23.090
It's delicious 'cause Mexican food, we just
don't have a good representation of it in

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.309
New York.

00:30:24.309 --> 00:30:32.580
And he's doing extraordinarily good things
and it, knowing Alex, , it suits him.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:38.610
I don't know of anyone that's done anything
as awesome as that.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:42.190
Sort of like, just turning his back on everything
he knew and relearning.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.059
I think that takes a lot of balls.

00:30:44.059 --> 00:30:45.059
So.

00:30:45.059 --> 00:30:49.220
&gt;&gt;Pete: I think Brooks Headley who's the pastry
chef at Del Posto.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.850
He just cut a seven-inch record with one of
the dudes from No Age.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.440
And it's actually punk rock.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.440
&gt;&gt;Dave: But he was

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.440
&gt;&gt;Pete: Um.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.680
&gt;&gt;Dave: But he is a punk rock.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:03.710
He was, before he became a pastry chef, he
was in like, hard core punk bands.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:04.710
So.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:05.710
&gt;&gt;Pete: Yeah.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:06.710
&gt;&gt;Dave: that doesn't count.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:07.710
&gt;&gt;Pete: I don't know.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:08.710
&gt;&gt;Dave: I mean he really is a rock star.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:09.710
[laughing]

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:10.710
&gt;&gt;Pete: It was a concise answer.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:11.710
[laughing]

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:12.710
&gt;&gt;Michael: [laughing] That's awesome.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:18.159
In the first issue you asked Uneo-san about
his feelings about tradition and authenticity.

00:31:18.159 --> 00:31:19.460
What are your feelings about that?

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.720
&gt;&gt;Dave: Who do we make fun of?

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.950
&gt;&gt;Pete: No, no, no, we asked Uneo-san at Bar
Five.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:25.950
&gt;&gt;Dave: Oh.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:31.649
&gt;&gt;Pete: Um, I mean I think, authenticity is
one of those traps that people get caught

00:31:31.649 --> 00:31:34.100
up in when they talk about food.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:39.850
Specifically like ethnic or you know, ethnic
food in America.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:41.840
It'll always be like "Oh, that place isn't
authentic."

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.870
Or "Oh it's all Chinese people there and it's
really authentic."

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:45.870
And it's not.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:51.191
It's this false measurement instead of like,
appreciating the deliciousness of the food

00:31:51.191 --> 00:31:52.929
and judging the restaurant on its own merits.

00:31:52.929 --> 00:31:58.039
And I think that what Dave was saying about
categorizing cuisine.

00:31:58.039 --> 00:32:03.289
Being less useful that responding to the restaurant
or the food specifically that's being served.

00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:06.799
But tradition is, you know, tradition is tradition
and that exists.

00:32:06.799 --> 00:32:12.440
Authenticity, I think, is sometimes a false
measurement to judge food by.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:18.269
Or, you know, it's not, it's used more like
a cudgel than it is like you know a precision

00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:19.269
measurement.

00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:21.669
&gt;&gt;Dave: I think it's extraordinarily stupid.

00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:22.669
[laughter]

00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:24.519
&gt;&gt;Pete: That was concise answer.

00:32:24.519 --> 00:32:25.999
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yeah, well no.

00:32:25.999 --> 00:32:29.610
I mean, it's like we're at this restaurant
getting drinks last night.

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:31.659
And it was "The Best Hamburger Ever!"

00:32:31.659 --> 00:32:34.029
That's the name of their hamburger.

00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:37.570
And I was like, "This is the dumbest name
I've ever heard."

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:45.350
And just, try, this pursuit of authenticity
again overshadows the pursuit of delicious.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.350
And you know what?

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:48.870
You have restaurants that import people from
Italy.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:50.659
Entire fucking towns.

00:32:50.659 --> 00:32:52.590
&gt;&gt;Pete: To make pasta.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:59.330
&gt;&gt;Dave: And you know what, they import the
flour.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.330
You know, pasta, there's three ingredients.

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:05.799
Flour, water, eggs.

00:33:05.799 --> 00:33:09.080
The water is extraordinarily important.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:14.909
It is full of microbes, it's full of things
that, the alkaline content could be different.

00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:20.200
These are all things that can dramatically
change the taste of pasta.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.249
The structure of pasta.

00:33:22.249 --> 00:33:27.309
And people are so caught up in pursuing the
marketing aspect of authenticity.

00:33:27.309 --> 00:33:30.470
Like "We serve authentic Italian food."

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:31.470
No, you're not.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:33.070
You're not in Italy.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:36.320
Shut the fuck up.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.320
[laughter]

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.820
Just think of it vice versa, right?

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:41.629
You've probably been abroad.

00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:47.429
Like you go to, let's say, you're in Shanghai.

00:33:47.429 --> 00:33:48.460
Right?

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:53.649
And you see some ex-pat serving authentic
New York style pizza.

00:33:53.649 --> 00:33:55.470
And your reaction is gonna be what?

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:56.470
No.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.429
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

00:33:58.429 --> 00:34:01.710
There's like, you know, soy sauce on the pizza.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.220
What the fuck are you talkin'about?

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.860
So that's the thing.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:10.159
I think it's easier to understand authenticity
when you take a ex-pat's point of view.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:15.230
It's like, I always use the, 'cause I did
meet a German guy from Munich that wanted

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.310
to make American barbecue.

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:18.530
He's like "I'm gonna make it authentic.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:21.159
It's gonna be just like Memphis style barbecue."

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.730
And I was like "No it's not gonna be Memphis
style barbecue.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:29.349
'cause you're number one not using the beef
that's coming from, any of the meat that's

00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:30.760
coming from America.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.159
You're not using any of the wood from America.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:39.069
You're not even using any of the workers,
the hands, the invisible stuff.

00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:44.200
All the things that make something special,
that tastes the way it does at a unique area.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:48.031
So don't tell anybody you're serving authentic
American barbecue."

00:34:48.031 --> 00:34:49.109
&gt;&gt;Pete: And it even goes to how we eat.

00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:52.419
It's like the difference between the way we
eat ramen here and the way we eat ramen in

00:34:52.419 --> 00:34:53.419
Japan.

00:34:53.419 --> 00:34:56.099
If you're not eating it the same way, if you
don't have the same cultural association with

00:34:56.099 --> 00:34:58.420
how you relate to that food.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:01.580
That inhibits the potential for it to be authentically
authentic.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:07.359
I mean, we both think that authenticity is
kind of like a red herring.

00:35:07.359 --> 00:35:08.359
But.

00:35:08.359 --> 00:35:09.359
&gt;&gt;Dave: True.

00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:11.750
&gt;&gt;Pete: it should be about the deliciousness
of the food.

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.540
Not about the story that goes on with it.

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:19.829
&gt;&gt;Dave: I think it's more important instead
of getting the authenticity down is understanding

00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:23.440
what the flavors are of a particular region.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.150
And paying respect to that.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:27.690
And that again, using Alex Stupak as an example.

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:31.920
Here we are in New York and he's cooking food
from various regions of Mexico.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:38.720
Somebody that has a really encyclopedic knowledge
of flavor profiles of Mexico, but we don't

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.300
have the same ingredients.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:44.770
So he's gonna try to mimic but not copy those
flavors.

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:46.970
And in a way it's not Mexican anymore.

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:48.140
It's New York.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.829
And I think that's really important.

00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:51.240
[coughing in background]

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:55.530
&gt;&gt;Michael: I think one question that probably
everyone in this room has is, why is there

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.609
not a Momofuku in LA yet?

00:35:57.609 --> 00:35:59.000
&gt;&gt;Dave: Wow.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.830
Almost happened like four or five times.

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:03.380
Different people.

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.309
It's a sore subject for Peter.

00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:08.760
'Cause it almost opened up in his favorite
hotel.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.790
Don't say it, 'cause I'll get in trouble.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:12.790
&gt;&gt;Peter: OK.

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:15.220
I just coulda stayed there for like, free.

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.500
It would have been crazy.

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.500
&gt;&gt;Dave: Ahhh.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.500
[laughter]

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.010
&gt;&gt;Peter: It's really all about me, our relationship.

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:23.180
&gt;&gt;Dave: I think it'd be tough to open up in
LA.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.400
It's not that I don't like to.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.600
I just think it's a fast food culture.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.140
People have to drive.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.300
People don't drink.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:35.450
There's like few restaurants that do multiple
turns.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:41.250
And it's hard enough, and I don't know.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:46.990
Like, maybe we'll do something but, I knew
it was a bad idea to sort of think about opening

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:53.960
a restaurant in LA just because it would break
up my layover to Australia.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.990
And that's not a good enough reason to open
up a restaurant.

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:58.380
In fact, it's a really, really bad reason.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.520
So as much as I'd like to.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:01.770
'Cause the produce here is so great.

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:07.440
And I've always maintained that the best restaurants
in the world, at least in America should easily

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.850
come from southern California.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:11.800
I mean, obviously San Francisco.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:16.790
Just, California just produces amazing things.

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:18.410
So.

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:19.410
That is the draw.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:21.569
Because the product you get here.

00:37:21.569 --> 00:37:22.720
You have tomatoes already.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.000
The salads.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.829
When we got here the first thing we wanted
was "Let's eat salad.

00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:27.970
It's so good."

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:29.839
&gt;&gt;Pete: We have like apples and cabbage.

00:37:29.839 --> 00:37:30.839
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yeah.

00:37:30.839 --> 00:37:31.839
We.

00:37:31.839 --> 00:37:32.920
&gt;&gt;Pete: Most of the.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.630
&gt;&gt;Dave: Can't grow apples like we do.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:39.010
But everything else is pretty amazing, is
really amazing.

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.610
So, that's the temptation to open up a restaurant.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:44.820
Because the produce here is so amazing.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:49.750
And, but, you know, I'm never gonna say never.

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:51.300
But it's most likely never going to happen.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.700
&gt;&gt;Michael: We'll just have to make those trips.

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:59.090
Harold McGee wrote in one of the Lucky Peach
issues that mold actually enhances some of

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:01.240
the flavor of produce.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.250
Speaking of produce.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:06.420
And Dave and Pete are doing a lecture tonight
at UCLA.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:10.349
The Science and Food series about the role
of microbes in our food.

00:38:10.349 --> 00:38:15.210
Can we get a little preview of what you will
be talking about tonight.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:19.339
&gt;&gt;Dave: Mold equals flavor.

00:38:19.339 --> 00:38:20.349
Microbes equal flavor.

00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:22.300
You don't see it but it does.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:28.119
And so much of what we're doing right now
at our test kitchen is developing misos and

00:38:28.119 --> 00:38:31.630
soy sauce and fermented products.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:32.630
Vinegars.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:39.740
All these things that are extraordinarily
delicious, full of umami but are controlled

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.560
rot.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:48.640
And it calls into question again our concept
of what is fresh, what is delicious.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:53.660
And sorta ties into, well basically a lot
of it circles and hovers around this taboo

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.890
subject of MSG.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:39:02.740
Which, I think, using some terms from the
UCLA guys, I jokingly say, but sometimes I'm

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:08.700
not joking when I say that it clearly suggests
a form of racism.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.109
&gt;&gt;Pete: The fear of MSG.

00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:12.150
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yeah.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:13.700
Fear of MSG.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.809
Which, people say they're allergic to.

00:39:15.809 --> 00:39:21.260
And I'm not saying they're, I just believe
that it happens to be possibly more psychosomatic

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:22.260
than anything else.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.970
'Cause there's nothing that proves that MSG.

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:31.540
In fact, all the studies, there have been
many that are, try to prove that MSG creates

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.720
this Chinese Restaurant Syndrome.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.579
There's no evidence at all.

00:39:35.579 --> 00:39:40.940
In fact, everything supports that it's psychosomatic.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:46.480
And we serve Asian food in part, I'm particularly
interested in it because we serve a lot of

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.890
Asian ingredients and people say "Oh, I can't
eat your food because there's soy sauce in

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:51.890
it."

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:57.740
But they're happy going to Bobo, eating a
plate of pasta with tomatoes and Parmesan

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:58.740
cheese.

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:00.380
&gt;&gt;Pete: Both of which are ingredients that
are rich in

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:03.460
&gt;&gt;Dave: Glutamic acid, which equals umami.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.460
You know.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:14.880
And the only difference between that and artificially
made MSG is they add one molecule of sodium

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:17.190
so you can disperse the glutamic acid.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:23.049
Your body digests and breaks down glutamic
acid the same way as one would eat a bag of

00:40:23.049 --> 00:40:25.240
Doritos or anything else.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.340
Soy.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.540
Like, Doritos.

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:32.130
You know, a plate of Parmesan is extraordinarily
high in MSG.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:35.890
&gt;&gt;Pete: Yeah, one of the ongoing things in
the magazine is campaigning for MSG.

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:36.890
[laughter]

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:38.680
&gt;&gt;Dave: At the very least I. [inaudible] it's
true.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.370
You're making fun of me.

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:44.900
&gt;&gt;Pete: The first issue we had Harold explain
the whole birth of Chinese Restaurant Syndrome

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.690
was the title of a letter in the New England
Journal of Medicine that was a question, not

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:49.690
a report.

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:50.690
&gt;&gt;Dave: Written by a Chinese guy.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:51.690
That sucks.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:52.690
&gt;&gt;Pete: It's on that dude.

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:53.690
&gt;&gt;Dave: [laughing]

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:56.510
&gt;&gt;Pete: And then we had another article later
about how there are flavor receptors in your

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:59.570
tongue for umami, for glutamic acid.

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:00.650
It's just something interesting.

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:01.650
'Cause it's part of, you know, savoriness.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:04.930
It tells you the food is good.

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:09.500
So eventually we'll hope to convince people
that MSG is OK.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.780
Which is not to say that we cook, or you cook,
with like, MSG

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.220
&gt;&gt;Dave: Oh, no, no, no.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:16.960
But the question, here's the question: Why
don't we use MSG?

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:22.250
We use all sorts of other ingredients that
people don't have any problem not questioning.

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:26.630
But it's like the most taboo thing you could
possibly add.

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:28.770
And people know nothing about it.

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:29.799
They believe the media.

00:41:29.799 --> 00:41:34.170
They believe what's been told to 'em and it's
just one of these things that you know, until

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:37.560
proven otherwise, all facts prove to the contrary.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.619
That MSG's not bad for you.

00:41:39.619 --> 00:41:42.000
And it's not that we want to promote MSG.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.869
It's just, let's care about real issues, not
about, you know.

00:41:46.869 --> 00:41:50.210
And in a way, that's why I say it may be a
form of racism.

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:53.099
Because, you have people who are like, "I
can't eat this.

00:41:53.099 --> 00:41:54.280
I can't eat Chinese food.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.280
Or I can't eat Thai food.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.790
Or I can't eat Korean food."

00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:59.380
But they can eat Italian food.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.859
And that pisses me off.

00:42:00.859 --> 00:42:01.859
[laughter]

00:42:01.859 --> 00:42:06.550
&gt;&gt;Michael: [laughing] Well, I would like to
now open the questions for anyone on the floor

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.109
who has questions for them.

00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:09.569
And we have a microphone in the back.

00:42:09.569 --> 00:42:10.609
You can step up.

00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:12.680
&gt;&gt;Dave: No, you can just, we can hear you.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.680
[audience murmuring]

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.860
&gt;&gt;Dave: I'll just, I'll just repeat, it'll
be fine.

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:16.860
[inaudible]

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.160
&gt;&gt;Dave: Oh yeah?

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.760
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hi guys, my name is Jess.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.700
I'm a huge admirer of both of you guys.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:29.049
I have a couple comments and a question.

00:42:29.049 --> 00:42:35.049
Hopefully you won't mind given that much of
my disposable income has gone to fund Momofuku

00:42:35.049 --> 00:42:36.049
in New York.

00:42:36.049 --> 00:42:39.510
My favorite issue has been the "sweet spot"
issue.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:41.089
Especially the apricot article.

00:42:41.089 --> 00:42:42.270
&gt;&gt;Peter: Adam Gollner?

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:44.000
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah, that article.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.829
I think you guys alluded to this earlier.

00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:51.030
Pretty much redefined how I defined fresh
fruits.

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:52.400
And I've been lecturing.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.180
My husband's like, "OK, I get it.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.410
We're not gonna get apricots here.

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:59.620
We'll have to fly to Uzbekistan or wherever
it was that you guys featured."

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.910
&gt;&gt;Peter: It's really expensive to go to Tajikistan.

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:03.940
And it's a really long flight; there are no
direct routes.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:04.940
&gt;&gt;female #1: Right.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.950
So I contacted the vendor to see if I can
get some delivered.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:08.950
But that's ongoing.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:14.290
Anyway, that was a great article and I've
been also talking to people about the ikejime

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:17.520
and I don't cook as much as I should.

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:23.599
But your recipes is something that I've, you
know, put on my refrigerator just for inspiration.

00:43:23.599 --> 00:43:29.299
&gt;&gt;Peter: We do those funny recipe layouts
because we know, I mean, in any cooking magazine

00:43:29.299 --> 00:43:32.560
you've ever bought, if you cook one or two
things out of an issue.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:33.900
You're like, that was useful.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:38.329
So we just try to make them readable and like,
you know, if you read through it you at least

00:43:38.329 --> 00:43:39.329
learn something about it.

00:43:39.329 --> 00:43:43.590
Whereas if it was just like a column of text
maybe you wouldn't be motivated to do that.

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:44.590
&gt;&gt;female #1: Great.

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:50.560
And in terms of the restaurants David, I absolutely
loved the shaved foie gras at Coi.

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.670
And if you ever get rid of that I will be
very upset.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:58.540
I heard you have a tendency to take stuff
off your menu once they reach that popularity.

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:04.000
&gt;&gt;Dave: We're lucky that people like that
dish but unlucky that people like it enough

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.790
that if we took it off the menu people would
be pissed.

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:13.720
So, um, we sort of have this unwritten rule
where we won't replace a dish unless we can

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.640
exceed its deliciousness.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.040
And how people perceive it.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:21.010
So, we're gonna have that on for a while.

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:23.640
But if we're in California, we'd have to take
it off.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.900
'Cause you have the dumbest legislation ever.

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:32.200
&gt;&gt;female #1: Chicago had it but I think they
had a loophole.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.799
&gt;&gt;Dave: No, they repealed that.

00:44:35.799 --> 00:44:38.440
Partly because, I don't know.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:46.400
It's, I mean, if you guys aren't aware, the
California has banned the sale and consumption

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.540
of foie gras.

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:52.549
Which is extraordinarily short sighted I think.

00:44:52.549 --> 00:45:02.790
And, you know, there's other issues to, for
anti foie protesters to tackle like commodity

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:04.900
chicken.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:09.380
That goes to chicken McNuggets and other terrible
things that go into food.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:12.650
But this is just a ridiculous topic.

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:16.250
Like nobody, like 200,000 people a year consume
foie gras.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:19.440
It's something ridiculously small.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:25.200
But it's something that we dealt with in New
York and unfortunately that, the legislators

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.200
love.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:32.109
'Cause it's just their ability to pass this
is their ability to take, to tell voters that

00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:36.349
"We care about animal rights and the welfare
and the environment."

00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:39.930
'Cause it's such a nonsensical topic that
nobody really cares about.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:41.829
So it's a pyrrhic victory for them.

00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:42.829
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah.

00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:45.589
And in terms of non controversial foods.

00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:48.780
Your kimchi at Noodle Bar.

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:49.780
As a fellow Korean.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.819
Quite proud.

00:45:50.819 --> 00:45:52.000
Your mother must be very proud.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
&gt;&gt;Dave: She thinks it's too salty.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.410
&gt;&gt;female #1: She says it's too salty?

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:57.770
I ate the entire jar by myself.

00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:59.340
I hate admitting that, but I did it.

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.240
And your wait staff kinda stared at me.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.040
&gt;&gt;Dave: I'm glad you enjoyed it.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:07.089
&gt;&gt;female #1: And then finally my question
is, I know you spend a lot of time outside

00:46:07.089 --> 00:46:13.089
of the kitchen now and my question to you
is, how do you still stay involved with all

00:46:13.089 --> 00:46:16.750
the different restaurants that you guys have
around the world.

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:18.420
&gt;&gt;Dave: Man.

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:22.869
Living out of a suitcase.

00:46:22.869 --> 00:46:25.800
No, we have a lab.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.780
It's a struggle.

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:34.270
And I'm sure that if you asked Larry Page
and Serge of Google like how the hell do you

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:40.510
guys keep the spirit of Google alive as you
guys have grown into this massive company?

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:41.510
Right?

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:44.630
It's not as, it's not the upstart that it
once was right?

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:50.339
How do you maintain that philosophy to stoke
the fire, to stoke creativity, to stoke people

00:46:50.339 --> 00:46:52.880
to be excited and work for Google.

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:56.020
And I think that's the struggle that I'm always
trying to figure out.

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:57.559
I don't have that answer.

00:46:57.559 --> 00:46:59.740
'Cause we do have so many employees.

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:03.970
I never thought I'd get to a point where I
don't know anyone's name.

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:05.490
I just don't.

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:06.880
it's too hard.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:10.550
And not too hard, it's impossible.

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:13.040
So, it's a work in progress.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.040
As everything is.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.040
So.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.059
&gt;&gt;female #1: Thank you.

00:47:16.059 --> 00:47:19.510
&gt;&gt;Pete: Yeah, and check out, Adam wrote a
book called The Fruit Hunters.

00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:22.530
Which if you liked that article, you will
enjoy.

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:27.140
&gt;&gt;female #2: Hi, I've a question for Dave.

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:33.030
In the most recent issue of Lucky Peach, you
warned that dark days are coming in the culinary

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:34.030
world.

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:35.030
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yeah.

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:40.520
&gt;&gt;female #2: Can you tell us more about what
you think about that and do you mainly attribute

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:49.980
that to the Food Network, that celebrity type
of culture that has pervaded the world?

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.480
Culinary schools?

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.079
Or, just things are different now?

00:47:54.079 --> 00:47:55.289
&gt;&gt;Dave: Things are different now.

00:47:55.289 --> 00:48:01.040
And I don't think you can attribute, I'm pretty
pessimistic, not pessimistic.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.170
&gt;&gt;Pete: Yeah.

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:04.420
&gt;&gt;Dave: I'm pretty pessimistic.

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:07.549
[laughter] About the future of the culinary
world.

00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:09.829
Particularly fine dining.

00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:11.630
I don't necessarily love fine dining.

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:15.809
It's not that I don't love it, I don’t'wanna
eat it every day.

00:48:15.809 --> 00:48:21.900
I think that it's extraordinarily important
that we continue to have the intensity of

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.210
fine dining.

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:25.510
To teach cooks.

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:29.150
So the loss of fine dining restaurants.

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:32.130
The loss of, how should I say?

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:36.160
I use this as an example a lot.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:41.950
Like if you were an actor, if you were a star
football player in high school, you sort of

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:45.930
know what's at the end of the tunnel if you
happen to be successful at it.

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:48.750
You know that there's fame and fortune and
media, whatever.

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:51.690
So you're a bit prepared for it.

00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:55.260
When I started to cook, or the generation
before me.

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:59.310
And obviously everyone before that, that never
existed.

00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:03.119
You just cooked and maybe one day you were
gonna be good enough to have your own restaurant.

00:49:03.119 --> 00:49:07.329
If somebody was lucky enough to give you that
opportunity.

00:49:07.329 --> 00:49:14.510
Now, with the internet and with TV, you can't
blame cooks, but now that option is available

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:15.510
to them.

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:18.210
So like an athlete, they know that if they
happen to be good at it.

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:19.460
Or not even good at it.

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:24.091
They're going to be able to gain some notoriety
or fame and it's changed everything.

00:49:24.091 --> 00:49:32.030
And the 40 hour work week has changed everything
as well.

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:41.520
You know, I think that I was talking to the
head of Brown University's medical department.

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:48.589
And he was saying, I was asking, are we producing
better doctors now than we were in the past?

00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:52.180
And he said, "No." [laughs] Basically, no.

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.920
He didn't think so.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.930
Not necessarily that they're worse.

00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:59.710
Kids aren't less intelligent or less motivated.

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:03.030
It's just that systems change.

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:04.900
You know.

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.430
They're more concerned about life-work balance.

00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:13.270
And when he was a medical resident, you worked
100, 120 hours a week.

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:15.990
And like two, three day shifts.

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:19.390
Now, it's regimented like eight, ten hours
a day.

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:23.270
Even if you wanted to go work 100 hours a
week at a hospital you wouldn't be allowed

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:26.099
to particularly because of the insurance.

00:50:26.099 --> 00:50:32.050
And the liability that you could murder, I
mean, you could accidentally kill somebody.

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:40.319
And you know, I've spoken to other, you know,
professionals, like a very well known person

00:50:40.319 --> 00:50:41.490
in the medical field.

00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:43.680
And she basically said it's a good thing.

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:44.680
You know.

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:49.060
That cooks, not cooks, that doctors aren't
working those hours.

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.230
Because it causes fatigue and it's not good.

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:55.560
But the one agreement that I have I think
from these two esteemed gentlemen.

00:50:55.560 --> 00:51:00.160
Is that the medical profession is that they
feel that you lose intuition.

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:04.210
You lose the ability to know how to cook.

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:08.490
And one of 'em was like, "Everybody wants
to become a ophthalmologist.

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:11.910
And a specialized doctors.

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:13.260
Nobody wants to become a surgeon anymore."

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:16.212
Partly because there's a system in place that
makes them better.

00:51:16.212 --> 00:51:20.410
The technology makes the doctors better and
then they actually are.

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:29.510
And I feel that if that's happening at the
highest level of education in this country,

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:34.660
why wouldn't it affect what I don't, it's
not the lowest but, a field that is certainly

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:38.380
lower in craftsmanship and skill than being
a medical doctor.

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:42.220
There's certainly a lot more to know and to
do.

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:46.220
And if that's affecting the highest field,
why wouldn't it affect the culinary field.

00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:51.579
So if you just really look at, the hours you're
supposed to work, I think that's really put

00:51:51.579 --> 00:51:57.619
a, you can't learn how to cook in 40 hours
a week.

00:51:57.619 --> 00:51:58.619
You can't.

00:51:58.619 --> 00:52:01.500
Can you guys do your job in 40 hours a week?

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.030
&gt;&gt;audience member: Less.

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:04.049
&gt;&gt;Dave: Less?

00:52:04.049 --> 00:52:06.700
[laughs] for most people, you can't.

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:10.440
But you guys are on salary and Google makes
a ton of money.

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:11.440
Right?

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:15.700
And but for the most part, cooking, you don't
make a lot of money.

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:20.630
So you have to be able to, you gotta work
more.

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:24.869
And you do it for the love of it, and if you're
unable to work more.

00:52:24.869 --> 00:52:26.460
I don't know how much, right?

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:31.480
But I think it's really important for cooks
that are starting out to really immerse themselves

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.750
in it as much as possible.

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:39.140
And right now we have system in culinary culture
that prohibits that.

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:41.160
So things are changing.

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:44.000
And for that reason, I'm pessimistic.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.690
So it's not, I've nothing against younger
cooks.

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:51.680
And just whatever they call them, the millennial
generation?

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.589
It's not their fault.

00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:56.960
It's the, we, somebody has to figure out,
devise a better way to teach.

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.290
And that's our job as chefs and cooks.

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:00.770
We have to teach.

00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:03.340
And it's becoming more and more difficult
to teach.

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:06.270
And I'll just add one more thing.

00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:12.349
We have a lab and we're doing, I think, some
cool stuff with fermentation and new techniques.

00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:15.450
And just learning is a good thing.

00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:19.500
And I had a cook that was like "Hey!" he was
talking to the head of the lab.

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:26.500
And he's like "I wanna, I would love to learn
how, what you guys are working in the lab."

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:30.340
And they were like "Come in on Wednesday,
we have open office hours, we'd love to teach

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:31.869
you, tell you what we're doing."

00:53:31.869 --> 00:53:36.490
He's like "That's my day off, can't do that."

00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:37.490
[laughs]

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:43.349
You know, and if you don't have the, we can't
force them to do it.

00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:47.750
We can, I don't know.

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:53.910
I'm actually, completely flabbergasted and
trying to figure out how to encourage people

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:55.329
to want to learn more.

00:53:55.329 --> 00:53:58.530
And to want to be passionate about cooking.

00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:00.880
And it's something that I love a lot.

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.180
And I care a lot about.

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:10.210
And it's extraordinarily troublesome to me
to, I think it should, you know, people should

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:11.210
be excited about it on their own.

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:12.210
They would want to learn.

00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:13.210
But I don't know.

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:15.430
I don't know what to do.

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:20.559
&gt;&gt;female #2: That's a very pessimistic view.

00:54:20.559 --> 00:54:21.559
[laughter]

00:54:21.559 --> 00:54:22.589
&gt;&gt;Dave: Well.

00:54:22.589 --> 00:54:26.760
&gt;&gt;male #1: What's the 40 hour work week in
kitchens.

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:31.170
'Cause that's not something I've ever heard
of being reality before.

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:39.160
&gt;&gt;Dave: Well, the 40 hour work week usually
in New York and even in California, you work

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.500
40 hours, then after 40 hours you get overtime.

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:44.049
In California, I think it's like two and a
half?

00:54:44.049 --> 00:54:45.950
What is it?

00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:47.660
&gt;&gt;Michael: time and a half.

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:49.539
&gt;&gt;Dave: That's crazy.

00:54:49.539 --> 00:54:52.319
The margins in a restaurant are so small.

00:54:52.319 --> 00:54:55.349
And it's so hard, just staffing out a restaurant.

00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:59.990
And then if you have to pay a cook time and
a half and give 'em like a lunch break.

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:01.230
It's crazy.

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:02.970
You need people to work.

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:04.840
Kitchens don't have the luxury of over-staffing.

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:07.930
&gt;&gt;male #1: Well when you came up it was "Shift
A", right?

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:08.930
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yes.

00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:09.930
Basically, worked.

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:15.180
&gt;&gt;male #1: So is there like a shift between,
like, do restaurants don't do shift pay anymore.

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:16.480
They do hourly pay.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.170
&gt;&gt;Dave: Well, shift pay is illegal.

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:23.340
&gt;&gt;male #1: I mean I know some line cooks and
they don't work even close to 40 hours weeks.

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:26.240
&gt;&gt;Dave: I'm not saying everyone does.

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.240
Alright?

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:30.190
But for the most part it's headed that direction.

00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:33.460
And again, if you step away from what we're
at.

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:37.350
'Cause the culinary world and everything that's
happening is happening at such a rapid pace

00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:40.310
I don't think we have the perspective to really
see what the hell's happening.

00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:45.589
We don't have the time frame to have reflection
of what is happening.

00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:46.980
So you have to look at other cultures.

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:52.400
Look at what happened to Europe with the 40
hour, I think it was 36 hour work week.

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:55.030
It literally killed dining in France.

00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:56.690
I mean.

00:55:56.690 --> 00:56:05.090
There are restaurants that continue to employ
people and work at longer hours but for the

00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:10.260
most part, if you have the majority of country
or the majority of an industry working a set

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:14.339
set of hours, it eventually diminishes the
talent pool.

00:56:14.339 --> 00:56:18.119
It diminishes your workforce.

00:56:18.119 --> 00:56:19.880
And now, not everybody does.

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:22.609
But maybe there, are they hourly employees,
your friends.

00:56:22.609 --> 00:56:25.890
&gt;&gt;male #1: I actually am not sure.

00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:27.011
&gt;&gt;Dave: That's where you have

00:56:27.011 --> 00:56:28.011
[audience member calls out something]

00:56:28.011 --> 00:56:30.570
&gt;&gt;Dave: You have a sous chef and you work
a lot.

00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:32.119
You work a lot of hours.

00:56:32.119 --> 00:56:37.060
&gt;&gt;female #2: I'm going to end it with a more
optimistic question.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:42.569
I have an 11 pound Mangalitsa pork shoulder
in my refrigerator right now.

00:56:42.569 --> 00:56:45.279
What would you recommend I do with it.

00:56:45.279 --> 00:56:47.280
Should I just make a balsam?

00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.880
&gt;&gt;Dave: It's a really easy recipe.

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:49.880
And

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:50.880
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I know.

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:53.760
&gt;&gt;Dave: And Mangalitsa is a type of pig from
Germany, I believe?

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.799
&gt;&gt;Pete: Is that the furry pig?

00:56:54.799 --> 00:56:55.799
&gt;&gt;Dave: The furry one?

00:56:55.799 --> 00:56:56.799
&gt;&gt;female #2: From Hungary.

00:56:56.799 --> 00:56:58.020
&gt;&gt;Dave: It's like a woolly, yeah, Hungary.

00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:01.500
And it's got extraordinarily well marbled
fat in it.

00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:04.460
And it's just delicious type of pig.

00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:10.290
And, it was like a lost breed or something
and it came back.

00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:13.380
And it's really expensive so yeah, I'd throw
a party.

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:14.380
[laughter]

00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:19.319
&gt;&gt;female #2: But when there's so much fat,
like, the simpler the better.

00:57:19.319 --> 00:57:20.319
Right?

00:57:20.319 --> 00:57:21.319
And that's why I thought of the balsam recipe.

00:57:21.319 --> 00:57:26.260
&gt;&gt;Dave: Well, there's only so much you can
do with a pork shoulder, right?

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.700
'Cause, its'a little bit sinewy.

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:33.000
Like you could slice it thin enough to cook
like thin steaks of it.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.380
But for the most part you need to cook it,
if you're gonna cook it whole, long enough

00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:42.820
where, you know, the sinew and some of the
muscle tissue is gonna break down.

00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:45.829
And that's how you're gonna get that sort
of braised meat sensation.

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:52.049
&gt;&gt;female #2: And do you have any tips that's
not in your cookbook for that recipe.

00:57:52.049 --> 00:57:55.200
&gt;&gt;Pete: So, it's simple.

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.200
And stew.

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.200
Just salt, sugar.

00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:58.200
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yeah.

00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.200
&gt;&gt;female #2: So I can't screw it up.

00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.200
&gt;&gt;Dave: You can.

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.619
But the likelihood of it happening is pretty
low.

00:58:01.619 --> 00:58:02.619
&gt;&gt;Pete: Yeah.

00:58:02.619 --> 00:58:03.619
[laughter]

00:58:03.619 --> 00:58:07.969
&gt;&gt;Dave: Especially you know, just put it in,
and six, seven hours later, 300 degrees.

00:58:07.969 --> 00:58:09.040
You should be ready to go.

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.040
Even if it's 11 pounds.

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.040
&gt;&gt;female #2: Alright.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.040
I'll throw a party.

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.040
Thank you.

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:14.040
&gt;&gt;Dave: thank you guys.

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.040
&gt;&gt;Pete: Thanks for having us.

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:15.041
[applause]
