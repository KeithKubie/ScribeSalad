00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.060
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Well good
afternoon everybody and thank you

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.540
so very much for being
here today with us

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.670 position:56%
in the African Middle East Division.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.440
I am the Chief of the
Division Mary-Jane Deeb.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.890
And I am delighted to
welcome you all here.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.490
I know that you're here because of
the speaker, because of the topic,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.940
because it's a fascinating topic.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.520
Mona Khademi is going to
be talking on the life

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.170
of Laura Clifford Dreyfus Barney

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.700
and her connections
with Iran and Iranians.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.490
And this lecture, this presentation
today is part of a lecture series

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.070
on Persian lecture series
that we've been holding

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.550
for the past four years.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.660
It's been curated by the Persian
specialist Hirad Dinavari.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.230
And it is a continuation if you
want, of the wonderful exhibit

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.530
that we had on 1,000
years of the Persian book.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:34.430
So we are continuing on the themes,
on Persian themes and I always put

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.980
in a few words about our
own division and as most

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.840
of you already know our division
is made up of three sections,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.520
the African, the Hebraic
and the Neri section.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.170
We cover 78 countries in
the Middle East and African

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.810
and Central Asia and the Caucasus.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.310
We collect materials in the
languages of those countries.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.870
We collect, we preserve,
we serve these collections.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.640 position:56%
But we also want those
collections to be known by everyone.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.700
And so we organize programs,
exhibits, conferences

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.910
and other activities that
highlight these collections,

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.680
and that inform our
patrons about the countries

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.980
and the cultures these
publications come from.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.760
So our presentation
today is a case in point.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.310
Mona Khademi is a scholar and
has been a patron at the library

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.800

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.770
the work that she's currently
engaged in with us today.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.550
And to share with us her research.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.570
So I am grateful and delighted that
she's here and it is from scholars

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.380

African and Middle Eastern Division

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.680
of the Library of Congress.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:46.680
And Mary-Jane Weeks, and
Dear Hirad Dinavari for the -

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.230
for all the hard work he has done
for organizing today's event.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.890
And my thanks go to each
one of you in the audience.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.150
Thank you so much.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.210
My challenge today has
been to prepare a talk

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.370
about the life of Laura
Dreyfus Barney.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.940
And her long fruitful
life for a limited time.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.750
For the interest of
time and in order not

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.520
to miss any important points
I will read my presentation.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.930
I will be showing some
historical pictures and I would

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.370
like to ask you not to take
any pictures of the images

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.390
because they are copyrighted.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:45.830
The first question people ask
me always is why did you become

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.620
interested in Laura Barney's life?

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.570
It was in the year 2000 when
I heard that studio house

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:02.120
at 2306 Massachusetts Avenue,
Northwest was being sold

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.750
and its contents auctioned.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.510
Studio House was the
house that Laura Barney

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:14.300
and her sister Natalie
Barney had inherited

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.730
after the death of their mother.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:24.050 position:56%
And then years later in 1960 donated
it to Smithsonian Institution.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:30.320
The house which is on
the National Register

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:36.780
of Historical Places stands
currently and is owned and occupied

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.770
by the Embassy of Latvia.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.910
A plaque with the name
of Laura and her sister -

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.430
Still stands outside the building,
acknowledging their donation.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:56.230
I knew that Laura Barney was Bahai.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:01.980 position:56%
And that she had compiled a book but
did not know much more about her.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.770
I visited the house at that
time and I got interested

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.300
to learn more about her life.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:15.170
I found very little
published material and that is

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.800
when I started my journey.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:25.600
A journey that I found fascinating
and has continued to date.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:32.070 position:56%
Research about her life has taken me
to a variety of archives in France,

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:37.950
England, Switzerland and
several cities in United States.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:43.200
And I have found correspondences,
documents, newspaper articles

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.950
and I've even been able
to interview some people.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.510
And the material that
I have found they were

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.840
in English, Persian and French.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:02.330
And obituary in the Washington
Post in August of 1974 wrote

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.990
about Laura Dreyfus Barney.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:11.220
And after writing about her family
and her achievements it reported

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:16.540
that her interests extended from
the International Council of Women

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:21.950
to local philanthropic
projects in Washington.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:30.270 position:56%
She had died on August 18 at her
home in Paris, she was 94 years old.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:35.880
It said that Mrs. Barney was
a member of the Bahai faith

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:43.230
and wrote the book Some Answered
Questions, a book about her faith.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.480
Who was Laura Barney?

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.890
Why do we have to know
about her life?

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.420
What are some of her
accomplishments?

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.510
How was her childhood?

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.530
Why did she learn Persian?

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:07.300 position:56%
What attracted this privileged woman
to a faith emanating from Iran?

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.410
Where did she meet
Gandhi, Ezra Pound,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.940
Whistler and Eleanor Roosevelt?

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:22.620
Why was she awarded and appointment
an officer of the Legion d'Honneur.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:31.150
Why was this woman called a global
leader and who had noble deeds?

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:36.040
Today I will answer
some of these questions.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:45.100
Laura Clifford Barney was
born in Cincinnati in 1879

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:51.850
to wealthy Albert Clifford
Barney who was an industrialist

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:59.090
and financier, who was the son of
a manufacturer of railway cars.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:06.920
Her mother was Alice Pike Barney, a
prominent artist, a philanthropist

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.180
and the daughter of a
multi-millionaire entrepreneur.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.800
Alice became a civic and
social leader in Washington

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.270
in the early twentieth century.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:26.160
Albert and Alice had two
daughters, Natalie and Laura.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.240
Laura who was born three
years after her sister.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:36.310
The family moved to
Washington D.C. in 1889.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.820
The sisters had the rich

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.540
and privileged life
and grew up in luxury.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:49.170
The family's summer
vacation home had 26 rooms.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.950
They had governess
and private tutors.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.840
The two sisters were sent to a
private boarding school outside

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.270
of Paris, and then back to the US.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.270
And the family attended
Episcopalian church.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:14.880
The characters of the two sisters
were different from an early age.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.740
Laura was the one who was diligent,
the student - a diligent student,

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:28.430
rather shy, who always tried to
improve and had serious thoughts.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:33.020
From childhood, she
had the sense of duty.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.750
Natalie was the opposite.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:44.050
In 1900 when Laura had returned
to Paris to continue her education

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:50.310
in dramatic arts, she attended a
meeting at the home of May Bolles,

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:54.590
an American woman living in Paris.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:59.320
May Bolles was among the first
group of Westerners who had gone

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:05.740 position:56%
to visit the head of the Bahai
faith Abdul Baha in Akka, Palestine,

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.280
today's Israel, the year before.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:16.690
Abdul Baha was the son of the
prophet founder of the Bahai faith.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:21.180
Because of the time limitations
I will not talk about the history

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:28.080 position:56%
of the Bahai faith, whose forerunner
was the Bab, its founder Baha Alla,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.460
who was born in Iran 200 years ago.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:39.020
And because of his teachings he
was exiled together with his family

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:46.160
and was imprisoned in Baghdad,
Adrianople, Istanbul and lastly

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.040
to the prison city of Akka.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:56.500
Soon after that meeting with May
Bolles in Paris Laura traveled

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:02.970
with her cousin to Akka to meet
the spiritual leader from the East.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:07.070
After a long and difficult trip.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.820
After meeting Abdul Baha,

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.620
she realized that those were the
teachings she had been waiting for

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:19.640
and she became a believer
in the Bahai faith.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:24.420
Laura's attraction to this
new faith were most likely

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.660
because of the principles
of equality between sexes

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:35.230
and the belief in the oneness
of God and oneness of humanity.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.550
She returned to Akka
after a few months.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:45.720
On her second visit,
Abdul Baha asked her

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:54.420
to accompany Abdul Fadl Gulpaygani
an Iranian scholar to the West.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.060
Abdul Faz was the most rooted

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:07.130
and the greatest Bahai scholars
living in Egypt at that time.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:11.930
She accompanied him to Paris with
a translator and after a stay

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.460
of three months she
accompanied him to the US.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:21.090
Laura and her mother
paid for his expenses.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:26.650
During his stay Laura deepened
her knowledge of this new faith

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.250
and started learning Persian.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:36.540 position:56%
In Washington Alice Barney,
Laura's mother had become interested

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:40.710
in the Bahai faith and its
teachings and held meetings

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.380
at her home for Abdul Faz.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:47.050
She painted a portrait
of him which is now

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.900
at the Smithsonian National
Museum of American Arts.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:59.170
There were always write ups about
the Barney family in the local

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:04.730
and even the national newspapers
given their social status.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:13.220 position:56%
An article in the Washington Post of
March 1902 read "Ms. Laura Barney,

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.570
who is a Bahai'st as
are other members

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.440
of Alice Clifford Barney's family,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:26.340
says that at Akka one sees
demonstrated both in the family

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:31.310
and the religious life the
harmony and love which is one

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:36.660
of the pivotal principles of
the teachings of Bahai'ism".

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.960
And sometimes the news they covered

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.690
in the newspapers gave
incorrect information.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:50.290
Laura was never amused, but this
was what she had to tolerate.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:57.230
Gossip magazines printed
several untrue and false articles

00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:02.070
about Laura's mother
and made fun of Laura.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:06.860
Her father who cared about
people's opinion about his family

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.600
and their social standing was
not happy to see the articles

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:17.510
and he decided to close the house
where the meetings were held.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.680
Another incident that
made him furious was

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:27.530
that the year before the news
of the publication of a book

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.620
by Natalie which had reached him.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:39.410
Natalie, Laura's sister was
an author, poetess, a rebel

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:46.510
and later held literally salons
in Paris for about 60 years.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:51.700 position:56%
She was openly gay and her published
book was about lesbian women

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.750
with drawings done by her
mother, which caused much grief

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:08.990
for the father who went to Europe
to collect all published copies.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:15.290
Albert's wife and his two daughters
were following unconventional

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:21.970
lifestyles and was too
much on his health.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:26.340
He was outraged with
the news of his family

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:31.730
and had the second heart
attack and died in 1902.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:37.470
The father left his wife
and two daughters a fortune.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:47.960
Laura returned several more times
to Akka between 1904 and 1906.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:52.160
And spent weeks and
sometimes months there.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.990
Posing questions to Abdul Baha.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.980
Laura was deepening her
knowledge of the Bahai teachings

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.470
and asking deep philosophical
questions.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:10.930
In 1906 at the request
of Abdul Baha Laura

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:17.730
who was only 27 years old
traveled to Iran, the birth place

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:23.150
of her faith to meet
the Bahai's there.

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:28.310
She was accompanied
by Hippolyte Dreyfus.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.230
Hippolyte Dreyfus was
the first French man

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.910
from Paris who had become a Bahai.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:39.780
Hippolyte had studied law
and had a doctoral degree

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:45.410
and was practicing before
the Paris Court of Appeals.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:52.920 position:56%
He later gave up his legal career to
devote himself to oriental studies,

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:59.230
comparative religion and learning
Arabic and Persian intending

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.950
to translate the Bahai writings.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:09.090
Laura also had the chaperone
and escort, a French Bahai lady

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:13.310
who accompanied her on this trip.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:19.690
They first traveled to Ashgabat in
Turkmenistan where a Bahai House

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.750
of Worship was being built.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.340
They met the Bahai's there.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:32.050
Then they continued on to Iran.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:36.440
She was the first Western
Bahai woman

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:43.020
and Hippolyte the first
Western Bahai man to visit Iran.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:48.460
Their stay lasted over
five weeks and most

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:54.840
of the cities they visited had
historical Bahai significance.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:00.880
In each city they met with
dignitaries, government officials,

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:06.580
prominent people and many
of whom were Bahai's.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:12.890
Laura said that she was
delighted to meet the crowds.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:19.390
Upo arrivalin Iran they spent one
night in Vazvan, the birth place

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:28.330
of Tahirih, the Persian Poetess.In
Tehran she met another Iranian

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.640
scholar, [Inaudible].

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:36.850
He was originally from Hamadan
and was an Islamic scholar

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.950
who had converted to
the Bahai faith.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:47.320
She spent several days and long
hours engaged in asking questions.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.830
After a grand reception in Tehran,

00:21:51.830 --> 00:22:00.030
she wrote "Of course this spiritual
quality and rarified atmosphere

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:06.500 position:56%
of such Heavenly assemblies were the
distinguished members of the west

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:14.010
and east gathered together in such
a loving environment can neither be

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:19.700
described nor recorded
It should only be seen".

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:28.390
While in Tehran Laura sent a
letter to her mother reassuring her

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.660 position:56%
that she should not worry about her.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.570
Stating that Iran was "one

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:38.890
of the most peaceful
countries that she had seen".

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:43.830
In another letter she wrote that
the Bahai's there were wonderfully

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:50.260
sincere and kind and the people she
met were among the most important

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.980
people of Persia.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:56.720
In Asfahan the delegation
was hosted by [Inaudible],

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:03.030
was the Vazir of Asfahan
with responsibilities

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:10.970
for government finances in that
promise some years earlier.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:14.560
He was well known to be a Bahai.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.440
[Inaudible] was one of
the notables of Asfahan

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.320
who had also become a Bahai.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.840
They arrived in Tabriz
with [Inaudible]

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:32.190
and were welcomed and
greeted by Bahai's.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:36.640
The governor and the agent
of the crown prince had asked

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:42.190
that a person be present at
every gathering they attended.

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:47.980
His son met with them and
asked them many questions.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:55.220
He made comments about Ms. Barney's
command of Persian and the fact

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:59.910
that she had no accent
like other foreigners.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:07.340
And he said that she spoke better
than many educated Iranians.

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:14.230
They also visited Maku, the
city of Maku is well known

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.610
in the Bahai history for its fort

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:23.990
where the Bab was imprisoned
for nine months in 1847.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:29.330
He was later executed by
firing squads in Tabriz.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:33.550
They had to cut their stay short

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:38.180
because the constitutional
revolution was under way.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.070
She wrote later that
"Many of our brothers

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:48.250
and sisters did not get
a chance to meet us".

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:55.960 position:56%
Being the first woman from the west,
the first Bahai woman from the west

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:01.910
who visited Iran, her trip
must have opened the minds

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:07.570
of the Iranian women as to what
the western women were doing.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:14.460
According to the star of the
west a Bahai magazine her journey

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:19.720
to Iran brought much
enthusiasm and passion

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.120
to the hearts of the lovers of God.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.760
And Laura Barney's
services in the course

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:32.620
of that visit were
considered distinguished.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:40.110
Iranians looked up to westerners
and their presence in Iran

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:43.970
in those years must have
been something special

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.350
with long-term effect.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:52.510
Several American newspapers
reported about this trip.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:56.010
The Washington Herald reported that

00:25:56.010 --> 00:26:00.120
"Ms. Barney is a young
woman of many gifts.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:05.430
And is indulged with
originality and executive talent.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:10.010
In addition to her
perfect mastery of French,

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:14.260
she has gained vast knowledge
in the Persian language

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:20.640
in which she writes, reads,
translates and speaks fluently.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:28.940
Her devotion to the Bahai movement
speaks for her broad mindedness

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:34.010
and proves her ardent
desire to serve humanity".

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:42.380
It continued "For this philosophy
she considers an efficient means

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.250
to that end.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:48.850
Her house in Paris has
been a delightful center

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:52.610
and a gathering place
for all those interested

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.820 position:56%
in the higher problems of humanity".

00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:04.090
After her return from
Iran she traveled to Akka.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:10.430 position:56%
And asked explicit permission from
Abdul Baha to publish her collection

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.320
of questions and answers.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:18.350
The questions were hers from
her Christian perspective,

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:23.340
which she had asked during
her long stays in Akka,

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:27.430
and the answers were by Abdul Baha.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:36.190
He granted permission after every
page of the book was read, approved

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:40.670
and stamped by his special seal.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:46.430
The Seal that was used for
his authoritative writings.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:57.150
And that is why the book that she
compiled became a Bahai Holy Book.

00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:04.470
The book that she compiled was
some answered questions in English

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:09.970
and [Inaudible] in Persian and
both were published in 1908.

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:21.230
Some of the topics dealt with the
prophets of God, the soul, fate,

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:28.150
man's destiny, immortality
and life after death.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:34.760
In this book she also had posed
questions related to Christianity,

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.230
such as Birth of Christ,

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:42.510
his resurrection, Baptism
and the Trinity.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:48.450
Her book became an
essential and significant book

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.930
for understanding the basic
belief of the Bahai's.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:57.530
And introduced this
faith to the west.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.430
It was her greatest accomplishment

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:06.620
and achieved immortal fame
in the Bahai world over.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.160
Laura also collaborated with
Hippolyte to translate the book

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:16.720
into French, which was
also published in 1908.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:22.010
The book that she had comprised
is translated into 13 languages

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.790
and have been reprinted many times.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.740
The last one in 2014.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:36.570
Soon after that in 1909
she wrote a drama called

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:42.070 position:56%
"Gods Heroes, a drama in five acts".

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.130
And the script was
published the following year.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:50.320
This was Laura's defensive reaction

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:56.240
to protect the Bahai
faith and the Bab.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:01.100
It seems that a French
playwright intended to write a play

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:07.060
about the Bab and to have Sarah
Bernhardt the renowned French stage

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:12.590
actress play the role of the
Great Babi Bahai heroine,

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:14.850
the poetess Tahirih.

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:19.680
Tahirih meaning the pure
one, she also had the title

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.560
of [Inaudible] consolation
of the eyes.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:28.210
Who was executed at
the young age in 1852?

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:33.510
Laura was shocked by the
thought of what they would show

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:37.760
on the Paris stage with
the life of the Bab.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.530
That caused her to write this play.

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:44.570
It was written around
the life of Tahirih

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:48.110
and was illuminated
in Persian style.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:53.410
The protocol among
the theater people was

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.040
that if someone was working

00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.760
on a subject then no
one else would touch it.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:08.800
Newspapers in the US printed
articles about this publication.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:13.990
The Boston Globe printed an
article in 1910 with the heading

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:21.790
of "Girl Writes Persian Play
for Parisians" referring

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:26.060
to the political circumstances
in Iran at that time.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:33.130
It stated "This Persian crisis
has drawn much attention

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:37.340
to the new play written
by an accomplished

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:42.350
and learned American girl,
Ms. Laura Clifford Barney

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:46.610
for the theater the season".

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:52.410
It continued "God's heroes
is a play dealing exclusively

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.270
with the modern history of Persia.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:32:02.710 position:56%
The play while dealing with the
modern subject is a Medieval spirit.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:07.380
It savors of the miracle
or mystery plays,

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:14.540 position:56%
Ms. Barney knows Persian almost as
well as she knows French or English.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:20.640
Hence the rich oriental
metaphors one finds in the play

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.660
and the flights of
imagination such as our scene

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:29.910
in the [Inaudible]
even the very shades

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:34.130
of meanings are well brought out".

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:45.230
It was in 1911, that Laura
and Hippolyte got married

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:51.890
and they adopted the last
name of Hippolyte Dreyfus.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:58.410
They had known each other since
1900 and had collaborated together

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:03.420
and had realized that they
had common aspirations.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:11.290
The same year Abdul Baha who
had been freed and had gone

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:17.410
to Egypt traveled to the
West for the first time.

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:21.010
A trip which Laura
had the major role.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:28.380
She had invited him and it was her
husband who met him in Marseilles

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:32.480
when he arrived on the
continent of Europe.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:37.440
Laura and her husband were with
him during his stay in [Inaudible]

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:45.580
in France, a town by Lake Geneva
where he stayed for a few days.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:51.130
And then they accompanied
him on several side trips.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:56.920
They accompanied him to
Switzerland and later to England.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:04.510
In London Lady Blumfield,
Abdul Baha's hostess wrote

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:11.260
"Foremost amongst our visitors were
Monsieur and Madam Dreyfus Barney,

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:18.770
the brilliant French scholar and
his no less brilliant American wife

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:23.740
who spoke Persian with Abdul
Baha, translated for him

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:29.340
and were altogether helpful,
courteous and charming".

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:40.230
When Abdul Baha later traveled to
Paris he stayed in an apartment,

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:46.370
but he spent a good deal of time
at the home of Dreyfus Barney's.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:52.920
Abdul Baha traveled to
North America in 1912

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:57.030
and visited Washington
D.C. three times.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:04.000
And the home of Laura's mother
Studio House at least three times.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.460
And addressed the guests there.

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:13.500
Laura accompanied him on
several of his visits during one

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.970
of his trips to Washington D.C.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:31.800
He returned to Paris in January
1913 after his visit in America.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:36.110
The Dreyfus Barney's again
hosted him at many meetings

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:39.520
and accompanied him
on this trip too.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:43.470
They were with him with the
Orientalist Edward G. Brown

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:48.000
and his wife visited him.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.930
Laura and Hippolyte
started a trip to regions

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:57.870 position:56%
of Eastern Asia towards end of 1913.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:05.660
They visited Japan, Korea and China
and had planned to travel to India,

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.900
Persia and back to France.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:16.550
But while they were in China on
Yenges River World War I broke out

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:21.930
and they were forced to return
to US and then back to Paris.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:27.540
During the war Laura served
with the American Ambulance Core

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:31.960
which was basically the
American Hospital in Paris.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.570
And Hippolyte assumed
his military obligations

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:40.330
as a member of the French Army.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:46.290
Laura also volunteered her services
with the Red Cross and helped

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:51.660
with the refugees in several
regions in Southern France.

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.740
And she was also the co-founder

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:58.900
of the first Children's
Hospital Avignon.

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:06.040
Laura was made a chevalier of
the French Legion of Honor,

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:11.260
the highest French
decoration created by Napoleon

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:16.170
for her work among the
wounded in World War I.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:19.060
And later she was promoted
to the Officer

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.970
of the French Legion of Honor.

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:35.170
At the end of the war they
visited Abdul Baha before embarking

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:41.950
on their trip that they had cut
short earlier because of the war.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:49.960
They spent about a year and a half
traveling from Marseilles to Egypt,

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.580
Dutch Indies which
is today's Indonesia,

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.230
into China they visited
Miramar, Thailand, Cambodia

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:01.480
and Vietnam, Singapore and India.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:06.500
While in India they had an
audience with Mahatma Gandhi.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:12.050
And it was in Rangoon Burma
that they heard the news

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:17.760
of the passing of Abdul
Baha in 1921.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:24.210
After her return Laura became
active with the League of Nations.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:28.590
The predecessor of
the United Nations.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:34.120
The League of Nations was the first
international organization whose

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:39.170
principle mission was
to maintain world peace.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:44.940
She chose to work in social
and humanitarian arenas in line

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:48.120
with the principles
she had accepted.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:56.080
She also became an active member of
the International Council of Women

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:02.570
and was its representative at the
League of Nations for almost all

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:06.350
of her - the remainder of her life.

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:12.460
Having seen the horrors
of war firsthand she said

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:17.210
"In a way all these
horrors are a good thing

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:20.020
for the future generations.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:23.600
Who see what war means.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.840
Not simply chivalry and medals.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.870
I think that women will
be great help to get

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:38.860
out of this horrible
habit of the past".

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:44.720
Laura lost her husband
Hippolyte in 1928.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.260
She was not yet 50 years
old when she became a widow

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.850
and they had no children.

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:56.910
She lost her mother
a few years later.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:01.770
She organized an annual
exhibition of her mother's art work

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:06.350
in Washington D.C. and the First
Lady Eleanor Roosevelt attended the

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:09.050
exhibition opening.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:13.300
She also established a
memorial fund and a trust

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.070
in the name of her mother.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:20.260
And donated her paintings
to museums mostly

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:24.830
to the Smithsonian
Museum of American Art.

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:30.020
For the remainder of her life.

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:36.020
She rendered many services
with numerous responsibilities.

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:39.520
One of her responsibilities
in those years was serving

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.820
on the International Committee
on intellectual corporation.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.740
A committee that was the
precursor of [Inaudible].

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:52.600
Some of the distinguished
people who had worked

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:58.370
with this committee were
Albert Einstein, Marie Currie,

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:07.010
Henry Berksen, Bella Bartuke,
Thelma Mann and many others.

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:11.870
She was also the vice president
of disarmament committee

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:17.590
which was formed by 14 major
international women organizations

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:22.560
working tirelessly with the
League of Nations which was active

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.970
in Geneva up to the
start of World War II.

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:33.050
In the 1930's Laura
traveled across Canada

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:37.110
and gave talks at several
major cities.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:43.800
She was invited also to
visit Egypt, Lebanon, Syria,

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:47.880
Turkey and Greece and gave talks.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:53.070
As a brilliant speaker she
gave her talks at universities,

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:59.380
national libraries and clubs,
talking about peace, disarmament

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:05.130
and bringing people of
different cultures together.

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:10.380
One newspaper reporter
wrote about her.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:17.880
It was she, the American woman
transplanted to France who was able

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:23.580
to put her roots down there
to serve a greater homeland.

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:28.950
That of men of good will
whose prestigious adventures

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:32.960
of the spirit I wanted to know.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.420
Then the reporter continued,

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:39.820
"Madam Dreyfus Barney's
astonishing personality

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:44.510
and her lucid intelligence
are self-evident".

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:52.560 position:56%
I admired this elite woman who knows
how to think globally at a time

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:58.500
when so much hatred and so many
minds make brothers into enemies

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:04.070
and once again the
threat of war returns.

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:07.770
Another newspaper article stated

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:12.370
"Madam Dreyfus Barney
teaches by example".

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:16.250
Are not the very tone of
her advocacy the nature

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:19.930
of her arguments the
very proof of this?

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:25.470
As an American woman
a quarter Jewish,

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:28.770
and Dreyfus as her
families last name,

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:33.560
her husband's family name she
was encouraged to leave France

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.340
at the onset of World War II.

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:43.350
She traveled to Washington D.C. in
1940 and stayed here for six years.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:49.480
Upon her arrival after visiting
a photography exhibition

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:56.130
at the Library of Congress,
she wrote an article titled

00:43:56.130 --> 00:44:00.710
"In a Library" reflecting
on the war.

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:10.320
She wrote "During this cruel period
we know that we must remain united

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.360
in our services to others.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:19.840
Then the end of the war will find
us strong before the realities

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.230
of life".

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:27.630
During those six years in
the US she remained active.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:33.410
She served on several national
and international boards.

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:38.680
She became the co-founder of the
Institute of War Organization,

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:43.280
a permanent center in Washington
for the study and dissemination

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:48.710
of the principles and
methods of world organization.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:54.840
It was sponsored by a group of
distinguished men and women known

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.890
for their interests in
international affairs.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:02.790
More than 20 of whom
were representatives

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:07.370
of universities throughout
the country.

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:11.880
That same year Laura
Barney served as a member

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:17.360
of the United States Delegation to
the conference of the commission

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:22.850
of intellectual corporation
held in Havana, Cuba.

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:30.360
Laura was invited to attend the
international congress of women

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:36.270
that was taking place
in Iran in 1967.

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:41.060
She was invited by the sister of
the Shah who was the vice president

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:46.260
of the International Council
of Women at that time.

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:50.280
Laura was very interested
to return to Iran

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.530
but her health did not allow her.

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:58.740
She was 81years old at the time.

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:02.910
She stayed active until
the end of her life.

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:10.080 position:56%
In her later years her mind was
still sharp even though her body was

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:15.620
handicapped by rheumatism and
the side effects of a fall

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:20.540
from a horse during her
childhood that had stayed with her

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:25.420 position:56%
and caused her to limp all her life.

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:35.800
Laura died in August 1974
in Paris at the age of 94.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:41.530
And according to her wishes
she was buried in the same plot

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:46.170
as her sister Natalie
in the cemetery.

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:52.830
The two sisters had selected
different paths in life

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:58.870
from early on, but Laura
remained devoted and close

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:02.970
to her sister despite
their differences.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:12.150 position:56%
Newspapers on both sides of the
Atlantic such as the Herald Tribune,

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:18.640
the New York Times,
the Washington Post,

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:25.490
Lamond and Le Figero
announced her death.

00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:34.480
Someone who knew Laura Barney well
wrote, "With her keen intelligence,

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:43.520
logical mind and investigative
nature she devoted her whole life

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:51.040
from adolescence to improving
human relations bringing people

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:58.250
of the different races,
classes and nations together".

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:05.410
He continued, "Those who had the
rare privilege of knowing her

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:12.660
over a period of many decades can
testify that her on daunted zeal

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:19.590
for the objective of brotherhood
of man remained alive and glowing

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:23.890
to the very last day
of her life on earth".

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:33.600 position:56%
Laura Dreyfus Barney challenged
many of her immediate social circles

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:37.050
and selected a path different

00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:41.480
from what her social
milieu would have dictated.

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:47.750
She could have selected a
much easier path in life,

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:50.640
but she had an intense attraction

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:55.080
to the teachings that
had come from Iran.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:49:01.920
She had said "But he
has told us not to keep

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:08.630
to ourselves alone what he has
entrusted to us for humanity".

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:16.900
This is a glimpse into the life
of a privileged American woman

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:21.840

a spiritual leader from Iran.

She tried to bring the
world closer together,

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:32.080
helped create mutual understanding
and not only between the people

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:36.870
of the west and the east,
but the rest of the world

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:42.890
and devoted her life to
humanitarian activities.

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:46.830
Thank you very much for
your patience and thank you

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:51.270
for giving me this opportunity
to share with you some parts

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:55.190
of my research, and to
talk about one aspect

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:57.910
of Laura Dreyfus Barney's life

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:01.430
that of her connections
with Iran and Iranians.

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:03.230
Thank you so much.

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.770
Thank you everyone for being
here especially on a lunch break.

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:15.600
I also want to take a second
and ask Mona to say something

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.920
about the books she
brought in as well.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.550
&gt;&gt; Mona Khademi: The books
I brought are her books

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:21.920
that have been published.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:27.350
There are some answered
questions in English, in Persian

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:35.390
and God's Heroes, a Drama in
Five Acts the 1910 print of it.

00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:36.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:40.630
We have time for some questions,
feel free to ask and I will be glad

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:45.510
to repeat them in the microphone.

[ Inaudible question ]

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:58.060
&gt;&gt; Before discovering the house
had you had heard of Laura before?

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:01.360
&gt;&gt; Mona Khademi: Yes I
knew that she was a Bahai

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.770
and I knew she had written a book.

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:07.120
But that was basically what I knew.

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:10.920 position:56%
I didn't know much about her mother,
whether she was a Bahai or not.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:18.740
I don't - I didn't know any
details of her life at the time.

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.040
Thank you.

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.340
&gt;&gt; Any other questions?

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.640
Don't be shy.

[ Inaudible question ]

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.100
&gt;&gt; What was the most
attractive thing to her,

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:45.520
to the Bahai faith for her?

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.410
&gt;&gt; Mona Khademi: You know I
think I mentioned it in my talk,

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:52.750
I think the activities that she
picked up for rest of her life

00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:58.410
and she devoted her time to it,
maybe those were what attracted her

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:01.300
to - what was she attracted to.

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:04.170
The equality of men and women.

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:06.660
She believed in that
from the beginning

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:09.770
and also the fact that
humanity is one.

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:13.060
That is one of the main
principles of the Bahai faith

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:18.140
and she devoted all her
life to those two causes.

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:22.790
Through the League of Nations and
the International Council of Women.

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:27.510
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

[ Inaudible question ]

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.630
&gt;&gt; Did she leave any
written material

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:43.250
about her observations
from her visits to Iran?

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:47.690
&gt;&gt; Mona Khademi: You know she left
Paris at the start of World War II.

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:51.470
She was in America for six years.

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:56.230
When she returned to Paris
many things were stolen

00:52:56.230 --> 00:53:02.280
from her apartment, including her
notes and diaries of her visits

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:09.940
to Akka, meetings with Abdul
Baha, many material belongings

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:15.120 position:56%
but she said that the most important
were her notes of all those years

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:19.210
that she wanted to publish
and she had already asked

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:21.230
for permission to publish.

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:27.890
Those were all stolen, so whatever
I have found is through her letters

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:32.100
to other family members, to
her sister or to her mother.

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.430
I refer to some of them in my talk.

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:43.510
But nothing else written with
details of her trip to Iran.

&gt;&gt; Compilation of her public talks?

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:53.940
&gt;&gt; Mona Khademi: There
is no compilation

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.470
but I do have some of them.

00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:59.390
I have seen some of her talks.

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:05.200
That requires further research
because as I said she traveled

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:10.120
across Canada, she traveled in
many Middle Eastern Countries

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:14.670
and gave talks, one needs
to do further research going

00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:18.350
into either archives
of those countries

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:21.600
or through the organization
that she traveled

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:29.510
with to find the transcript
of those talks.

&gt;&gt; Mona Khademi: You know
since I've started my research

00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:40.120
in the year 2000 I have given
talks and published some papers

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.600
and even a chapter of a book.

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:46.870
Right now I am working on
a full biography of hers,

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:54.050
which is two-thirds done and
I hope that will be out and in

about her other activities

like the International Council
of Women and the different roles

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:07.570
and responsibilities she had
with the League of Nations.

Mary-Jane and Joan had to step

out because they had
another meeting to attend to.
