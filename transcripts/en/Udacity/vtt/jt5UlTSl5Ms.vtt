00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.800
So, let's ask ourselves this question.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.260
When control transfers to the ShellCode,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.620
what privileges are going to be
used when this code is executed?

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.380
We know the code is attacker code.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.710
The attacker actually created the code,
wasted memory,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.840
transferred control of this program that
we were running before to the ShellCode,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.342
and remember the program was
running on behalf of some users.

00:00:27.342 --> 00:00:31.680
So it's a service, it may be running on
behalf of rule or depending on what sort

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.310
of rule is this or credentials we
have some role or whatever it is.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.520
It could a system process for example.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.630
So, the program was running
with certain privileges.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.230
This program is now going and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.660
executing these instructions
that make up the ShellCode.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.010
So whose privileges are we going to
be using when the shell code or

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.370
the instructions that make
up a ShellCode get executed?

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.930
These privileges are going to be
the privileges of the host program,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.020
the program that gets exploited was
running with certain privileges.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.830
This attacker code now has the same
privileges that the host program or

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.590
the target program that
could exploit it had.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.360
So if this happened to be
system service as I said,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.330
is running with root privileges.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.130
Essentially, you have
keys to the kingdom.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.505
You can access arbitrary resources,
so the attacker used

00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:26.042
a vulnerable program used above for
all the idea that we talked about,

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:30.035
transfer the control to its own code,
that was the ShellCode, and

00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:33.805
the ShellCode let's it launch to command
shell, and the command shell now

00:01:33.805 --> 00:01:38.595
can start whatever program it wants
to and that program would run on

00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:44.070
behalf of the host programs owner or
group privileges whatever that it had.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.720
So the attacker has come in and
become you, either the system or

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.070
a particular user who is running
this vulnerable program.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.230
So, this is how the attacker
is able to execute

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.020
arbitrary code with a legitimate
user's credentials or privileges.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.040
Legitimate user's privileges
are available to this

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.169
arbitrary code that is being
executed on behalf of the attacker.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.340
That's the best case scenario from
the attacker's point of view.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.300
It's the worst case scenario from our
point of view because somebody is

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.150
executing code we have no
knowledge of with our privileges.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.340
And they were able to get into the
system because there was a vulnerability

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.440
that got successfully exploited and
as a result

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.010
the attacker has ability to do
everything that he or she wants to do.
