Hello. I am interested in the process by which
I could download everything from a brain and

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.819
upload it into a brain inside the body of
Ryan Reynolds so I could have lots of cool

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.019
fun. Is that possible? Asking for a friend.

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:19.539
Hey brainiacs, Trace here for DNews! Over
the centuries, we've compared our brain to

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.910
clocks, telephone switchboards, and now (of
course) computers; but really the brain is

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.169
none of these things. It's its own thing.
In the upcoming movie Self/Less, a dying man

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:33.640
uses crazy cool technology to transfer his
consciousness into a younger man's body. One

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.910
would assume each brain has similar programming
for how to run a heart, manage an immune system

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.330
and so on -- so we just need the memory data
from the person we're downloading, but if

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.870
I wanted to download all the data from one
brain, and upload it into another brain…

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.510
would that even be possible? Stephen Hawking
thinks so, and futuruist Ray Kurzweil believes

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.420
we're only 40 years to away… So, what's
blocking us from starting our first brain

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.260
backups?

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.430
Firstly, we'd have to read from the source
brain, scientists will have to learn how we

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.780
store those memories. Neurons don't simply
store one bit of information like in a computer.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.290
Each neuron can create 1,000 connections with
those around them, and unlike machines aren't

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.740
only on or off -- they have other states too.
Luckily, humans are pretty obsessed with mind-reading.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.990
Researchers at the University of California
Berkeley scanned the brains of people while

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.810
they watched videos -- and using only the
brain scans, a computer was able to determine

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.970
what the brains were processing. Using an
fMRI scan to follow blood through the brain,

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.770
using three dimensional representations of
the scanned areas called voxels, the researchers

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.460
trained the computer to piece together what
the brain was looking at. Using tech like

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.830
this, scientists have scanned brains of players
of Counterstrike, and see when they want to

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.600
turn left or right, but if their character
is killed, emotional response overwhelms the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.190
scan. Emotions are far too complex to read…
yet.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.400
Next, we'll have to write to the new brain.
When WE do that, we're biochemically modifying

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.739
neurons and their connections to other neurons.
There are trillions of these synaptic connections

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.540
in each person's head. A study in Nature explored
exactly how this process works using mice

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.180
with cells that had been genetically modified
to activate when hit with laser light -- this

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.430
is called called optogenetics. With this method,
researchers were able to demonstrate how memories

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.239
are written, erased and reactivated, and then
able to "implant" a false memory into another

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.060
genetically modified mouse! It's REALLY incredible,
but we can't yet do this with any mouse off

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.939
the street… yet.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:41.269
So let's assume we get to a point where we
can read and write to brains; we need to copy

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.379
that information. But, the human brain isn't
a finite storage system like a hard drive;

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.730
there could be a lot of space in there. Estimates
vary from 2.5 petabytes -- about a million

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.069
gigabytes -- down to a few measly gigabytes.
If you wanted to copy 2.5 petabytes over say,

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.029
a USB 3.0 connection, it would have to run
continuously for more than 80 DAYS; and even

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:05.629
over Thunderbolt 3 it would take almost a
week!

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:12.499
The biggest issue in consciousness transfer,
is going to be mapping the brain accurately.

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:15.529
Computer scientists from giant companies,
major universities, and world governments

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:20.099
have been working on mapping and translating
the brain network to a computer network for

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.999
decades. But, thoughts don't live on a single
neuron, nor are they processed in a single

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:29.129
place, but rather as a patterned network of
brain cells picking up the information and

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.519
processing it. We're at the fundamental level
of brain mapping already, we've got a while

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:39.150
to go until we can map all the connections
and states of all our individual neurons in

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.949
real time, but just imagine where we'll be
with a few more decades behind us, considering

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.290
where we are already... Billions of dollars
are being spent on this, and according to

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.689
top minds in the field, it's only a matter
of time until we learn to emulate a brain

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.790
in a computer, and map a consciousness on
top of it.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.669
Based on what we know now, maybe we aren't
too far from a brain copying future... Self/Less

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:02.980
hits theaters on July 10th, and will star
Ben Kingsley and Ryan Reynolds. In this sci-fi

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.139
tale, an extremely wealthy man, dying from
cancer, undergoes a radical medical procedure

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.790
that transfers his consciousness into the
body of a healthy young man. But all is not

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.669
as it seems when he starts to uncover the
mystery of the body's origin and the organization

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.370
that will kill to protect its cause.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.570
If you could, would you extend your life with
a consciousness transfer?
