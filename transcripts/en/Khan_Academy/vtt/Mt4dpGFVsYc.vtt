00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.500
Before I actually show you the
mechanics of what the curl of a

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.370
vector field really is, let's
try to get a little

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.600
bit of intuition.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.110
So here I've drawn, I'm going
to just draw a two-dimensional

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.760
vector field.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.525
You can extrapolate to 3,
but when we're getting

00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:15.770
the intuition, it's
good to do it in 2.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.110
And so, let's see.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.290
I didn't even label
the x and y axis.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.720
This is x, this is y.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.300
So when y is relatively low,
our magnitude vector goes in

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.830
the x direction, when it
increases a little bit, it

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.380
gets a little bit longer.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.150
So as we can see, as our change
in the y-direction, as we go

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.200
in the y-direction, the
x-component of our vectors

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.020
get larger and larger.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.130
And maybe in the x-direction
they're constant, regardless

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.980
of your level of x,
the magnitude stays.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.230
So for given y, the magnitude
of your x-component vector

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.810
might stay the same.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.700
So I mean, this vector field
might look something like this.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.710
I'm just making up numbers.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.870
Maybe it's just, I don't
know, y squared i.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.860
So the magnitude of the
x-direction is just a

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.840
function of your y-value.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.810
And as your y-values get bigger
and bigger, the magnitude in

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.660
your x-direction will get
bigger and bigger, proportional

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.870
to the square of the magnitude
of the y direction.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.950
But for any given x, it's
always going to be the same.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.920
It's only dependent on y.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.100
So here, even if we make
x larger, we still get

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.750
the same magnitude.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.640
And remember, these are
just sample points

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.250
on our vector field.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.570
But anyway.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.000
That's enough of just getting
the intuition behind

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.580
that vector field.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.630
But let me ask you a question.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.850
If I were to, let's say that
this vector field shows the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.020
velocity of a fluid
at various points.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.610
And so you can view this, we're
looking down on a river, maybe.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.880
If I were to take a little twig
or something, and I were to

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.520
place it in this fluid, so let
me place the twig right here.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.520
Let me draw my twig.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.480
So let's say I place a twig,
it's a funny-looking twig,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.690
but that's good enough.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.920
Let's say I place a
twig right there.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.010
What's going to
happen to the twig?

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.230
Well, at this point on the
twig, the water's moving to the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.260
right, so it'll push this part
of the twig to the right.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.660
At the top of the twig, the
water is also moving to the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.720
right, maybe with a faster
velocity, but it's also going

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.570
to push the top of the
twig to the right.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.090
But the top of the twig is
going to be being pushed to

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.970
the right faster than the
bottom of the twig, right?

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.480
So what's going to happen?

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.190
The twig's going
to rotate, right?

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.680
After, I don't know, some
period of time, the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.950
twig's going to look
something like this.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.960
The bottom will move a little
bit to the right, but the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.520
top will move a lot
more to the right.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.810
Right?

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.650
And the whole thing would have
been shifted to the right.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.650
But it's going to
rotate a little bit.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.370
And maybe after a little bit
further, maybe it looks

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.940
something like this.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.880
So you can see that because the
vectors increasing in a

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.650
direction that is perpendicular
to our direction

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.790
of motion, right?

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.560
This fairly simple example,
all of the vectors point

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.960
in the x-direction.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.300
But the magnitude of the
vectors increase, they increase

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.160
perpendicular, they increase
in the y-dimension, right?

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.700
And when this happens, when the
flow is going in the same

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.700
direction, but it's going at a
different magnitude, you see

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.460
that any object in it
will rotate, right?

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.200
So let's think about that.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.010
So if the derivative, the
partial derivative, of this

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.490
vector field with respect to y
is increasing or decreasing, if

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.230
it's just changing, that means
as we increase in y, or as we

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.460
decrease in y, the magnitude of
the x-component of our vectors,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.860
right, the x-direction
of our vectors changes.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.230
And so if you have a different
speed for different levels of

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.250
y, as something moves in the
x-direction, it's going

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.520
to be rotated, right?

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.920
You could almost view it as if
there's a net torque on an

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.700
object that sits in
the water here.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.320
And the ultimate would be, let
me draw another vector field,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.560
the ultimate would be if
I had this situation.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.180
Let me draw another
vector field.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.850
If I had this situation, where
maybe down here it's like this,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.200
then maybe it's like this, and
then maybe it gets really

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.960
small, then maybe it switches
directions, up here, and then

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.570
the vector field
goes like this.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.080
So you could imagine up here
that's going to the left, with

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.150
a fairly large magnitude.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.440
So if you put a twig here, you
would definitely hopefully see

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.490
that the twig, not only will it
not be shifted to the right,

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.650
this side is going to be moved
to the left, this side is going

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.410
to be the right, it's
going to be rotated.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.150
And you'll see that there's
a net torque on the twig.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.950
So what's the intuition there?

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.810
All of a sudden, we care about
how much is the magnitude of a

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.505
vector changing, not in its
direction of motion, like in

00:04:56.505 --> 00:05:00.640
the divergence example, but we
care how much is the magnitude

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.040
of a vector changing as we go
perpendicular to its

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.570
direction of motion.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.520
So when we learned about
dot and cross product,

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.070
what did we learn?

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.480
We learned that the dot product
of 2 vectors tells you how much

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.820
2 vectors move together, and
the cross product tells you how

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.300
much the perpendicular, it's
kind of the multiplication

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.260
of the perpendicular
components of a vector.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.720
So this might give you a little
intuition of what is the curl.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.510
Because the curl essentially
measures what is the rotational

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.800
effect, or I guess you could
say, what is the curl of a

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.240
vector field at a given point?

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.710
And you can you
can visualize it.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.870
You put a twig there, what
would happen to the twig?

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.460
If the twig rotates and there's
some curl, if the magnitude

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.730
of the rotation is larger,
then the curl is larger.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.640
If it rotates in the other
direction, you'll have the

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.300
negative direction of curl.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.820
And so just like what we did
with torque, we now care

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.420
about the direction.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.435
Because we care whether it's
going counterclockwise or

00:05:56.435 --> 00:05:58.620
clockwise, so we're going to
end up with a vector

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.710
quantity, right?

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.270
So, and all of this should
hopefully start fitting

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.210
together at this point.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.430
We've been dealing
with this Dell

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.830
vector or this, you know, we
could call this abusive

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.550
notation, but it kind of is
intuitive, although it really

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.690
doesn't have any meaning when
I describe it like this.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.520
You can kind of write it as a
vector operator, and then it

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.140
has a little bit more meeting.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.800
But this Dell

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.000
operator, we use it
a bunch of times.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.190
You know, if the partial
derivative of something in the

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.180
i-direction, plus the partial
derivative, something with

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.080
respect to y in the
j-direction, plus the partial

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.270
derivative, well, this is if we
do it in three dimensions

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.460
with respect to z
in the k-direction.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.660
When we applied it to just a
scalar or vector field, you

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.670
know, like a three-dimensional
function, we just multiplied

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.430
this times that scalar
function, we got the gradient.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:07:00.890
When we took the dot product of
this with a vector field, we

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.710
got the divergence of
the vector field.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.090
And this should be a
little bit intuitive

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.110
to you, at this point.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.300
Because when we, you might want
to review our original videos

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.380
where we compared the dot
product to the cross product.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.830
Because the dot product
was, how much do two

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.840
vectors move together?

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:26.070
So when you're taking this Dell
operator and dotting it with a

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.070
vector field, you're saying,
how much is the vector

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.840
field changing, right?

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.200
All a derivative is, a partial
derivative or a normal

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.020
derivative, it's just
a rate of change.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.195
Partial derivative with respect
to x is rate of change

00:07:36.195 --> 00:07:37.440
in the x-direction.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.170
So all you're saying is, when
you're taking a dot product,

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:44.500
how much is my rate of
change increasing in my

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.890
direction of movement?

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.700
How much is my rate of change
in the y-direction increasing

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.755
in the y-direction?

00:07:49.755 --> 00:07:52.410
And so it makes sense that it
helps us with divergence.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.825
Because remember, if this is a
vector, and then as we increase

00:07:56.825 --> 00:08:00.480
this in the x-direction, the
vectors increase, we took a

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.280
little point, and we said, oh,
at this point we're going to

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.100
have more leaving than
entering, so we have a

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.840
positive divergence.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.000
But that makes sense, also,
because as you go in the

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.790
x-direction, the magnitudes
of the vectors increase.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.310
Anyway, I don't want to
confuse you too much.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.380
So now, the intuition, because
now we don't care about the

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.270
rate of change along with the
direction of the vector.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.420
We care about the rate of
change of the magnitudes of

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.560
the vectors perpendicular
the direction of the vector.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:34.460
So the curl, you might guess,
is equal to the cross product

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.620
of our Dell operator
and the vector field.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.210
And if that was where your
intuition led you, and that

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.780
is what your guess is,
you would be correct.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.950
That is the curl of
the vector field.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:56.490
And it is a measure of how much
is that field rotating, or

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.890
maybe if you imagine an object
in the field, how much is the

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.720
field causing something
to rotate because it's

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.220
exerting a net torque?

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.510
Because at different points
in the object, you have a

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:13.230
different magnitude of a
field in the same direction.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.410
Anyway, I don't want to
confuse you too much.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:15.910
Hopefully that example I
just showed you will make

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.700
a little bit of sense.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.530
Anyway, I realize I've
already pushed 9 minutes.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.970
In the next video, I'll
actually compute curl, and

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.840
maybe we'll try to draw
a couple more to hit

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.320
the intuition home.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.380
See you in the next video.
