Next hypothesis--tests.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You can measure how well-tested individual parts of your product are.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If a piece of code has a high testing coverage,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
this means that it would be well-tested.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The question is is code that is well-tested less buggy?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Pick your choice.
