00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.510
well it's like well we thought about it
for seven million years and you know we

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520
for seven million years and you know we
 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.920
for seven million years and you know we
got to the point where we could kind of

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930
got to the point where we could kind of
 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.870
got to the point where we could kind of
act it out but we didn't know what we

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880
act it out but we didn't know what we
 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.720
act it out but we didn't know what we
were doing but it was a merge it's like

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730

dream of the terror of the future is
another dream and and it comes out in

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440
another dream and and it comes out in
 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.620
another dream and and it comes out in
mythology and in fantasy and in drama

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630

there's minimal ways that you can set up

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200
there's minimal ways that you can set up
 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.740
there's minimal ways that you can set up
a society that will work and so one of

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750
a society that will work and so one of
 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.050
a society that will work and so one of
them is is that the society has to be

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060

set up so that your sacrifices will pay
 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.759
set up so that your sacrifices will pay

off or you won't work and then the
 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.340
off or you won't work and then the
society will die and so it has to make

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350
society will die and so it has to make
 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.530
society will die and so it has to make
promises people have to make promises to

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540
promises people have to make promises to
 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.720
promises people have to make promises to
one another that's what money is money

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.930
pay off in the future
that's what money is and so if the

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940
that's what money is and so if the
 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.390
that's what money is and so if the
society is stable you can store up your

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400
society is stable you can store up your
 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.770
society is stable you can store up your
work right now you can sacrifice your

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780
work right now you can sacrifice your

store up credit for the future and then
 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.220
store up credit for the future and then
you can make the future a better place

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230
you can make the future a better place
 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.410
you can make the future a better place
but society has to be stable enough to

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420
but society has to be stable enough to
 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.289
but society has to be stable enough to
allow for that hyperinflation will do

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299
allow for that hyperinflation will do

of the gang members shrinks rapidly
because they don't really

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.140
because they don't really
expect to be alive that much past 21 and

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150
