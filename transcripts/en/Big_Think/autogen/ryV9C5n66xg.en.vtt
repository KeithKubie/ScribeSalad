circle is a very symmetric object you

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559
circle is a very symmetric object you
 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.190

doesn't change and that's what makes it

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
doesn't change and that's what makes it
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.850
doesn't change and that's what makes it
symmetric in the intuitive sense you can

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
symmetric in the intuitive sense you can
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.219

which might have changed it but but
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.899
which might have changed it but but
although they transform each part of it

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
although they transform each part of it
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.780
although they transform each part of it
don't transform the thing as a whole so

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790
don't transform the thing as a whole so
 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.340
don't transform the thing as a whole so
that's what makes a circle a symmetric

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
that's what makes a circle a symmetric
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.310
that's what makes a circle a symmetric

it goes over into itself a rap if your
 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.789
it goes over into itself a rap if your
mote rotate around its center by 120

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799
mote rotate around its center by 120
 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.830
mote rotate around its center by 120
degrees it's the same equilateral

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
degrees it's the same equilateral
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.620
degrees it's the same equilateral
triangle whereas if you take some

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
triangle whereas if you take some
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.920
triangle whereas if you take some
lopsided triangle it'll never go back to

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930
lopsided triangle it'll never go back to
 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.569
lopsided triangle it'll never go back to
itself until you come all the way back

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
itself until you come all the way back
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.080

to a trivial transformation that doesn't

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090
to a trivial transformation that doesn't
 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.459
to a trivial transformation that doesn't
train that doesn't change anything

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
train that doesn't change anything
 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.360
train that doesn't change anything
so change so a triangle has less

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
so change so a triangle has less
 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.090
so change so a triangle has less
symmetry than a circle according to

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100
symmetry than a circle according to
 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.760
symmetry than a circle according to
this concept but more but some symmetry

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770
this concept but more but some symmetry
 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.890
this concept but more but some symmetry
and so you start to see how this concept

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900
and so you start to see how this concept
 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.860
and so you start to see how this concept
have changed without change matches the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870
have changed without change matches the
 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.070
have changed without change matches the
intuitive notion of symmetry the great

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080
intuitive notion of symmetry the great
 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.250
intuitive notion of symmetry the great
advantage of that definition is that you

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260
advantage of that definition is that you
 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.820
advantage of that definition is that you
can apply it in very broad context not

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830
can apply it in very broad context not
 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.410
can apply it in very broad context not
only to describing the symmetry of

only to describing the symmetry of
 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.710
only to describing the symmetry of
objects but to describing the symmetry

of physical laws or the symmetry of
 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.290
of physical laws or the symmetry of
equations so for instance the theory of

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300
equations so for instance the theory of
 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.170
equations so for instance the theory of
relativity is a statement of symmetry

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180
relativity is a statement of symmetry
 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.730
relativity is a statement of symmetry
that if you change the way the world

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740
that if you change the way the world
 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.250
that if you change the way the world
looks by moving past it at a constant

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260
looks by moving past it at a constant
 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.490
looks by moving past it at a constant
velocity you change the appearance of

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500
velocity you change the appearance of
 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.770
velocity you change the appearance of
everything that's happening but the

everything that's happening but the
 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.640
everything that's happening but the
underlying laws are still valid that's

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650
underlying laws are still valid that's
 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.230
underlying laws are still valid that's
the assumption of the theory of

the assumption of the theory of
 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.270
the assumption of the theory of
relativity that drives it and makes it

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280
relativity that drives it and makes it
 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.770
relativity that drives it and makes it
powerful the idea that the laws of

powerful the idea that the laws of
 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.690
powerful the idea that the laws of
physics don't change as a function of

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700
physics don't change as a function of
 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.070
physics don't change as a function of
time is also a symmetry because it means

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080
time is also a symmetry because it means
 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.490
time is also a symmetry because it means
you can change when you start your

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500
you can change when you start your
 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.620
you can change when you start your
clocks and although the time stamps

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630
clocks and although the time stamps
 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.690
clocks and although the time stamps
you'll give to each event look different

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700
you'll give to each event look different
 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.150
you'll give to each event look different
the underlying equations will be the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160
the underlying equations will be the
 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.190
the underlying equations will be the
same that's the way of staying that the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200
same that's the way of staying that the
 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.670
same that's the way of staying that the
laws of physics don't change and

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680
laws of physics don't change and
 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.810
laws of physics don't change and
similarly the way that the the fact that

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820
similarly the way that the the fact that
 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.060
similarly the way that the the fact that
different the same physical laws apply

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070
different the same physical laws apply
 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.640
different the same physical laws apply
at different places as a symmetry

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650
at different places as a symmetry
 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.500
at different places as a symmetry
because you can change your position

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510
because you can change your position
 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.160
because you can change your position
without changing the way the laws work

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170
without changing the way the laws work
 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.270
without changing the way the laws work
so symmetry is a very powerful

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280
so symmetry is a very powerful
 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.250
so symmetry is a very powerful

many ways now the kind of symmetry that

leads to quantum chromodynamics
or general relativity or quantum

electrodynamics is mathematically

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200
electrodynamics is mathematically
 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.140
electrodynamics is mathematically
considerably more complex but it's the

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150
considerably more complex but it's the
 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.820
considerably more complex but it's the
same idea so there are transformations

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830
same idea so there are transformations
 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.880
same idea so there are transformations
of the equations that change the

of the equations that change the
 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.530
of the equations that change the
different terms in them so they might

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540
different terms in them so they might
 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.810
different terms in them so they might
change an electric field into a magnetic

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820
change an electric field into a magnetic
 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.910
change an electric field into a magnetic
field or a magnetic field into a

that changed the way the equations look
 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.640
that changed the way the equations look
but don't change their consequences so

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650
but don't change their consequences so
 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.980
but don't change their consequences so
the equations look quite different some

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990
the equations look quite different some
 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.510
the equations look quite different some
parts have moved over to the left and

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520
parts have moved over to the left and
 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.980
parts have moved over to the left and
some parts have moved over to the right

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990
some parts have moved over to the right
 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.510
some parts have moved over to the right
and some things have been multiplied in

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520
and some things have been multiplied in
 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.850
and some things have been multiplied in
funny ways but their consequences that

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860
funny ways but their consequences that
 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.430
funny ways but their consequences that

kind of equations that are like the
circles among equations are ones that

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280
circles among equations are ones that
 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.149
circles among equations are ones that
have this symmetry property and those

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159
have this symmetry property and those
 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.520
have this symmetry property and those
are the kinds of equations that turn out

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530
are the kinds of equations that turn out
 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.610
are the kinds of equations that turn out
to be the ones that are appear most

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620
to be the ones that are appear most
 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.499
to be the ones that are appear most
prominently in our fundamental

extraordinary thing but that's what
 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.100
extraordinary thing but that's what
that's not only true but that's how we

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110
that's not only true but that's how we
 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.639
that's not only true but that's how we
got to the equations in the first place
