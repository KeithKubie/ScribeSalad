00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.070
Hi.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.700
I'm Brian.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.730
We're going to be going over
problem number 13 of the fall

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.030
2009 final exam.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.650
I like to think of the theme of
this problem as polymers.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.130
So that's the overarching
concept.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.130
But I'm going to give you some
things I think are important

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.240
to review and to know before
actually meaningfully

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.980
attempting this problem.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.370
So there's three things that I
that I sort of thought were

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.080
very important.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.000
The first one is polymerization
processes.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.730
So we learned in class and in
the book as well that there's

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.120
two ways that we've covered that
you can create a polymer.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.610
And that is through either
addition polymerization or

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.520
condensation polymerization.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.150
And I'll talk about that
more in a second.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.770
The second thing you want to
know is basically molecular

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.930
weight and how it applies
to polymers.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.150
And you want to know about
elastomers for this problem.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.660
If you don't know about
elastomers then you'll have

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.370
trouble with the last
part of the problem.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.000
So that's kind of what
I would review.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.400
And then once you've got that
under your belt give the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.990
problem a try.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.060
So we're going to go
and we're going to

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.310
start the problem now.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.850
We're given in the problem the
6-aminohexanoic acid, which

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.560
I've drawn here.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.170
And we're also given at the
beginning of the problem the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.300
structure of nylon 6.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.130
This is the actual reaction
that's used to create nylon.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.300
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to show you--

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.990
or ask the question of how
do we create nylon from

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.850
6-aminohexanoic acid.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.350
And that's actually going to
answer part A and part B to

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.350
this problem.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.410
So to create a polymer--

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.060
in this case we're talking about
the polymer nylon 6--

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.940
you actually have to add
together many mers.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.900
So merge is the term we used
to denote the single unit

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.380
which is repeated n times
to create the poly mer--

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.410
polymer.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.180
So in this case the mer, the
individual unit of nylon 6, is

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.650
6-aminohexanoic acid.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.590
And that's this.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.920
That's the same thing
right there.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.990
So we're going to add these
together and we're going to

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.720
start creating our long
chain of nylon 6.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.440
Remember, nylon 6 a polymer is
a really, really long chain.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.040
Think of it as spaghetti,
very long spaghetti.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.620
It isn't just two molecules
that react.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.680
So let's just start somewhere.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.750
It's got to begin somewhere.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.870
You have to have two molecules
at some point in the beginning

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.590
reacting with each other.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.460
So let's look at our
two molecules of

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.970
6-aminohexanoic acid--

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.340
I have to keep looking back
at how to say that--

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.980
so let's take a look and we have
to think about now our

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.260
two possible processes or routes
towards polymerization.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.860
There's addition and there's
condensation.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.230
Now addition, as you probably
read and heard, requires there

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.550
to be a double bond present
between two carbon atoms. The

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.160
reason for this is because
usually have a free radical

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.830
coming in, which will
then initiate.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.950
That's why oftentimes the free
radical molecule or free

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.690
radical provider is called
the initiator.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.650
You need an initiator to come
in to break that double bond

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.330
and then create another
free radical.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.260
Which then lets the process
continue along in

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.810
a chain like that.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.890
If we look at our molecule here,
we don't actually have

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.280
any double bonds between two
carbon atoms. We have a double

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.630
bond with an oxygen but that's
not sufficient for an

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.300
addition-type reaction.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.720
For a condensation reaction,
what that basically implies is

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.840
two mer units, or two things
coming together to react and

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.630
they give off a byproduct.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.390
So that's how I remember
condensation, very often the

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.660
byproduct is water.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.200
You can have other byproducts,
like HCl or any other sort of

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.160
small molecules can
be given off.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.260
But most times what we'll see
in 3091 will be water given

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.620
off in condensation, so it's
sort of intuitive to call it

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.990
condensation.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.570
In this problem, if we look at
this, we have a molecule that

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.090
has the Hs on one side and has
Os on the other side, we can

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.830
actually almost see this
immediately as being a

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.170
condensation reaction.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.010
What's going to happen is we're
going to have this O

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.360
reacting with the positive
end of this

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.020
molecule, which has Hs.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.450
And we're going to have an H2O
liberated and given off.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.940
We're going to have the
new molecule formed.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.760
Let me draw the molecule
for you.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.010
Let me write it out.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.490
So we've just begun forming
our polymer and this is a

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.120
polymer which has an n of 2.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.180
It has 2 mer units
building it.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.350
Notice I've kept
the ends here.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.090
The positive and the
negative here.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.030
In reality what's going to
happen is we have a big vat of

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.940
this 6-aminohexanoic
acid and they're

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.940
going to keep reacting.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.960
So we might have another one of
these molecules float over

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.790
and react with this O.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.800
Or conversely, we could have
another one of these molecules

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.150
come over and react
with the H.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.960
So this thing is going
to keep building.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.410
And the way these polymerization
processes begin

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.470
is the control of some parameter
of the system.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.570
It could be temperature,
pressure you can add something

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.990
in to sort of initiate it.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.000
But that's how this
is going to start.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.800
So we've actually sort of
answered part a and b.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.890
We've come to the conclusion
that this is obviously a

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.340
condensation reaction.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.965
Because we're going
to give off--

00:05:51.965 --> 00:05:56.570
I left that out there, see
if you guys caught it--

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.460
H2O.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.070
So we're losing this O and
two of these Hs and

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.320
we're forming water.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.880
And that's the byproduct.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.080
And a byproduct immediately
should tell you we've got

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.390
condensation going on.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.720
So condensation polymerization,
part A.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.160
Part B, we've actually already
done to sort of logic out the

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.410
answer to part A.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.420
This is the answer to part B.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.660
Part B is just the reaction.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.150
I'll read it very
specifically.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.380
Write the reaction that converts
two molecules of

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.800
6-aminohexanoic acid into
a dimer of nylon 6.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.350
So we have two molecules
forming the dimer.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.500
You are going to have trimer,
and it goes on and on.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.420
The most common mistake on this
problem was to give us

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.530
the full repeating units.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.400
Let me just show you what
that would look like.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.290
And then we'll move on
with the problem.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.000
So the most common mistake on
this problem was to not have

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.990
these end units.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.070
And instead say, oh it's created
this huge, long chain.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.720
So I'm going to write
it as follows.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.940
And this is the symbol to
imply that it repeats.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.190
Likewise over here.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.950
So people would give us this.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.430
And that's not correct.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.070
And the reason that's a problem
is because not only do

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.690
you lose points on this
part, you also lose

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.880
points on the next part.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.180
So part C is now asking us to
calculate the molecular weight

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.190
of a molecule given
a certain n.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.160
n is the degree of
polymerization.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.140
So in this case, n equals
2, we've got a dimer.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.680
In part C, we have n equals--

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.230
surprisingly--

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:38.760
3,091 You'll see that's a
recurring theme in this class.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.420
So we have n equals 3,091 And
the question is, how do we

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.890
approach the molecular
weight problem?

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:48.220
Well we're told that we have
3,091 one of these mer units

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.710
making up this polymer chain.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:51.950
So let me just write
this down.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.950
We're going to form
an equation.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.640
If we take the mass of the full
chain and divide it by

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.790
the mass of a single mer unit
we should be able to extract

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.280
the number of units
in the chain.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.420
So let me write that
out for you.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.820
So the total molecular weight
of the molecule, divided by

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.580
the weight of a particular
mer unit.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.755
OK so we're going to
put that as mer.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.710
And so this is easy.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.750
Let's first identify what
our mer unit is.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.340
And this is why it was easy get

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.390
tripped up on this problem.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.530
Because if you made a mistake
on the part B, you have

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.950
trouble on part C.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.710
What is our mer unit?

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.960
So in our mer unit, what we're
talking about is a chain which

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:40.360
has 3,091 of these linked
pieces here.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.580
So let's look at this.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.460
What do we have?

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.490
Here's our mer unit.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.740
Let me circle it.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:51.700
We have 6 carbons.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.510
We have 11 hydrogens,
1 nitrogen and 1

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.650
oxygen in this mer unit.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.860
We're not going to take the
full, complete end unit.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.970
We're not counting this O.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.990
We're not counting those 2 Hs.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.630
We're dropping off 18 grams
per reaction into water.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.600
So this is our mere unit.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.880
Let's calculate the mass
of our mer unit.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.472
So it's going to be--

00:09:14.472 --> 00:09:17.890
let me write this here--

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.260
we're looking for molecular
weight.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.220
We're going to divide that by
the mass of the mer unit.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.200
Let me just write out the full
line of what it would be.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.830
Approximately 6 times
12 plus 11 times 1.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.610
So this is 6 carbons, times
the mass of carbon.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.890
11 hydrogens times the
mass of hydrogen.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.450
We're going to have 1 oxygen
times the mass of oxygen.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.660
And we're going to have
the nitrogen as well.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.940
So let me add that down here.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.760
1 nitrogen times the
mass of nitrogen.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.280
I rounded.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:47.730
That's OK.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.590
As long as you get
the idea right.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.000
So now we can easily
just solve for

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.290
the molecular weight.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.210
And we'll find that molecular
weight in this problem will be

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:05.270
equal to 3.5 times 10 to the
fifth grams per mole.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.870
There's another way to do
this problem, actually.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.680
And what you can do is you
can calculate n times

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.860
the number of this--

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.170
this particular molecule--

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:24.980
and you can subtract
off 3,090 orders.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.500
18 grams. 3,090 times
eighteen.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.630
You subtract that off.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.940
Think about a little bit why
it's 3,090 and not 3,091.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.160
So that's just maybe a
brain teaser for you.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.320
That is the answer to part C.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.730
And now part D asks us if we're
able to convert this

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:41.920
into an elastomer.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.010
So this is where it's really
required that you understand

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.590
what an elastomer is and what
that implies and what the

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.820
structure looks like.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.640
So an elastomer--

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.240
and I sort of paraphrased this
from the book and added my own

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.260
thing to it-- is basically a
randomly oriented amorphous

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.960
polymer with some cross-linking
such that you

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.960
have the ability to move the
chains but not slide them

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.600
completely over each other.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.740
So in order to have an elastomer
you must have

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.680
cross-linking.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.970
In order to have cross-linking,

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.090
what must you have?

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.020
Well from lecture and from
the book we know that to

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.330
cross-link you must have double
bonds in your carbons.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.940
So you must have 2 carbons--

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.020
going back over here--

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.550
which are double-bonded
together.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.830
And why is that?

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.200
Because what happens is those
double bonds will be broken by

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.120
some initiator element-- many
times we'll have sulfur--

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.920
will come in, break the double
bond and then you'll have

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.910
links forming between things.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.250
So let me actually give you
real-life example of this so

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.070
you can see what I'm
talking about.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.940
We're going to show disulfide
bridges bounding and creating

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.455
cross-links in a molecule.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.310
Something we're very familiar
with is rubber.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.100
And we're also very familiar
with car tires.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.530
The big difference between
those two things is that

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.470
rubber has vulcanized Which
means we're actually putting

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.520
sulphur into it to create a
different type of polymer.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.080
We're looking at a cross-linked,
much stronger

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.060
rubber which we use
on our car tires.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.550
So polyisoprene looks
something like this.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.520
You should be familiar with
this notation by now.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:05.100
We have this denotes
it repeats.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.290
We have our double
bonds, we have

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:07.620
our carbons and hydrogens.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.770
This is polyisoprene.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.250
And this is what we're
going to add sulphur

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.430
to vulcanize rubber.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.750
We're going to create
vulcanized rubber.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:19.300
sulphur generally actually
looks, it's a ring of 8

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:25.740
sulphur atoms. We'll then
add it to rubber,

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.230
maybe heat it up mixed.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.910
And you'll make what you're
used to on car tires.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.040
So what's actually happening
here is that you can see we

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.930
have this double bond
between carbons.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.970
The sulphur's going to come in,
it's going to react with

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:42.480
this double bond, and is
actually going to pull it off.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.430
And it might form a
chain like that.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.480
And then this sulfur will then
connect to another one of

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.820
these polyisoprene molecules
that was

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.390
originally double bonded.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.630
And I'm not going to draw
the rest of it out.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.900
And it's going to react, kill
this double bond, and it's

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.870
going to connect it.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.100
So basically what's happened
in this process of forming

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.790
sulfide bridges is you've got
this polymer, polyisoprene,

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.260
connecting to this polymer,
polyisoprene, and you have

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.720
cross-linking going on.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.910
And that's what we would need
to have in our case for the

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:18.185
nylon 6 in order to get an
elastomer, And because nylon

00:14:18.185 --> 00:14:21.840
6, because our mer unit,
6-aminohexanoic acid doesn't

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.750
have double bonds, we
can't break them.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.850
We can't network.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.380
We can't cross-link.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.460
And therefore we can't
make an elastomer.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.010
So the answer to
this problem--

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.440
in a very long-winded manner--

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.320
is no.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.060
You cannot create an elastomer
given that mer unit.
