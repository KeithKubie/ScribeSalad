00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:02.612
- [Voiceover] Alright, so
now I'm gonna do the analysis

00:00:02.612 --> 00:00:05.278
of this op-amp configuration again,

00:00:05.278 --> 00:00:09.445
and I'm gonna do it using
the idea of virtual ground.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.744
And the idea of a virtual ground actually,

00:00:17.744 --> 00:00:22.442
it makes really short work of
analyzing a circuit like this.

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:24.036
To review the virtual ground idea,

00:00:24.036 --> 00:00:26.679
it says if this voltage here, V out,

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.131
is in a reasonable range
between the power supplies

00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:33.364
of its op-amp, and remember
the power supplies are

00:00:33.364 --> 00:00:36.173
not shown here but they're
connected up to the op-amp,

00:00:36.173 --> 00:00:39.389
so this is a number that's
sort of like one hand of volts,

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:43.441
or two hands of volts,
between zero and plus or minus

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:45.343
10 volts, something like that.

00:00:45.343 --> 00:00:49.900
And the gain of this op-amp
is huge, it's just gigantic.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.843
It's up in the 100s of
thousands or millions.

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:56.600
And so, whenever there's a
normal, finite size voltage here,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.001
it means the voltage here is about zero,

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.171
it's very close to zero,

00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:02.936
it's down in the very small microvolts.

00:01:02.936 --> 00:01:05.389
And, the idea of a virtual ground,

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:08.952
says that if this node
here is at zero volts,

00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:11.724
which we've drawn it grounded,
so it's at zero volts,

00:01:11.724 --> 00:01:14.062
that means that this
minus terminal is gonna be

00:01:14.062 --> 00:01:17.053
also held at zero volts,
very close to zero volts.

00:01:17.053 --> 00:01:19.292
And that makes this virtually a ground,

00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:20.959
or a virtual ground.

00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:25.129
Another way to write this
is to say that the V plus

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:28.568
is approximately equal to V minus.

00:01:28.568 --> 00:01:31.461
Now, my professor who taught me this,

00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:33.624
had a little symbol for
it, what he did was he

00:01:33.624 --> 00:01:37.276
drew it like this, so you
can sketch that on your

00:01:37.276 --> 00:01:39.370
schematics, just a little symbol there,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.122
and that symbol will help
remind you that those two nodes

00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:44.122
are at the same voltage.

00:01:45.512 --> 00:01:48.242
Okay, so let's do the analysis again,

00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:51.242
we had, this was R1, and this is R2,

00:01:52.114 --> 00:01:55.864
and we have a current
flowing here, called i.

00:01:57.088 --> 00:01:58.756
And we can write an expression for i,

00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:01.256
so the voltage on this side...

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.410
The voltage on this side
of the resistor is V in,

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.389
and the voltage on this
side of the resistor is,

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:10.139
it's zero volts, it's zero volts,

00:02:11.858 --> 00:02:14.071
because we have a virtual ground here,

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:15.914
so we know the voltage on both sides.

00:02:15.914 --> 00:02:20.081
So I can say right away, i
equals the voltage difference

00:02:20.952 --> 00:02:24.702
V in minus zero, so just
V in, divided by R1.

00:02:28.702 --> 00:02:31.051
So we have an expression for i.

00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:35.201
Now, as you remember, the thing
we also know about op-amps

00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:38.571
is that this current is zero here,

00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:41.840
there's no current going into
the input of an ideal op-amp.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.682
A real op-amp there'll be a
really tiny current there.

00:02:44.682 --> 00:02:48.329
For our purposes right now
we can treat this as zero

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.667
current going in here,

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:51.008
so what does that mean?

00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:53.841
That means that i goes through R2.

00:02:56.753 --> 00:02:59.429
So let's write an expression
for i going through R2,

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.562
and we need to know the
voltage on each side of R2,

00:03:02.562 --> 00:03:06.145
well this side, this
is V naught, or V out.

00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:10.421
This side is V out, and this side, again,

00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:11.981
we get to use the zero,

00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:16.064
so i through R2 equals,
let's get the sign right,

00:03:18.943 --> 00:03:20.275
so the current's going in this way,

00:03:20.275 --> 00:03:23.449
so this is the positive, this
is the relatively positive

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.571
side and this is the negative side,

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:28.904
so i is zero minus V out, divided by R2.

00:03:37.655 --> 00:03:40.977
Now, let's set these two
currents equal to each other,

00:03:40.977 --> 00:03:45.144
so that means that V in over
R1 equals minus V out over R2,

00:03:50.131 --> 00:03:52.874
and what we want is an expression
that tells us what V out

00:03:52.874 --> 00:03:56.874
is in terms of V in, so
V out equals V in times,

00:04:03.206 --> 00:04:07.289
let's see, R2 goes on top,
R1 goes on the bottom,

00:04:10.213 --> 00:04:12.296
and there's a minus sign.

00:04:14.113 --> 00:04:18.162
And we did it, and that's
the expression for V out

00:04:18.162 --> 00:04:20.803
in terms of V in, for the
inverting op-amp configuration.

00:04:20.803 --> 00:04:23.219
Now, by using the virtual ground idea,

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:24.842
the analysis became really simple,

00:04:24.842 --> 00:04:28.036
it's basically one two three
steps to get to the answer.

00:04:28.036 --> 00:04:30.477
Compare that to the algebra
that we did in the previous

00:04:30.477 --> 00:04:34.843
video when we did this
from first principles.

00:04:34.843 --> 00:04:38.506
So that's an example of
applying the virtual ground idea

00:04:38.506 --> 00:04:40.923
to analyze an op-amp circuit.

00:04:42.947 --> 00:04:45.280
I'll do one more real quick.

00:04:49.794 --> 00:04:52.528
So here's a different
op-amp configuration,

00:04:52.528 --> 00:04:54.206
we haven't seen this one before.

00:04:54.206 --> 00:04:57.428
First thing to notice,
first thing to notice is

00:04:57.428 --> 00:04:59.305
now plus is on top.

00:04:59.305 --> 00:05:01.359
Always take a peek at your
op-amp to see which terminal

00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:02.617
is on top.

00:05:02.617 --> 00:05:06.450
We have V in here, as
usual, and here's V out,

00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:11.636
and again, what we wanna
do is find out what's V out

00:05:11.636 --> 00:05:13.053
in terms of V in.

00:05:14.374 --> 00:05:17.705
Now this circuit has no resistors in it,

00:05:17.705 --> 00:05:21.014
okay, that's alright, we'll
figure out what's going on here.

00:05:21.014 --> 00:05:24.078
Okay, let's apply the
idea of a virtual ground,

00:05:24.078 --> 00:05:27.509
so I'm gonna make my little
virtual ground symbol here,

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.640
like that, that reminds me
that these two terminals

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.737
are the same voltage if
we're doing the right thing,

00:05:32.737 --> 00:05:35.570
so let's figure out what V out is.

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:39.922
V out equals this terminal
here, and this one

00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:42.754
is pretty much equal to this one,

00:05:42.754 --> 00:05:44.092
and what's this one?

00:05:44.092 --> 00:05:46.298
This is V out, sorry V in.

00:05:46.298 --> 00:05:47.131
So, boom.

00:05:52.566 --> 00:05:56.825
We just did it, in one
step, that's the answer.

00:05:56.825 --> 00:06:00.158
This configuration is called the buffer.

00:06:01.271 --> 00:06:04.604
Or it's also called a unity-gain buffer.

00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:18.033
This is just a long way
to say the gain is one.

00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:20.176
So that's an example
of a unity-gain buffer,

00:06:20.176 --> 00:06:24.453
and we use the virtual
ground idea to analyze it

00:06:24.453 --> 00:06:25.953
almost instantly.
