The topic for today is Acme, which is an architectural description language.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.090
As awareness of the importance of architecture has grown, so

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.000
too have the tools available for working with them. Examples include tools for

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.700
drawing, simulation, analyzing, reverse engineering and reporting on software

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.210
architectures. A necessary step for tool interaction is a standard way for

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.150
representing software architectures, that is for an architectural description

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.290
language or ADL. In this less we will look at one particular ADL called Acme.
