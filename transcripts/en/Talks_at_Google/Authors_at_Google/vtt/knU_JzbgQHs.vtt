00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.300
LAURA ESTHER WOLFSON:
Well, thank you very much,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.920
everybody, for coming.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.250
It's a tremendous honor
to be here at Google.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.780
I'm really in awe of the
speakers who have preceded me

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.040
on this podium.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.840
There are so many
writers and thinkers

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.200
and men and women of
action who have been

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.660
part of the Google Talk series.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.690
Most of them have presented some
very specific area of knowledge

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.470
or even wisdom, or
they've talked about how

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.150
to do something in particular.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.040
As a writer, what I have to
offer is story, and language,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.270
and that's it.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.400
There's not going
to be a take away

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.830
because art is the marriage
of content and form.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.360
And form cannot be
retold or summarized.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.980
So I'm going to read
to you from my book

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.450
"For Single Mothers Working
as Train Conductors," which

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.520
some readers and critics
have described as an essay

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.900
collection.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.690
Some have said it's
a book-length essay.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.160
Some call it a memoir.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.790
That's my publisher because they
say that essay collection is

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.280
the marketing kiss of death.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.290
Some call it a story
collection, but it really

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.290
is an essay collection.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.120
But whatever you
call it, it takes up

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.170
a grab bag of subjects that
are obsessions for me--

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.190
translation, untranslatability.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.050
I've actually forged a
new path in essay writing.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.620
There are a lot of
essays about translation,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.460
but I am the first
writer I know who

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.160
writes about not translating.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.520
I realized after
this book came out

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.620
that it has two
essays in it that

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.850
are about books that I decided
not to translate and why.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.790
And I haven't-- I have
another one in mind.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.380
And I've been told that when
you write from your own life,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.120
you will only ever
write one book.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.480
This was something that a
writing teacher thundered at me

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.010
when I was young,
and I was turning

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.170
in a story that was
purported to be fiction

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.850
but clearly it was not.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.550
But I think I found the
solution because if you write

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.770
about books you
have not translated,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.570
you will never run
out of material.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.380
So the obsessions that I take
up in this book-- translation,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.520
untranslatability, Russian,
French, and Yiddish culture,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.319
literature, and language.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.110
I worked with French
and Russian at the UN.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.560
I did not work with
Yiddish at the UN.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.340
Other obsessions include
Judaism, marriage and divorce,

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.100
and chronic illness.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.280
I'm going to tell
you this story, which

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.860
is one section of "For Single
Mothers Working as Train

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.240
Conductors," which is a highly
subjective even quirky account

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.110
of my experiences being
hired as a new staff

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.180
employee at the United Nations.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.080
This piece takes up some
other subjects as well.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.060
But they're all subsumed under
the heading of "The Resistance

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.010
and Grief That We Human Beings
Display When We're Unwillingly

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.220
Going Through Life Transitions."

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.960
And in this case,
it's the transition

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.200
from a high-flying
international career

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.050
as a diplomatic and
conference interpreter

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.750
of Russian and English to a desk
job requiring minimal knowledge

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.050
of a few languages
before I transition

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.910
into a job as a
translator working

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.730
with documents in Russian,
French, and Spanish.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.310
Another transition it
describes is the transition

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.160
from the freedom
of self-employment

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.790
to being a tiny cog in
an immense bureaucracy.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.940
And both of those
transitions were

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.400
occasioned by a
different transition,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.620
which was the transition from
health to chronic illness.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.860
Now this is a worm's
eye view of what

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.470
it's like to work at
the United Nations,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.950
and it's not terribly favorable.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.470
So I'll give you some
background, some context,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.130
but before I get to
that, I want to say

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.440
that there is a kind of open
secret about my book, which

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.340
I'll share with you.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.420
It's something that
authors are always

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.060
enjoined not to say about their
work, but I'm a debut author.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.490
I haven't mastered the
protocols and the etiquette,

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.170
so I can say whatever I want now
until my second book comes out,

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.900
which I don't think
will be anytime soon.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.820
This one took over a decade.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.380
And that open secret is that
my book is autobiographical.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.870
I don't know why this
is often associated

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.180
with shame for writers, and
many writers will do almost--

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.120
they will stand on their
head to avoid admitting this

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.530
even if it's true.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.710
The pedigree of autobiographical
writing is superb.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.140
Everything from Augustine's
"Confessions," "Lord,

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.200
make me chaste but not
yet," to "The Little

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.040
House on the Prairie," to
"Remembrance of Things Past,"

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.630
which you'll hear more
about in a moment.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.960
These are some of
my favorite books.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.820
But I cannot hide the fact that
my work is autobiographical.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.570
It's transparently clear.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.880
I live on the Upper
West Side of Manhattan.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.540
My narrator lives on the
Upper West Side of Manhattan.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.290
I worked as an interpreter and
translator of Russian, French,

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.900
and Spanish, and
my narrator worked

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.165
as an interpreter and
translator of Russian, French,

00:05:53.165 --> 00:05:54.710
and Spanish.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.580
I have a chronic
degenerative lung disease.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.490
My narrator has a chronic--
well, you get the idea.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.620
But even though it's won a
prize for literary nonfiction,

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.580
this book and my
writing in general

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.850
embraces subjectivity,
memory lapses, hearsay,

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.910
and speculation, and
as such it should not--

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.060
it cannot and should
not be fact checked.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.930
Its purpose is to tell a
story, not to say here's

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:30.580
what happened.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.425
I would compare it to a
re-touched photograph.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.150
So getting back to
the United Nations,

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.280
I said I wanted to give
you some context because

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.300
of the unfavorable impression
that my reading may give you.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.100
I believe in the United Nations.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.870
I believe in its mission.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.510
I believe in multilateralism.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:02.870
But many of my UN coworkers
and I have a sneaking sympathy

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.210
for that famous remark
by John Bolton, who

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.990
was George W. Bush's ambassador
to the United Nations

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.682
when he said that if the top 10
stories of the United Nations

00:07:13.682 --> 00:07:15.265
secretariat should
suddenly disappear,

00:07:15.265 --> 00:07:17.320
nobody would miss them.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.700
And our sympathy for
this remark has nothing

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.430
to do with our politics.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.470
You would have to search
high and low to find

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.430
a staffer at the UN who
supported George W. Bush, let

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.350
alone Trump.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.500
It has more to do with the
way the organization is

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.070
run sometimes.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.430
The UN is in desperate
need of reform.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.720
That reform will probably
never take place.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.600
But it is nonetheless a really
necessary and indispensable

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.420
organization.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.970
And one of the problems is
that because its ideals are

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.970
so lofty, when it
inevitably fails,

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.480
that failure seems even
greater than it is.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.730
But to get back to
the top 10 stories

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.150
of the secretariat
building, I think

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.060
one of the reasons my
colleagues and I would not

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.010
be sorry if it
disappeared is because it

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.930
houses among many other things
the human resources department.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.780
And to get hired at the
UN, which in my case

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.230
took several years, you have
to jump through so many hoops

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.400
and go through a
ridiculous gauntlet

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.714
to prove your qualifications.

00:08:27.714 --> 00:08:30.380
I actually had to come in with a
rolling suitcase that contained

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.720
all of the books I had
translated so they could

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.390
estimate how many
words I had translated

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.480
during my previous decade
and a half as a translator.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.020
And this kind of thing causes
people to start their work

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.660
at the UN already with an
enormous chip on their shoulder

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.876
toward their employer.

00:08:46.876 --> 00:08:49.250
There are some good things at
the-- in the top 10 stories

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.470
of the UN.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:56.060
There is a restroom that has
a stunning view of Midtown

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.080
Manhattan for women
only, although I'm

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.080
told that it's been used as
a viewing post to look down

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.220
on the roofs of lower
buildings nearby when

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.935
couples are trysting and they're
unaware that they're visible.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.900
It also has a locked room
on the top floor reachable

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.630
only by a creaky,
twisting staircase

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:28.670
that contains nothing else
but a ping pong table.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:33.590
And this is one flight up from
the Secretary General's office.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.280
The ping pong table room is a
place where diplomats go late

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.940
at night when they're locked--

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.920
deadlocked I should
say-- in talks.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.020
They bang the little ball
around to blow off steam

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.040
before they go back to the
negotiation table, one hopes,

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.840
to achieve better results.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.000
So the UN does everything
it can to reduce

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.150
international tensions.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:02.690
And in that connection, I do
think that the United Nations

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.430
is important and indispensable.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.230
It's the only place in the world
where all 193 countries can

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.240
come together to
discuss everything that

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:15.070
needs to be discussed, from
sexual violence in conflict

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:20.080
to food insecurity to border
control, counter-terrorism,

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.750
how to stop female
genital mutilation,

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:27.950
and the human rights of women,
ethnic and racial minorities,

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:33.880
people with disabilities,
and children.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.590
I don't agree with
those people who

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.020
say we should turn
our backs on the UN

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.950
and instead found an institution
that's for democracies only.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.890
I think that would be
very, very problematic.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:47.290
I think that the
non-democracies are precisely

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.800
the countries that need
to be kept in the loop

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.060
and in the discussion.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.850
Furthermore, I'm not sure
who would decide which

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.280
countries are democracies.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.090
Is the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea a democracy?

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.310
Some people obviously think so.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.980
The Democratic
Republic of Congo,

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:10.240
also known as the
International Capital of Rape?

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.480
And then there are countries
whose democratic credentials

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.970
have been burnished
for centuries

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.980
that seem to be veering
toward other forms of rule.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:25.720
And there are democracies that
become authoritarian, and then

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.260
one hopes return to democracy.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
Are they going to join this
hypothetical organization

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.020
then be expelled and then
re-apply for admission

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:39.130
when they return to democracy?

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:43.850
So with these
unanswered questions,

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:47.516
I will now read to you
"Proust at Rush Hour."

00:11:47.516 --> 00:11:50.140
There are two things you need to
know because this is not quite

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.570
at the beginning of the book.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:56.350
It references the
lung disease which

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.560
I was diagnosed with in
the course of working

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:04.000
as a contractor at the UN and
undergoing all the processes

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.750
for becoming a staffer, and
it also references my bid

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.660
for that job, which was a bid
for financial and professional

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.220
security.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.360
So "Proust at Rush Hour."

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:23.050
"My job is a drag like
most 9 to 5 gigs I imagine.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.340
But, oh, the commute.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.510
The commute is a golden border
at the beginning and end

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:32.110
of each workday that
sheds some of its shimmer

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.140
onto the leaden
expanse in between."

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.340
I should add that I wrote
this a few months after I

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.100
became a permanent staffer.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.000
And I didn't realize
until a few years later

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.090
that it was actually
a lament for the lost

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.330
freedom of self-employment.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:50.549
"But, oh, the commute.

00:12:50.549 --> 00:12:52.840
The commute is a golden border
at the beginning and end

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.200
of each work day that
sheds some of its shimmer

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.350
onto the leaden
expanse in between.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:04.240
I'm a New Yorker, so taking
the subway to work is a given.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.150
The subway provides in
miniature all of the charms

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.530
of long-distance train
travel minus the view.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.530
There is the unencumbered
time, a commodity

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.460
beyond price for those who sell
their waking hours in order

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.770
to afford a place to sleep.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:24.970
There is the heady state of
in-betweeness, a brief release

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.340
from all worldly entanglement.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.390
There is the fact that subway
travel is, for now at least,

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.720
incompatible with
email and cell phones

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.200
and that it will always be
incompatible with vacuuming,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.280
dishes, and laundry.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.950
There are about
half a dozen things

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.500
tops that you can
do on the subway--

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.760
doze, observe the people
around you, listen to music,

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.890
read, think, things we
should all do more often.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.110
I was not always a commuter.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.180
I used to be self-employed.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.790
I worked from home.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.560
And when I traveled,
my conveyance of choice

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.970
was the jet plane.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:08.320
State banquets at the Kremlin,
Mafia trials, forgotten

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.300
literary masterpieces, KGB
files declassified under Yeltsin

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.850
to be reclassified later under
Putin, I translated them all.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.740
It was a halcyon time.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.190
The border between working
and not working was porous.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:28.390
When work was slow, I took
a walk or a yoga class.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.870
When a deadline loomed, I
worked weekends or evenings.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:36.070
As to why people dreaded Monday
and thanked God it was Friday,

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.620
I lacked all understanding.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.930
When people spoke
of their commutes,

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:45.120
I listened as to an account
of some quaint foreign ritual.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.160
But in my mid-thirties,
panic bore down.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.930
My health insurance was patchy,
my retirement savings meager,

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:57.580
my income blossomed and
shriveled with the seasons.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.850
I began planning for the
transition from free spirit

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.490
to commuter, boning
up on my French

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:06.550
so as to get that job
I'd set my sights on.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.970
Apart from the expense, there
was nothing onerous in this.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.430
Who would object to
spending some months

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:16.340
in Paris immersed in the
language of Moliere and Serge

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.740
Gainsbourg.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.500
This was a dream I had
nurtured and then set aside

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.730
almost 20 years before, and
I was glad of any pretext

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.700
to make it come true at last.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.520
French mastered, I
prepared to take up

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.880
my new job as an interpreter
of Russian and French

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:38.560
into English, working in a
tall building of green glass

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.060
at Midtown Manhattan's
eastern edge.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.550
And now unforeseen
things began to happen.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.920
During the trial period
before the job was

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.040
to become permanent,
my newly failing lungs

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.100
made it difficult
then impossible

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.880
for me to perform that demanding
work, a seemingly firm job

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.760
offer went limp.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.620
Through a series
of short contracts

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.580
within the organization,
I tumbled down and down

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:11.650
in status and job satisfaction,
though not salary.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.990
Until I landed in a
permanent position

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.300
editing English-language
documents

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.270
with duties that called
for no more than a

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.080
passing knowledge of French
or any other foreign language.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.310
Movement up the hierarchy,
I would come to understand,

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:31.270
was the reward for a different
sort of fluency altogether,

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.750
directly proportionate
to the climber's ability

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:39.310
to say nothing and offend no
one in the most elegant way

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:43.060
possible all at great length.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.740
Shortly after I started
the permanent job,

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.120
I was copied on an email from
one higher-up to another,

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.700
its contents presumably
affecting my future

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.420
in some way that embodied
this style so utterly

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:59.980
that I would be remiss if I
did not reproduce it here.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.430
Quote-- 'while I do not
think that your concern is

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:08.319
misplaced,' ran this missive,
'I would say that it may be

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.890
premature to suggest that
the guidelines would apply

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.579
uniformly as they
stand to all staff.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:19.119
I hope I'm not being
overly sanguine about this,

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:22.780
but I tend to think that just
as our specificities are being

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.660
taken into account to a
large extent in the interim,

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.840
they would readily be
accommodated in the long term.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.260
In other words,
the guidelines only

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.080
state the policy which
will no doubt allow

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.730
for some special dispensation.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.740
However, I do not dispute
for a second that yours is

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.130
a legitimate concern.'"

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.366
When I got this-- this
is just an aside--

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:49.240
I didn't know what I
was going to do with it,

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.900
but it seemed like such a
fantastic example of something

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.450
that I printed it out to save.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.150
And then later I
found this use for it.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.060
"But I reminded myself as
I printed out the email

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.210
and taped it to the wall over
my computer between a map

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:07.570
of the economic community
of West African states

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.850
and another of the
former Yugoslavia--

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:15.010
the Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, I was lucky.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.370
At last I had a permanent job.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.810
It came with health
insurance, which saved me

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.840
thousands each month on
crucial prescriptions,

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.750
medical equipment rentals,
and doctor visits,

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.050
disability benefits if I
became unable to work--

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.960
a possibility I now
had to entertain--

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.530
dental coverage so dazzling
that even the receptionist

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:38.440
at the dentist's
office was impressed,

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.015
liberal sick leave of which
I would take full advantage,

00:18:42.015 --> 00:18:46.210
a sunsplashed office with a view
of boats chugging up and down

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.120
the East River, access
to a post office,

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.360
bank, credit union,
employee-only low-interest

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.230
mortgages, medical service,
international newsstand, yoga,

00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:01.240
dancercize, and Pilates classes,
a cappuccino bar, cafeteria,

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.420
fancy restaurant with enormous
bowls of whipped cream

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.200
and raspberries on the all you
can eat dessert buffet, nine

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.640
levels of instruction at no
cost in my choice of Spanish,

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.040
Arabic, or Mandarin,
and high school

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.700
choirs visiting from
the heartland, singing

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.150
songs of international
peace and brotherhood.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.940
All this right on
the premises, all

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:29.290
mine in exchange for spending
my days doing nothing

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.570
or what felt like nothing.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.610
Where would I find
something better?

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:39.490
Indeed, I often ask
myself that question.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.910
Although my Russian and
my newly acquired French

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:47.680
are, as noted, superfluous in
the job where I've ended up,

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.790
the hiring process mysteriously
included an eight-hour language

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.390
proficiency test.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.830
And just as mysteriously,
the word translator

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.170
figures prominently in my title.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.430
With some luck in a few years,
I might transfer back to a post

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.810
where foreign languages
could prove useful.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:10.880
In the meantime, I've decided
to read Proust, yes, "In Search

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.120
of Lost Time," also
known as "Remembrance

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.750
of Things Past," in the
original French, all of it,

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:22.390
seven volumes on the
subway standing up.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:23.780
Here's the drill.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.630
In the morning, I get
to the subway platform,

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.580
pull out the book,
and open to the page

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.580
where I left off the previous
evening when the subway

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.690
doors glided apart at my stop.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.250
It's a fine edition with
the thinnest of paper,

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.670
the title tooled in
gilt on the spine,

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:45.110
and a slender grosgrain bookmark
sewn in, also gilt. Failure

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.780
to get the volume into
position before the train pulls

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.470
in means I may not get to do
any reading that morning as it's

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.590
often too crowded to fumble
in my bag for the book

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.320
after I board.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.590
Other things to do before I
push my way onto the train,

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:03.410
lay my hands on a pen
in my bag and make

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.350
sure the sticky note inside
the book's back cover

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.170
has not come unglued
and fallen out.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.330
The pen and the little
yellow scrap of paper

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.360
are for writing down
unfamiliar words.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.890
If I don't have a
pen at the ready

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:19.280
or if the sticky note is missing
or already filled with scrawls

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.960
from previous commutes, I'll go
back later, reread the pages,

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.700
and write down the
unfamiliar words

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.400
that I didn't capture
on the first pass.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.440
Then I'll look up--

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.790
look them up during
the slow moments

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.890
at the office that
add up to a work

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:36.640
day and another and another.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.420
The office with
the river view is

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.820
awash in battered
foreign language

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:45.260
dictionaries that appear to have
languished there for decades.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.930
If it weren't for
Proust and my compulsion

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:51.710
to look up every single
unfamiliar word I come across,

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.980
they would get very
little use indeed.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.940
Here are a few entries
from my Proust word list.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.380
[SPEAKS FRENCH]

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:19.460
Meaning respectively, sullen,
simpering, water sprite,

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.930
convoluted, mawkish,
carnation, jubilation,

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:27.650
tea party, to
warble, upholsterer,

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:33.590
villainy, procuress,
calling card, and greyhound.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:38.360
I'm on the Seventh Avenue
express now hurtling downtown.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.760
In one hand, I hold the
book and in the other,

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:45.290
the pen so I cannot properly
be called a strap hanger.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:47.600
I assume a wide
stance, bend my knees,

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.240
and ride the train
like a skateboard.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.695
In the 12 minutes or
so it takes the train

00:22:52.695 --> 00:22:57.830
to barrel down the line from
96th Street to Times Square,

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:02.690
I fight inertia's pull toward
freefall into some stranger's

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:07.550
lap, plunging instead into
the bucolic village of Combray

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:11.090
or the Paris salons
and cafes, where

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:14.510
representatives of the haute
bourgeoisie and demimonde

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:16.930
cross paths.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:20.580
I read Proust almost
exclusively on the subway.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.200
On weekends, I rarely
pick up the book.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.190
The little volume with
the grosgrain marker

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:28.850
lies untouched on my
desk from Friday evening,

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:31.820
time of unseemly
rejoicing, until Monday

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.460
morning, time of
dread beyond reason.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.460
This runs counter to
my notion of myself

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.250
as someone with an almost
religious reverence

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.200
for literature and its greats.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.100
But there it is.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.680
My life yields up
few moments that

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.740
are conducive to the
concentration and discipline

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.530
that Proust requires.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.140
Every week or two, I
indulge in a dalliance

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.790
with some other author.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:24:00.470
This sometimes takes place
on the subway but mostly off.

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:03.620
When I read on the down
low, it's always in English,

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.550
no need to keep a running lookup
list with the attendant pen

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.080
and Post-it note,
usually the work

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.180
of some contemporary
author whose

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.400
style is relatively terse.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:18.860
Though compared to Proust,
everything seems terse.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.750
I can tear through
a contemporary novel

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:24.140
of 200 to 300 pages in
the time it takes to read

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.260
25 to 30 pages of Proust.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:31.820
Read in brief spurts,
Proust's 3,000 pages--

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.870
well, the 700 I've read so far--

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:39.260
reveal themselves to be a
series of hundreds and hundreds

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:44.740
of linked discursive essays
two to five pages long.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.390
Here is a description of a
bouquet of chrysanthemums

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:51.170
in Madame Swann's chambers,
which segues into mention

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:55.280
of a sunset whose color is
similar to the flowers, which

00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.500
doglegs into a discussion of how
her former life as a kept woman

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:04.700
with a sideline in prostitution
nurtured in Odette, as she's

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.780
known to numerous
intimates, a taste

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.860
for a range of luxury
goods delivered to her door

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.980
from exclusive establishments
spanning many [SPEAKS FRENCH]..

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.340
Here is a discussion of the
difference between the face

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.110
a famous writers
presents at a dinner

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:24.120
party and his interior life
as laid bare in his books

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.630
and of the young
narrator's astonishment

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:29.650
at the contrast between
the two aspects of the man

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:32.390
whose work he has long
admired, a contrast

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.740
so marked that he thinks the
party guest must in fact be

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.560
some other writer
who coincidentally

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.350
bears the same name.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.630
Here is a meditation
on a musical phrase

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.990
that lodges in Swann's memory
after repeating-- repeated

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:48.010
hearings.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.770
Here is Times Square.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:54.010
I almost missed it, engrossed
in a description of the acacia

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:58.060
trees and the public toilet
on the Champs Elysees

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.550
near where Marcel and
Gilberte play hide and seek

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:01.600
after school.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.860
I pause mid-sentence, ride
the human wave off the train,

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.230
and come to rest
on the platform.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.710
Later when I resume
reading, I will cast around

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:15.040
in the middle of a two-page
paragraph to find my place.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.180
Although in a 300-page
stretch in which Proust places

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.850
under a microscope
the narrator's love

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:25.960
for his playmate, his pain when
he decides to cut himself off

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.390
from the girl because she
doesn't love him back,

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.670
his brief conversations
with her parents

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:34.270
when he visits her house
at hours carefully chosen

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.850
so that the girl will
not be there and hearing

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:40.510
about his visit later,
will perhaps be intrigued,

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:43.330
and how Odette
accessorizes the kimonos

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.520
she wears when receiving guests.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.880
Whether I resume exactly
where I left off,

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.180
inadvertently skip ahead,
or re-read half a page

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:58.390
without realizing it right away
is of almost no consequence.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:01.870
I come up the stairs and
cross a wide underground space

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:05.110
on my way to board the
shuttle to Grand Central.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.730
And before I see
them, I hear them.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:12.220
The warm, ludic sounds
evoke an involuntary smile.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:16.270
I follow the music to the top
of the stairs, around the corner

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.280
and behind a wide pillar.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.750
I stop to soak up the feeling
that rolls off these musicians.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:26.500
They're playing a washboard,
a dulcimer, a fiddle,

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:30.260
a tambourine, cymbals,
drums, a banjo, and a bass

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:34.180
though not all at once as the
instrument-to-player ratio is

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.982
about two to one.

00:27:36.982 --> 00:27:41.260
Dollar bills and CDs spill
out of an open guitar case.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:43.810
The men are wearing odds
and ends reminiscent

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:45.910
of other worlds and times--

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:49.780
a bolo tie, a bandanna,
a striped railroad cap,

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:53.170
a cowboy hat, a stocking
cap pulled down low

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.760
over dreadlocks.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.870
With them is a woman who wears
her excess flesh like an ermine

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:03.100
stole and passes out flyers
to the sparse audience, which

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.790
is constantly dispersing
and replenishing itself.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.530
When she runs out of
flyers or audience,

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:12.760
she shimmies to the
music in a manner that

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.090
appears deeply introspective.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:18.910
The flyers and the
handwritten sign

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:20.770
propped against
the instrument case

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:23.980
announced that these are
the Ebony Hillbillies.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.480
The men are not young.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.390
The calm they radiate
is not a natural fit

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:30.440
with Times Square at rush hour.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.440
But utterly at home
in their music making,

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.120
they carry it off.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.100
Their attitude captivates.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:40.710
Kindly, never rushed, each one
engrossed in his own playing

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.580
and simultaneously
adjusting to his partners

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.560
in numerous infinitesimal ways,
they are doing their thing

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.540
and doing it to perfection.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.470
Soon I will hasten toward
the low-cost mortgages,

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:57.340
the cappuccino bar, the
Arabic lessons, the Pilates,

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.570
and the raspberries
with whipped cream.

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.550
I'm always precisely 10 minutes
late, and no one in the office

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.450
ever seems to notice.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.360
But for the moment,
I am swept up.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.220
Where do these men
live, I wonder.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.220
It's always the first
question a New Yorker asks.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:16.060
Do they ride the A train
in from Far Rockaway?

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:20.080
Maybe they've come in from
Jersey City on the Path train.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.870
Do they have day jobs, benefits?

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:26.640
I doubt that anyone has
ever gazed admiringly

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.830
at their dental insurance cards.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:34.240
They play bass drum,
click, scrape, and saw.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.280
One of them taps his toes.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.200
Another stamps his heel.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.460
A third does something like
singing but less melodious.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.340
They do not look like the
kind of street musicians

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.800
who interrupt their
playing to bob their heads

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:52.210
and say thank you ma'am to
passers by dropping coins

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:53.320
in their case.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.500
No, they are not that kind.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.720
I stand off to the side,
watching and listening

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.710
for as long as I can before
running to make my connection.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.550
I head for the shuttle,
which goes ceaselessly

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:09.270
back and forth between Times
Square and Grand Central.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:12.420
I have my pick of three
trains on parallel tracks

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.240
numbered 1, 3, and 4.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.700
They all go to the same place.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.640
Someone once explained to
me why there's no track 2,

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.330
but I've forgotten the reason.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.510
There's a track 2
elsewhere in the system,

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:27.247
but it peters out before
reaching Times Square,

00:30:27.247 --> 00:30:28.080
something like that.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.330
I clutch the little
volume in one hand,

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:34.140
preparing to open it and
regain my place mid-sentence.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.010
Behind me, the men--

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.790
did they grow up together
somewhere in East Tennessee?

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.280
Did their group coalesce
in a bar in Brooklyn

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.200
before Brooklyn was hip?

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.840
Are they Harlem born and bred?--

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.340
are still at it?

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.620
On the shuttle, I'll
read one more page,

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.580
maybe two if I recognize
all the words about Odette

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.950
and the ladies who come to
her Wednesday afternoons

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:59.010
and discuss where they have
their dresses made or about

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.110
a brothel where
the madame always

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:05.490
urges Marcel to try out a Jewish
prostitute with messy hair.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.550
She's better educated and
a better conversationalist

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.460
than the others says the madame.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.330
And Marcel always demurs.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:13.200
No, thank you.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.360
Maybe next time.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.070
I'll get off the
shuttle at Grand Central

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:20.130
with the other passengers
and traverse the station's

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:22.260
cathedral-like expanse.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.960
There are easier,
faster routes to work.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.660
But a day that brings
with it a sense of awe,

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.900
head tilted to take
in that vast space,

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.110
is a day not yet entirely lost.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.790
I will admire the
pearly-faced clock

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:39.540
that anchors the center
of the Grand Hall,

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.790
go down a narrow
marble-floored passage

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:45.930
where vendors sell grilled
Hawaiian tuna, peppercorn

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:48.900
sausage, cheeses that
verge exquisitely

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:53.610
on the foul, mangoes, bananas
foster cupcakes, whatever they

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:57.330
are, tiramisu cake, and
other treats with names

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:00.690
fancy beyond recall
wrapped in crinkly paper

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:06.150
or packed in bright tins, and
dripping with snob appeal.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:10.500
I will emerge from underground
into the city and the shadow

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.690
of the green glass building.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:15.750
I cannot hear the
music anymore."

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:16.866
That's all folks.

00:32:16.866 --> 00:32:19.842
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:24.370
I'll be happy to take
questions about anything

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:29.195
I just read or said or
anything about the book.

00:32:29.195 --> 00:32:32.246
AUDIENCE: I have to ask,
did you ever finish Proust?

00:32:32.246 --> 00:32:33.620
LAURA ESTHER
WOLFSON: Sorry what?

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.820
AUDIENCE: Did you
ever finish Proust?

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.980
LAURA ESTHER WOLFSON:
Did I ever finish Proust?

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.720
I am finishing Proust.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.105
I'm still finishing Proust.

00:32:41.105 --> 00:32:43.450
I'm on volume four.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:46.760
I was reading volume
one in '07 I think.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.560
So I put it down
for years at a time.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.430
And the last time
I put it down, I

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.597
decided I should
reread the parts

00:32:54.597 --> 00:32:55.680
that I had read in French.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.640
I should read them in
English as a memory jog.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.840
So that took a year.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.165
And now I'm on volume four.

00:33:02.165 --> 00:33:06.910
AUDIENCE: Seems like you learned
French at a later age and not

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:07.730
in school.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:08.840
Correct me if I'm wrong.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.550
How is that experience?

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:12.890
Harder?

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:13.994
What were your resources?

00:33:13.994 --> 00:33:15.785
LAURA ESTHER WOLFSON:
What were my sources?

00:33:15.785 --> 00:33:16.655
AUDIENCE: Resources.

00:33:16.655 --> 00:33:17.988
LAURA ESTHER WOLFSON: Resources.

00:33:17.988 --> 00:33:21.200
Well, I actually had a very
solid foundation in French.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.070
I had taken it for five or
six years in middle school

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.420
and high school.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:32.540
And I hadn't touched it or
used it in probably 20 years,

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.650
but it was all there.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:37.100
It was just like opening a
book that had been closed.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.730
The grammar was all there.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.040
I just needed to be--

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.200
to learn how to
comprehend spoken French

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.690
and add vocabulary.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:49.220
So I-- as a freelancer,
I was able to take time

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:52.520
to go to France and
take French classes

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.860
and mingle with French people.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.390
And I had a mentor,
who was already

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:58.730
an interpreter at the
UN, who was coaching me

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.040
through this process,
and she told me

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.800
which newspapers to read,
what movies to go to,

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.340
what TV shows to watch.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.480
Go to plays.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.320
Find yourself a French-speaking
boyfriend, she said to me.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.630
So that was how I did it.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:15.845
It took about six months.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:21.949
And it's important to note
that since I was working only

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:24.650
from French into
English, I didn't

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:28.370
have to be able to speak
flawlessly or write flawlessly.

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:31.090
I only had to
comprehend flawlessly,

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.170
and that's a
passive skill that's

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:37.080
much easier to acquire than
the active skills of speaking

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.899
and writing in other language.

00:34:39.899 --> 00:34:42.380
And although there's a
widespread perception

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:46.880
that it's harder to learn a
language when you're an adult,

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.460
I don't think that's
necessarily true, especially

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.530
if you've already learned
a foreign language.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.679
Then you have a lot of the
conceptual apparatus in place

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:58.940
already, and you just
need to add another layer.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.580
Because as another
speaker in this series,

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.130
Noam Chomsky, said--

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.040
I'm not quoting verbatim--
but the ideas that grammar--

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.740
the broad concepts of
grammar are the same--

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.972
generally the same from
one language to another.

00:35:11.972 --> 00:35:13.430
And when you master
those, you just

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:16.910
have to add some unique
pieces for each language.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.932
AUDIENCE: So you intrigued
me with your untranslatable

00:35:20.932 --> 00:35:21.890
statements about books.

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:23.744
I'm curious how you
define that or what

00:35:23.744 --> 00:35:24.910
makes a book untranslatable?

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:27.243
LAURA ESTHER WOLFSON: What
makes it look untranslatable?

00:35:27.243 --> 00:35:30.590
Well, I can only
say for myself what

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:33.710
makes a book untranslatable
because other people then went

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:38.900
on and translated those books
that I declined to translate.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.790
I think as a
translator, you have

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.830
to believe that everything
is translatable.

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:45.586
Otherwise, you're a fraud.

00:35:45.586 --> 00:35:47.960
But as a person who knows more
than one language and more

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.760
than one culture, you know
that it's not possible.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.290
So you have to live
with that contradiction.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:57.080
In my-- well,
literary translators

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.780
like to say that you
can only translate

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:03.229
those books that you've
fallen in love with.

00:36:03.229 --> 00:36:05.270
And I didn't fall in love
with any of those books

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:06.930
that I turned down.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:09.020
So I guess that's
the first condition

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:13.350
because literary translation
is not remunerative at all.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.410
It's the worst paid
form of translation.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:23.030
I turned down books because
there were things about them

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:26.600
that I felt I didn't
fully understand.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.970
As it happens, the books
that I write about here

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:33.824
that I decided not to translate
were all oral history.

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.990
They did not have difficult
words or idioms in them,

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:39.740
but I felt that I would
not be able to capture

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.490
the unique voice
of the speakers.

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:48.050
One of them contained many,
many different speakers,

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:52.190
and I didn't know how I was
going to contrast them all.

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:53.330
They all felt different.

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:55.700
And I did a sample
of a few pages,

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.850
and I felt like everything
that I did was correct,

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:02.000
but there was something
about it that was not right.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.610
Later I found out
that the person

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:07.490
who had done the oral history--

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:08.960
in different
versions of the book,

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:15.110
she actually attributed the same
passages to different speakers.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:18.696
So my concern-- I was
apparently more conscientious

00:37:18.696 --> 00:37:21.650
than she was.

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:24.170
But there are also words
that are untranslatable.

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.970
Somebody asked this for
an interview recently.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:31.820
What's the word-- what's
a word in Russian that's

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:34.150
untranslatable?

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:37.610
And I answered, there was
a word that I encountered

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:41.270
on one of my first big
stays in the Soviet Union

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.340
when it was still
the Soviet Union.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.920
The word is [SPEAKS RUSSIAN].

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.590
The root is [SPEAKS RUSSIAN],,
which means table.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:51.256
[SPEAKS RUSSIAN],, the
suffix, means around.

00:37:51.256 --> 00:37:52.880
And then the last
part [SPEAKS RUSSIAN]

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.980
just indicates that
it's an abstract noun.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.130
So this word
literally means that

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:02.180
which goes on around a table.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.150
But it means
something like feast

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:09.990
plus banquet plus all the
conversation, speech making,

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:13.310
toasts, drinking,
singing, and the bonds

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:14.820
that are arising between--

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:19.700
among all people around
the table and all the work

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:23.540
that went into putting
out that spread

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:29.030
all in one word in a culture
where feasting and gathering

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.280
is very, very important.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:35.070
And it also usually signifies
a private family or friends

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:37.160
event, not an official event.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:40.650
So how do you put that
all into one English word?

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:45.560
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
draw a parallel that I'm

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.060
a little embarrassed to make.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.000
As with many people here, I
write software for a living.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.770
And one of the
things about software

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:53.080
is that it's never done.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.940
You can always go back and
polish it and improve it.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.980
And your writing seems--

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.170
your style of writing
seems to be the same,

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:04.160
that however much effort
you put into it, however

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:10.015
carefully you craft it, you can
always go back and change it.

00:39:10.015 --> 00:39:11.390
How do you know
when you're done?

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.800
I know when I'm done because
the deadline has passed.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.750
But how do you know when you're
writing when you're done?

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.950
LAURA ESTHER WOLFSON: How
do I know when I'm done?

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:24.630
Well, there was a French
poet who said no work of art

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:26.718
is ever done, only abandoned.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:32.770
I do tend to
procrastinate by spending

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:35.170
a great deal of time polishing.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:37.240
That's a nice word for it.

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.180
Oscar Wilde said, I
spent the day writing.

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.980
I spent the morning
putting in a comma,

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.680
and then I spent the
afternoon taking it out.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.840
I don't know how I'm done.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.740
For this book, there
were revision deadlines.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.130
But when I was
writing the pieces

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:55.660
over the course of years,
nobody was waiting for them.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:00.550
I think that I was
producing about 40--

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:06.420
35 or 40 publishable pages
for many years, a tiny amount.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.930
And I guess when I just felt
that I'd spent enough time

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:15.060
polishing and I wasn't adding
anything substantively new,

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.290
then I would stop.

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:21.850
But they're never finished
until they're bound.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:24.820
Raymond Carver used to get his
books from his publisher just

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.200
published, and he would
take out pencil and start

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.590
correcting the finished book.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:31.890
I'm tempted to do
that sometimes.

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:32.770
Thank you very.

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:36.720
[APPLAUSE]
