Octopus populations have been booming in the
last 60 years to the point where some marine

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.930
biologists even call them “the weeds of
the sea”.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.879
Their main purpose in life is to breed and
make babies, but the way they do that is real

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.380
weird.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.680
Check out this Facebook video we made to

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.900
see how... octopuses? Do the dirty.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.280
Pretty crazy right? Those poor little guys. If you

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.270
wanna know more about how animals get it on,
check out our series “Wild Sex” on Seeker’s

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.400
Facebook page, Seeker Media.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.159
In the meantime, if you’re curious what
happened after ancient humans and neanderthals

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.950
had sex, watch this video here.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.500
Are there any other weird animals you want
to know more about?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.090
Let us know down in the comments, be sure

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.029
