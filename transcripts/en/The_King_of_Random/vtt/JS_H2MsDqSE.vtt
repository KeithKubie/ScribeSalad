Today's gonna be
the first of a two-part video

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.010
showing how to make
a person-safe set of bow and arrows

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.120
that you can use to
play tag with your friends.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.960
[Music]

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.480
For this project, we're using some
3/4 inch schedule 40 conduit PVC.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.220
It's almost exactly
the same as the white PVC,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.420
but since this is
not designed to be buried,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.200
it's more sunlight resistant.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.000
These fiberglass driveway markers
are designed to stab into the ground

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.920
to give yourself a little additional
visibility for the edge of a driveway,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.620
usually.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.900
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.660
Some fiberglass rods
will be cut to length,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.120
secured together,
and fit inside a length of PVC 2.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.780
A paracord bowstring
will then be fit into some notches,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.580
carved into the ends of the PVC.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.660
Let's start by taking our PVC pipe,
and cutting it to 5 feet in length.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.300
[Music]

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.140
Overall, we're going to want
four fiberglass rods in our bow.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.400
One will be just under 60 inches,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.900
one will be 48 inches,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.620
and two of them will be 24 inches.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.220
Our whole PVC pipe is about 5 feet long,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.430
and our longest fiberglass rod,

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.920
we want to be about
1 inch short of either end.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.260
So, let's take 2 inches off,
and they get 58 inches long.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.500
When cutting fiberglass,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.390
you want to make sure
you're cutting slowly and carefully,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.340
so you don't get a lot of splintering.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.960
To help reduce splintering even further,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.340
I'm going to wrap our fiberglass
in a piece of duct tape before I cut it.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.650
We've got two driveway markers
that are 48 inches long.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.430
That's just the right size for one of them,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.420
the other one we need to
cut nicely in half.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:41.140
[Music]

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.220
After cutting that in half,

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.560
we now have our 5-foot length,
our 4 -foot length and two 2-foot lengths.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.620
Make sure it's got the
centers of these all lined up.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.800
We now want to use
a little bit of duct tape

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.040
to tape around the very center,
and hold all these rods together.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.540
[Music]

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.420
These four fiberglass rods
bound  together

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.700
are what's going to give
our bow it's spring power.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.940
Now, when we pull against our PVC,
instead of just bending in half,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.920
It should arch nicely,
and give our string some spring.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.740
The four rods should fit
fairly snugly down inside the tube,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.240
and right where they're taped together,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.480
there should be enough friction
that it doesn't slide unless you push it.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.720
We've got a nice flexible rod
with a lot of spring to it,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.380
and what we need to
do now is add a string.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.660
Our PVC isn't going to do a very good job 
of holding onto any bowstring right now.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.840
I'm going to try to file a
shape about like this.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.420
So, let's take a round file,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.380
and carve some angled
notches into the top and bottom

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.140
that our string can grip on to.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.840
With this shape,
when our bow is curved,

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.440
that should be pretty much
in line with the direction of the string.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.920
[Music]

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.540
We need to tie two knots in our string,
so that the loops on both ends

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.940
will hold securely,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.400
but not have so much slack that the bow 
straightens out when we're not using it.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.040
Let's fold our paracord over,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.960
and use a Figure-eight knot
to make a loop that will be strong,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.120
and large enough to fit
over the top of our PVC.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:21.400
[Music]

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.350
By attaching the string onto
one side of the bow and bending it,

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.700
we're able to mark approximately
where on the paracord

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.260
we want the other loop to go.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.060
This is not necessarily
going to be exactly the right spot

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.580
because after attaching
our string to our bow,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.880
the stretching action may
make it a little bit too loose,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.920
and it may tighten up the knots more,
giving a little more slack into our string.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.080
But we'll start with this,
and adjust from there.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:53.650
[Music]

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.440
Not bad. Not bad at all.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.920
Let's just trim up the extra paracord,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.060
and we should be able
to give our bow a test fire.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.600
We have approximately 57 inches 
between one end of our bow and the other,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.020
Let's just mark right
on the center on the string

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.720
that will let us know where
to be putting the knock of our arrows.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.580
We're going to be going over how to make 
these person-safe arrows in our next video,

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.260
but for now I'm just going
to take one and see how it fires.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.600
[Music]

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.520
Beautiful.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:31.420
[Music]

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.640
Great hang time.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.040
Our bow and arrow is
always working great.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.700
I do just want to add a little
bit of decoration on to this

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.410
because you know, we like
adding decoration to stuff.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.500
I'm not going to put anything
right where I'm gripping

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.160
because I feel like that would
just get worn off over time.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.480
But I think the rest of the bow,
I'll try and add a little bit of color to it.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:05:17.460
[Music]

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.900
Our bow is built,
and it is working great.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.140
We've got incredible range.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.680
I think I can shoot
these arrows like 100 feet.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.979
A quick note about the bow,

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:26.540
if you leave it strung all the time,

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.780
the PVC and the fiberglass rods
inside will start to bend,

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.080
and then, you'll lose a lot of power.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.900
So, anytime you're not actively using it,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.600
you should take the bow string off.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.080
In our next video,

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.000
we're going to be showing
you how to make these arrows,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.680
so they are safe and they can't hit you,
even if they hit you in to face.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.200
The goal is so that no matter how 
you shoot someone with these arrows,

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.100
they're going to be fine.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.960
Guys, we've got more for you to see.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.740
That little box at the top will
transport you directly to our last video,

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.220
and you should go check that out.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.500
The box at the bottom will show you

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.260
what YouTube thinks
you should be watching now.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.040
This bomb in the middle
wiil subscribe to the channel,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.400
so you never miss a video.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.400
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see the next one.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.240
Talk to you then.
