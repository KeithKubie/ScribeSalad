00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] Now it turns out this is not an easy thing to do.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
An obvious idea might be to complete all this normalized alphas,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but you still have to be able to sample from those.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So, in the spectrum of our alphas you might draw a random variable

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
uniformly from the interval 0;1, and then find out the alpha

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so that all the alphas leading up to it, and some are smaller than beta,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but if we add the new alpha to the sum you would get a value larger than beta.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now that's doable. It's inefficient.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In the best case you get an N* log(N) implementation.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Let me show you what is commonly done, and I don't take any guarantee

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.843
that it's entirely unbiased, but there's a very simple trick.
