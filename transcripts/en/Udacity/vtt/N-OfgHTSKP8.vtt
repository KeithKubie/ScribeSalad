As labelled on each graph, the horizontal axis represents the x values, and the

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:09.745
vertical axis represents the y values. From our equation, we know that even if

00:00:09.757 --> 00:00:15.351
no wipers were made or x equals 0, Grant would still have to spend $1,200, which

00:00:15.363 --> 00:00:20.615
would make y equal 100. That gives us the point 0,1200. x equals zero along the

00:00:20.627 --> 00:00:25.335
y-axis here. We need to find the graph that intersects the y-axis at y equals

00:00:25.347 --> 00:00:29.985
1,200. And that is this graph right here. The trend in the rest of the graph

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:34.655
makes sense as well. But every pair of glasses wipers that Grant makes, he

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:39.578
spends more money because our x value increases. From the equation, we can see

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.170
that as x gets bigger, y also gets bigger. So, the graph needs to move up and to

00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:44.748
the right.
