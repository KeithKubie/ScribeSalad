00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:11.700
Ebert 
got his start in the public sector at the

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.809
age of 15 reporting on high school sports
for Champaign-Urbana’s News-Gazette.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.110
He held that job all the way through college,
even while serving as a reporter and editor

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.060
of the Daily Illini at the University of Illinois.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.290
One of Ebert’s first movie reviews, on La
Dolce Vita, was published in 1961 in the Illini.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.270
A few years later, Ebert was accepted into
a PhD program at the University of Chicago,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.469
making a move to the city necessary.

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.400
He started looking for jobs to support himself
and was referred to the Chicago Sun-Times

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.070
by the editor at another paper.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.280
Ebert was hired in 1966 as a reporter.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.930
The movie critic at the Sun-Times left about
a year later and the job was given to Ebert.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.320
A full schedule of graduate studies and a
full time job was too much to juggle, though,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.070
so he left school to focus on writing movie
reviews and a book.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.210
In 1967, the University Press published his
book on the history of the University of Illinois.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.820
His career received another boost when, in
1969, Reader’s Digest ran his review of

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.110
Night of the Living Dead.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.060
russ-myer-and-roger-ebertThat same year, he
partnered with friend and famous porn film

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.069
director, Russ Meyer, to write a screenplay
for Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, the follow-up

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:21.579
to Valley of the Dolls.

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.570
Ebert and Meyer had become friends when Ebert
contacted him in his early days at the Sun-Times

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.109
with writing samples, seeking movie writing
opportunities.

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.049
When Meyer was offered a three picture deal
with 20th Century Fox, and started working

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.810
on Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, he immediately
thought of Ebert, who, as expected, was eager

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.810
to sign on.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.499
Ebert later described Beyond the Valley of
the Dolls as “a movie that got made by accident

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.630
when the lunatics took over the asylum.”

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.579
When you consider that a major studio hired
an independent, X-rated filmmaker and an inexperienced

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.479
screenwriter and gave them carte blanche to
write a script, it is pretty amazing the movie

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.140
ever happened.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.329
The two cranked out the Beyond the Valley
of the Dolls screenplay in six weeks.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.609
Ebert stated that they simply made the movie’s
plot up as they went along and spontaneously

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:10.520
threw in a plot twist at the end that hadn’t
been anticipated, revealing one of the characters

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.730
to be a transvestite.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.110
Beyond the Valley of the Dolls borrowed from
pretty much every movie genre, including satire,

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.650
melodrama, musical, comedy, violent exploitation
movies, and porn.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.569
The team tried to soften some of the sex and
violence to avoid getting an X-rating, but

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.590
the movie ended up with an X anyway.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.129
Ebert later said that if the movie were to
be rated today, with a few edits, it would

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.909
probably be rated R.

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.370
At this point, Meyer wanted to re-edit the
film to include more nudity, but 20th Century

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.780
Fox was suffering from cash flow issues and
rushed the film into release as it was.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.840
Surprisingly, considering the circumstances
behind its creation, Beyond the Valley of

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.950
the Dolls was a big success, earning approximately
$9 million (about $56 million today), nearly

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.239
nine times what the studio spent to make it.

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.620
Ebert and Meyer went on to partner on the
ludicrously named Beneath the Valley of the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.689
Ultra-Vixens, Up!, and several other such
movies.

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.230
They were also working on the Sex Pistols’
movie Who Killed Bambi?, a punk rock version

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.060
of the Beatles’ A Hard Day’s Night when
it was killed by the studio due to the racy

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.620
content in the script.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.690
Ebert moved on from making X-rated films and
back into movie critiquing and, in 1975, started

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.159
co-hosting a weekly film review show, Sneak
Previews, locally produced by a Chicago public

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.170
broadcasting station.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.349
His career as a movie reviewer took off from
there.

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.290
Ebert’s final TV show, Ebert Presents: At
The Movies, premiered 39 years later in January

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.569
of 2011 and ended on December 30, 2011.

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.290
He died at the age of 70 on April 4, 2013
after an 11-year battle with cancer.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.170
Shortly before his death, he stated:

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.359
I know it is coming, and I do not fear it,
because I believe there is nothing on the

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.959
other side of death to fear.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.670
I hope to be spared as much pain as possible
on the approach path.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.280
I was perfectly content before I was born,
and I think of death as the same state.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.920
What I am grateful for is the gift of intelligence,
and for life, love, wonder, and laughter.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.720
You can’t say it wasn’t interesting.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.560
My lifetime’s memories are what I have brought
home from the trip.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.120
I will require them for eternity no more than
that little souvenir of the Eiffel Tower I

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.830
brought home from Paris.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.670
And in his final blog post published two days
before his death, he signed off with,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.569
So on this day of reflection I say again,
thank you for going on this journey with me.

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:23.710
I’ll see you at 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.340
the movies.
