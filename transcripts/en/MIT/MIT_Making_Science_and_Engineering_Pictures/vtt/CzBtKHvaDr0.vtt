00:00:08.387 --> 00:00:08.970
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.090
We're going to get a little
bit more detail about how

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.470
to sharpen images.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.060
Here's microfluidic
devices that we saw before

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.530
in the flatbed scanner section.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.590
I cropped a larger
picture, and as we zoom in,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.870
we're actually seeing some
Newton rings, which we're not

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.780
loving, but let's pretend
that they're not there.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.660
You know that we're going to get
Newton rings when you put glass

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.390
on top of glass,
or-- this is PDMS,

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.450
which is also going to
give us some Newton rings.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.470
So let's just take an area,
maybe around here, just

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.567
to pay attention.

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:50.025
I'm going to zoom
in a little more.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.180
Your eye should
focus around here

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.940
and around the numbers,
and maybe over here.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.790
To see what happens when we
sharpen, we go to the Filter,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.370
we go down to Sharpen,
and use Unsharp Mask.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.950
There are all kinds of
things, but for our purposes,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.610
Unsharp Mask is the way to go.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.720
And it was already set
at 128 once before.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.360
Let's go down to almost
very little sharpening,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.430
almost kind of the
original image.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.940
And watch as I increase
the amount of sharpening.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.070
You're seeing more and
more getting sharp.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.640
But, unfortunately, what also
happens is you get a lot of,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.280
the dirt is sharpening as well.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.640
And we'll discuss that in
a moment, a little bit.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.060
But we're going to go at
length about cleaning images.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.450
For example, if I accepted this
with 228, which is considerably

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:00.620
sharper than before-- let
me undo it with Command-Z.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.960
That was without sharpening.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.360
That's with sharpening.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.700
I hope you're seeing.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.229
Look over here now.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.130
Without sharpening.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.000
With sharpening.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.790
So we're getting some
real clarity here,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.900
which I think is
what we want to show.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.980
But, as I said, we are
also getting some junk,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.770
which, if I decided
to get rid of,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.020
let's say with
the Healing Brush.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.690
Little bit here.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.770
Get rid of this.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.050
Get rid of this.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.830
This is making
the image cleaner.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.180
And the question is, am
I permitted to do this?

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.650
And we're going to have a very
important deeper discussion

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.040
about how much we can, in fact,
enhance scientific images.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.770
For the time being,
let's leave it at this.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.440
And we're going
to save the image

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.790
and clearly indicate
this has been sharpened.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.350
And that's it.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.140
There you go.
