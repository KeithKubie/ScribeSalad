so now that we know how to unlock an

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870
so now that we know how to unlock an
 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.780
so now that we know how to unlock an
achievement let's make some progress

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790
achievement let's make some progress
 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.150
achievement let's make some progress
towards unlocking in incremental

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160
towards unlocking in incremental
 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.280
towards unlocking in incremental
achievement as you recall one of the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290
achievement as you recall one of the
 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.900
achievement as you recall one of the
achievements we wanted to implement is

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910
achievements we wanted to implement is
 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.000
achievements we wanted to implement is
our scent to guess or achievement this

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010
our scent to guess or achievement this
 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.099
our scent to guess or achievement this
is an achievement that a player earns

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109
is an achievement that a player earns
 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.609
is an achievement that a player earns
for making 100 guesses and this is an

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619
for making 100 guesses and this is an
 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.800
for making 100 guesses and this is an
incremental achievement meaning that we

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
incremental achievement meaning that we
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.060
incremental achievement meaning that we
want the player to see that they've made

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
want the player to see that they've made
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.310
want the player to see that they've made
a certain amount of progress every time

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320
a certain amount of progress every time
 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.830
a certain amount of progress every time
they play the game and so let's get to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
they play the game and so let's get to
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.229
they play the game and so let's get to
implementing that this process is fairly

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239
implementing that this process is fairly
 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.110
implementing that this process is fairly
similar to what we did before in my Chi

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
similar to what we did before in my Chi
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.750
similar to what we did before in my Chi
Minh manager I am going to i'm going to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760
Minh manager I am going to i'm going to
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.530
Minh manager I am going to i'm going to
create a method increment achievement

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
create a method increment achievement
 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.139
create a method increment achievement
with ID and we'll have our nsstring

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149
with ID and we'll have our nsstring
 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:56.420
with ID and we'll have our nsstring
achievement ID say x amount whoops let's

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
achievement ID say x amount whoops let's
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.299
achievement ID say x amount whoops let's
get that colon in there 30 and we'll

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309
get that colon in there 30 and we'll
 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.279
get that colon in there 30 and we'll
have an int that will reflect our

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
have an int that will reflect our
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.020
have an int that will reflect our
progress and now we can implement this

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
progress and now we can implement this
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.750
progress and now we can implement this
method will go down here and once again

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760
method will go down here and once again
 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.030
method will go down here and once again
like before we're going to create a gpg

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040
like before we're going to create a gpg
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.580
like before we're going to create a gpg
achievement object will call this one

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
achievement object will call this one
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.690
achievement object will call this one
increment me and we're going to call gpg

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700
increment me and we're going to call gpg
 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.289
increment me and we're going to call gpg
achievement achievement with ID and pass

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299
achievement achievement with ID and pass
 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.670
achievement achievement with ID and pass
in our achievement ID string and then

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680
in our achievement ID string and then
 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.200
in our achievement ID string and then
increment me instead of unlock

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210
increment me instead of unlock
 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.210
increment me instead of unlock
achievement with completion handler we

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
achievement with completion handler we
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.990
achievement with completion handler we
will say increment achievement num steps

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
will say increment achievement num steps
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.840
will say increment achievement num steps
with a completion handler now this

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
with a completion handler now this
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.100
with a completion handler now this
number of steps is the amount of

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
number of steps is the amount of
 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.810
number of steps is the amount of
progress that we want to make towards

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820
progress that we want to make towards
 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.789
progress that we want to make towards
unlocking this achievement remember

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
unlocking this achievement remember
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.469
unlocking this achievement remember
we're doing this for our son a guess or

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
we're doing this for our son a guess or
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.940
we're doing this for our son a guess or
achievement where we want the user to

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
achievement where we want the user to
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.219
achievement where we want the user to
make 100 guesses so this will be the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
make 100 guesses so this will be the
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.840
make 100 guesses so this will be the
number of guesses that the user has made

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
number of guesses that the user has made
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.359
number of guesses that the user has made
every game so might be seven then maybe

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
every game so might be seven then maybe
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.609
every game so might be seven then maybe
it'll be six then maybe will be 12 and

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619
it'll be six then maybe will be 12 and
 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.569
it'll be six then maybe will be 12 and
then four and so our number of steps by

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579
then four and so our number of steps by
 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.649
then four and so our number of steps by
which we want to increment this

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659
which we want to increment this
 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.139
which we want to increment this
achievement is the progress variable

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
achievement is the progress variable
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.960
achievement is the progress variable
that we pass in and then we have our

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970
that we pass in and then we have our
 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.050
that we pass in and then we have our
completion handler

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060
completion handler
 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.679
completion handler
and let's put this on a new line and

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689
and let's put this on a new line and
 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.490
and let's put this on a new line and
we're going to have three arguments

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500
we're going to have three arguments
 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.979
we're going to have three arguments
passed into our completion handler first

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989
passed into our completion handler first
 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.899
passed into our completion handler first
how we newly enlarged this lock this

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909
how we newly enlarged this lock this
 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.789
how we newly enlarged this lock this
achievement that is how we made enough

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799
achievement that is how we made enough
 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.220
achievement that is how we made enough
progress towards completing this

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
progress towards completing this
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.509
progress towards completing this
achievement that we've unlocked it

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519
achievement that we've unlocked it
 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.059
achievement that we've unlocked it
current steps is the number of total

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069
current steps is the number of total
 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.130

steps that the player has now made as
 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.680
steps that the player has now made as
reported by your system and error is if

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690
reported by your system and error is if
 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.509
reported by your system and error is if
there's any error now by the way if we

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519
there's any error now by the way if we
 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.890
there's any error now by the way if we
wanted we could leave this all blank and

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900
wanted we could leave this all blank and
 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.530
wanted we could leave this all blank and
you know everything will work just fine

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540
you know everything will work just fine
 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.960
you know everything will work just fine
the library will record everything and

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970
the library will record everything and
 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.580
the library will record everything and
it will display an achievement unlocked

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590
it will display an achievement unlocked
 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.580
it will display an achievement unlocked
toast when appropriate but just you know

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590
toast when appropriate but just you know
 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.500
toast when appropriate but just you know
so we can see what's going on we'll do

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510
so we can see what's going on we'll do
 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.220
so we can see what's going on we'll do
some logging here so if error will end a

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230
some logging here so if error will end a
 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.890
some logging here so if error will end a
slog got an error are incrementing in

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900
slog got an error are incrementing in
 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.360
slog got an error are incrementing in
achievement and will pass in our

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370
achievement and will pass in our
 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:16.369
achievement and will pass in our
localize description and otherwise if

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379
localize description and otherwise if
 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:22.670
localize description and otherwise if
newly unlocked and a slog her a newly

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680
newly unlocked and a slog her a newly
 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.500
newly unlocked and a slog her a newly
unlocked and I suppose in either case we

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510
unlocked and I suppose in either case we
 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.400
unlocked and I suppose in either case we
can NS log according to the system your

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410
can NS log according to the system your
 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:43.309
can NS log according to the system your
total progress is now % d steps and this

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319
total progress is now % d steps and this
 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.229
total progress is now % d steps and this
will be current steps close that up and

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239
will be current steps close that up and
 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.809
will be current steps close that up and
that's about it we now have a generic

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819
that's about it we now have a generic
 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.789
that's about it we now have a generic
method to make progress towards an

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799
method to make progress towards an
 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.559
method to make progress towards an
achievement let's go back to our game

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569
achievement let's go back to our game
 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.619
achievement let's go back to our game
model and we're going to increment this

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629
model and we're going to increment this
 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.039
model and we're going to increment this
achievement from our player guest method

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049
achievement from our player guest method
 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.229
achievement from our player guest method
now you might be tempted to just

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239
now you might be tempted to just
 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.240
now you might be tempted to just
increment this achievement here you know

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250
increment this achievement here you know
 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.189
increment this achievement here you know
every time the player makes a guess you

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199
every time the player makes a guess you
 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.250
every time the player makes a guess you
would call self dot achievement manager

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260
would call self dot achievement manager
 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.379
would call self dot achievement manager
incremented chipman by ID you know

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389
incremented chipman by ID you know
 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.199
incremented chipman by ID you know
whatever we're calling it by a mount one

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209
whatever we're calling it by a mount one
 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.409
whatever we're calling it by a mount one
however this will run you into trouble

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419
however this will run you into trouble
 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.899
however this will run you into trouble
and that's because when you call gpg

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909
and that's because when you call gpg
 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.540
and that's because when you call gpg
incremented chief montanes client will

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550
incremented chief montanes client will
 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.089
incremented chief montanes client will
actually go out onto the network and try

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099
actually go out onto the network and try
 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.110
actually go out onto the network and try
and make a network call

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120
and make a network call
 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.120
and make a network call
every time and if this were to happen

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130
every time and if this were to happen
 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.550
every time and if this were to happen
very frequently if a player were to make

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560
very frequently if a player were to make
 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.920
very frequently if a player were to make
a lot of guesses there is a chance that

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930
a lot of guesses there is a chance that
 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.930
a lot of guesses there is a chance that
your game could end up getting throttled

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940
your game could end up getting throttled
 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.670

contrast to game centers recommendation
 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.629
contrast to game centers recommendation
where I believe they encourage you to

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639
where I believe they encourage you to
 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.340
where I believe they encourage you to
make progress towards achievements

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350
make progress towards achievements

constantly I'm pretty sure this is

constantly I'm pretty sure this is
 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.450
constantly I'm pretty sure this is
because game centers on device client is

is we're looking into making

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830
is we're looking into making
 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.100
is we're looking into making
improvements to ours in the future but

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110
improvements to ours in the future but
 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.320
improvements to ours in the future but
for right now our recommendation is not

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330
for right now our recommendation is not
 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.810
for right now our recommendation is not
to increment an achievement by one every

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820
to increment an achievement by one every
 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.120
to increment an achievement by one every
single time so here's what we're going

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130
single time so here's what we're going
 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.510
single time so here's what we're going
to do instead once the player has won a

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520
to do instead once the player has won a
 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.760
to do instead once the player has won a
game we're going to call self

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770
game we're going to call self
 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.890
game we're going to call self
achievement manager and we're going to

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900
achievement manager and we're going to
 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.330
achievement manager and we're going to
increment our send a guess or

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340
increment our send a guess or
 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.279
increment our send a guess or
achievement by the total number of

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289
achievement by the total number of
 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.360
achievement by the total number of
guesses that the player has made so

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370
guesses that the player has made so
 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.770
guesses that the player has made so
we're only making this achievement

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780
we're only making this achievement
 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.050
we're only making this achievement
increment call once per game instead of

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060
increment call once per game instead of
 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.360
increment call once per game instead of
once per guess and that will work out a

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370
once per guess and that will work out a
 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.460
once per guess and that will work out a
whole lot better both in terms of the

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470
whole lot better both in terms of the
 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.860
whole lot better both in terms of the
system not throttling your game and you

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.629
system not throttling your game and you
know your user's device not having to go

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639

every three seconds we can get our
achievement ID by once again going to

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.110
unlocking an achievement play games all
you need to do is record the amount of

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.120
you need to do is record the amount of
 

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.090
you need to do is record the amount of
progress the user has made for that game

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:54.100
progress the user has made for that game
 

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.370
progress the user has made for that game
and the system will add up your

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:56.380
and the system will add up your
 

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.040
and the system will add up your
achievement progress for you so there we

00:08:59.040 --> 00:08:59.050
achievement progress for you so there we
 

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.380
achievement progress for you so there we
go we have now successfully incremented

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:01.390
go we have now successfully incremented
 

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.060
go we have now successfully incremented
achievement as well as unlocked an

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.070
achievement as well as unlocked an
 

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.680
achievement as well as unlocked an
achievement we have two more

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:04.690
achievement we have two more
 

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.590
achievement we have two more
achievements to implement but before we

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600
achievements to implement but before we
 

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.030
achievements to implement but before we
add those in I don't know about you but

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040
add those in I don't know about you but
 

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.100
add those in I don't know about you but
it's kind of bothering me that we've got

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.110
it's kind of bothering me that we've got
 

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.960
it's kind of bothering me that we've got
our achievement IDs embedded right there

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:12.970
our achievement IDs embedded right there
 

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.970
our achievement IDs embedded right there
within the code so i think in our next

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:14.980
within the code so i think in our next
 

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.290
within the code so i think in our next
lesson we're going to clean this up a

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:16.300
lesson we're going to clean this up a
 

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.640
lesson we're going to clean this up a
little bit just get these out of here

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:17.650
little bit just get these out of here
 

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.310
little bit just get these out of here
and then we'll implement these last two

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320
and then we'll implement these last two
 

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:28.480
and then we'll implement these last two
achievements so i'll see you soon
