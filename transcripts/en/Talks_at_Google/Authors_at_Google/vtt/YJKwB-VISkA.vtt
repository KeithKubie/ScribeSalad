[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.417 --> 00:00:06.958
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD:
Thank you, guys.

00:00:06.958 --> 00:00:08.946
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.340
Thank you so much for
having me at Google.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.048
I'm really honored
that you all showed up

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:16.250
during your lunch break.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.835
Very cool.

00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:18.710
JASMINE JAKSIC: And for
those in the audience

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.960
who haven't read the book, can
you summarize what it's about?

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.085
MICHELLE RIGBY ASSAD: Sure.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:26.060
So the book, "Breaking
Cover," is a memoir.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.240
And it answers all
the key questions,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.229
like, how in the world
did you get into the CIA?

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.030
It talks about my
career at the CIA,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.300
which was being an
undercover counterterrorism

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.100
officer along with my husband.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.140
We served together for 10 years,
primarily in the Middle East.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.880
And then it also follows us
after we leave the agency

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.570
and what we did afterwards.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.060
So it's a memoir.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.820
And the whole point
of the book is

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.000
to use my story
to inspire others.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.820
Because I'm from a
small town in Florida.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.530
And I come from a
very rural area.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.420
And I never imagined
myself doing anything

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.610
remotely like the CIA.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.780
And I eventually found out that
ordinary people can do really

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.730
extraordinary things
when you don't

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.980
let your fear get in the way.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.780
And that's the
point of the book.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.000
JASMINE JAKSIC: How did
you go from being someone

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.780
who wanted to become a
ballerina to actually becoming

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.227
an expert with
counterterrorism in the CIA?

00:01:26.227 --> 00:01:27.310
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: Yeah.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.920
So people just assume,
you must have grown up

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.230
wanting to be a spy.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.230
I'm like, really, no.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.930
I wanted to be a
Rockette or a ballerina.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.190
But instead, I
actually found myself

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.900
being very fascinated by foreign
affairs because of "National

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.210
Geographic" magazine.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.620
I love "National Geographic."

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.140
And so as a kid, it
introduced me to a world

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.380
completely outside of anything
I knew from central Florida.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.520
And I eventually
followed that passion

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.870
to the Middle East for study
abroad programs in college.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.100
And then I went to Georgetown
for my master's in Arab studies

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.150
and got recruited out of
Georgetown into the CIA.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.190
JASMINE JAKSIC: In the book,
you talk about your mentor, who

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.750
wouldn't even make eye contact
with you because of your gender

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.260
and would only address your
male colleague in the room.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.480
How did you deal with that?

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.480
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: OK.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.920
So here you are.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.090
You're from a small town.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.810
You've been offered
a job in the CIA.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.690
But now you've got to go through
a year's worth of training,

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.660
which is kind of like boot
camp for intelligence officers.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.950
And so I totally had
imposter syndrome.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.890
How in the world did I
get hired into the CIA?

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.290
What am I doing here?

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.440
Am I capable of this job?

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.560
And so during that
year of training,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.900
because you're learning a
tradecraft, it's very intense.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.270
And so you get
placed with a mentor.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.490
So there's one mentor
and two students.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.360
And so it was a male
student and myself.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.020
And this guy was a
legend at the CIA.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.690
And on the first day, in
the little tiny office

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.650
where we were meeting,
he introduced himself.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.950
And I realized he was only
talking to my male colleague

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.510
the whole time.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.590
He couldn't even look at me.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.070
And I was like,
that's really weird.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.520
And after we were done with
that hour-long session,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.030
my male colleagues said,
well, that was strange.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.487
And I said, did you notice that?

00:03:33.487 --> 00:03:34.070
He goes, yeah.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.140
He didn't look at you once.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.080
And eventually, it came out that
this gentleman, who had already

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.930
been retired for about
20 years, had only

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.810
worked with women in the
context of being secretaries

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.130
in the agency.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.040
And he could not conceive
of the idea of a female

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.380
being an intelligence officer.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.450
And he just couldn't wrap
his brain around that.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.934
And so I realized
in that moment,

00:03:56.934 --> 00:03:59.600
OK, so I guess I'm going to have
to deal with being a little bit

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.340
invisible.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.290
But you've got to do
what you've got to do.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.230
JASMINE JAKSIC: How
do you transition

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.360
something that
can be a perceived

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.829
weakness into an advantage?

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.870
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: So
I decided in that moment,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.300
like, I can't help what
this guy thinks about me.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.450
He has his own preconceived
ideas of what women may or may

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.160
not be capable of.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.290
And he kept saying
things to me like,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.960
are you sure you want to
work in the Middle East?

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.190
And I kept saying, yeah.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.900
I mean, I've actually
spent a lot of time

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.470
already in the Middle East, and
I'm fascinated by this culture.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.570
And he said, but you
know it's dangerous?

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.460
And I said, I get that.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.320
And he admitted to me
one day that he could not

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.320
envision me carrying out
clandestine operations

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.860
on behalf of the CIA as a woman.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.840
But I just decided, OK.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.530
There's nothing I
can do about that.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.450
So I'm just going to learn
everything I can from him

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.220
and just push past it.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.690
So there are places like--

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.420
I'm sure a company like
Google, if you perceive

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.550
a systematic issue
or problem, you

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.780
can address that officially.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.820
But the agency is not
one of those places.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.480
So I just had to put up with it.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.240
I'll show him eventually.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.740
JASMINE JAKSIC: And
it's interesting

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.440
because I remember there is a
part in the book where you talk

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.100
about it's the HR department
that decides to place people,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.920
especially women, at desk jobs.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.120
And it's intentional.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.230
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: Yeah.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.430
It's an intentional
decision at the agency.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.160
Certain positions, they would
like women to be in primarily.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.910
When you're talking
about field positions,

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.960
being deployed overseas in
the clandestine service,

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.010
there's a case officer role.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.070
And they tend to like
having men in that role,

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.950
particularly in the
Middle East region.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.650
And then there's one that's
more behind the desk, that's

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.300
managing the flow
of intelligence.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.940
And so they put me
in that position.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.430
And they said,
your husband, who's

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:04.070
a native speaker of Arabic,
he can do this field role much

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.270
better than you as a female.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.130
And I was like, OK.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.160
Well, they're the CIA.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.340
They must know because
they kept saying,

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.830
these guys are not
going to respect you.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.660
The kind of sources
that we're dealing with

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.031
are very hardened
terrorists and insurgents.

00:06:21.031 --> 00:06:23.280
And you're just never going
to be able to do this job.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.160
And so I thought,
well, the CIA must now.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.520
And when I got to Baghdad
in my third deployment,

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.890
I'm in the field.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.076
And I'm seeing that
my male colleagues,

00:06:38.076 --> 00:06:39.950
other than my husband
and a couple of others,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.680
had never been to
the Middle East.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.620
And it suddenly dawned
on me, wait a minute.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.750
How can these people
do a better job

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.600
than I can when I've
been busting my butt

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.300
to study the Middle East, and
I know this culture really,

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.560
really well?

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.810
And I finally
realized in Baghdad,

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.090
when I finally got into
the debriefing room,

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.470
that the CIA was wrong.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.690
But it took me a really
long time to figure it out.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.440
JASMINE JAKSIC: And
unfortunately, this is not just

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.260
at the CIA, as you know.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.140
We all deal with it
in various forms.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.110
A lot of my friends, not
just in the tech field,

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.220
but even outside, they get
sick and tired of the biases,

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.500
and they decide to
leave the workforce.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.890
Have you ever felt
like doing that?

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:31.870
And if so, what kept you going?

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.520
MICHELE RIGBY
ASSAD: So I would be

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.490
lying if I said that I
didn't consider leaving

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.524
the CIA about 1,000 times.

00:07:39.524 --> 00:07:40.690
It was a really hard career.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.450
But I'm also a very
stubborn person.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.850
So if somebody tells me
I can't do something,

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:54.670
or I'm told I'm not good
enough, or I'm pushed aside,

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.070
there's something deep
inside me that just

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.420
wants to prove everybody wrong.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.830
And so I think that
determination to win

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.020
is what kept me in there,
kept me in the role.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.420
JASMINE JAKSIC: Based
on your experience,

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.410
what advice would
you give to women

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.320
who feel somewhat
marginalized in their role?

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.620
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD:
So it's really tough

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.130
to be completely
underestimated all the time.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:24.445
But at the same time,
it can be useful,

00:08:24.445 --> 00:08:26.320
especially in the agency,
when you're dealing

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.370
with counterterrorism issues.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.930
There are a lot of
experiences in which it

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.429
was good to be underestimated.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:36.640
So meeting with
special cases where

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.940
they thought we could be dealing
with a double agent, what

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.360
was really useful was walking
to a meeting with an individual

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.120
from a different culture--
some were from the Middle East.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.800
Some were from
different cultures--

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.820
who essentially thought
that I didn't know anything.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:57.190
And so I used that to my
advantage in those meetings.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.070
And so I would get
people to open up to me,

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.710
not realizing what
they were doing.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.780
So being underestimated--
you can't help what

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.970
other people think about you.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.740
You have no control
over what's going on

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.960
in somebody else's mind.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.970
But what you do
have control over

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.520
is the extent to which
you develop yourself

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.530
to a point you can
no longer be ignored.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:23.050
So all those years when people
thought I wasn't intelligent

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.030
and couldn't know anything
about Arab culture,

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.550
I put my head
down, and I decided

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.090
to figure out how to do this
job better than anybody else.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.100
I mean, I just decided,
I've got to figure out

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.190
how to be a really good
intelligence officer.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.230
And so I built up this
expertise over time,

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.610
a counterintelligence and a
counterterrorism expertise,

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:48.400
until finally the point at which
I demonstrated very clearly

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.800
that I could walk
into a debriefing

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.570
room with an Arab source and
get him to give me intelligence

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.990
he wouldn't give other people.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:01.090
And then finally, I,
after years and years

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.930
of building up this
knowledge, could prove myself.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.580
And then I could
use that leverage

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.520
to get the kind of job I
wanted in the CIA, which

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.600
was that special job looking
at potential double agents

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.350
and things like that.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.630
But it's a slow process.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.410
It takes time to become
an expert in your field.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.930
But I would just
say, do the best you

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.270
can to become really
good at that thing

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.130
you're most passionate about.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.950
And then make it so that
people can no longer ignore you

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.670
because you're so
good at your job.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.170
JASMINE JAKSIC: This is a bit
of a loaded question, I admit.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.910
But do you think you would
have ultimately achieved more

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.400
in your career if
you were a man?

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.691
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: I know,
that is a loaded question,

00:10:44.691 --> 00:10:45.770
isn't it?

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:51.130
I don't know, and I guess I try
not to think of it that way.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.180
I'm the eternal optimist.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.910
So even when I'm up
against something that's

00:10:54.910 --> 00:11:00.750
a huge challenge, I guess
I feel like eventually,

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.500
on the other end of
this, something good's

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.280
going to work out.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.560
And if I think back to
what if I had been a guy,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.090
or what if this, it just--

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.429
I guess I try not to
think of it that way.

00:11:11.429 --> 00:11:12.970
JASMINE JAKSIC: In
the book, you talk

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:17.980
about how sometimes
being open and smiling

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:23.230
can be misconstrued as
one-dimensional and naive.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.900
How did you deal with it?

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.560
Do you think that sort of
assumption is warranted?

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.530
And also, does it
make sense for us

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.682
to put up a tougher exterior?

00:11:34.682 --> 00:11:36.640
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: So
you guys can tell, just

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.755
in the short period
of time we've

00:11:37.755 --> 00:11:39.400
been in this room,
that I'm a fairly

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.920
outgoing, smiley personality.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.830
I really enjoy
interacting with people.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.920
And so I have noticed,
especially in an environment

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.720
like Washington,
DC, people assume

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.560
that when you're nice and
friendly and open and smiley,

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:02.260
you are not multifaceted,
that you're not intelligent.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.630
And it's not people being jerks.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.460
They don't even really
often understand

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.280
they're creating these ideas
about you in their head.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.150
But I learned in DC
and in the Middle East

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.240
how to show other aspects of my
personality at different times.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.950
So I learned when I was
in a place like Cairo

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.510
as a student studying
culture, I learned

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.430
how to stand up for
myself in situations

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.144
where I was being
taken advantage of.

00:12:29.144 --> 00:12:31.060
And that's when the smile
comes off your face,

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.040
and that's when you
show the rougher

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.680
part or the more aggressive
part of your personality.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.950
So coming from the South, as
a good Southern girl, where

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:43.480
you don't show when
something's wrong

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.370
or you have to be very subtle
in how you approach people

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.200
when something's
wrong, it doesn't

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.280
work in a place like Washington
or the CIA or the Middle East.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:13:00.400
You have to find ways to reveal
the multidimensional nature

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.880
of your personality.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.760
So I can stand up for myself.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.660
I can get aggressive
when I need to.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.960
And understanding and having
the confidence to do that

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.724
was something I learned
in the Middle East.

00:13:13.724 --> 00:13:16.420
JASMINE JAKSIC: And
earlier in the talk,

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.570
you mentioned imposter syndrome.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:26.050
And this is something that's
not tied to just being a woman.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.510
It cuts across gender.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.950
And you also talk about one
of your male colleagues,

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.860
who also dealt with it.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.250
How does one overcome
imposter syndrome?

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.690
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: Yeah, OK.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.610
Has anyone in this
room-- raise your hand

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:46.002
if you've ever dealt with the
whole imposter syndrome issue?

00:13:46.002 --> 00:13:46.502
OK.

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.584
I feel so at home right now.

00:13:52.584 --> 00:13:54.500
That's so interesting
because I came to Google

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.530
thinking you guys all knew how
awesome you are all the time.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.255
And Jasmine's like,
no, we feel it, too.

00:14:00.255 --> 00:14:01.600
JASMINE JAKSIC: Yes.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.320
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: And
so imposter syndrome,

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.450
I think there's something
refreshing about knowing

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.830
that you're not the only
person who suffers that.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:12.890
OK.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.680
So I get into the CIA.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.390
I've never known anybody
who worked at the CIA.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.430
I've only seen it
in Hollywood movies.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.910
So in my mind, people were
prepped their whole lives

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.770
to be CIA officers.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.050
They're all martial
artists with black belts.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.730
They all speak five languages.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.300
They're all total cultural
savants who traveled the world.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.450
And so you walk in there all
meek and mild and thinking,

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:39.170
I'm not sure I can do this.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.975
And then you discover
how very wrong you were.

00:14:41.975 --> 00:14:43.850
And you look around you,
and you're like, OK.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.475
These are just regular human
beings here in this building.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.830
The way that I dealt
with imposter syndrome

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.569
is simply by not quitting.

00:14:54.569 --> 00:14:56.360
And much of the time,
it was just because I

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.830
was too embarrassed to quit.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.980
And so I like to
tell people I've

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.350
had a lot of success
in my life simply

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:07.550
just because I hung in there
longer than other people.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:08.615
The secret to my success.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.940
And it's because, I
think, when you struggle,

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.900
when you work so hard to
deal with your imposter

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.890
syndrome, the process
of that struggle breeds

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:26.870
something really beautiful in
you in terms of your expertise.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:31.550
When I had a meeting and the
guy sitting across from me

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:35.540
is telling me he's an al-Qaeda
emir, and he's telling me

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.620
he's been running
operations in Baghdad,

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.110
and something about
his body language

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.500
is telling me
intuitively that there's

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.150
something wrong with this guy.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.620
And I sat in the
struggle for weeks

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.750
after this debriefing
trying to figure out,

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.520
why is it bothering me?

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.000
What about this guy is
giving me this bad feeling?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.520
And after weeks of trying to
go through this debriefing

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.390
in my head, I suddenly
realized, this guy wasn't

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:08.420
acting like an al-Qaeda emir.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.180
He wasn't behaving like
all of the other terrorists

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.890
I had dealt with.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.800
When they walked in a
room, these other guys,

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.470
they walked in like
they owned the place.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:22.100
They had the biggest egos I
have ever seen in my life.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.900
And I suddenly realized,
this guy didn't have an ego.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.680
And he was scared.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.280
And when I picked
him up in my car,

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.946
I actually had a
moment where I thought,

00:16:31.946 --> 00:16:34.130
this guy's gonna pee his pants.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.500
Like, he was
shaking like a leaf.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:41.060
And after weeks of going back
through the entire meeting,

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.150
this struggle brought me
to a point where I said,

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.400
I don't think he's
what he's telling us.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.650
I don't think he's
an al-Qaeda emir.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:52.040
I don't even think he's
in al-Qaeda at all,

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.690
never mind being the
leader of a cell group.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.770
And it turns out that
after a couple of months

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:01.580
of intensive efforts for
me to vet his information,

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.130
he was never in al-Qaeda.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:08.089
And so that struggle
brought me to a place

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:10.250
where I suddenly had
this confidence like,

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.319
I can read body language.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:15.560
I get the culture enough to
realize when something's wrong.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.319
And then finally, that whole
imposter syndrome thing,

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:21.260
it finally went away.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.450
And it was like a turning
point in my career,

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.849
when I realized
that I was actually

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:27.670
really good at intelligence.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:33.920
So the moral of the story
is just hang in there.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.600
JASMINE JAKSIC:
You know how biases

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:41.060
goes both ways, like how people
judged you in Middle East,

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:45.290
we tend to have always
stereotypical ideas

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.900
about people from
Middle East, as well.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.240
But you have spent a
lot of time with them.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.610
You know them on
a personal basis.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:54.860
What are some of
the misconceptions

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.005
that we as Americans
have against them?

00:17:58.005 --> 00:17:59.630
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD:
So the first thing

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:04.310
is that when you don't interact
with a certain people group,

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.570
you tend to have the
worst ideas about them.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:10.190
And the thing that I love about
people from the Middle East

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:14.090
that you realize immediately
when you go to the Middle East

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.630
is how hospitable people are
and how they will literally

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.120
give you the shirt
off of their back.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.780
The way they treat visitors,
the way that they welcome you

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:28.220
into their home or welcome
you to the country,

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.700
I learned what hospitality
was from Arabs.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.210
And it taught me a lot
about being a better person.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:39.340
So that's one thing I
like to tell people.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.570
Another thing that
makes me crazy

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.860
is when I hear people
say things like,

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.440
oh, you served in
the Middle East.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.720
It's that place
where people just

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.340
kill each other all the time.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.017
And this has been going
on for thousands of years.

00:18:52.017 --> 00:18:54.350
And it sounds like, oh, they're
just animals over there.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:55.730
They just love to fight.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.950
They're just warmongers.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.680
And what makes me crazy
about that is it's

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:05.130
a fundamental misunderstanding
of the Middle East.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.024
There's a lot of
identity politics

00:19:07.024 --> 00:19:09.440
that exist in the Middle East
that are different than what

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.640
we have in America.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.500
Our political
system here is very

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.380
different than the political
system in the Middle East.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.450
And so what you
have, you don't have

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.550
separation of church and state.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.440
They're integrated into one.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.200
And so that creates a
completely different dynamic

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.190
in terms of identity politics
and fighting for control

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:33.830
over ideology, which is
fighting for control over power.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.500
It's not because-- people
aren't fighting each other

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:41.124
because they just love warring
or they're just these animals.

00:19:41.124 --> 00:19:43.040
It's that they're dealing
with a different set

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.650
of political circumstances.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.720
And in order to understand
that, you really

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.290
have to look at and recognize
how different the systems are

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.180
that we're dealing with.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.970
JASMINE JAKSIC: That's quite
fascinating because most of us

00:19:55.970 --> 00:20:00.080
hear about terrorism and
terrorists based on headlines

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.140
that we get through media.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:07.430
But you know them as
people beyond criminals.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.600
And that is really interesting.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.887
We don't get to see that
side of those people.

00:20:13.887 --> 00:20:15.470
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD:
The most fun part

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.964
of my job as an intelligence
officer, everybody

00:20:18.964 --> 00:20:19.880
thinks it's Hollywood.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.240
You're driving fast cars.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.430
You're drinking Martinis.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.810
You're doing all this
high-speed stuff.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.400
But what I find the
most fascinating aspect

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.310
of being an intelligence officer
is the psychological aspect

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.710
of those interactions
with another human being.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.880
So the way I like
to explain it is you

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.270
have created a relationship
with a guy who you

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.250
have nothing in common with.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.800
As a counterterrorism
officer, your job

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.140
is to get insider information.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.030
You need to stop terrorist
attacks from occurring.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.850
So who are you gonna
be meeting with?

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.100
You're going to be
meeting with penetrations

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.690
of a terrorist group.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.450
These are guys who
have turned on the rest

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:03.290
of the terrorist group and
have agreed to be the mole.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:08.210
They've agreed to risk their
lives to partner with the CIA

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.830
to give you this intelligence.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.690
So while he's a terrorist, while
he has clearly killed people,

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.600
he now is in a place that
he's willing to work with you.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.460
If you mishandle
his intelligence,

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.400
if you mishandle his
identity information,

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.530
you could get him killed.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.950
So he's risking his life
to be meeting with you.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.630
So if I'm going
to be interacting

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.390
with this human being to
get intelligence out of him,

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.550
fundamentally, he
has to trust me.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.700
And if I walk through
the door, and I'm

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.320
the opposite of what he's
expecting, as a female,

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.970
he's not going to trust me.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.980
So how do I connect
with this guy

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.410
who has crazy,
hardened ideology,

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:52.040
thinks women should never leave
home, and if they leave home,

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.700
they should be completely
covered and have a male escort?

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.980
How am I going to
connect with him?

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.510
If I want him to see
me as a human being,

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.956
I have to understand who he is.

00:22:02.956 --> 00:22:05.330
And it's got to be something
other than terrorist sitting

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.130
in a seat across from me.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:08.090
He has strengths.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.590
He has weaknesses.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.720
He has his own motivations.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.020
And if I'm going to work
with him in intelligence,

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.270
I have to know what
his motivations are.

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.160
Is he doing this for money?

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.800
Is he doing this to take
out the competition?

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.310
Is he doing this because he no
longer buys into the ideology,

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.080
and he's had it with
al-Qaeda, and he's

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.980
willing to risk his life
to work against them?

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.610
So fundamentally,
I can't do my job

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:38.330
unless I can see that person
and interact with them

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.890
as a human being.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:43.580
JASMINE JAKSIC: You say every
agent who interacts with them,

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.740
they have three big challenges.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.710
And in your case, you
have the fourth one.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.917
Do you want to elaborate
what those challenges are?

00:22:50.917 --> 00:22:52.000
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: Yeah.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.630
So your challenges,
as you're trying

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.740
to then make this
connection with this person

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.460
you have hardly anything in
common with, is first of all,

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.320
you're an American.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.697
So you're the enemy
from the get-go.

00:23:03.697 --> 00:23:05.780
And we're talking about
not all Middle Easterners.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.571
We're talking about
these terrorist sources

00:23:07.571 --> 00:23:09.170
we're meeting with.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:12.710
Then secondly, you
work for the CIA.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.630
So you're double enemy.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:17.060
And then thirdly,
it's assumed you're

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.700
Christian if you're white.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.260
It's obviously not necessarily
the case, but they assume that.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:28.500
So you're American, CIA,
Christian, and then female.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.550
So it's like you have the
deck stacked against you.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.670
And so you have to figure out--

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:37.900
preparing for my first
debriefing in Baghdad,

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.070
I realized, OK, again, I can't
help what that guy thinks of me

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.690
when I walk through the door.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.939
But I've got to figure out
very quickly how to make

00:23:45.939 --> 00:23:46.980
this connection with him.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.390
So I've got to take all of
his assessments about me

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:50.980
and turn them on their heads.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.546
I have to absolutely
turn them upside down.

00:23:53.546 --> 00:23:55.420
And the reason why it's
got to happen quickly

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.893
is because we're getting
shelled constantly.

00:23:58.893 --> 00:24:01.240
And we're in the green zone.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.760
And we've got a curfew.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.200
And we've got all of these
external things going on.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.570
So we have got to make this
meeting happen quickly.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:10.540
So I walk in the
room, and I have

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.900
to be sure that my body
language is exuding confidence.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:18.110
Even though I'm
terrified, I'm excited.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.000
I'm shaking.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.980
But I don't want him to
see that I'm shaking.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.310
So I'm, like, deep
breathing exercises.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:26.710
I greet him in Arabic.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.970
I greet him using Arabic
phrases that show--

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:35.690
they're not [ARABIC],, thank
you, or silly phrases.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:37.360
I'm using phrases
that demonstrate

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.460
I've studied Arabic.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.160
And then I'm talking
to him about something

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.930
that matters to him.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.940
So I've studied this
guy inside and out.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.790
And I know that the guy I'm
meeting with has this huge ego,

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:50.350
and he feels really important.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.970
So I stroke his ego.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:56.170
I say, Abu Muhammad, I am so
impressed by what you have

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.030
done in the last few months.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.370
You have been incredibly
brave by sharing

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:04.165
X, Y, Z. What you have
done has literally pushed

00:25:04.165 --> 00:25:06.070
al-Qaeda out of your village.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.020
I'm really impressed with you.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.490
So I'm stroking his ego.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:11.440
And making him feel
important because we all

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.400
want to feel important.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.630
And then I got to show
him that I'm intelligent.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.690
So I have to talk
about Iraq writ large,

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.870
my knowledge of Iraq, what
kind of a country Iraq is.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.910
I have to show him that
I know specifically

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:27.970
how Iraq is different than the
rest of the Middle East, what

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.880
makes Iraq unique.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.110
And as I'm having this
conversation with him, this,

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:35.590
like, back and forth, nice to
meet you, and this exchange,

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:41.320
I'm seeing his eyes
twitching because I am not

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.520
what he expected.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.010
And so I know that it's working.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.500
And so I continue this
dialogue with him.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.810
And I can see that I am
shocking the heck out of him.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.550
And about five minutes
into this exchange,

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:58.750
where I have confronted
every single mis-assessment,

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:00.610
he has this moment
where he just decides,

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:04.300
like, wow, she's smart.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.180
I like her.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.781
And I'm going to work with her.

00:26:07.781 --> 00:26:09.280
And now we can get
down to business.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.810
And now I have taken my
disadvantage as a female,

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:15.460
and now I've turned
it on its head.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:20.010
And now he wants to impress
me because I'm a female.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.160
Fine.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.860
I can work with that.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.580
If that's what we're
dealing with, fine.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:30.460
And so I realized that
anyone can use this strategy

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.010
to deal with people
who don't fundamentally

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.090
understand who you are.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:38.100
But you have to work
with them, nonetheless.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.410
JASMINE JAKSIC: I'm going to
switch gears a little bit.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.760
There have been a lot
of shootings recently,

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.290
including the one at
our YouTube campus.

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:49.650
Is there something that
we as civilians can do

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.564
to be more alert and stay safe?

00:26:51.564 --> 00:26:52.980
MICHELE RIGBY
ASSAD: Yeah, I know.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.312
That's such a tiny question.

00:26:55.312 --> 00:26:57.690
Such an easy question
you ask, Jasmine.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.030
So I think the most
important thing

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:06.090
is to realize where
you're most vulnerable.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.670
Because some attacks are
a surprise, like this one.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.080
And you can't plan for that.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.780
And you can't really
prepare in many situations

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.700
for the lone wolf to crack
and do what this woman did.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.040
However, I do like
to tell people

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.670
it's really important to know
when you're most vulnerable

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.420
or to know when you're
in situations where

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.003
if something's
happened, this might be

00:27:26.003 --> 00:27:27.640
a place where it will happen.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.710
So it tends to be in
places where, like, you're

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.150
at a concert.

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:36.840
Or you're at a mall
during Christmastime,

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.110
buying presents
in December, where

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.820
you're in large
gatherings of people--

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.020
you're at a sporting event.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.330
Whenever you're in
places like that,

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.160
you have to just say,
OK, in this moment,

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.350
I realize that I
am in a place where

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.900
this would be-- we're just
target-rich environment

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.050
for a terrorist.

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:56.390
But here's the other thing.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:57.946
It's telling yourself
ahead of time

00:27:57.946 --> 00:27:59.820
that you're going to
have the right response,

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.890
God forbid something happens.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:06.510
Because when an attack occurs,
you have a surge of adrenaline

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:08.550
that courses through your body.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:11.520
And you have one
of three reactions.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:15.200
It's either fight,
flight, or freeze.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.940
And it sounds really
basic, but a lot of people

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.130
freeze in those situations
because they are so

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.837
overcome by fear, or they
don't know what's happening.

00:28:23.837 --> 00:28:25.920
And so the idea is to tell
yourself ahead of time,

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.230
God forbid I am ever in
one of those situations,

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:30.930
I am not going to freeze.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:36.870
And so sometimes, survival
is as simple as not freezing.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.720
And the CIA gave us
training because a lot of us

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.400
were sent to war
zones and places

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.930
where we could be ambushed.

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:45.450
And the idea is that the
place where the attack occurs

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:49.530
is called the X. And you have to
do anything possible to get off

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:51.570
the X in those situations.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.390
So they actually
trained us, find out

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:58.140
where the threat's coming
from, which direction,

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.070
and run the other way.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.160
And again, it sounds
really-- like, really,

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.060
the CIA has to teach
you people that?

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.420
But yes, they do.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.150
And actually, I think as
human beings, just recognizing

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.570
the potential responses and
being able to say, like,

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.130
you're taking your family out.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:15.840
And you guys are
in a public place.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:19.950
And you realize, we could be
a little bit vulnerable here.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.650
Where are the exits?

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:25.230
So when I go to a concert,
I look at the concert hall.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.989
And I already-- exit,
exit, exit, exit.

00:29:27.989 --> 00:29:29.280
Where is everybody going to go?

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.280
Probably that direction.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.220
Is there another direction
I could go to not

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.170
get involved in a stampede?

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.830
These are the kinds of things
I think through in my head.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.520
Where's cover or concealment?

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.330
If something happened right
now, where would I run?

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.360
And so as a
counterterrorism officer,

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.550
I'm a little sick like that.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.810
I think through these
things all the time.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.454
But anyway, it gives you an idea
of what you can think through

00:29:51.454 --> 00:29:53.370
in your head as you're
dealing with an attack,

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:56.130
like what just happened
on your YouTube campus.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.020
How long did she
have her weapon out?

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.150
Did she brandish it
for several seconds?

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.970
Did she give anybody
a moment to respond?

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.830
Or did she literally just pull
it out and start shooting?

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.520
So the questions are, how
much time do you have?

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.870
And to just do anything--

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:11.700
I'm telling you guys, anything--

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.360
to get off the X.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.040
JASMINE JAKSIC: That's
actually great advice.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.680
As someone who has dealt with a
lot of people with ill intent,

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.320
can you even spot
them in public?

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.180
Is it even possible?

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:30.350
I mean, once they pull the gun
out, then of course you know.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:31.910
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD:
I think that you

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.750
could be quite surprised
at how much you can see

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.550
when you're paying attention.

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.030
I was with my family.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.790
This was during my CIA training.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:44.060
So I started learning how to
pay attention to my surroundings

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.890
at this period of time.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.300
And we were in a toy store.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:51.276
And this story's actually in the
book, so you'll recognize it.

00:30:51.276 --> 00:30:52.602
But we were in a toy store.

00:30:52.602 --> 00:30:54.060
And we were walking
down the aisle.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:59.210
And I saw this guy crouched
down by the Barbie dolls.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:01.850
And he looked weird.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:06.350
He looked unkempt, like his
hair was, like, not combed.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.020
Half of his shirt was tucked in.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.270
He just looked super sketchy.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:14.350
And he, like, made the hair on
the back of my neck stand up.

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:18.800
And so I literally
watched this guy's eyes

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.090
glom onto my six-year-old
niece and watch her walk down

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:27.440
the aisle in such an
inappropriate manner,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.140
I could barely
put it into words.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.230
In that moment, all
I thought in my head

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:38.120
was, pedophile,
pedophile, and grabbed her

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.040
and ushered her
through the aisle.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:44.840
And I didn't have confidence
at that point to say something

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.220
because I didn't--

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.410
I was, like,
second-guessing myself.

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:49.940
Am I correct?

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.642
Is that right?

00:31:50.642 --> 00:31:51.350
What could I say?

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:54.470
Like, I think there's a
weird guy in aisle five.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.900
Like, what do you tell people?

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.786
Knowing what I know now, I
would have gone back in time,

00:31:59.786 --> 00:32:01.910
and I would have gone to
the front desk or whatever

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:04.717
and said, there's a really
sketchy guy in aisle five.

00:32:04.717 --> 00:32:06.050
He looks like a pedophile to me.

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:09.920
But, you know, just
letting you know.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.010
So it's interesting because
I noticed something.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:14.570
I was paying
attention to something

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.570
that didn't look right.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:20.510
And so I think you really have
to honor your gut feeling when

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:22.560
something is out of place.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.980
And the more you pay attention
to your surroundings,

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:28.160
the more you'll see things
that just don't fit in

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.980
or just don't look right.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.400
And you'll be surprised.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.270
JASMINE JAKSIC:
That makes sense.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.660
Last question, and then we'll
move on to audience questions.

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.330
What's the most valuable
lesson that you learned

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:44.160
at CIA that might be
applicable to everyone,

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.409
including us civilians?

00:32:46.409 --> 00:32:48.200
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD:
So it really kind of--

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.540
it's the theme of
today, which is

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.050
you have to find a way in
your job to be authentically

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.790
who you are.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:00.700
It takes a long period of time
to build up the confidence

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:04.660
to say, how can I, with
my unique perspective,

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:08.470
bring who I am to
this job or this role,

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:11.380
and to have the confidence to
say, I see things a little bit

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.500
differently.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.230
Can we potentially
do this or that?

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:17.920
And what's nice is Google,
you work for a company

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.530
that really honors innovation.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.320
And you work in a place that
kind of upholds that which

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.280
is fabulous.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.280
Like, I'm jealous.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:35.570
But the idea is to feel free to
disrupt because of who you are.

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:39.710
Use your personality to
disrupt the status quo,

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:42.920
to innovate, to change
how things are done.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.980
Your power comes in
your authenticity.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:50.360
When I tried to run an operation
like my male colleagues,

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.590
I wasn't doing a very good job.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.350
But when I decided
in that moment,

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:57.140
I'm going to be Michele,
my smiley Michele

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:00.410
face, whatever, that seemed
so foreign to the CIA.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:05.000
But when I brought that into my
job and brought it into the way

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.719
that I planned and
executed operations,

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:11.750
I stood out in the
best possible way.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:17.389
And what made me feel initially
like an oddball in the CIA

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:20.152
is what enabled me
to shine eventually.

00:34:20.152 --> 00:34:22.610
And again, it took me, like,
five years to figure that out.

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.659
And hopefully, it
won't take you as long.

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:28.219
But it is to encourage you
to be as authentic in what

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:29.420
you do every day.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.700
Because I think that's
where your success lies.

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:33.199
Yeah.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:33.698
Oh, yeah.

00:34:33.698 --> 00:34:35.300
So the question
is what do I think

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.130
about what's going on
in terms of terrorism

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:37.921
in the Middle East?

00:34:37.921 --> 00:34:40.139
And is it getting
better or worse?

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:45.440
So we've done a pretty
good job of disrupting ISIS

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:50.520
from its stronghold in Syria and
northern Iraq, as you all know.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.030
There's no longer a
caliphate, although there

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:56.030
are pockets of ISIS
in northern Iraq,

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:58.610
and obviously still in Syria.

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:01.411
Now, what the press is not
telling you very much--

00:35:01.411 --> 00:35:03.410
I think there's just been
little glimpses of it,

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.750
but this is the big
insight right here--

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.640
a lot of the
leadership that hasn't

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:12.620
been killed in counterterrorism
operations is in Libya.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.950
I think Libya is going to be
the next Afghanistan in terms

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:19.850
of a base of operations.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:23.283
And so I think because
Libya's essentially

00:35:23.283 --> 00:35:27.410
a hardly functioning country--

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.480
Libya, as you can
tell, is a mess.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.400
There is a government,
but the government

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.690
has very little control over
what happens all over Libya.

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:38.360
And so things are going
haywire in the country, which

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:43.160
is why you have people smugglers
and crime syndicates sending

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.340
migrants across the
Mediterranean into Europe.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:50.840
And now I think that the more
that terrorism leadership sets

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.850
up base in Libya,
the more you're

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:55.790
going to see a
marriage of terrorism

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.220
and the human
smuggling trade, which

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:02.090
is very lucrative in terms
of lining their pockets

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:08.330
and helping them
kind of recalibrate,

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.230
reconstitute themselves.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:14.902
And so I'd say
heads up on Libya.

00:36:14.902 --> 00:36:16.526
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
earlier getting

00:36:16.526 --> 00:36:19.419
the motivation behind
why these individuals are

00:36:19.419 --> 00:36:20.460
doing what they're doing.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.960
And one of them
that struck me was

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.376
to eliminate the competition.

00:36:24.376 --> 00:36:26.270
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: Yes.

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:28.925
AUDIENCE: What kind of
terrorist competition is there?

00:36:28.925 --> 00:36:30.800
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD:
Yeah, I'll let you know.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.040
This is interesting, actually.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.480
So it took me a long
while to figure this out.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:40.400
But there were a lot of
sources who pretended like they

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.667
were all, like, oh, yeah, CIA.

00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:43.250
We're friends.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.749
We're good.

00:36:43.749 --> 00:36:45.140
We're gonna work together.

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:48.020
When in effect, they
had never intended

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.450
to leave terrorism behind.

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:52.940
They just wanted to take out
the other guy on the block

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.900
so they could be in charge.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.110
So it's like a double
agent, but not in order

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:59.930
to work against
CIA, necessarily,

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:04.917
but a double agent to establish
their power on the street.

00:37:04.917 --> 00:37:06.750
So they'd be like, hey,
that guy over there,

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:08.480
he's a really bad terrorist.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.720
His name is so-and-so.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.830
This is his phone number.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:12.413
This is his make and
model of his car.

00:37:12.413 --> 00:37:14.600
And this is the location
of his safe house.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:21.570
Next thing you know, military
troops take out that guy.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:24.200
Next thing you know, we
find out a year later,

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.240
we took out the
competition, and that guy

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:32.030
took over as head honcho and
was playing us, essentially.

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:34.233
That happened more often
than we'd like to admit.

00:37:34.233 --> 00:37:36.085
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
about [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:36.085 --> 00:37:39.096
So I can imagine that
there are many sources who

00:37:39.096 --> 00:37:40.770
are kind of coming to you.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:43.275
But the case that
you're reaching out,

00:37:43.275 --> 00:37:47.490
how are you finding the people
that are the best sources,

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:49.680
and then how do you
kind of turn them

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.624
into sources of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:51.624 --> 00:37:54.290
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: It's tricky
because so much of that I'm not

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:56.780
allowed to talk about.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.300
I can say, because this
was cleared for my book,

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:03.530
people think it's so
hard to recruit sources.

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.420
And there's certain
things in intelligence--

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.760
like, it's hard to recruit
a North Korean because it's

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.240
hard to find them.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.770
It's hard to recruit
Putin's inner circle

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:15.240
for obvious reasons.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.990
It's not hard to recruit
in the Middle East,

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.700
especially for
counterterrorism operations.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.480
It's not hard to
collect information.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:28.250
What is really hard is
collecting good information.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:31.850
Most of what we get is
fabrications or lies.

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:35.180
And so the better we are
at vetting the information

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:38.180
and finding the golden
nuggets, the better--

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.760
that's the hard part of the job.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.210
And recruiting people who
are being truly recruited

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:47.690
versus using you to take
out the competition, that's

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:49.751
also the hard part.

00:38:49.751 --> 00:38:50.750
It's like a half answer.

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:51.791
How do you like that one?

00:38:54.035 --> 00:38:55.660
AUDIENCE: You were
talking a little bit

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:59.110
about developing those
instincts for spotting things

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:00.880
that you feel are off.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.280
We have programs running
here around making

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.799
you more aware of your
unconscious biases

00:39:05.799 --> 00:39:07.340
and how those can
be really damaging,

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.850
the assumptions that you
make about other people

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:10.390
can potentially
be really damaging

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:13.610
if they're based
on unconscious bias

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:15.260
rather than on
some kind of fact.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:19.070
So I'm curious, as you were
developing those instincts,

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:21.260
how did you differentiate
between what

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:25.500
might be bias on the basis
of how we're socialized

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.400
in society broadly
and where you found

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.195
that your instincts
were really right,

00:39:30.195 --> 00:39:33.920
and how you sort of made
those determinations.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.320
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: Gosh.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.520
That's a good question.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.401
I mean, was it in terms of
understanding my own biases,

00:39:41.401 --> 00:39:42.400
or understanding theirs?

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.260
AUDIENCE: Understanding theirs.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:43.840
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: My own.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.339
OK.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:50.720
Yeah, because we all
bring biases to the job.

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.460
Absolutely.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:51.960
All of us.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.610
And I think it's
impossible to completely--

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:56.480
we're human beings.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.030
We're flawed.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:04.130
But I think the extent to
which you can call it out,

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.740
and I think there's some level
of emotional intelligence

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:09.720
involved in that, and
being aware of yourself.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.930
Some people just aren't aware.

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:16.280
And that's where dialogue
and debate with others

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.920
can be helpful to you,
you know, healthy dialogue

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.750
to help us each
understand our own things.

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:25.250
So I had to be--

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:29.630
if I'm gonna deal with
this guy, my natural--

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.600
actually, this is funny.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.080
I would say my natural
inclination was to not trust.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.910
But that's actually a good
thing in intelligence.

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:39.120
So in that case, it worked.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.780
But in real life, outside of
intelligence, not trusting

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.820
anyone is a hard way
to live your life.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.907
But I don't know if that
answers your question.

00:40:45.907 --> 00:40:47.990
You're gonna make me think
about that for a while.

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:56.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] skilled
or being tenacious and sticking

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:59.040
around, [INAUDIBLE]
opportunities.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.790
And it seems like both
of those strategies

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:02.540
are kind of internally
focused, like being

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.930
really good at what you're
doing versus gutting it out.

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.066
Are there any ways, or
do you have any thoughts,

00:41:07.066 --> 00:41:07.922
about ways to kind
of more directly

00:41:07.922 --> 00:41:10.422
address some of the obstacles
that you faced in your career?

00:41:10.422 --> 00:41:13.150
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD:
That's a great question.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:17.040
One of the things that I did,
because I had to find ways

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.440
to show that expertise--
you're like, yeah, OK.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.780
Become really good at what
you do, and then what?

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:28.560
And so for a long period
of time in the CIA,

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.860
I was really jealous of
a lot of my classmates

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.905
that kept getting sent
to really nice places.

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:40.230
I admit it now.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:41.820
Like, I can't tell you where.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:45.340
But they were eating great food.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.280
They were-- classical
architecture,

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.640
and nobody's shooting at them.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.990
And my husband
and I felt like we

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:55.170
kept getting the shaft
because OK, one war zone.

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:56.160
OK, two war zones.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.780
But really, 10 years of that?

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:04.530
And we kept doing the jobs
no one else wanted to do.

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:07.850
And part of that was,
OK, we were Arabists.

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:09.309
OK, there's a
reason why you keep

00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:11.100
getting sent to these
places because that's

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.600
where a lot of the
conflict is going

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.360
on at this moment in time.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.420
It took me looking
back at my CIA career

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:24.270
to realize by taking the jobs
no one else wanted to do,

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:28.290
we had developed this level
of terrorism expertise

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.060
that I would sit
with my classmates

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:35.250
back at CIA headquarters
when I was on TDY,

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:37.590
and they would listen to
my stories of my meetings

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:41.760
with terrorists and be like, I
have nothing to relate to that.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.300
I've never done
anything like that.

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:49.380
I realize getting shafted
over and over again

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.940
was actually a career builder.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:55.650
And so I also realize that by
taking a couple of the projects

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:57.190
that no one else wanted to do--

00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:00.270
Jasmine and I talked about
this last night a little bit.

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:03.250
She did something similar.

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:04.500
And sometimes, you don't know.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:10.380
Somebody's giving you, like,
the project no one else wants.

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.850
There were a couple of
occasions when I did that.

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:15.250
And I said, like, I've
got to show my skills.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:18.210
And so I found some ways
to do these projects

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:20.520
to be unique and
creative and different.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.100
And when I actually handed
it back to the manager,

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:27.000
they were like, what is it that?

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.220
You actually did do the project.

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.180
I'm like, well, yeah.

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:30.930
You gave it to me.

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:32.630
I did it.

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:35.890
So there's something about doing
the things others don't want

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:38.789
and knocking the
ball out of the park.

00:43:38.789 --> 00:43:39.330
I don't know.

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:41.280
There's something to be
said in that strategy.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.870
I know that's not
the only strategy.

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:47.610
But that's one strategy
that worked for me.

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:51.100
AUDIENCE: So in your talk,
you mentioned that as a female

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:54.214
and constantly
smiling and people

00:43:54.214 --> 00:43:58.360
might think that you're being
naive and unprofessional,

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:02.416
especially in Washington,
DC [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:02.416 --> 00:44:05.220
And sometimes you only
interact with people briefly.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:11.317
So what's your strategy
to [INAUDIBLE]??

00:44:11.317 --> 00:44:13.650
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: I think
that it's really impossible

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:16.417
to do if you have a really
short interaction with someone.

00:44:16.417 --> 00:44:18.000
They're probably
gonna still walk away

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.170
from you after a five-minute
meeting or a two-minute meeting

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:24.170
or an introduction thinking
what they walked in.

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.490
So I think in order to
change people's minds,

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:27.810
you have to have some time.

00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:31.410
You have to have some
history with them.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:33.660
I figured out how to make
it work in those debriefings

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.060
because it had to happen
really, really quickly.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.870
But that was a very artificial,
compressed period of time.

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:42.300
We just had to get in that
room and get down to business.

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.360
But that was unusual.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:48.480
I think that often, I'm not a
person that feels comfortable

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.974
being like, yeah, I'm smart.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.110
I'm not one of those people
that feels comfortable

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:56.374
trying to self-promote.

00:44:56.374 --> 00:44:57.540
I don't like self-promotion.

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.400
But I think in some
cases, you have

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.920
to find some subtle
way to do that that

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:07.256
might be against your
nature in order to survive.

00:45:11.899 --> 00:45:16.507
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
if the CIA today,

00:45:16.507 --> 00:45:18.455
is it different than
when you joined?

00:45:18.455 --> 00:45:21.650
Or how much has it changed
since you've been there?

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:23.400
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD:
I don't know for sure

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:28.510
because when you leave
the CIA, you can only

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:31.150
stay in touch with people who
reach out to you because you

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:32.680
don't want to blow their cover.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.040
And so it's very tricky
about who you talk to.

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.520
And so it's not like I'm
still in touch with everyone.

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:42.010
So I am surmising that
probably nothing has changed

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:45.540
just because I've talked--

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:49.120
was that diplomatic enough?

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.880
Just because I talk to
women and men who served,

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.330
like, in the 1980s.

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:55.290
And I hear the same stories.

00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:59.410
And so nothing's
changed since 1982 .

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.930
It probably hasn't
changed in the six years

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:02.935
since I left the agency.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.540
AUDIENCE: In 2003,
the war was sold

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.620
to allies and the
American public in part

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.869
on the basis of information
developed by the CIA that

00:46:15.869 --> 00:46:16.660
proved to be false.

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:17.701
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: Yes.

00:46:17.701 --> 00:46:21.350
AUDIENCE: To what extent
did you feel pressure

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:23.154
to develop information
that supported

00:46:23.154 --> 00:46:25.546
a particular point of view?

00:46:25.546 --> 00:46:28.469
And to what extent
did you counter that?

00:46:28.469 --> 00:46:29.510
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: Yes.

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:34.100
So we were there
when that all was

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:38.060
happening because we were just
baby intelligence officers.

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:42.290
And so there was efforts
to try to find this elusive

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:43.940
information that
just didn't exist.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:55.910
There was a situation when my
husband's boss changed a report

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:59.630
to reflect something that didn't
actually happen in the meeting.

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:02.930
And he stood up and
said, that's not

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:04.430
what happened in the meeting.

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:07.610
And that information was of
such a consequential nature

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:10.770
it was going to end up in front
of the president and the White

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:12.830
House.

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:17.210
My husband basically got nixed
on his annual performance

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:22.890
because he stood up to his boss
and said that never happened.

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:24.667
So when I say the
CIA's a hostile work

00:47:24.667 --> 00:47:27.000
environment, that's the kind
of thing I'm talking about.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.825
So you have a decision.

00:47:29.825 --> 00:47:31.200
Are you gonna do
the right thing,

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.210
even if it means that you're
set back in your career?

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:38.570
Or are you just going
to toe the line?

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:41.780
But just to be fair, that
guy was very unusual.

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:44.600
I hope to never work with
someone like that again.

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.661
I didn't see that
in other places.

00:47:46.661 --> 00:47:48.660
I just saw that with that
particular individual,

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:50.910
a lot of fabrication going on.

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:54.500
But I wish that on
no one because that's

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:58.720
such a hard place to-- that's
such a awful place to be,

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.261
really.

00:48:00.261 --> 00:48:01.843
Does that answer your question?

00:48:01.843 --> 00:48:04.533
Yeah.

00:48:04.533 --> 00:48:06.032
AUDIENCE: I've got
another question.

00:48:06.032 --> 00:48:08.407
You keep mentioning your
husband as obviously in the CIA,

00:48:08.407 --> 00:48:09.800
or was with you.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.091
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: Was, yeah.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.654
AUDIENCE: We see
movies all the time.

00:48:14.654 --> 00:48:18.664
And I'm sure movies-- like,
we watch hacking in movies.

00:48:18.664 --> 00:48:20.455
It's like, oh, I'm
bypassing the mainframe.

00:48:20.455 --> 00:48:21.290
Oh, that's cool.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:22.790
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD:
Eyes roll back?

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:23.885
Yeah.

00:48:23.885 --> 00:48:26.820
AUDIENCE: How true
is it in your life

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.820
where you weren't allowed to
tell your extended family what

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:31.620
you actually did
or where you were?

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:36.637
Or did you have a cover
story for back home?

00:48:36.637 --> 00:48:38.720
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: So
it was really interesting.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.750
So as we were going through
that CIA recruitment process,

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:45.230
the recruiter said, be
careful who you tell

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:47.330
about the process you're
going through right now.

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:50.110
Because you can't
tell your 50 friends

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:51.860
that you're applying
to the CIA and you're

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.290
going through this
process, and then suddenly,

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:57.530
no, I'm just kidding.

00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:02.150
Then they also, once we got
into the CIA and we got hired,

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:05.930
you are allowed to tell
your immediate family,

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:09.110
but only if you think
they can handle it.

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:10.610
And so there are
some people-- like,

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:12.620
I had a colleague in
Baghdad whose family

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:16.130
thought she was working on
her PhD in the United States.

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:19.280
They had no idea she
worked for CIA, government.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.470
I'm like, how do you keep
that cover story running?

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:24.140
We're, like, eight-,
nine-hour time difference.

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:25.580
How do you do that?

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:28.737
I don't think she hardly
ever talked to her family.

00:49:28.737 --> 00:49:31.070
There were people who were
like, yeah, if I tell my mom,

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:33.400
she's gonna shout it
from the rooftops.

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.660
She's gonna be like, my
daughter's so awesome.

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:36.877
She works for the CIA.

00:49:36.877 --> 00:49:38.960
Or there was somebody who
was like, my dad's gonna

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.760
be watching the evening news
every night thinking he's

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.170
gonna see my face on there.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:43.620
And he can't handle it.

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:46.310
So you have to make this--

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:48.620
because they now have
to protect your cover

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.370
story when you tell them.

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:54.402
And they have to do it
convincingly for you.

00:49:54.402 --> 00:49:56.360
And if you pick up the
phone and you call home,

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.970
and they say, how are
things at the CIA,

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:00.410
they've blow your cover.

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:02.150
So you have to be
absolutely certain

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:04.640
that the few people
that you do tell

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:08.300
understand that your
life is on the line.

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:11.840
And they've got to protect you.

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:15.590
My husband's family, because
he's originally from Egypt,

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.700
were not American citizens.

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:19.700
And so we never told
them because we didn't

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:20.870
want to put them in danger.

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:26.210
I think towards the
end of our career,

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:29.630
before they passed away, I think
they suspected that something

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:30.660
else was going on.

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:33.850
And I think they were
proud of my husband, which

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:34.850
makes him feel good now.

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:37.444
But he was never actually
able to tell them.

00:50:37.444 --> 00:50:39.110
I think at one point
he said to his dad,

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:41.190
like a month before
he passed away,

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:46.010
you know, Dad, I've been
doing counterterrorism work.

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:48.231
And he goes, I know.

00:50:48.231 --> 00:50:49.480
Just shook his head like that.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:50.830
So I think he figured it out.

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:57.630
AUDIENCE: I have an
interesting question.

00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:59.643
What do terrorists want?

00:50:59.643 --> 00:51:01.587
Like, what do they really want?

00:51:01.587 --> 00:51:03.920
If they had a magic wand and
could make anything happen,

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.844
what is it?

00:51:04.844 --> 00:51:07.010
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: To
create this caliphate, which

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:10.050
they thought they were creating
in Syria, where they could

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:17.490
control this whole new
umma, the body of believers,

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:23.370
this political-religious
state firmly grounded

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:26.460
on their interpretation
of Sharia law.

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:29.610
And of course, the guys
that are terrorists really

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:31.140
want this to be
the woman doesn't

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:32.200
leave the home uncovered.

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.200
And the men are warriors.

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:38.190
And you give people a choice
to convert to Islam or die.

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:42.870
So their interpretation of
Islam is what you see on the TV.

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:48.630
And in their perfect world,
their idea of perfection

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:53.150
is this caliphate, really.

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.750
Yeah.

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:57.090
And the caliphate then being
used to then spread Islam

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:59.040
to the rest of the
world, and specifically

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:04.110
their interpretation of Islam,
and bringing that either

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:07.070
by missionary efforts or force.

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:10.140
AUDIENCE: So would you say that
in some ways they're idealists?

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:12.120
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: Yes.

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:13.140
Absolutely.

00:52:18.497 --> 00:52:21.180
AUDIENCE: So I have a question
about what is the reason

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:22.990
that you leave CIA?

00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:24.760
And then what's your current--

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:28.630
how do you think your current
career or life compared

00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:32.180
with previous [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:33.970
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD:
So after 10 years

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:37.930
of war zones and
working weekends,

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:42.130
working holidays, not
seeing your family

00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:46.890
except maybe once a
year for a couple weeks,

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:49.950
being undercover, working in
places where you're constantly

00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:51.420
looking for hostile
surveillance--

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:52.961
because we were in
places where there

00:52:52.961 --> 00:52:54.480
were carjackings
and kidnappings,

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:55.840
and al-Qaeda was running around.

00:52:55.840 --> 00:53:00.530
So it was like this really
intense and hard way to live,

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:02.190
where Joseph and
I are constantly

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:08.880
looking if somebody got an
AK-47 or an RPG aimed at us.

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:12.360
You just-- it's not
sustainable, that lifestyle.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:15.090
And we were exhausted.

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:18.660
And also, at that same time,
I felt this spiritual calling

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:19.650
to write this book.

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:23.700
And I knew that in order to help
inspire others with my story,

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:27.120
I had to do it in true name
versus pseudonym, which

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.980
meant I'd have to
leave the CIA, and I'd

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:32.370
have to request permission
to drop cover, which

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:33.460
is a big deal.

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.950
And they don't have to do it.

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:37.230
So after 10 years, we left.

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:41.670
And I actually started writing
this book, "Breaking, Cover,"

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:43.920
a year before I left the agency.

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:48.900
And now I feel so free.

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:53.560
Nobody's trying to shoot me,
most of the time, anyway.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.650
Yeah, I understand the
United States is still

00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:56.820
a dangerous place and all.

00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:01.590
But it's very different than
what our former lives were.

00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:06.360
The fact that I can be
sharing these stories with you

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:07.830
gives me intense--

00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:11.130
a lot of joy to share my
stories and inspire others.

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:14.054
And so I could not be
happier at the moment.

00:54:14.054 --> 00:54:16.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
very public events

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.136
affect your ability
to build trust

00:54:18.136 --> 00:54:23.557
with your contacts and your
ability to do your job?

00:54:23.557 --> 00:54:25.890
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: Public
events like speaking events?

00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:29.120
AUDIENCE: No, very public events
like Benghazi in the news.

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:31.230
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD:
Oh, sorry, sorry.

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:33.090
How do those events affect--

00:54:33.090 --> 00:54:36.400
AUDIENCE: Your ability to
develop that trust you need.

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:37.950
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: Got it.

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:41.670
You know, it's really hard to
tell your sources these days,

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:42.510
trust me.

00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:44.880
Your name will never get leaked.

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:48.030
I think there's just
been so many leaks.

00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:51.300
So much classified
information has come out.

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:52.860
And it's made our jobs--

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.840
I can tell you, every
time there was a leak

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.940
and we were still
working at the CIA,

00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:59.790
we had all kinds of sources
quit left and right.

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:03.770
Because once those names were
leaked, people lose lives.

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:07.650
They either had to get out of
Dodge, or they were killed.

00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:11.430
So it is very hard these days to
recruit new sources because we

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:14.160
can't really--

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:15.970
I can do everything
I can to protect you.

00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:18.660
But I can't help
what other people do.

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:20.600
So it's hard.

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:21.682
Yeah.

00:55:21.682 --> 00:55:25.380
AUDIENCE: So having
this picture of the CIA

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:30.864
as a bureaucratic good old
boy network, very [INAUDIBLE],,

00:55:30.864 --> 00:55:33.816
somewhat rigorous in
their determination, well,

00:55:33.816 --> 00:55:35.292
we've always done it this way.

00:55:35.292 --> 00:55:37.752
And at the same time, the
terrorist organization

00:55:37.752 --> 00:55:41.580
or something like the Westboro
Baptist Church meets the mafia,

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:42.610
are there any upsides?

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:44.776
I mean, this doesn't look
like a recipe for any sort

00:55:44.776 --> 00:55:48.510
of improvement, even long-term.

00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:50.280
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: Yeah.

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:56.040
I think that the CIA, there are
a lot of good people at the CIA

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:58.890
that succeed and protect
us every single day

00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:03.240
despite this bureaucratic
organization that is still

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:06.900
living like it's 1960.

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:10.680
We're gonna need some serious
strategic and visionary

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:12.300
leadership to change that.

00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:13.900
I don't see that happening.

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:15.000
I really don't.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.860
I'm a realist in that regard.

00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:18.240
Usually I'm an
optimist, but I've

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.448
been in long enough to
realize that it's probably not

00:56:20.448 --> 00:56:22.132
going to happen.

00:56:22.132 --> 00:56:24.090
But I think that the
world has changed so much,

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:26.070
and we're still pretending
like we're in a Cold War.

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:28.140
We haven't adjusted the
way that we carried out

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:31.030
operations to the new realities
that we're dealing with.

00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:33.720
So I think that we're
not doing as good a job.

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:36.540
America deserves better.

00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:37.950
I don't know how
to get us there.

00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:40.230
But even having these
talks, I hope in some way,

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:41.970
will influence
some people to join

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:44.340
who are going to be visionary
people in the future,

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:48.647
and maybe bring something
new and fresh to the CIA.

00:56:48.647 --> 00:56:51.105
AUDIENCE: What are your thought
on Edward Snowden's actions

00:56:51.105 --> 00:56:53.810
and what he revealed?

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:57.600
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: He put
a lot of people and sources

00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.830
in danger.

00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:03.840
So I don't have a very high
opinion of Mr. Snowden.

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.990
Let's just put it at that.

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:10.620
A lot of the programs
that he talked

00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:13.230
about were not secret
programs in the sense

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:14.820
that they weren't this--

00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:18.750
they were coordinated
amongst all

00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:22.890
of the entities in
Washington that have

00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:25.480
oversight over intelligence.

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:26.700
So it wasn't like a rogue--

00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:29.370
they weren't rogue
programs in that regard.

00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:31.170
The way that the
media makes it sound

00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:34.900
is as if they were the NSA
and its own rogue program.

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:36.652
But you have
congressional oversight,

00:57:36.652 --> 00:57:38.610
and you have this oversight
and that oversight.

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:44.430
So these programs were,
as I understand it,

00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:45.450
properly coordinated.

00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:49.190
But he released so
much information

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:54.230
that was so damaging to our
relationships with our allies

00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:55.250
abroad.

00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:59.660
I mean, all of our ambassadors
had to have meetings after that

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:02.334
where they basically were
told by the president

00:58:02.334 --> 00:58:04.250
or minister of interior
in that country, like,

00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:05.510
we can't trust you people.

00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:07.370
You guys can't keep
anything a secret.

00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:09.870
And so we're not going to
tell you secrets anymore.

00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:11.750
So our counterterrorism
fight has suffered.

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:15.470
Our ability to work
with our foreign powers

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:18.260
on law enforcement
and migration issues

00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:21.674
has suffered a great deal
because of that stuff.

00:58:21.674 --> 00:58:23.590
AUDIENCE: Is there any
sense of responsibility

00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:25.459
for if we weren't
spying on Americans,

00:58:25.459 --> 00:58:26.750
it wouldn't have been an issue?

00:58:28.867 --> 00:58:30.950
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD: Then
you get into the details

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:32.450
of is it spying?

00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:33.790
It's metadata collection.

00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:35.900
Then how are you using
it, and all of that stuff?

00:58:39.211 --> 00:58:39.710
Yeah.

00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:41.630
I mean because then
the question would

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:46.880
be to the oversight committees,
you thought that was OK.

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.710
But now we're telling you--

00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:50.780
if you disagree with
that, then there's

00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:53.689
a debate about should
we be doing this or not.

00:58:53.689 --> 00:58:55.730
JASMINE JAKSIC: Yeah, I
mean, this was a delight.

00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:58.031
Thank you for coming here
and sharing your experience

00:58:58.031 --> 00:58:58.530
with us.

00:58:58.530 --> 00:58:59.480
We really appreciate it.

00:58:59.480 --> 00:58:59.880
MICHELE RIGBY ASSAD:
Thank you, Jasmine.

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:00.780
Thank you, all.

00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:03.230
[APPLAUSE]
