00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.350
In this example there were several lines we couldn't really tell whether or

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.600
not it should be included in the final file.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.740
This is because it could've been added by one person or

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.840
they could have been removed by the other and we couldn't tell which was which.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.170
How could we solve this problem?

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.430
Well, it would definitely help to know what the file looked like at

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.670
the beginning of the day.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.230
If the original file looked like this, with the lines A, B and D,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.710
could we then determine for these unknowns whether or not they should appear?

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.360
Again, this is a hard question.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.580
Here's how I would go about it.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.040
For each line that's in Jake's file, but not in Rachel's, I would try to figure

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.720
out whether Jake added the chore, or whether Rachel removed it, and vice versa
