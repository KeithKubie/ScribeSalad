00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.240
I was hardly more than

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.679
a tourist when  I first went.

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.279
I just 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.210
gasped at seeing the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.500
extraordinary main temple and

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.539
and the great abundance of

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.019
monuments and I knew nothing about those things
in those days

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.029
I've seen simply stuck to it because

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.320
I realized there's nobody else doing the
job

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.910
so

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.060
it seemed to me that I would have fun

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.079
being

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.830
a bit of a 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.280
pioneer, I suppose you could say

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.780
and dealing with all sorts of challenges

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.080
of every kind, I mean

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.840
health and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.360
food supply and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.520
methods of 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.050
finding guides and so it was all just a
wonderful challenge.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.699
I of course soon realized I had to 
take flash photographs

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.250
and that really meant

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.960
using

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.600
two flashes, one as a fill in and another one

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.189
at a 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.920
raking angle

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.570
but of course I was

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.940
much more able as the photographer in those
days than I was as a draftsman the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.800
I mean even doing the drawings

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.810
I found I had to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.500
devise various conventions of drawing
and

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.829
I soon had to realize that I  had
really to

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.520
correct the drawings at night

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.740
because

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.470
as 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.640
the sculptures were in bare relief

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.420
and nearly always

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.049
rather eroded 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.950
there would be very fine remains of

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.619
incised lines, for instance, which were 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.610
almost obliterated by erosion,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.450
but by casting

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.969
the beam a light at a

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.690
low, at a raking angle,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.040
you could you could you

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.360
could retrieve them

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.139
and so that became an important part of the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.189
way I did things.

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:12.980
Draw them by day, do 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.279
as much as I could by day, and then go back
at night.

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:18.019
I really haven't changed my methods

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.959
very much

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.040
and I certainly think

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.699
I regard myself as very lucky as having stumbled
into all this.
