00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.820
Let's say that we've
got company A over here,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.910
and it takes out
a $1 million loan,

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.920
and it pays a variable
interest rate on that loan.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.430
It pays LIBOR plus 2%.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.830
And LIBOR stands for London
Interbank Offer Rate.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.720
It's one of the major benchmarks
for variable interest rates.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.840
And so it pays that
to some lender.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.620
This is the person who
lent company A the money.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.440
It pays them a variable
interest rate every period.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.570
So for example, in period
one if LIBOR is at 5%,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.520
then in that period, company
A will pay 7%, or $70,000

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.370
to the lender in that period.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.120
In period two, if
LIBOR goes, let's say

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.610
LIBOR goes down a
little bit to 4%,

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.680
then company A is going to
pay 4 plus 2, which is 6%,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.740
which is $60,000 in interest.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.100
Let's say that we have
another company, company B,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.390
right over here.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.980
It also borrows $1 million, but
it borrows it at a fixed rate.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.870
Let's say it borrows it
at a fixed rate of 8%.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.020
So in each period,
regardless of what

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.280
happens to LIBOR or any
other benchmark-- so

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.484
this is to probably another
lender, or different lender,

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:25.150
than the person that
A borrowed it from.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.608
And it could be a
bank, or it might

00:01:26.608 --> 00:01:28.660
be another company, or
an investor of some kind.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.710
We will call this
Lender 1 and Lender 2.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.990
So regardless of the
period, right now

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.620
company B will pay
8% of $1 million

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.760
in each period, which
is about $80,000,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.150
or exactly $80,000, each period.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.189
Now let's say that
neither of these parties

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.730
are really happy
with that situation.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.630
Company A doesn't
like the variability,

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.000
the unpredictability in
what happens to LIBOR,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.970
so they can't plan for
how much they have to pay.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.306
Company B feels like they're
overpaying for interest.

00:01:56.306 --> 00:01:58.930
They feel like, wow, the people
who are doing variable interest

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.510
rates, they're paying a
less amount of interest

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.920
every period.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.540
And maybe they also,
company B also,

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.280
thinks that interest rates
are going to go down,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.462
or that short term,
or that variable rate

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.420
is going to go down,
LIBOR is going to go down.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.880
So that's an even
bigger reason why

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.810
they want to become a
variable rate borrower.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.520
So what they can do,
and neither of them

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.186
can get out of these
lending agreements,

00:02:19.186 --> 00:02:21.910
but what they can do is
agree to essentially swap

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.730
some or all of their
interest rate payments.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.710
So for example, they can
enter into an agreement,

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.650
and this would be called an
interest rate swap, where

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.200
company A agrees
to pay B-- maybe,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.770
let's make up a number here-- 7%
on a notional $1 million loan.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.480
So, the $1 million will
never change hands,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.800
but company A agrees to pay B
7% of that notional $1 million,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.950
or $70,000 per period.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:01.210
And in return, company B agrees
to pay A a variable rate.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.690
Let's say it's LIBOR
plus 1%, right over here.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.200
And this little
agreement-- and they

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.325
agreed they would agree to
do this for some amount.

00:03:11.325 --> 00:03:13.180
And once again, this
is LIBOR plus 1%

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.629
on a notional $1 million.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.670
And that word notional
just means that $1 million

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.378
will never change
hands, and they're just

00:03:20.378 --> 00:03:24.080
going to exchange the interest
payments on $1 million.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.970
And this agreement
right over here

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.149
is called an interest rate swap.

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:32.190
And I'll leave you there.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.565
In the next video,
we'll actually

00:03:33.565 --> 00:03:38.920
go through the mechanics to
see that A is truly now paying

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.500
a fixed rate when you put in
all of their different payments

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.450
into both the swap
and the lender,

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.500
and Company B, after entering
into this swap agreement,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.660
is now really paying a
variable interest rate.
