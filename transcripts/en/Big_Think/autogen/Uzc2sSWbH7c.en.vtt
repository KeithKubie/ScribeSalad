00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.670
Immigration in the United States is a controversial
issue just as it is in most other countries

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.599
of the world.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.109
Many other of not just first-world countries,
like Japan, Australia, Western Europe are

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.590
wrestling with immigration, but many developing
countries.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:31.499
When I was last in Indonesia, Malaysia, Indonesia's
neighbor, is having a problem with Indonesians

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:36.750
migrating into Malaysia because the standard
of living in Malaysia is higher than in Indonesia.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.130
And South Africa, an African country, is having
issues with immigration with neighboring poorer

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.650
African countries such as Zimbabwe sending
immigrants into South Africa.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.130
So immigration in the United States the fact
is every American without exception, is an

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.130
immigrant.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.760
Native Americans immigrated 13,000 years ago,
and everybody else has immigrated within the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.230
last 400 years.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.479
My father immigrated at the age of 2 in 1904.

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.329
My mother's parents immigrated around 1890.

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.140
Most Americans are immigrants.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.310
If you look at the contribution of immigrants,
if you ask yourself, do a thought experiment:

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.110
take the citizens of any country in the world
out there, take the citizens of Poland or

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.400
Russia and divide them into two sets.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.670
Suppose you had a mechanism for dividing every
citizen of Poland into either two categories.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.140
One category are those people who are healthy,
ambitious, willing to take risks, willing

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.250
to try new ways, young, strong.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.760
And the other category consists of those people
who are weak, unwilling to take risks, unwilling

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.760
to experiment, wanting to carry on in their
old ways.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.280
In effect, dividing a country into those two
groups is what's accomplished by the decision

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.900
to emigrate.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.770
The decision to emigrate is made by people
who are healthy, strong, willing to undertake

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.810
risks, and face the unknown.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.280
And those who don't emigrate, on the average,
lack those qualities.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.490
But willing to take risks and experiment,
those are essential qualities for innovating.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.450
And the United States is a country of innovation.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.250
It's therefore, no surprise that the great
majority of American Nobel Prize winners are

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.130
either first-generation immigrants or the
children of first-generation immigrants.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.200
So immigration has made a strong contribution
to the history of the United States.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.120
But it's controversial because whenever you
get a batch of people who are there and then

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.390
another batch people coming who are different
the Vietnamese of the 1970s, etc. they are

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.460
different and there are likely to be prejudices.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.989
There have been prejudices against immigrants
throughout American history, beginning with

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.880
the first non-British immigrants, the Irish
and the Germans.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.300
And eventually, that settled down.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.180
Then the prejudice against the Eastern Europeans,
the Japanese and Europeans of the late 1800s,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.980
and then the prejudice against the Vietnamese.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.250
So it's unsurprising that immigration is an
issue in the United States today, but reflect

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.900
on our history.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.550
Students of immigration say that the United
States has benefited more from immigration

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.239
than any other country in the world, and that
for the United States, a higher percentage

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.569
of our immigrants are highly trained, skilled
people who contribute to our economy than

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.970
the immigrants into any other country in the
world.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.800
Yes, it's a problem for us.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.250
But we are better off than any other country
with that problem.
