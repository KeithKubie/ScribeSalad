oh hi I'm Missy gadelle I'm a chemical

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490
oh hi I'm Missy gadelle I'm a chemical
 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.130
oh hi I'm Missy gadelle I'm a chemical
engineering student at the University of

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140
engineering student at the University of
 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.470
engineering student at the University of
Minnesota I'd like you to explain your

work in a drawing no problem I take this

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019
work in a drawing no problem I take this
 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.000
work in a drawing no problem I take this
pen and this sheet of paper and what I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010
pen and this sheet of paper and what I
 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.439
pen and this sheet of paper and what I
can do with I cannot explain the wood

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449
can do with I cannot explain the wood
 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.170
can do with I cannot explain the wood
spintronics in a few minutes but I can

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180
spintronics in a few minutes but I can
 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.960
spintronics in a few minutes but I can
explain for example the giant

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970
explain for example the giant
 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.919
explain for example the giant
magnetoresistance geumja so I suppose

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929
magnetoresistance geumja so I suppose
 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.160
magnetoresistance geumja so I suppose
that on the way of the electron in a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
that on the way of the electron in a
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.930
that on the way of the electron in a
conductor I put two thin layer of

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
conductor I put two thin layer of
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.869
conductor I put two thin layer of
magnetic material and I suppose further

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
magnetic material and I suppose further
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.270
magnetic material and I suppose further
that the magnetization are in the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280
that the magnetization are in the
 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.490
that the magnetization are in the
opposite direction this is a North Pole

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500
opposite direction this is a North Pole
 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.500
opposite direction this is a North Pole
yes on the top and the South Pole is at

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
yes on the top and the South Pole is at
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.350
yes on the top and the South Pole is at
the bottom of this layer it's not spall

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360
the bottom of this layer it's not spall
 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.010
the bottom of this layer it's not spall
yeah

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020
yeah
 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.319
yeah
and so the basic physics is that the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
and so the basic physics is that the
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.369
and so the basic physics is that the
electron depending on the spin can cause

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379
electron depending on the spin can cause
 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.710
electron depending on the spin can cause
this layer is a spin is parallel to the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
this layer is a spin is parallel to the
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.679
this layer is a spin is parallel to the
magnetization so this one will be able

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689
magnetization so this one will be able
 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.969
magnetization so this one will be able
to cause this layer but then will not be

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979
to cause this layer but then will not be
 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.399
to cause this layer but then will not be
able to cause a second one it will be

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
able to cause a second one it will be
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.380
able to cause a second one it will be
reflected

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390
reflected
 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.240
reflected
if one consider the spin down electrons

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250
if one consider the spin down electrons
 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.420
if one consider the spin down electrons
there as I cannot cross even the first

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430
there as I cannot cross even the first
 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.080
there as I cannot cross even the first
layer so the current is stupid by this

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090
layer so the current is stupid by this
 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.810
layer so the current is stupid by this
association of two layers with opposite

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
association of two layers with opposite
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.670
association of two layers with opposite
magnetization not totally but all this

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
magnetization not totally but all this
 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.280
magnetization not totally but all this
is is same situation so now I suppose

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
is is same situation so now I suppose
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.100
is is same situation so now I suppose
that that by applying a magnetic field I

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110
that that by applying a magnetic field I
 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.969
that that by applying a magnetic field I
align the magnetization of the two layer

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979
align the magnetization of the two layer
 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.899
align the magnetization of the two layer
then for the spinner policy spinner will

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
then for the spinner policy spinner will
 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.050
then for the spinner policy spinner will
be able to cause surface one but also

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060
be able to cause surface one but also
 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.639
be able to cause surface one but also
the second one the spin on electron will

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649
the second one the spin on electron will
 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.649
the second one the spin on electron will
be repelled of course but the Alpha the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659
be repelled of course but the Alpha the
 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.350
be repelled of course but the Alpha the
current will be able to cause the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360
current will be able to cause the
 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.460

the way to the electrical currents this
 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.450
the way to the electrical currents this
is what you use in your computer you've

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460
is what you use in your computer you've
 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.110
is what you use in your computer you've
detect the magnetic field generated by

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120
detect the magnetic field generated by
 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.520
detect the magnetic field generated by

magnetization of two layers this open

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500
magnetization of two layers this open
 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.980
magnetization of two layers this open
the weight of the current and you can

detect the magnetic bit in fact this

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270
detect the magnetic bit in fact this
 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.500
detect the magnetic bit in fact this
works if this spin up cannot flip spins

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510
works if this spin up cannot flip spins
 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.630
works if this spin up cannot flip spins
during the travel between the two layers

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640
during the travel between the two layers
 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.040
during the travel between the two layers
in fact each one knows that he will keep

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050
in fact each one knows that he will keep
 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.080
in fact each one knows that he will keep
his spin only on a short distance of a

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090
his spin only on a short distance of a
 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.220
his spin only on a short distance of a
few nanometers and so what is necessary

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230
few nanometers and so what is necessary
 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.020
few nanometers and so what is necessary
is that the distance between the two

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030
is that the distance between the two
 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.440
is that the distance between the two
layer must be short with me in the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450
layer must be short with me in the
 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.160
layer must be short with me in the
nanometer scale and this is why also

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170
nanometer scale and this is why also
 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.759
nanometer scale and this is why also
spintronics the cool start only with the

spintronics the cool start only with the
 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.480
spintronics the cool start only with the
