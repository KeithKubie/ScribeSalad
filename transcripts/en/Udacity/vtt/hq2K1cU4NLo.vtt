00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.700
We've learned so far that BRCA1 exerts its

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.020
main effect by aiding the DNA repair machinery in

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.480
breast cells. But obviously there are a lot

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.220
of other factors, both genetic and environmental that contribute

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.770
to one, the overall mutation rate in a

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.310
cell as well as the cell's ability to repair

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.370
those mutations. Other environmental factors that generally effect

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.370
DNA mutation and repair could be things like UV

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.480
exposure, particularly for tissues in your skin, or

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.940
cigarette smoking, particularly affecting tissues in your lungs.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.010
These can increase the chance for DNA damage.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.550
Thus making it more likely that a repair

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.900
may not happen. And there are even more

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.200
genetic and non-genetic factors that contribute to risk

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.060
in far less well understood ways. For most

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.430
women who develop breast cancer, it's due to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.810
a combination of many of these different environmental and genetic

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.715
factors. Let's say that we have two women who've been

00:00:56.715 --> 00:01:00.870
analyzed for eight genetic factors associated with risk for breast

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.950
cancer. At the end of the test we see that

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.489
they have same alleles for each of these eight genetic

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.790
factors. They both test same for each of those eight

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.300
alleles and thus they have the same calculated risk for

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.750
breast cancer. But one of the women goes onto develop

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.920
breast cancer, whereas the other one does not. I want you to tell me how

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.240
or why this is even possible. They had the same genetic makeup for these eight

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.510
genetic factors. They had the same calculated

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.070
genetic risk but one got breast cancer and

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.260
the other one didn't. Go ahead and put your answer in the text box here.
