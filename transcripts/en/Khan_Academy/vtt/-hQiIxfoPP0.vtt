00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.080
- [Instructor] During his
trip to the Vancouver Zoo,

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.580
a man was shocked when an escaped baboon

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.650
stole his ice cream.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.460
Afraid of sustaining serious injuries,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.950
the man consented to the baboon

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.840
that he keep the ice cream,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.070
which wasn't his favorite flavor anyway.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.440
I also would consent to a baboon

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.890
that was trying to eat my ice cream.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.700
But, anyway, let's see if this
is the best way to say that.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.180
So, the man consented to the baboon

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.590
that he keep the ice cream.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.750
So, this is a little bit strange,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.530
especially because the man
consented to the baboon

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.790
that he, who's he referring to?

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.540
I mean, we know, he know the ice cream,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.080
that the baboon keep the ice cream,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.730
but it still feels a little bit,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.410
or is he talking about he,
the man, he, the baboon?

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.800
It feels like a little bit of
a clumsy way of saying this.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.900
So, let's see the other
choices, how those work.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.400
So, the man let the
baboon keep the ice cream,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.170
which wasn't his favorite flavor anyway.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.413
So, that one actually
doesn't seem too bad.

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:01.810
So, let's see, afraid of
sustaining serious injuries,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.100
the man let the baboon keep the ice cream,

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.460
which wasn't his favorite flavor anyway.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.280
Yeah, this seems, this seems decent.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.530
Afraid of sustaining serious injuries,

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.500
the man granted the baboon permission

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.160
to keep the ice cream,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.040
which wasn't his favorite flavor anyway.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.920
This seems like a very formal thing to do

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.840
while a baboon's trying
to eat your ice cream.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.183
Now, this is way too wordy
and just kind of weird.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.060
Afraid of sustaining serious injuries,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.220
the man authorized the baboon,

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.700
authorized the baboon
to keep the ice cream.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.681
That, too, feels a little bit bureaucratic

00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:38.060
for what's going on.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.830
I think the man just let the
baboon keep the ice cream.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.130
Nice and clean, to the
point, it is concise,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.070
it is the way that most
human beings actually talk,

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.700
and it doesn't sound like something

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.760
that's happening at city hall.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.320
So, yeah, the man let the
baboon keep the ice cream.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.270
Even consented to the baboon that he keep,

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.820
this is very clumsy and he was consenting

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.110
for someone else to keep ice cream

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.803
is not how we talk in everyday life.
