00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.420
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Good afternoon.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.920
My name is Georgette Dorn and I'm
the chief of the Hispanic division

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.340
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.870
It's a pleasure to welcome all of
you here on behalf of the Library

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.800
of Congress and the
Hispanic division

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.670
and it is even a greater pleasure
to welcome Sergio Waisman,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.970
my [inaudible] from Argentina.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.840
Sergio is a professor at George
Washington University since 2003.

He has a PhD from the University of
California Berkley and a Master's

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.190
from US Colorado in
creative writing.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.390
He teaches comparative literature
and Latin American literature.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.020
He wrote a book on
Borges and Translation,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.480
which I have to read I'm sure.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.120
[Inaudible] his translations
of six books

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.720
by Latin American authors including
the Absent City by Ricardo Piglia

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.480
for which he received a national
endowment fellowship award.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.220
His first book, Leaving
[inaudible], was a great success.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.580
He also translated
[inaudible] by Maria Venezuela.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.590
We have 11 books in the
library under his name.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.820
The commentators are going to be
Gwen Kirkpatrick who is professor

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.930
and chair of literature
in Spanish and Portuguese

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.690

She has a PhD from
Princeton University.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.430
She is the author of
Dissonant Legacy of Modernism.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.590
She is co-author of Women, Culture,
and Politics in Latin America.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.660
She has nine books under
her title, under her name

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.960
in the Library of Congress
[laughter].

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.450
Laura Demaria is a
professor of literature

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.770
at Maryland University,
US of Maryland.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.180
She started at university
[inaudible] and has a PhD

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.280
from Wharton University
in Saint Louis.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.810
She teaches 19 century, 20 century

Has published a collection of
short stories and also [inaudible].

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.480
She has five books in the
library under her name [laughter].

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.960
Thank you.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:29.300
[ Applause ]

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.450
&gt;&gt; Gwen Kirkpatrick:
Thank you Georgette.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.680
It's a real pleasure to be in
the Library of Congress and to be

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.840 position:56%
with Sergio and Laura and Georgette.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.270
The Library of Congress is a
very important place for me

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.940
and for our students as well and
for the country and the world.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.940 position:56%
Georgette stole a bit of my
thunder, but I think I will go ahead

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.940
and read what, somewhat different.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.760
Sergio Waisman is a
translator/writer and professor

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.990
of Spanish and Latin
American literature

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.980
at George Washington University
and until recently liberated,

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.410 position:56%
he served as chair of the department

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.340
of modern languages
and literatures at GW.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.620
He did that a long time.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.770
His book Borges and Translation:

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.780
Irreverence of the Periphery has
been published in English, Spanish,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.380
and Italian and has become
an indispensable reference

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.250
for the study of Borges.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.210
As a novelist, Sergio has
written Leaving [inaudible]

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.680
about a bilingual and
bicultural life

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.230
with wonderful baseball stories.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.160
That's what always stays.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.220
He integrates translation
and the theory of translation

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.340
into both his critical
and his creative work.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.780
As Sylvia Malloy has stated,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.380
for Waisman translation is
a creative critical concept

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.720
that signifies both
the way of reading

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.410
and thinking about literature.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.840
Sergio doesn't just translate
contemporary fiction,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.970
he's taken on the task
of 19 century,

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.080
many different styles
of the 19 century works.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.870
He has translated for
Oxford University Press,

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.890
works of [foreign language
spoken] and with Kelly Washburn,

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.250
a collection of [inaudible] Poetry.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.680
I recommend very highly, including
[foreign language spoken] the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.430
Penguin edition of the Mexican
classic, the Underdogs by Azuela.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.960
Several novels and short story
collections by Ricardo Piglia,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.360
whom we have today and the writings
of Juan Jose Sierra among others.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:59.060
He received an NEH translation
fellowship award for his work

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.260
with Piglia's [foreign language
spoken], the Absent City.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:14.110
Sergio received his PhD from the
University of California Berkley

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:22.410
and an MA in creative writing from
the University of Colorado Boulder

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.130
and this is full disclosure.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:32.890
Sergio had a class with me when
he was an undergraduate [laughter]

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.470
and I also worked with
him when he was

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.130
in the doctoral program at Berkley.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.900
I didn't direct his dissertation,
I won't take credit for that,

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.990
but I was on his committee and
it was, it's a wonderful stroke

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.130
of fortune that our lives have
intersected again in Washington.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.460
At Berkley, I remember
that his research on Borges

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.840
and on James Joyce
impressed scholars

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.210
from both Spanish and English.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.910
No small feat.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.350
His areas of research in teaching
include Latin American literature

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.740
and culture with a focus

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.630
on the southern [inaudible]
literary translation in theory,

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.660
comparative literature, and
Jewish Latin American literature.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.880
The novel he is presenting
today Target

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.720
in the Night [foreign
language spoken] prize

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.470
for the best Latin
American novel of the year.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:37.690
Very big prize and in 2015, Piglia
was awarded the Formentor prize

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.710
for lifetime contribution
to literature.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.730
Widely regarded as Argentina's most
important living writer, for me,

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.610
at least, each of Piglia's
novels comes as a surprise.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.200
Even though he often uses
the journalist Emilio Remse

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.910
as a kind alter ego in his novels.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:06.210
Remse often has trouble getting
to the heart of the matter.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.770
The novel at hand is partly
an odd ball detective story

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.400
where Porta Rican charmer from New
Jersey is murdered in a sleepy town

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.040
in the Pompous in the
late 60's, unlikely.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.420
[Laughter] and partly a
family saga of fortune,

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.100
corruption, and perhaps incest.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:36.120
The late 60's in Argentina showed
signs of what will come later.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.420
Some isolated gorilla plots,
planning for the return of Parone,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.640
and the full blown
crisis that begins

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.180
with Parone's return
and death in 1974.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.990
And then the long dictatorship.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:58.730
This novel only obliquely refers to
political events, but it represents

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:03.920
on a small town scale the reach
of money, judicial corruption,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.320
and the sacrifice of entrapped
innocence or at least those

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.140
who appear to be innocent.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:16.920
Gaucho's industrialist beautiful
perplexing women, jockeys,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.560
Japanese Argentine hotel
workers are just a few

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.120
of the characters whose
lives we encounter.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.870
Some of whom Gaucho
style, are wary enough

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.970
to say very little
and make no waves.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:38.340
The detective Crochet, who
seems to be the only one

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:44.610
who knows the true story, however,
talks and writes much too much.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.430
Flooding the town with
anonymous letters.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.930
Do we know too much?

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.590
Or too little in the flood
of information we receive?

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.520
Whose words matter?

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.110
And in which context?

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:06.960
In retrospect, 2015, we
know that this context even

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.390
in small town Pompous
life was to be explosive

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.680 position:56%
and this is what Sergio can explain.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.510
Thank you for your
translations Sergio.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:30.110
[ Applause ]

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.410
&gt;&gt; Sergio Waisman: It's
really pleasure to be here.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.710
Thank you Georgette.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.520
Thank you [inaudible] for
organizing and Gwen and Laura

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.430
for being here with me today.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:46.080
Translation is very difficult,
a lot of work, a lot of time,

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.010
and it's really a pleasure and
an honor to arrive at this point

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.510
and there were plenty of
times in the last few years

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.130
where I thought I would never
get to this point [laughter].

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.100
I'm so glad to be here.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:03.650
I know that a number of
people here also know Spanish,

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.140
so I just want my ideas
to read a little bit.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.210
I'm going to read the
opening paragraph in Spanish

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.190
and then switch to English.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.050
I'll read very briefly to
give you a sense of the novel.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:18.970
Blanco Nocturno: Target in
the Night by Ricardo Piglia.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.070
Because the novel is a literary
thriller of kinds and because

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:30.220
so much depends not only on
the story, but also the feel,

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.740
the tone of the narrative I
wanted to read the beginning

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.960
to give you a sense
of what it's like.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:42.540 position:56%
Also I remember when Piglia finished
this and I coincided with a visit.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.540
I have this very clear image of him
at his computer turning back at me

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.160
to look at me very excited
because he had gotten,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.500 position:56%
he had finished the first paragraph.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.740
He had the whole novel
written, but he had finally,

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.230
finalized the first paragraph

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.620
and it I could just see him
right there looking back

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.950
and reading the opening
paragraph and so I want to read

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.510
that in Spanish and then I'll
switch to the translation.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:53.220
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.410
So that's the opening
of Blanco Nocturno

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.560
and the opening of
Target in the night.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.460
Tony Duran was an adventurer
and a professional gambler

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.600
who saw his opportunity
to win the big casino

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.680 position:56%
when he met the Bella Donna sisters.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.520
It was a ménage a trois that
scandalized the town and stayed

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.410
on everyone's mind for months.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.950
He'd show up with one of the
two sisters at the restaurant

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.320
at the Plaza Hotel, but no
one could ever tell with which

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.180
because the twins were so alike

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.480
that even their handwriting
was indistinguishable.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.390
Tony was almost never seen
with both at the same time.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.450
That was something he kept private.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.180
What really shocked
everyone was the thought

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.490
of the twins sleeping together.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.560
Not so much that they
would share the same man,

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.880
but that they would
share each other.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.300
Soon the rumors turned into
stories and elaborate tales

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.310
and before long no one could
talk about anything else.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.550
People went on about it
throughout the day in their homes

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.870
or at the social club or
at the store and tavern.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.900
Everyone had a detail to
add commenting as easily

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.190
as if they were talking
about the weather.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:58.970
In that town, like in all the towns
in the Provence of [inaudible],

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.390
more news was batted
around in a single day

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.770
than in any large city in a week.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.290
The difference between regional
and national news was so vast

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.720
that the residence could
retain the illusion

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.600 position:56%
that they lived an interesting life.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.280
Duran had come to enrich
that in mythology

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.810
and his figure reached legendary
heights long before the time

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.010
of his death.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.210
You could take Tony's comings
and goings through the town

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.970
and draw a map from them.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.050
An outsiders ramblings along
the elevated sidewalks,

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.390
his walks to the outskirts

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.470
of the abandoned factory
and the deserted fields.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.430
He deciphered the older
and hierarchies

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.130
of the place in short order.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.130
The dwellings and houses stand
clearly divided according

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.630
to its social level of inhabitance.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.650
The territories seems to have been
drawn by a snobbish cartographer.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.420
The wealthy live at the top of
the hill and then the circle

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.760
of about eight blocks is the
so-called historical center of town

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.740
which includes the square,
the town hall, the church,

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.010
and the main street with the
stores and two story houses.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.590
Finally, slopping down
on the other side

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:04.060
of the railroad tracks are the
poor neighborhoods where over half

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.550
of the darker skin
population lives and dies.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.080
Tony's popularity and the envy he
arouse among the men could have led

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.890
to anything, but in the end his
downfall was simply a matter

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.410 position:56%
of chance, which is what had
brought him here in the first place.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.750
It was incredible to see such an
elegant [foreign language spoken]

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.100
in that town full of bask and
[foreign language spoken] Gauchos.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.580
A man who spoke Spanish
with a Caribbean accent,

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.320
but looked as if he
came from the Provence

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.620
of [inaudible] or from [inaudible].

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:36.660
A mysterious foreigner lost in the
town, a mysterious foreigner lost

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.580
in a lost town in the
middle of the Pompous.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.840
And now I'm going to jump
and just read a couple

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.200 position:56%
of very short fragments along the
way to give you a sense of the novel

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.040
without providing any spoilers.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.060
[ Laughter ]

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.890
If I can. So no spoilers.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.240
So Ricardo Piglia and almost all

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.530
of his books he has this
recurrent character, Emilio Remse,

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.210
who is an alter ego of types.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.750
He's also, early on in his
career Piglia also used Remse

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.040
as a sudo name to sign
some of his own works.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.880
So it's a very complicated
double of the author.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.740 position:56%
Remse, in any case, goes to this
small town to investigate this crime

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.710
and what he finds, what he
investigates is the crime

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.650
and it's a lot more than that.

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:34.670
And locally there's this inspector
Crochet, as Gwen mentioned,

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:38.810
and these two investigative
figures carry out different kinds

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.890
of investigations and then
at times they come together

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:46.200
and discuss the intrigue that
they're trying to resolve and that,

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.070 position:56%
which is the intrigue that the
reader is trying to resolve as well.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.260
And so this is a small
part where Remse

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:57.280
and Crochet are working together or
discussing the situation together

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.970
to try to figure out what
exactly is going on in this town.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.020
When he spoke with someone,
this is inspector Crochet,

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.020
he was forced to choose
certain thoughts.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.920 position:56%
It was impossible to say everything.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.350
He always tried to have his
interlocutor reflect with him

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:20.510
and arrive at his own
conclusions even before him.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.600
That was how he could
trust his reasoning

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.450
because someone else would
have thought it with him.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:29.230
In this he was like everyone
else who was too intelligent;

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.880
[inaudible] Sherlock Holmes,
and needed an assistant to think

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.030
with him and to keep him
from falling into delirium.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:39.390
And Remse comes to
service and assist him.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:45.850
An intellectual interlocutor for
Crochet in the story of this crime.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:50.630
One of the hardest
things to translate

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.310
of this novel was actually
translating the title;

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.360
Blanco Nocturno.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.440
So blanco, as most people
know is the color white,

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.590
but that's not the
only being in Spanish.

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:06.970
Blanco is also a target [foreign
language spoken] and we went back

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:12.540
and forth many times with the title

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:16.860
and whereas white nocturne
was a possibility.

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:21.330
In the end I went with Target
in the Night in part to try to,

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:26.310
because the novel is very
much about this target

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:32.360
and even though it's not
always clear what the target is

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:37.610
and also there was something
about the noir-ish feeling

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:42.010
or the detective side,
which seemed to go better,

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.810
work better with Target
in the Night.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.290
And so this is one
very brief section

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.320 position:56%
where the title is actually
mentioned in Spanish and so I wanted

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.720
to explain this and then you can
hear how it sounds in English

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.630
with the Target in the Night.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.090
So this is Crochet
and Remse together.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.390
They're investigating.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.900 position:56%
They headed out of town in Crochet's
car at midnight on a side road

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.570
that bordered the district
line toward [inaudible].

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:08.120
They drove across the
countryside avoid the fences

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.310
and the still animals.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.790
The moon was occasionally
covered by the clouds.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:14.930
So Crochet would use the
search light attached

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.230
to the side of his car.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.780
A bright bulb with a handle
that could be adjusted by hand.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.660
All of a sudden, in
the illuminated circle,

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.650 position:56%
they saw a rabbit paralyzed by fear.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:30.840 position:56%
White, motionless like an apparition
in the middle of the dark.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.420
Caught in the light beam,
it was a target in the night

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.390
and now there's foot note and
I'll read you the foot note.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:41.480
Ten years after the events
narrated in this story,

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.320
on the eve of the [inaudible]
war, Remse say in the garden

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.930
that English soldiers were
equipped with infrared glasses

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:52.090 position:56%
that allowed them to see in the dark
and fire at targets in the night.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:55.260
As he read this, Remse remembered
that night in the country

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.550
with the paralyzed rabbit in
the beam of the search light

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.590
from Crochet's car and realized

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.370
that the war was lost
before it had begun.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.740
That's the end of the foot note.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.280
This is Piglia's foot
note, not mine.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.690
And now back to the narrative.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.480
It was a target in the night
that they quickly left behind.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.540
They drove for several hours
bumping along because of the pits

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.800
in the road, staring
at the silver lines

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.050
of the wire fences under the stars.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.100
Finally, turning off at a
wooded path, they saw a glow

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.340
from a lighted window of a
country house in the distance.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.850
By the time they reached the
source and were getting close

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.340
to the small house, dawn
was starting to break

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.920
on the horizon turning
everything a pinkish hue.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.380
Remse, excuse me.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.170
Remse got out and opened the gate
so the car could enter and go

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.660
down a narrow road
surrounded by bushes.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.590
A peasant was sitting on a bench

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.080
under the house eves
drinking [inaudible].

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.740
A patrol officer was
dozing off nearby,

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.040
leaning back against the tree.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.340 position:56%
I'm interrupting myself at any point

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.040
where I don't want to
give away anything.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.070
[ Laughter ]

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:03.810
Right, so it's hard to read from
a literary, a thriller because I'd

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.390
like you to get a little sense
of the novel, but I don't want

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:12.510
to give away the, the, yeah the
thriller, the thrill of the plot.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:16.110
[ Laughter ]

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:20.130
While he's in this town, there was
mention of the Bella Donna sister's

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:24.890
from the beginning and when Remse
goes to investigate his part

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.930
of the investigation, he meets
everybody in town and he strikes

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:32.390
up a relationship with one of
the sisters and there is some,

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:38.910
the novel in addition to
this thriller, noir-ish tone,

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.660
which hopefully you've been
hearing as I've been reading along,

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.340
it also has some other
sections which are written

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.810
in a slightly different style
and this is one of these.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:52.350
And here we have Remse with one

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.820
of the Bella Donna
sisters, with Sophia.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.240
Night had fallen over the house.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.060
They were still sitting on the
chairs out on the back porch,

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.400
mostly in the dark except
for a small lamp behind them

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.620
in the living room looking out
over the peaceful back gardens

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.300
and the lights beyond.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.250
After a while Sophia got up
and put a Moby Grape album

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.680
on the turntable and
started to move.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.580
Dancing in place to Changes.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.880
I like Traffic.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.180
I like Cream.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.730
I like Love she said
and sat down again.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:25.910
I love the band names
and I love their music.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:29.510
I love Moby Dick, that's
what Remse says.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:30.810
I'm sure you do.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.420
Take your books away from
you and you'd be buck naked.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.720
My mother is the same.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.970
The only time she's relaxed
is when she's reading.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.560
As soon as she stops
reading she's a nervous mess.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.550
Crazy when she doesn't read,
not crazy when she reads.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:45.850
See her over there?

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.440
See that light across the yard?

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.330
There was a guest house
across the back gardens

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:54.040
with two large lit windows through
which one could see a woman,

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.640
her white hair pulled back, reading
and smoking on a leather arm chair.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.330
She looked as if she
were in another world.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.560
All of a sudden she
took off her glasses,

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.350
reached back with her right hand
without looking to grab a blue book

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.440
from a bookshelf out of sight.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.170
She put the page up against her
face, then put her round glasses

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:16.350
on again, settled back in the
tall arm chair and kept reading.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.620
She reads all the time, Remse said.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.000
She's the reader Sophia said.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.960
And finally --

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.460
Another brief scene in which
we have both inspector Crochet

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.880
and Emilio Remse together.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.120
So Crochet says to Remse, you read
too many detective novels kid.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.690
If you only knew what
things were really like.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.670
Order doesn't always get restored.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.050 position:56%
The crime doesn't always get solved.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:53.510
There's never any logic to it.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.990
We struggle to establish the
causes and the [inaudible] effects,

00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:01.660
but we're never able to understand
the entire network of the intrigue.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.020
We isolate facts, we stop
in front of a few scenes

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.120
and we question a handful
of witnesses,

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.480
but for the most part we
move blindly in the dark.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.310
The closer you are to the target,

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.970
the more you get tangled
in a web without end.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.490
Crochet got up ceremoniously
and gave him a hug.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.790
This is a point where
they're about to split up.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.480
Then he thumped down again in his
chair and leaned over his notes

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.670
and [inaudible] distracted.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:34.350
I said Remse, we're already gone.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:35.820
The story goes on.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.120
It can go on.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.420
There are several possible
conjectures.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.040
The story remains open.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.770
The investigation has no end.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.580
The investigation cannot end.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.710
Someone should invent
a new detective genre;

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:48.870
paranoid fiction, it
should be called.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.170
Everyone is a suspect.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.260
Everyone feels pursued.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.510
Thank you very much.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:24:09.520
[ Applause ]

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.100
&gt;&gt; Laura Demaria: I'm
short [laughter].

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.430
Okay thank you so much Sergio
Waisman for letting me part

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:20.400
of this presentation and I'm
going to do, before we start,

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.860
the way that we visualized this
part was a dialogue between Sergio

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:29.210
and myself, but before doing
that I'm going to do something

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:34.940
that I tell my students never to
do; that is to get inside the mind

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:40.700
of the author and said what he
or she is thinking and I'm going

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:45.110
to get inside Ricardo Piglia's
mind and I'm going to say

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:49.720
that he will love, he would
have loved to be here.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:55.280
There is a quote that I have
heard Ricardo Piglia quote many,

00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:01.010
many times and that quote is from
Faulkner and it says as this;

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:06.250 position:56%
I wrote that book, the Son of the
Fury, Faulkner says that Piglia says

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:11.680
that he says [laughter] and I
learn how to write, how to read.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:17.960
I would like to repeat that with
a torsion and I would like to say

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:25.770
that I read Ricardo Piglia's books,
any book, and I truly learn how

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.390
to read and how to write.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:33.700
So in a way I feel that
what has done Sergio Waisman

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.880
with his translation of
Ricardo Piglia's book is

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:43.260
to let other people know how
to read and how to write.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.110
So thank you Sergio for doing that,

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:53.540
but now my first question has
a kind of an introduction.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.100
[Foreign language spoken],
the last reader at the center,

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:02.490
we can visualize a writer that
reads many books, but at the center

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:06.510
of that book there is
a writer that writes

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:09.580
and reads, but there is no library.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.740
There is a city and there's a cave.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.580
You could see, however,
the plain relationship

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.170
between a reader and a book.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:26.280
A scene, a reading scene [foreign
language spoken] that it multiples

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.560
in many, many readers
throughout the pages.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:34.280
Real readers, fictional readers,
and you have [inaudible],

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:41.250 position:56%
you have Kafka, you have Borges, you
have [inaudible] just to name a few.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:46.350
In that change of readers, in
that changes of scenes of reading,

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.450
there are no translators.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:52.450
So here I proposed a different
reading scene [foreign language

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:57.270
spoken] that it's not at the
[foreign language spoken].

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.930
A translator reading a book.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.870
He or she is translating that book.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:11.860
A translator under a lamp reading a
book in order to create, construct,

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:17.170
displays, that version
he or she has in front.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:22.240
Or to put in another way,
Sergio Waisman reading Piglia

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.030
in his basement in Kensington.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:27.050
[ Laughter ]

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.330
Reading Piglia word by word,

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:35.980
sentence by sentence
advancing slowly into the book.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:41.090
Not only as a reader,
but as something else.

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:45.650
That something else, that
relationship between author

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:50.040
and translator is at the
core of this new encounter.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.780
So Sergio Waisman, complete
for us that close relationship

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.950
between author and translator.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:01.770
You have talked about it a
little bit with me before.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.240
We haven't rehearsed this,

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:09.160
but I would like to know how
a translator reads differently

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.590
from us.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:14.510
We are all readers, but
you read with a purpose.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:19.860
You read with a goal and at the
end your reading materializes

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:25.100
in something else in a new book and
that's something that I cannot do.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.970
So that's my first question.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.200
&gt;&gt; Sergio Waisman:
We're just going to,

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:36.920
I'm going to come back
to answer the question.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.700
So thank you Laura.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:45.420
Right so translation is very
complicated and I think I've spent,

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:49.550
I think I've dedicated my life
to translating and my adult life

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.850
to thinking about translation.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:59.490
So one of the things about, the
first thing that I would say is

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:03.060
that for the most part it is
true that translation and the act

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:07.120
of translation is very close
to reading and that the scene

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.010
of translation is very close
to the scene of the reader.

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:12.320
And that that's the
perfect starting point

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.580
and in a way it's also
the perfect ending point.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:19.700
Much like reading, the scene of
translation, a lot happens there

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.530
and most of it is invisible.

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:25.500
So I mean not only because
it happens in this basement

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:30.420
in the suburb, but also because
a lot it happening with two

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.850
or more languages, two or more
text, two or more cultures,

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:40.260
trying to bridge huge
distances; linguistic, cultural

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:44.350
and also deciding what to do,
trying to figure out what to do

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.890
when the distances
cannot be bridged.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:51.320
So I think, one of the
truisms about translation,

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.860
one of the things that's
often said is that translators

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.540
and interpreters are essential
in order to communicate,

00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:00.780
to bridge differences, and
languages and this is true.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.330
And yet for me, one of the
most interesting things

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:08.860
about translation is noticing
those differences and times

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:13.560
when differences cannot be
bridged or resolved and, of course,

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.580
that's what interests us, often,
about literature, about literature

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.750
from other languages and
other cultures is the fact

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:23.280
that it's different from our
own language, our own culture.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:28.930
And the translator is in a rather
impossible place in which he

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:33.530
or she is, needs to be aware
of these differences and

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:39.380
yet somehow has to try
to rephrase them in a way

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:45.900 position:56%
that they can be understood and
there's constantly a new production,

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:49.340
a new creation in the
translation which threatens

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.080
to leave something behind.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.560
There's different metaphors,
different ways

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:59.500
that this is expressed and there's
always a level of, well depending

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.410
on what vocabulary you use, it
will come out very differently.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.980
There is always violence
in translation.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.850
There's always infidelity
in translation.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:12.580
There's always betrayal
in translation

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:19.190
or you can say there's always
bridges and you, new connections

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:23.370
and new text, and new meanings and
new possibilities for the future.

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:25.910
And somehow both things are true.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:29.750
I'm not sure if I'm
answering the question.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:38.420 position:56%
The last thing that I want to say is
that it's true that, well the scene

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:42.000 position:56%
of translation tends to be invisible
and I take every opportunity I can

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.900
to try to make some of that visible

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.390
because I think it's a very rich
scene which would interest a lot

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:53.020
of readers from a lot of different
languages and perspectives,

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.430
but translation, part,
I'm very aware

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:01.780
that when I am translating
something I am writing my reading

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.460
of another text.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:09.060
I am writing my interpretation in
another language and that that,

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:13.360
and that the moment I switch
languages there are these

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:20.320
differences and points of conflict
with the original that I'm,

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.460
that I've read because
as I write it,

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:28.180
well the best ideal translation
would be the same text

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:32.570
as the original, but that, of
course, would be different also

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:34.490
because time passes
as [inaudible] show.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:42.130 position:56%
Even if you don't betray the
original, the original gets betrayed

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:46.560
by time and is that betrayal or
an infidelity or a production

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.520
of you meaning new possibilities.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.060
So I write my reading
in another language

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.840
and if it doesn't work,
it's a bad translation.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.710
Everybody notices it and everybody
knows who the translator is.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:06.000
If it works well [laughter]
then everybody remembers Piglia

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.800
and the translator fades
into the much disgust

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:18.900
and rather problematic
invisibility of success,

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.510
of writing the same thing
again in another language,

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.600
which by definition
can't be the same thing.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.480
So anyway, it's a paradox.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.930
That's my answer.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:29.680
It's a paradox.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.120
[ Laughter ]

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.820
&gt;&gt; Laura Demaria: I
have two more questions

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.180
and then we're going
to open the floor.

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.190
My second question
has to do with the,

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:44.310
what Borges called [foreign
language spoken], the intonation

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:49.630
or what we could be
called the tone of a text,

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:52.300
of [foreign language spoken]
and my question is very simple

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.910
because for me, how to translate
the [foreign language spoken].

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:02.360
It's a, I don't know how you do it

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:09.660
or do you try to reproduce
that tone?

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:12.370
That [foreign language
spoken] or you just try

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:18.470
to create a completely new tone
or [foreign language spoken]?

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:21.580
Sorry that [laughter] --

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.820
&gt;&gt; Sergio Waisman: So
that's a good question.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:37.400
The tone. Right so, right so
the tone is very important.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:43.700
The, I think the way that I
want to approach this is those,

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.930
a lot of people here
know two languages.

00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:47.820
Some people here know
more than two languages.

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.980
We all have the experience
or the antidote

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.090
that we are slightly
different people depending on,

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.690
if I'm speaking English or
if I'm speaking Spanish.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:59.580
There's this feeling that
I'm slightly different.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:02.960
That there's a different tone to
my communication and yet I'm aware

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.000
that I'm the same person.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.430
So with translation, I think that
the, something similar happens.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:13.720
In simplest terms, when I
translate Piglia, I imagine,

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.150
I try to imagine what Emilio Remse,

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:19.240
Piglia's alter ego might
sound like in English.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.000
What, how he, what he could
sound like in English.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.020
Which, of course, doesn't exist
before I do the translation

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.280
because Emilio Remse
exists in Spanish

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:32.250
and in a very particular
tone and feel of Spanish,

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:36.150
which is [foreign language
spoken] from Argentina, from,

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:43.860
particularly from [inaudible]
and the Provence of [inaudible].

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:49.190
So I think it's a game of
imagination, of trying to imagine

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:53.950
and in the best cases, the
new tone or the new feel

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:57.820
in the translation is
something that will resonant

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.430 position:56%
like invisible pretext, the original

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.670
that if you read the
translation you know

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.550
that there's something
right before it.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:07.090
it will resonant with that

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:09.530
and hopefully it will
also create new resonances

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:13.450
in the target language, in
English and the US this time,

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:18.280 position:56%
but I think it's a game, not a game,
it's a challenge of imagination

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:25.300
and of trying to imagine what, by
hearing one tone and one language,

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:28.790
what that tone might be
in the other language.

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:33.490
So it's, I think from that
point of view translation is,

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:38.860
has the potential to be this other.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:46.180
&gt;&gt; Laura Demaria: My last
question, it's very short

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.610
so don't sit down [laughter].

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:51.070
You have talked about the
reverence of translation,

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:59.020
but I would like to turn that
irreverence into reverence

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:03.890
and there seems to me
that in order to translate

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:08.970
and be irreverence first,
you need to be reverent.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:18.210
[ Laughter ]

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.840
&gt;&gt; Sergio Waisman: Yeah I think
that there's two sides to it.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:31.490
so on the one hand, translators are
expected to be extremely humble,

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:34.380
to erase their own identity,
and their own voice and to speak

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:38.650 position:56%
for the original author and to be
as reverent as possible and in fact,

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:42.390
that, and that is part of
the gesture of translation

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:45.940
to say this I am translating
this text, this author,

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:52.090
this merit is being translated,
merits my time, and it has a tone

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:55.130
and it has a feel and a
story, which is not mine,

00:37:55.130 --> 00:38:00.280
but so I will put my story aside
in order to try to find a tone

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.290
for this story from another
language to find a voice now

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.590
in the English in the US.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.990
So from that point of view,
translation seems to be a,

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:13.160
very much an altruistic task.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.870
The translator removes him or
herself and gives themselves

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:18.950
over to the project
of the translation

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:23.930
and with extreme reverence for
the author of the original.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:27.340
The flip side of that is the
irreverence and the infidelity

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.170 position:56%
and the betrayals that always happen

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:32.470
because by definition you're
writing a different text

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:35.910
than the original and --

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:45.400
You don't have to be a translator
who sets out to creatively rewrite

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:49.030
and change the text in
order to be irreverent.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:56.300
Translation is an irreverent task
because the novel is already here.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.040
So the fact that I'm writing
this novel, that's irreverent.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.340
This is the original.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:05.170
This is the copy and copies in
society tend to be secondary

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:08.570
and inferior and derivative.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:14.220
To what extent is the copy
successful, meaningful,

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:17.930
have its own live,
its own readership?

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:21.790
Well to the extent that it
finds, resolves this tension

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:25.320
between being reverent and
irreverent, between being faithful

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:31.380
and unfaithful, between I,
trying to set my own voice

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:35.370
and writing style aside
in order to translate

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:40.150 position:56%
and rewrite somebody else's writing
style for whom I have such reverence

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:47.030
that I'm willing to leave my own
aside and yet by doing that it's,

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:49.860
I'm also being irreverent
and betraying the original

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.180
because I'm writing another text.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.980
So it's also [laughter], this,

00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:00.970
it's also a contradictory
gesture, for sure [laughter].

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:04.040
So, yeah. Do you want
to come back or?

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.340
&gt;&gt; Laura Demaria: No.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:08.130
I'm going to stay here and --

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:09.920
&gt;&gt; My name is [inaudible]
and thank you

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.360
for your [inaudible] and question.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:18.460
My question is about cultural
differences that you mentioned

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.560
that cannot be directly translated.

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:27.370
Could you please give a
couple examples from this book

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:30.470
of such culture differences
that do not translate

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:34.680
into English, so American culture.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:38.390
And how do you then
communicate them?

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:39.690
Thank you.

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:41.130
&gt;&gt; Sergio Waisman: No
that's a good question.

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:46.570
So I think that one of the
first examples that comes

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:50.570
to mind is the figure of the
Gaucho and the whole mythology

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:57.210
of the Gaucho, which is at the core
of Argentine literary tradition

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:02.500
and at the core of important
parts of Argentine history and so,

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.620
right so is there an
equivalent of a Gaucho in US?

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:17.060
Well he's sort of a cowboy, but
not quite and the mythology and now

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:22.390
over 100 years of stories,
both poetry and fiction

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:25.080
about the Gaucho is
a long tradition.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:30.300
And that, because of Piglia in
the early 21 century is working

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:35.540
with this figure of the Gaucho who
probably hasn't existed in reality

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:39.040
since the 19 century, but in
mythology and in story telling

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:43.340
in Argentina has remained
a vital figure.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:46.800
So I don't know, it's
not a good translation,

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.930
but a good cultural analogy.

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:54.590
It might be more like the mobster
in Chicago, a figure about which,

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:59.100
well do they, does it really exist?

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:02.720
Like it's displayed in the
Godfather, or is there a lot

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.920
of storytelling and
mythology about it?

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:09.880
So that would be an example
and for some of these,

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:13.790
so Gaucho in English
is Gaucho [laughter].

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:17.930
So sometimes the cultural
references and differences,

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:22.690
you can translate the context
and the stories around them

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:24.440
and then sometimes certain words,

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.520
certain concepts need
to stay in the original.

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.950
And then, and I think that's
what happened with Gaucho

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:36.750
from south American Spanish into
other languages for over 100 years.

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:40.740
So sometimes individual
words or concepts need to,

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.690
those words maybe are not
rewritten, but then the context

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:48.130
around them does need to be
reworked in order to be understood.

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:49.440
Does that make sense?

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.330
Yeah. Yes please.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:56.550
&gt;&gt; I'm [inaudible]
formerly the University

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:59.610
of Maryland, but still affiliated.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.170
Thank you so much.

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:02.820
Thank you Gwen, Laura.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:07.280
I have so many questions, it
really brought up so many things

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.920
in paradoxes, but one of the
things you did say briefly is

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.890
that [inaudible], you
work with Piglia.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:15.950
Now I know you translated
those [inaudible]

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:18.810
where you could not
speak with [inaudible].

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:22.370
What is the difference for
you, for working with an author

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:28.040
who is alive and comment?

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.200
&gt;&gt; Sergio Waisman: Right, so I've
had both experiences of working

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:35.220
with writers who are alive and
with whom I ca communicate dialog

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:38.880
in some way, like Piglia and
then some early 20 century

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.990
or 19 century writers.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:47.590
So I think the theoretical answer
is that there is no difference.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:52.740
That translation, so other people
mention my work with Borges,

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:56.140
so the translation is
always a conjunction.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:03.180 position:56%
It's always a surprising mixture and
dynamic combination of the original

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.340
and the translator producing
this translated text,

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:08.350
which then will have
its new readers.

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:17.550
So in some ways it's not different
because the translator has

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:22.570
to do a tremendous amount of
research to read the text,

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:27.830
pursue all of the suggestions,
possible meanings of the original

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:33.790
and in doing that, in that
kind of reading I think you,

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:36.500
this might sound a little esoteric.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:40.440
So you initiate a dialog
with the text and its content

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:44.660
and what you imagine it to be its
horizon of when it was written

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.860
and when it was first read
and you have an ongoing dialog

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.480
from your own horizon, from
your own context and I think

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.980
that one has, I'm not sure.

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:59.980 position:56%
I think I have those kind of dialogs
when I read all the time and it's

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:03.950
with very few writers with whom I
can actually have a conversation.

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:07.720
How it's different when the
conversations with Piglia is that,

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.030
well it complicates,
it complicates it

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:15.520
because I can't be
flippant about it.

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:22.800
so the reverent or irreverent
question, I am hugely reverent

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:28.270
and having a chance to know
him and communicate with him

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:35.310 position:56%
for over 20 years, that's increased
my reverence and that has everything

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:38.960
to do with Piglia and what he's
like and his work and how he,

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.900
how generous he is with people
who have readings in common

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.530
who are interested in his work.

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:49.470 position:56%
And it very much complicates the
fact that as a translator I need to,

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:53.310
at some point, be irreverent
and break away from the figure

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:56.300
of the author and it's
also very complicated

00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:00.020
because Piglia is very smart about
translation, very aware of it

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:05.060
and so he knows that he's happy
to have every conversation with me

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:08.960
that we can, but then there will
come a point where that needs

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:14.700
to be broken off and I need to
take the text to its next horizon

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.230
where there will be new
readers in another language.

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:19.400
And he has the faith or
the confidence to know

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:24.530
that it might travel, yeah and
from that point of view I'll,

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:28.590
I don't know if a mediator or
a mule or something like that

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:29.890
to bring the contraband

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:33.660
from Argentina [laughter]
to a new audience.

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.810
&gt;&gt; For example, in the title --

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:37.730
&gt;&gt; Yes. Right.

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:42.470
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] taken that
title and he had not liked it?

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:45.050
[Inaudible]

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:46.450
&gt;&gt; Sergio Waisman:
It's hard to tell.

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:51.070
So Blanco Nocturno, white nocturne
would be the literal translation.

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:57.020
In Spanish there's the binomial,
blanco nocturne, the white night.

00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:05.120
The, if you reproduce the binomial,
the white nocturne or dark, white,

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.780
dark it doesn't quite work.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:10.240
White nocturne is the
title of a poem.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:16.210
Piglia's input into the title
was that he said that he tends

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:20.210
to avoid titles that
sound overly poetic

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:22.960
and that that's not what he had
in mind with Blanco Nocturno.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.420
Now the problem with that is

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.510
that it does actually
sound poetic in Spanish.

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:30.140
[ Laughter ]

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.440
Right, right.

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:35.330
So I mean I think that from
a pragmatic point of view he,

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:36.670
as always, he was very generous.

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:40.130
He wrote an e-mail explained
what he had in mind and said

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:41.790
of course it's your decision.

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:45.480
So and I think that this, throwing
the [inaudible] in this case

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:47.310
from him to the translator.

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:51.170
I think this actually goes very
much in line with Piglia's poetics,

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:54.970
which is to write and circulate
stories and thrown them

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:58.200
out for the reader to
take up and interpret

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.840
and then either circulate
or think about.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:03.140
So --

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:08.890
I think the other thing
that happens with Piglia is

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:11.410
that he tends to be
right [laughter].

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.670
So and I think that,
so based on experience

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:16.680
when he said oh white
nocturne, that's pretty,

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:22.920
but it sounds too poetic, too
something, too flowery maybe.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:26.410
Then I said well let me think
about that and so I'd like to,

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:30.900
I do say we when, you're right,
when I talk about the title,

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:36.510
but in the end it was my decision
and the editor was okay with it.

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:41.490
[ Laughter ]

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:42.790
Yes, please Georgette.

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:44.730
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: I think
actually the title is perfect,

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:47.120
because the other one
sound like music.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.420
White nights [inaudible].

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:49.990
It makes no sense what so ever.

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:51.680
So the title is perfect.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.390
And what I really admire
most of you,

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:56.420
how well you dominate
both English and Spanish.

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:57.720
I mean [inaudible].

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.800 position:56%
I think that's amazing and also
bring good American English speaking

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.030
public what Argentina is like.

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:05.160
Which I think is very difficult.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.280
So I think that's really amazing.

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.580
&gt;&gt; Sergio Waisman: Thank you.

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:12.390
I think there are many
outstanding translators

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:15.170
who are not entirely bilingual.

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:18.090
So that's a possibility and
there are many bilingual people

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:20.500
who are not great translators.

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:28.150
So I think it is true, but for me
part of it is the haphazard exiles

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:33.150
and movings and comings and goings
and leavings that I grew up with

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:34.820
and then it's also a lot of work.

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:39.310
So I think it's both things
that, the result of family

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:43.830
and historical processes that made
me bilingual and then it's a lot

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:47.120
of work at both languages
and the translation.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:52.080
So I don't want to, it's not
just an oh I'm a, I don't know.

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:56.000
I don't know if that makes
sense, but thank you.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.590
[Inaudible] had a, yeah.

00:49:57.590 --> 00:49:59.310
&gt;&gt; I have a question
about the process.

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:01.640
I want to take you to the beginning

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:05.450
on how do you choose
what to translate?

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:07.700
The world [inaudible]
translator, so how do you make

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:13.010
that choice [inaudible] choices
and maybe another question;

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:17.420
have you ever found a
translation that you would start

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:20.120
that process just goes nowhere

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:25.970
and you have [laughter]
stop and then yes --

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:29.510
&gt;&gt; Sergio Waisman: What's that?

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:32.470
[Inaudible] I know [laughter].

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:37.470
So I think, I also, I'm also want
to be upfront about the fact that,

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:39.750
so I have a great job with tenure.

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:42.960
So my process is different than
somebody who is doing translations

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.960
to earn a living as a translator.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.150
What, before I had
tenure and especially

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:52.170
when I was a graduate student, my
first few year, there was less,

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:53.960
there was less to the process.

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.970
It was a project came up,
hopefully it would interesting,

00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:58.880
I would take it.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:05.040
Now, I'm at a point where I'm able
to be a lot more choosy, choosier

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:10.230
and I don't know that I
can really categorize that.

00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:14.930
It's very subjective and
it has to do with a style

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:17.870
or a tone as Laura said, that --

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:28.710
I feel or I suspect is missing
in English or American literature

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:31.610 position:56%
and it's my attempt to imagine that.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:35.620
So it's a perceived lack
and, but I don't mean this,

00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:40.360
I don't in any way mean to say that
I know all of the different styles

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.810
or tones that are available
in American literature.

00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:49.210
So it's a perceived lack in
myself that I try to address

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:53.490
or travel towards by rewriting
something that does exist,

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:56.530
in this case in Spanish
in Argentina.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:01.950
And yes, but for the most part
I tend to finish the projects.

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:06.120
So I try to make the decision
before hand whether I will be able

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.020
to complete it or not.

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.970
So thank you.

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:12.270
Yes.

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:14.040
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.340
Okay, yes.

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.590
&gt;&gt; I'm Kathleen Baltimore Net
from Virginia Military Institute

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:21.370
and my question is how do you
move from project to project?

00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:24.270
Does it take you a while to
[inaudible] figure you had

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:29.340
where you have to have a
spiritual cleansing [laughter].

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:33.450
How do you get it out of
your head and [inaudible] in?

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:36.490
&gt;&gt; Sergio Waisman: Well I
think because of the nature

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:40.350
of the academics calendars and
so forth, it tends to be more

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:45.010
or less one project per year,
more or less, and then centered

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:47.820
around a lot of intensive
work in the summers.

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:53.080
So with the [foreign language
spoken], the Underdogs,

00:52:53.080 --> 00:53:01.790
I think that for those, for
three months, I'm, 2007 or 2000?

00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:07.080
I, for three months I worked
very hard to try to be an expert

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:13.110
in Mexican Spanish from the
time of the Mexican Revolution.

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:16.870
And I wrote what I learned in
English, which is the contradiction

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:21.600
that I was, so I had all of these
reference books in my basement

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:27.400
in Kensington and then I
think part of the process,

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.180
this is not something premeditated,

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.790
but as soon as I finish the
translation I just leave it

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:34.310
because I have written my reading.

00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:37.290 position:56%
So it actually just sort of happens.

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:41.630 position:56%
If I hadn't finished the
translation, it might not have left,

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:46.030
but once I write my version
then I move on and with Piglia,

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:49.230
now this is the third book of his
that I've translated into English.

00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:53.110
I'm hoping to continue
with his work about,

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:56.280
hopefully about one book a
year for the next few years.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.310
So I think that with, the
flipside of that is, with,

00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:05.580
I think that the engagement
with Piglia's work and this tone

00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:08.850
that I don't have that's
lacking, which I'm trying

00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:12.350
to produce by translating his work.

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:14.650
I think that's a lifelong project.

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:27.060
&gt;&gt; I wonder, do you find it
difficult to translate the humor

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:29.600
from one language to the other?

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:33.200
I [inaudible] difficult many times,
but [inaudible] I read a page

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:38.480
of [inaudible] in Spanish
and I find it so humorous

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:42.680
and then I ask a friend

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:46.510
to [inaudible] the
same thing [inaudible].

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:49.100
[ Laughter ]

00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:56.420
I wonder [inaudible] difficult
to translate and sometimes,

00:54:56.420 --> 00:55:00.370
well not in books, but
when you see a movie

00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:03.300
and they translate
the joke [inaudible].

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.590
[ Laughter ]

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:07.970
&gt;&gt; Sergio Waisman: Right, so
I think that's a good point.

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:11.800
I don't have any advice
on how to translate humor.

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:15.110
The only thing that I would
say is that once again,

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:20.330
translation around this question
focused, can work as a focus

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:23.340
and a lens to the problem itself.

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:27.850
So humor itself doesn't translate
well even within the same language.

00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:29.670
So if you have to turn
around and explain a joke

00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:32.110
to somebody, it's no longer funny.

00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:34.210
[ Laughter ]

00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:38.270
And so likewise, so it's
translation and if you,

00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:44.970
and it's noticeably difficult to
translate humor, but it's also,

00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:48.360
it's also, because, you know in a
joke you're either in on the joke

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:53.010
or not in on the joke
and so, I don't know.

00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:54.310
Sometimes it translates

00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:56.470
and sometimes it doesn't,
but I think that --

00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:59.270
&gt;&gt; But do you find it difficult?

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:00.570
&gt;&gt; Sergio Waisman: Oh yeah.

00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:02.850
[Laughter] Very difficult.

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:04.470
Very difficult, but like I say,

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:06.510
I don't know that I
have any solutions --

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:34.060
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:37.800
It's definitely very difficult
and I think it's a case by case

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:44.530
and some jokes, some context,
some humor, a solution comes up

00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:46.980
and then it becomes, I
don't know if equally funny

00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:49.420
or analogously humorous
in the translation.

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:55.260
Sometimes it doesn't and,
but I think I see it similar

00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:57.980
to the challenge of
translating a tone.

00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:02.770
So the tone, the feel of
this novel, the noir-ish feel

00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:06.460
in the Pompous of Argentina.

00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:10.640
So in my mind analogist
tone for that is something

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:15.970
about 1950's cinema or crime
in the US, which of course I,

00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:18.910
is not something that, I
haven't lived either one

00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:20.210
of these experiences.

00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:24.800
So they're both projects
of reading and imagination.

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.100
Yeah.

00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:27.400

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:34.470

see yourself in translation.

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:37.870

a novel [inaudible] book

on [inaudible].

00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:45.510 position:56%

fit themselves in translation?

00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:52.360
[ Laughter ]

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:54.670

it's, honestly it's different

for each book, but I would
like to believe that I'm,

00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:03.610 position:56%
I will try to follow the model of
Piglia's as much as I can, which is,

00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:07.450
if I am in, the handful of
times I am fortunate enough

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:10.310
to have a translator either
in the past or in the future,

00:58:10.310 --> 00:58:13.470
I will be very grateful and be
happy to have the conversation

00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:16.310
and then let them do their
work because it's their work

00:58:16.310 --> 00:58:19.010
and I've already done my work.

00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:20.680
Of course that doesn't
quite apply to my novel,

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:23.510
which I translated
myself [laughter] --

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:27.650

[ Laughter ]

00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:39.560 position:56%
And I think that, I think it's also
very different what language you are

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:42.970
translating from and into and so
I think for Argentine writers,

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:46.130
for Latin American writers
to be translated in the US,

00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:48.780
it's usually important for them,

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:54.860
there's enormous geopolitical
differences, financial differences.

00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:59.940
So there's, and I'm with
my own work I'm not,

00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:05.220
as a translator I have a
role in that market of trying

00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:08.810 position:56%
to translate Latin American
literature and put it in circulation

00:59:08.810 --> 00:59:10.650
in an American market,
which is a huge market

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:13.270
with a lot of potential writers.

00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:17.770
But with my own work, right so
if it gets translated to Spanish

00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:23.850
or Italian from English, I'm aware
that I'm just glad that it's being,

00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:26.170
the relationship to the
market is complicated.

00:59:26.170 --> 00:59:30.090
It would be another conversation
and where the translator is sort

00:59:30.090 --> 00:59:34.040
of a creative figure, but also
a representative of the work,

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.160
a little closer to the
agent or the editors.

00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.460
It's complicated.

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:40.440
I think it depends a lot on
the, not only on the book,

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:43.750
but then also which direction
the translation is going.

00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:49.260
&gt;&gt; There's a question here from
Christopher and then [inaudible].

00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:55.050
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:59:55.050 --> 01:00:04.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And I wanted to go back to the
scene of the translation [inaudible]

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.340
and revisit in particular the idea

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:11.050
of betrayal the translator
is [inaudible] and partly

01:00:11.050 --> 01:00:12.350 position:56%
because it sounds like a lot of fun.

01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:14.140
[ Laughter ]

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:22.680
We can finally be bad and it sounds
kind of sexy, you know [inaudible].

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:27.520
But the need to be
accurate complicated?

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:30.110
How bad [inaudible] as a translator

01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:39.340
and still have the translation
count as a good translation?

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:44.560
I was just wondering
how do you incorporate

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.280
that question of accuracy.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sergio Waisman: Yeah, it's a
good question and I want to be clear

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:55.450
that I always try to be as accurate
and as faithful as possible.

01:00:55.450 --> 01:01:01.530
I think the different works of
translation are different, right?

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:06.960 position:56%
So of course, if you were working
or serving as a medical interpreter,

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.120
there is no, and the
question is about the liver.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:14.460
There is no room for a
creative infidelity with,

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:18.050
in medical interpret, right?

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:21.810
So I think that, what I was
saying before is very specifically

01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:26.540
to literature so and
then maybe two thoughts.

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:34.540
One is that because it's literary
translation and to the extent that,

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:36.510
this is going to be a
general [inaudible],

01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:40.340
to the extent that literature works
with ambiguities and ambiences

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.420 position:56%
and multiple different meanings even

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:44.570
in the original, before
you translate.

01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:49.070
Then the question of accuracy or
fidelity becomes very complicated

01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:52.780
because it's accurate or
faithful to which meaning

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:55.100
or which interpretation
of the original?

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:58.180
So I think that what the translator
must do is be aware of the fact

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:04.120
that he or she is, well like
any good reader try to be aware

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.360
of as many of the different
meanings, suggestions,

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:10.520
interpretations as possible of
the original and then be honest

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.210
about the fact that one, in
the end will probably have

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:14.510
to choose one of those.

01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:16.800
And this example with the
title works very well.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.640
Blanco Nocturno, Target
in the Night.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:24.340
I've chosen one of them and then
whether it will have an analogist

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:31.310
amount or branches of new
meanings in the translated language

01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:34.850
that will be determined
by the new set of readers.

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:43.110
And another side of the
question is that, right so,

01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:47.640
so as [inaudible] shows, even
all attempts to be as accurate

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:52.150
and faithful to the original,
end up betraying themselves.

01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:55.320
So the betrayal isn't always fun.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.890
It isn't always oh I'm
really going to change this.

01:02:57.890 --> 01:03:02.680 position:56%
Sometimes it's oh, this, either
these cultural differences or these,

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:07.220
the language has changed and in a
way this no longer means what it

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:09.160
meant at the time of the original.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:15.020
So sometimes it just, the
accuracy, sometimes being accurate,

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:23.820 position:56%
sometimes the accuracy and exactness
is itself not true or not possible.

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.790
There's somebody in the back or --

01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:32.110
[ Inaudible Response ]

01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:34.430
Hi Anna, sorry I couldn't see you.

01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:36.210
Please. Please.

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:37.510
Please.

01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:41.070
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to add to the
conversation regarding betrayal.

01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:45.070
I think the larger question would
be is there any moment in language

01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:47.730
in which there's fullness
of meaning?

01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:51.380
Like what would fullness of
meaning be in the first place?

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:52.960
What would a moment in
which you say a word

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.290
and that word means everything it's
supposed to say in any language

01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:59.520
at any moment and then
pass that to translation.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.490
Do you know like translation
is something

01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:02.790
that just comes [inaudible].

01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:04.860
&gt;&gt; Sergio Waisman: Right.

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.160
&gt;&gt; So.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.460
&gt;&gt; Sergio Waisman:
I think it's true.

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.520
I think, maybe it's harder with
individual words or phrases,

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:14.610
but with other things like
tone or feel along with,

01:04:14.610 --> 01:04:17.380
in the case of fiction,
the storyline.

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:20.960
I think there's definitely a
fullness of tone and storyline

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.730
in the original and you can get
a fullness of tone and storyline

01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:29.230
in the translation,
which will be the same,

01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:31.830
yet very different
from the original.

we do want to leave time
