00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.179
Matt: Okay, here we go, we have a link 
between Mersenne primes and perfect numbers

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.179
Brady: You've already shown a link...

00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:07.910
Matt: We're going to, well, I'm going to prove that link. 
So, here's how we're going to do it

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.710
Once again we're going to have n,
and we're going to have 2^n - 1

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.020
But, I'm not going to bother with the ones that don't work. I'm only going to have the ones that work.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.880
Which is 2, 3, 5, 7, and 13
and they give us the Mersenne primes

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:31.250
Ahh... 2 gives us 3 ... 3 gives us 7 ...
... 5 gives us 31 ... 127 ...8191 ...

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.310
and then they match up with ... 
some perfect numbers.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.490
Which I'm gonna put over here.
As "Perfect Number"

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.930
And so, 3 matches up with 6
7 matches up with 28

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:53.510
31 matches up with 496
127 matches up with 8128

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.949
and then this one matches up with ... something.
We will get to that in a second.

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.729
Brady: Can there only be one Mersenne prime,
 among the factors of a Perfect Number?

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.249
Matt: Yes!
There's only...

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.619
There's only ever one Mersenne prime in
the factors of an even perfect number,

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.159
and every even perfect number has one
Mersenne prime in there, somewhere.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.520
The reason I keep saying even, and
I'm gonna stop saying even from now on,

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.640
is because no one has ever found an odd
perfect number.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.530
But no one has ever managed to prove
that odd perfect numbers don't exist, so..

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.920
For all we know, there could be an odd 
perfect number, but no one has come across it.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.189
We do know, if we find an odd Perfect Number,
it's not going to have a Mersenne prime as a factor.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.820
So from now on when I say Perfect Number I mean even perfect number by default.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.160
So, if you look at the link I showed you that these numbers were all factors of these perfect numbers

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
In fact I'm going to write those in.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.040
So if you have 3, you multiply it by 2, you get 6.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.480
If you get 7, and you multiply it by 4, you get 28.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.840
If you get 31, and multiply it by 16, you get 496.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.120
127 multiply it by 64, you get 8128.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.360
So now, you should be thinking, "what's the pattern here?"

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.280
Right, so let's say I give you a new Mersenne prime. Let's say it's hot off the press.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.920
Wow, I've just found 8191 as a Mersenne prime, you know what, I want to know what its perfect number is.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.800
Because that's where the fun is.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.080
Forget Mersenne primes, in fact Mersenne primes were first studied by the ancient Greeks

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.780
solely to get to the perfect number goodness.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.700
And so all we want to know is what do I have to multiply that by to get over there.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.400
And so people searched for all sorts of patterns. People go "Ah! It's obvious because if you square 2 you get 4.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.120
If you square 4 you get 16.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.060
That's the pattern", ignoring the fact that 16 squared is 256.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.740
And the people go, "Oh no wait! Multiply by 4, because 4 times 4 is 16.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.000
And 16 by 4 is 64" and they ignore that fact that 2 by 4 is not 4.  So people find other patterns.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The actual pattern is...

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.020
this equals

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.680
2 to the 1

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.020
That equals 2 squared.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
That equals 2 to the four.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
That equals 2 to the 6.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.700
And it's these numbers here, the 1, the 2, the 4, and the 6, that's where the pattern is.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.040
That is always 1 less than the number over here.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.560
So 1 less than 2, that's our 1. 1 Less than 3 that's our 2. 1 less than 5 that's our 4.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.560
1 less than 7 that's our 6.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.240
So this column is 2 to the n-1.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.200
Brady: I reckon if you'd given me 2 weeks I wouldn't have figured that out.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.260
Matt: So I use this to torment young people. I get highschool students to try and work out that pattern.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.680
And basically I walk around being a professional jerk.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.740
Because I won't give them the answer. And they come up with a pattern and I go, "does it work?"

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.740
and they'll try the next one and it won't.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.000
And eventually one kid will work it out and they will be the most smug child you have ever met and justifiably so.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And they will happily retire

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.640
convinced that if you have a Mersenne prime

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.060
2^n -1

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.220
and you then multiply

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.840
that by 2^(n-1)

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.520
you always always always get a perfect number.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.120
And they will go home and I will say, "Well how do you know it works?"

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.120
How do we know that's always going to work?

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.760
We haven't proven that. And they will confuse trying examples with proving something.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.240
And I love trying examples. I don't want to rain hate on the trying example parade.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.020
Because that's how you find patterns to start with but you then you got to prove them.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.020
So we're going to prove that this always works.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.880
And we'll be very careful, by the way because 2^n -1 sounds a lot like 2^(n-1).

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.600
And this subtract 1 can drift if you're not careful when you're copying things.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.700
But what's quite fun if you get someone to do this, listen to how they pronounce this because people pronounce

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.840
superscripts in maths with rising inflections

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.680
and so you get kids to read this out and they go, "well this is two to the n minus one".

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.000
"times two to the n minus one"

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.340
and that, you know, means superscript.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.520
Brady: Is that why Australians ...
Matt: And that's why Australians are very good at maths

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.200
So that's why I put this at the end, right?

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.520
So I end on the inflection. If I put this at the beginning it messes with my - I can't do,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.340
"Two to the n minus one, two to the n minus one." it's just not as much fun. So we're going to prove this.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.520
And I'm going to prove it by doing an example first, then I'm going to do it in a general sense.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.040
So let's be lazy and do it for 496.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.880
And so a little while ago I impressed you and possible two or three other people

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.020
by randomly listing off, as if I had memorized them,

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.020
all the factors of 496.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.660
All I was doing was starting at 1 and doubling.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.320
Double 1 to get 2, double 2 to get 4, double 4 to get 8, double 8 to get 16.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.700
If I double 16 I get 32,

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.240
which is 1 above a Mersenne prime.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.860
So in fact to get any perfect number you start at 1, you keep doubling

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.060
until you can choose any Mersenne prime of your choosing

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.400
you get 1 above your Mersenne prime and instead of writing plus 32

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.860
I'm going to put plus 31 instead. I'm going to switch to the Mersenne prime.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.240
And then I'm going to continue the doubling. I double that I'm going to get 62

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.520
I double that I get 124

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.520
I double that I get 248.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.500
So in fact, I wasn't, I hadn't memorized those numbers

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.020
I just started a doubling sequence and then jumped off it to a Mersenne prime

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.680
Brady: You had memorized the Mersenne prime

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.820
Matt: I had memorized the Mersenne primes and then I doubled the Mersenne primes to finish the sequence

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:26.340
And because I am ... 'cos I know where we're going I'm going to switch back to adding in the number itself.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.960
which you remember I did before. I said you could

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.280
add the number that the total was twice the original, I want to put that back in the mix.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.280
So how could we add these up?

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.700
We could have just added them up by summing them.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.360
Let's get slightly more excited. Because if you look at this

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.720
this sequence here is actually that sequence times the Mersenne primes.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:53.480
So I could rewrite this, this equals 1+2+4+8+16

00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:01.060
+ Mersenne prime 31 outside 1+2+4+8+16

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.180
And that's actually why I put this back on so we get that same 16 in there.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:10.780
I can then make that 1 + 31 because it's 1

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.260
times that sequences + 31 times that sequence.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:22.920
That's 1+31 times 1+2+4+8+16

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.460
That now equals, 32.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.420
And that will always bump it back up to the next power of two so that becomes 2 to the 5.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:38.380
And 1+2+4+8+16, if you actually adds them all together that equals 31

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:45.980
And if you multiply those together you get twice 496, you get 992.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.280
So that's an unusual way to add them together

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.640
right, but now we're going to do the same thing in general

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.480
for this equation.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.160
What I'm going to do, is I'm going to take

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:02.900
2 to the (n-1) times 2^n - 1.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:09.420
And I'm going to show you if you add all the factors of this, they sum to give you that formula.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:14.660
Or rather if you add all the factors, not just the proper factors they sum to twice that formula.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.800
So what are the factors of that?

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.800
Well what have we got at the front here?

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.040
We've got 2^(n-1)

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.420
So that means the factors are definitely going to be

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:29.260
1+2^1

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:37.160
+2^2 +2^3 + all the way up to 2^(n-1)

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:44.420
So that's going to be 2^(n-2) +2^(n-1), it's going to be a whole number.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.820
So this is obviously a big power of 2; there are all its factors.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.400
This is prime; it's not going to have any factors.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.720
But it's going to be this multiplied by all of these.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.460
So now we're going to have this, 
we're going to have 2^n - 1

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.980
+ 2^1 outside of 2^n - 1

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:05.160
+ 2^2 outside of 2^n -1

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:12.020
+ all the way up... 
blah, blah, blah,  + 2^(n-2) outside of 2^n -1

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.900
plus 2^(n-1) outside of 2^n -1

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.020
which is our original number again at the end of the list just like we had over here.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.220
It's equivalent to the very same number on the end.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.340
So that's the actual formula has appeared again.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.680
So what we really want to show is, all the other ones add to the same as that.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.640
So we're going to show that by showing that all of them together equal twice that.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.760
Okay, so we can start to tidy this up a little bit

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.760
so that's going to equal

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.340
this top sequence can stay the same.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:48.980
There's still going to be 1+ 2^1+2^2 + all the way up +2^(n-2) +2^(n-1)

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.380
and this one here I'm going to put that out the front, so that's going to be

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.200
2^n -1, so it's that prime number.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:05.080
times 1+2^1+2^2+ dadadada, + 2^(n-2)+2^(n-1)

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.580
Okay, now, we're going to, because we have one lot of this, and that lot of that

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.400
so that's going to equal 1+that.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.440
but there we got minus 1 so that's just going to equal 2^n

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.780
outside of, so what I've done, I've done same as over here

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:25.860
which was the Mersenne prime +1 gave us back to 2^5.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.200
I've done this +1, the 1s cancel out 
and we're left with 2^n.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:40.180
And this is going to be 1+2^1+2^2+ all the way up 2^(n-2)+2^(n-1)

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:46.720
Now here's our problem: How on earth can we add together a sequence of numbers, a series here

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.820
when we don't know how many there are? We don't know where it stops.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.700
Somehow we have to add together a sequence where we don't know the end,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.700
but we can do that with a little bit of cleverness.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.620
Where we just say

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.500
let's assume we know the total, let's just say there's some total

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:09.620
And it equals whatever this all of this happens to add to but we currently don't know what it is.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.680
But we've given it a name which is always the first step in maths

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.040
And what would be twice that total?

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.040
What if we had two times that total?

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.440
Well that would equal double all of this.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.200
So that would then become our 2.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.620
+ double that would become 2^2+ double that would become 2^3

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:39.380
+ all the way up double that would become double that would become 2^(n-1)+ double that + 2^n

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.500
And actually, that is the same as that

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.720
that term is going to be the same as that term, all the way down, that is the same as that, that is the same as that.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.820
So fact, all of these match apart from the beginning one here and the end one here.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.180
So we want to cancel all these out

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.780
if I take all of these and subtract all of these

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.820
I would just be left with this one subtract that one. So 2T

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:10.420
minus T, this row minus that row equals 2^n-1

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:16.220
And in fact 2T-T is just T, the total is 2^n-1.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.220
And we call this the geometric series.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.960
So that this, or it's a particular case of the geometric series where you can add together

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.720
any long list of sequence of numbers where each one is the previous one multiplied by a constant amount.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.360
In this case we're multiplying it by 2 each time.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.940
It works for other ratios.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.160
So I can swap that in for all this mess becomes that.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.540
So now this, bring that down, equals

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.680
2^n outside of 2^n -1.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.280
And you're like, "Well we're practiaclly there." The only thing we're missing is

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.520
we expect a minus 1 there and we haven't got it here. Where's that gone?

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:55.600
Well like I said this is twice the original number.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.700
So we want to prove this equals twice 
what we started with.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:03.720
So we go with that equals twice times what's left if you take out a 2.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.880
Well that's 2^(n-1) outside of 2^n-1.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.200
And that's it.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:16.040
And so that is the proof that if you had a Mersenne prime 2^n-1

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.600
and you multiply it by 2^(n-1)

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.960
you'll guarantee to get a perfect number

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.720
because if you take all the factors of that expression

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.160
and then you add them all together, 
you get back to twice your original expression

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.480
which is our definition of the perfect number.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.140
And so people talk about the fact that there's a link between Mersenne primes and perfect numbers

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.300
but now we have managed to prove it.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.720
That's - I'm so pleased I'm going to put the lids back on to both of the pens.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.340
Brady: Hi there everyone it's Brady who makes the Numberphile videos

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.780
and I'm actually starting a new channel in January 2015 called Objectivity.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.440
And it's all about all the amazing treasures and science objects you find in places like this:

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.420
the archive room at the Royal Society.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.760
