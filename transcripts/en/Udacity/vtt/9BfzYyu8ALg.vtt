Now, we've talked a lot about algorithms, set-ups, and equations, but what we

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.550
haven't really talked about is how to get your assets into the game in the

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.565
proper way. And that's what we're going to talk about in this unit, proper

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:14.090
asset loading. Which, by the way, is the dark art of high performance

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.630
programming. If you get it right, your games load quickly and you get happy

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.564
users. If you get it wrong, you get bad load times and then all of a sudden

00:00:20.564 --> 00:00:22.996
people are starting flame wars on the internet about how long it takes for you

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:27.290
to load your level. Choice seems kind of obvious to me.
