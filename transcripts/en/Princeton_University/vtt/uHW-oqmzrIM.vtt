TANYARADZWA ASHLEIGH TAWENGWA (TANYA):
My name is the Tanyaradzwa

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.590
Ashleigh Tawengwa, and I'm a
junior here at Princeton

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.730
University.


00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:15.230
[MUSIC PLAYING]


00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.200
TANYA: I
grew up in Harare, Zimbabwe,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.600
in the suburbs.


00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.680
And I'm the last of
seven siblings.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.260
And so life was definitely full
of activity as a child.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.540
A special place for
my family is

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.770
definitely our farm in Marondera.


00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.960
This is a town an hour
out of Harare.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.430
Harare is the capital
city in Zimbabwe.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.750
The farm has been a very special
place, because that's

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.730
where my dad and his brothers
and his sister grew up.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.000
And that's where we still
go as children.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.010
My grandparents are
buried there.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.010
My uncles are buried there, and
my brother's buried there.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.340
And so it's definitely a place
that we all go to and love.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.370
Here at Princeton University,
I've been

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.400
involved in the Glee Club.


00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.250
I'm also involved in Umqombothi,
which is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.860
Princeton's African a
cappella ensemble.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.150
I founded that my
freshman year.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.450
I'm also involved in
L'Avant-Scene, which is the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.940
French theater group.


00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.000
I have been involved in
Sensemaya, the Afrobeat band.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.810
And currently I'm serving as a
residential college adviser in

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.680
Rockefeller college.


00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.380
I didn't know I was applying
for the Adam Award.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.960
I was simply applying for
funding from the Lewis Center,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.710
and I just sent in a proposal
for a project that I had to go

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.670
and study ethnomusicology
in Zimbabwe.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.170
And I just gave a budget.


00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.450
And I remember opening my
email, and it was--

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.360
it said, congratulations.


00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.150
And it's like, you
are this year's

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.000
recipient of the Adam Award.


00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.280
MICHAEL CADDEN: Well, Alex
Adam was a member of

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.110
the class of 2007.


00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.470
And during his freshman year he
became very involved with

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.400
the arts here at Princeton.


00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.940
His parents thought that it
would be a great way of

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.890
honoring his memory, to create
something at Princeton that

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.450
would allow his legacy of
creativity to live on.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.940
Tanya was who talked to us about
her musical studies back

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.630
in Zimbabwe.


00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.520
But one of things that happened
during the course of

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.520
her summer was that
she made a CD.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.550
And so all of that was kind
of amazing and moving.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.800
But then came the song.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.220
TANYA: [SINGING]

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.500
When I look to you, my world
starts to move, and I can

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.750
barely breathe.


00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.400 position:97%
 


00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.110
When I look to you, my pains
cease to hurt, and

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.380
I am free to live.


00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.820
TANYA:
With that particular song,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:55.350
"With You," when people listen
to it, I really want them to

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.680
know that they're never alone.


00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.820
I think that it's easy sometimes
to fall into this

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.440
pit where you feel like, it's
just you, and no one cares

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.460
about how you're feeling.


00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.850
And you can't be you.


00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.130
You have to put on a face.


00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.340
You have to act a
particular way.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.380
And I guess what I express in
that song is with you, you,

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.360
who to me, in this context is
God, I'm free to be me.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.000
And honestly, I'm convinced that
for a lot of us, 90% of

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.090
the time, we are not being
who we truly are.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.410
And so my message at least in
my music, I pray, is that

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.250
people feel encouraged and
liberated to be the people

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.580
they were created to be.


00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.520
Something that I said at one
point was, even though things

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.490
get hard at Princeton, this is
where I'm supposed to be.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.560
And what I meant by this was, I
am sure of my place here at

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.740
Princeton University.


00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.030
I am sure that there's a
purpose for me being

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.220
here at this time.


00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.670
And I didn't just wake
up being sure.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.020
I began my journey at Princeton
with a lot of doubt.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.380
I doubted my abilities.


00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.800
I told you I got off
the wait list.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.740
And so, being here I always
felt like a second class

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.620
citizen, well at least
at the beginning.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.250
Until one day I just woke
up, and I said, no.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.020
This is my home.


00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.140
I belong here.


00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.590
I'm sure.


00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.510
You can do it.


00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.220
You can do it.


00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.320
You can be exactly who
you want to be.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.580
You can push.


00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.490
You can work hard, and
you can make it.
