00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.710
What if I had a big pizza party with
lots of friends and lots of different

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.880
kinds of pizza and at the end of
the party there were lots of leftovers.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.765
And I had the choice to take home
three-eighths of the anchovy pizza or

00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:16.210
five-sixteenths of the pepperoni pizza.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.320
Which one should I take home if I want
as much leftover pizza as possible.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.631
How do I compare three-eights and
five-sixteenths?

00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:31.440
One way we can compare three-eighths and
five-sixteenths is using a number line.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.470
Here's our number line and
notice that it goes from zero to one.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.804
On this number line please
select where three-eighths and

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:40.870
five-sixteenths should fall.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.220
So you'll be selecting two boxes and
just as a little hint,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.769
each of these little tick
marks is one-sixteenth.
