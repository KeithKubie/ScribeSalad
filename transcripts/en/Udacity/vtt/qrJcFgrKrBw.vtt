00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.448
So going back to our original problem, if we want to rationalize this

00:00:03.448 --> 00:00:08.247
denominator we can actually use the conjugate. We multiply the denominator and

00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:12.200
the numerator by the same amount. So that way we multiply by 1. We know we can

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.632
multiply by the conjugate since if we multiply these two expressions together

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:20.715
we'll wind up with a number in our denominator, with no radical. We'll simply

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:26.606
have a squared minus b squared, which would be 7 minus 5. A squared is 7, and b

00:00:26.606 --> 00:00:32.470
squared is 5. We multiply each of these radicals by 4, to get this numerator.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.771
Next we simplify our denominator to get 2. If we leave the 4 outside of these

00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:40.400
two radicals then we can simplify a common factor of 2 in our numerator and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.232
denominator. So our denominator simplifies to 1, leaving us with 2 root 7 plus

00:00:46.232 --> 00:00:50.706
2 root 5. Notice that we rationalized our denominator. We had something that

00:00:50.706 --> 00:00:54.536
contained radicals to something that turned into 1. Now not every time our

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:58.870
denominator will be so nice. Sometimes we'll just have a number down here. In

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.414
this case our denmoinator was 1, but we know that's not always the case.
