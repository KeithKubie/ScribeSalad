00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.240
Probably in terms of writing and linguistic
awareness there were a combination, firstly

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.060
of W’s, P.G.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.630
Woodhouse, Oscar Wilde and Evelyn Waugh, the
British novelist.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.820
That’s a male Evelyn by the way.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.430
And I would add to that Arthur Chonan Doyle,
the author of Sherlock Holmes.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.850
When I was between the ages of about seven
and twelve I was obsessed with Sherlock Holmes

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.050
and I would read and reread and re, re, reread
all those, so the rhythms and tones of the

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.910
English language as exemplified by that kind
of grand perfect Victorian manner and then

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.390
Dickens, but it was really Oscar Wilde who
awoke language in my head in a way like nobody

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.309
else and I think also discovering the kind
of man Oscar Wilde was, was an enormous influence

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:02.309
as well.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.990
The fact that you could be such a towering
intellect, such a lord of language and be

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.190
charming and graceful, kind, good natured,
but also unhappy and unlucky was a great discovery

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.300
for an adolescent because one of the traps
of adolescence is the sort of paranoid resentment

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.410
that somehow you’re never going to match
up and that everybody else’s life is going

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.300
to be better and finer and fuller.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.440
That everyone else attended some secret lesson
in which how to live was taught and you had

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.610
a dental appointment that day or you were
somehow not invited and the point of great

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.990
writers like Wilde is that they make that
invitation to you.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.220
They welcome it.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:53.780
Perhaps the greatest definition I think of
character and quality is people who when they’re

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.640
truly great rather than making you feel that
tall they make you feel that tall, that they’re

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.670
greatness as it were improves you.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.470
They used to say of Oscar Wilde that when
you got done from a dinner table you felt

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.560
funnier and wittier and cleverer.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.879
Now a lot of Brilliant people make you feel
less funny, less clever, less witty because

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.890
they’re so clever, witty and funny, but
he had the opposite effect.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:27.459
A bit like what Shakespeare said about Falstaff,
not just a wit, but a cause of wit in others.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.520
Philosophy is an odd thing.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.920
When we use the word in everyday speech you
know you sometimes hear it hilariously.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.069
They say, “Oh, it’s never good to be late.”

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.579
“That’s my philosophy.”

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:47.760
You think that’s a generous description
of that rather dull precept to call it a philosophy,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.500
but it’s odd how philosophers generally
speaking, at least the ones I’ve read or

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.040
the ones I you know value, don’t have in
that sense a philosophy.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.170
There is no particular Socratic or Dimechian
or Kantian way to live your life.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.420
They don’t offer ethical codes and standards
by which to live your life.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.569
They don’t offer a philosophy to follow.

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.159
They just simply raise an enormous number
of questions mostly, so in the sense that

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.439
you put the question is there a philosopher
that’s important to me.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:27.219
Well I me I loved really the sort of the Bertrand
Russell grand sort of tour of philosophy,

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:34.109
the history of philosophy from the pre Socratics
as they’re called, Zeno and so on through

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.711
to Socrates and Plato and Aristotle.

00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:38.549
I never quite liked Aristotle.

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.180
I think that’s partly…

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.939
Although he was obviously a genius and brilliant
and he invented logic, so what’s not to

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:45.939
like.

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:51.379
I think it was his influence on the medieval
mind was probably rather pernicious and unfortunate

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:58.109
and all those categories and things, but when
it opened up with I suppose Spinoza and them,

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.150
but then Kant and the enlightenment era.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.150
Oh and actually Locke.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.230
I did like Locke.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.209
He was a fine philosopher, but they don’t…

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.340
I mean what is so great about them is that
they just…

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.700
They’re quite scary when you think of the
word philosopher and especially if it’s

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.109
logic and symbolic logic and it gets onto
Hegelian philosophies, incredibly difficult

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.210
to read I find and you follow it for about…

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.370
Well it’s like trying to grab a salmon.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.860
You know the harder you clutch at it the more
it springs, slips out of your hand and whoa,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.949
it’s gone and you chase it again and what
was that and you feel very stupid, but the…

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:40.090
I think the beauty of questioning and simplicity
that you get from Kant in particular I think

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:48.569
is just amazing because it’s like they say
of simple mathematical laws that make fractals,

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:55.229
the tiniest little elegant observation about
or question about something just spins out

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:00.060
these immensely complex things that make you
rethink everything.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:07.750
So yes, I think philosophy is a really important
dimension, but I think in our age we tend

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.139
to be rather sloppy about it.

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.760
We either think Buddhism is philosophy, which
you know or some sort of eastern thing about

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.400
being nice and spiritual and that will do,
which it’s fine.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.870
I mean you know obviously I believe in kindness
and niceness and lots of spiritual things,

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.030
but the real intellectual rigor and quest
of logic is something that I’m afraid takes

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.340
incredibly hard work and we live in an age
in which hard work is if not actively deprecated

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.820
or denigrated it is run away from or ignored.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.830
It’s sort of people frown at you and say,
“Well, that’s a bit dull and stupid.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.349
Why can’t we just short circuit it and talk
about like spirit?”

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:53.740
Well yeah, you can say spirit, but if you
think that’s philosophy and if you think

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.590
that’s good enough.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.810
The most important philosophy I think is that
even if it isn’t true you must absolutely

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.870
assume there is no afterlife.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:17.610
You cannot for one second I think, abbragate
the responsibility of believing that this

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.300
is it because if you think you’re going
to have an eternity in which you can talk

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.569
to Mozart and Chopin and Schopenhauer on a
cloud and learn stuff and you know really

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:32.340
get to grips with knowledge and understanding
and so you won’t bother now.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.330
I think it’s a terrible, a terrible mistake.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.949
It may be that there is an afterlife and I’ll
look incredibly stupid, but at least I will

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:47.400
have had a crammed pre afterlife, a crammed
life, so to me the most important thing is

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.610
you know as Kipling put it, to fill every
60 seconds with you know what is it?

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.360
To fill every unforgiving minute with 60 seconds
worth of distance run.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.880
You know absolutely, so that’s all I’m
saying I suppose.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:13.340
Is that there is no point wasting time being
lazy, though of course indolence in a divine

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.290
way, actually has its advantages.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.460
Oh, shut up Steve.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.830
Okay, next one.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.410
It’s interesting.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.169
Atheism comes into rather a bad press and
I suppose I’d rather describe myself as

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:29.310
a humanist, who human…

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.590
I don’t believe in God.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.139
I don’t believe there is a God.

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:34.289
If I were to believe in a god l would believe
in gods.

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:37.530
I think monotheism is the really ghastly thing.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.040
That is the absolutely staggering to me misapprehension.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.789
I can perfectly see why anybody might imagine
that each thing, each thing that grows, each

00:07:47.789 --> 00:07:53.300
phenomenon that we… that accompanies us
on our journey through life, the sky, the

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.950
mountains, spirits of nature.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:08:03.009
I can imagine why man would wish to endow
them with an inner something, an inner animus

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:05.249
that they would call the god of that thing.

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:06.340
I can see that.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.319
It’s a beautiful and charming way of looking
at it and I can understand the Greek idea

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:18.880
that there are these you know these principles
of lightening or of war or of wisdom and to

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.449
embody them, to personify them into a Athena
or Aries or whichever god you want makes enormous

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:28.510
sense, but to say that there is one only god
who made it all and who is…

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.070
Yeah, that is just…

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.070
What?

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.070
Why?

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.070
Who said?

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.070
Where?

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.070
Come on.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.700
And I love how when people watch I don’t
know, David Attenborough or Discovery Planet

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:46.800
type thing you know where you see the absolute
phenomenal majesty and complexity and bewildering

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.440
beauty of nature and you stare at it and then…
and somebody next to you goes, “And how

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.850
can you say there is no God?”

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:54.850
“Look at that.”

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.970
And then five minutes later you’re looking
at the lifecycle of a parasitic worm whose

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:05.320
job is to bury itself in the eyeball of a
little lamb and eat the eyeball from inside

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.360
while the lamb dies in horrible agony and
then you turn to them and say, “Yeah, where

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.839
is your God now?”

00:09:10.839 --> 00:09:13.070
You know I mean you got…

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.230
You can’t just say there is a God because
well, the world I beautiful.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.480
You have to account for bone cancer in children.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.470
You have to account for the fact that almost
all animals in the wild live under stress

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:31.029
with not enough to eat and will die violent
and bloody deaths.

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:36.120
There is not any way that you can just choose
the nice bits and say that means there is

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.350
a God and ignore the true fact of what nature
is.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:44.300
The wonder of nature must be taken in its
totality and it is a wonderful thing.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:49.740
It is absolutely marvelous and the idea that
an atheist or a humanist if you want to put

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:56.380
it that way, doesn’t marvel and wonder at
reality, at the way things are, is nonsensical.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.029
The point is we wonder all the way.

00:09:59.029 --> 00:10:03.200
We don’t just stop and say that which I
cannot understand I will call God, which is

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.260
what mankind has done historically.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.790
That’s to say God was absolutely everything
a thousand or two thousand years ago because

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:14.940
we understood almost nothing about the natural
world, so it could all be God and then as

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:20.779
we understood more God receded and receded
and receded, so suddenly now he is barely

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:21.779
anywhere.

00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:28.279
He is just in those things we don’t understand,
which are important, but I think it just is

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:31.470
such an insult to humanity and the Greeks
got it right.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:38.899
The Greeks understood perfectly that if there
were divine beings they are capricious, unkind,

00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:47.740
malicious mostly, temperamental, envious and
mostly deeply unpleasant because that you

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.940
can say well yes, all right, if there is going
to be god or gods then you have to admit that

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.210
they’re very at the very least capricious.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.330
They’re certainly not consistent.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.930
They’re certainly not all loving.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.890
I mean really it’s just not good enough.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:11.829
You know if we empower ourselves with responsibility
over our actions, responsibility over our

00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:17.339
destinies and responsibility for directing
and maintaining and creating our own ethical

00:11:17.339 --> 00:11:21.820
and moral frameworks, which is the most important
thing really isn’t it because perhaps the

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:27.709
greatest insult to humanism is this idea that
mankind needs a god in order to have a moral

00:11:27.709 --> 00:11:28.709
framework.

00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:36.360
There is a very clear way of demonstrating
logically how absurd that is because the warrant

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.830
for that logical framework, for that moral
framework that comes from God is always tested

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:45.449
against man’s own morals and it’s a complicated
argument, but I mean that’s you know it’s

00:11:45.449 --> 00:11:54.519
the standard one which is pretty unanswerable,
but the idea that we don’t know right from

00:11:54.519 --> 00:12:00.470
wrong, but we have to take it from words put
down in a book two, three, four, five, six

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:09.740
thousand years ago and dictated to rather
hotheaded neurotic desert tribes is just insulting.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:15.269
It’s just no, I mean you know if there were
a God he would want us to be better spirited

00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:17.259
than to take his word for everything.

00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:18.630
Wouldn’t he?

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:23.269
If he gave us free will would he really want
us to say, “No, I have to abide by everything

00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:28.970
that’s written in this book, all the laws
of circumcision and of eating and of… and

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.399
what to do with menstruating women?”

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:32.170
I mean, “I’m going to obey those written
down there.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.279
“ “I won’t think for myself because
that’s not required of me.”

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:36.279
Come on.

00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:46.110
It’s just not good enough and you know I
have no quarrel with individuals who wish…

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:47.509
who are devout and who have faith.

00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:48.940
I don’t want to mock them.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.240
I really don’t, but damned if I’m going
to be told by them what to do with my body

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.830
or damned if I’m going to have the extraordinary
battles won by enlightenment over the past

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:06.800
400 years, to have those battles abdicated
by a new dark ages.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.800
It’s you know.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:14.700
The battle lines must be drawn.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.600
Music in its time, but I mean that’s a function
of history you know.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:23.790
The fact is that composers always write for
the power because… or power and money and

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:29.230
it so happened that in the period when polyphony
all the way through to the classical and early

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:34.329
romantic era all the power and the money was
with the church, so some great masses and

00:13:34.329 --> 00:13:39.800
some great choir music and some great oratories
were written from obviously the Baroque age

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:45.829
being the sort of pinnacle of that, but all
the way through to Mozart’s final works

00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:52.339
and his requiem and Beethoven’s Missa solemnis
and Mendelssohn and so on.

00:13:52.339 --> 00:13:56.880
There have been some marvelous religious works
and in paintings similarly, but that’s because

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.509
these were princes.

00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:59.990
They were princes of the church.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.440
They were prince arch bishops who employed
Mozart.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:10.710
These were not spiritual beings who inculcated
these composers with a sense of the divine

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.750
that makes the music divine.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:20.209
The glory of Verde’s requiem or Mozart’s
requiem or Bach’s pieces is that they are

00:14:20.209 --> 00:14:24.920
fantastic, incredibly human and like all great
human’s thing they reach for the infinite.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.190
They reach for beauty.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.949
A religious person would call that the divine.

00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:31.190
You could call it the humanist.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:35.910
You could call it anything else, but certainly
is that.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.110
Religion has been good for that and good for
architecture because it is required that enormous…

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:44.920
It required enormous buildings for the shepherding
of people in, in order to do the services

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.339
and they spend a lot of money on it and so
they are rather glorious buildings.

00:14:48.339 --> 00:14:50.589
You’ve got to hand them that.

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:53.220
Do they make the trains run on time?

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.500
No, they didn’t do that.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.529
That’s about it really.

00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:58.100
And there are some kind individual people.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:03.040
I mean very kind people who give to the poor
and look after the sick and so on, but it’s

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:09.410
not necessary and sufficient as a justification
for religion because there are plenty of people

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:18.100
who are not religious who are also kind to
the sick and good to the poor and care about

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.100
people’s wellbeing.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.100
Yes, very much so.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:28.310
I mean Trevor Huddleston and Arch Bishop Tutu
from South Africa are two good examples who

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.100
were both genuine men of their church or let
me see.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:36.680
Huddleston is dead, but Tutu is still alive
and who both fought a terrible injustice and

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:42.590
used all the authority of their position amongst
their believers and but very bravely spoke

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:46.540
out and sometimes against the wishes of the
church hierarchies.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:53.550
Some liberation rheologist who are from you
know some of them mad communists, some of

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:58.319
them just decent liberals who fought against
the hideous doctrines of the Roman Catholic

00:15:58.319 --> 00:16:03.410
church for example and there are individual
voices who are raised in conscious against

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:08.640
the bureaucracy and the dogma and the doctrine
of the churches and you know certainly of

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:15.949
course individuals in you know Bonheoffer
for example in Germany, the Lutheran minister

00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:18.420
who spoke out against Hitler.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.420
There are…

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:27.380
Of course there have been good and fine religious
people and the Dolly Llama seems rather charming.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.380
I don’t know.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.380
It’s terrible.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:40.310
I don’t want to come over as some terrible
anti ecclesiastical figure, but.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:45.300
I came from what on the surface would have
looked like a very typical English family

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.470
in as much as I say a typical one that an
American might regard as typical.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:55.730
It was a country house with gardeners and
nice staff and it looked rather grand and

00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:02.970
I was sent away at the age of seven to a prep
school, which in England is from seven to

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:09.440
thirteen is prep school, sent away to boarding
school two hundred miles from home and that

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.310
sort of again was very traditional English.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:16.130
What you might call an upper class, upper
middle class sort of education and where I

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.970
received a very classical education.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:25.760
My parents were marvelously educated people.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:31.299
They’re both university educated, both brilliant
scholars in Irwin, my father a physicist,

00:17:31.299 --> 00:17:40.600
my mother historian, but not absolutely typical
of the class because my mother’s family’s

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.600
Jewish.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.970
She is European Jewish and she was…

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:48.460
She was born in Britain, but her sister was
born in the family area, which is now Slovakia,

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:56.150
but which was Hungary and indeed for a short
time, Czechoslovakia and so there was that

00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:01.220
sort of mixture, that rather exotic mixture,
the mother’s family of people who talked

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.890
about food, which was a very an un-English
thing to do back in the sixties when I was

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:05.890
growing up into.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.530
We had that kind of exotic accent and all
those things, but they weren’t Judaic.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:10.530
They weren’t religiously Jewish.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.780
They were just proud to be Jewish Jews and
there were plenty of them in Israel.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:20.870
Those who had survived the Holocaust were
in Israel or most in America and so in that

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:21.870
sense it was a…

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:26.159
It was an idyllic childhood looking at the
house and looking at how lucky we were it

00:18:26.159 --> 00:18:30.540
looks fantastic, but of course the childhood
is what goes on inside your head, nothing

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:39.090
to do with what goes on outside, so it was
the usually sticky mess of adolescent Sturm

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:43.510
und Drang.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:49.770
Always closest to my mother because my mother
is an extraordinarily warm and unbelievably

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.990
friendly and loveable person.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.650
People are genuinely astounded by her, her
positivity.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:58.270
She is just the most smiling person people
will have met.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:04.100
And so that you know obviously gave you know
closest warmth.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.970
My father was rather remote.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:06.970
I thought of him…

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:10.220
I wrote about this in my autobiography that
I thought of him as Sherlock Holmes.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.900
He was similarly a deeply rational man and
unbelievably brilliant you know because of

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.549
his physics and his mathematics and also music.

00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:22.760
As a young boy he was a choral student at
St. Paul’s Cathedral and played piano beautifully

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:30.620
and his musical understanding was very fine
and but very sort of great intellectual rigor.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.030
He seemed to us as children, to my brother
and my sister and myself as quite cold and

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.030
quite forbidding, quite frightening.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.539
He worked incredibly hard.

00:19:38.539 --> 00:19:39.970
He worked at home.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:46.980
The stable block of the family house, which
was a very large stable block indeed was he

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.470
converted to his laboratory is where he worked
and so he…

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.690
You know we never had the pleasure of him
being out of the house.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:58.130
I mean he was inside the house in his study
working you know working and we never quite

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:02.870
knew where he was and if we made a noise we
felt sort of thunder rumbling, so he was quite

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:08.110
a scary man and now of course on very easy
fine terms, but it was a difficult, difficult

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.179
thing.

00:20:09.179 --> 00:20:14.559
What makes a good family?

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:17.540
Well, I suppose obviously love.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.179
Love lubricated often I think by humor.

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:25.780
I think a family that can laugh at each other
and tease themselves and who are able to be

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.000
jolly with each other I think is the key.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.700
Humor is you know like a dog’s tongue or
dog’s nose rather, which should be cold

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:38.630
and faintly wet and a vet will tell you that’s
a sign of a healthy dog.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:44.820
I think our equivalent of a cold wet nose
is humor.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:49.470
Families where there is not much laughter
I think are signs of some sort of dysfunctionality

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:50.470
or sickness.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.900
Maybe if there is too much laughter it’s
dysfunctional too.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.900
Who knows?

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.900
Families are so different.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.210
I’ve never met anyone who says they come
from… they thought they lived in a normal

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:00.210
family.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:03.460
As children everyone thinks their family is
weird and they’re upset by the weirdness

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.780
of their own family.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:13.610
It is a peculiar thing we’re asked to do,
but I think GK Chesterton put it that it is

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:21.220
an onerous responsibility that having been
dropped by the stork down a random chimney

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:26.799
and unwrapped we are invited to get on with
a set of strangers who peer down at us.

00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:30.090
You know because although yes, we share the
DNA.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.690
You know they are physically of our flesh
and we are their flesh.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:34.690
Nonetheless they…

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:35.690
We didn’t choose them.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:36.690
They are a set of strangers.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.900
There is this man here and we should call
him Daddy and there is this woman here.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.270
We should call her Mummy.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.290
This girl here I should call my sister and
this boy here I should call my brother and

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:48.720
we are somehow bonded for life.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.320
I remember making an absolute…

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.290
Well, I wouldn’t say fool of myself.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:22:00.330
I was expelled from a meeting of Latter Day
Saints when I first went to Salt Lake City.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:05.060
I just literally as a tourist I was wandering
around and this person in a grey shift came

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.370
up to me and said, “Would you like to see
around?”

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:08.370
And I said, “That’s very kind.”

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.320
And then she started gathering others and
then I realized she was a Mormon who was doing

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.870
a tour and presumably there was a little bit
of a recruitment going on because they are

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.590
very proselytizing sect as you know, the Mormons.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:24.800
Anyway, she gave us a good tour and we saw
this tabernacle here and this here and so

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.120
on and then at one point she said, “I just
want to tell you a little about the church

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.120
of the Latter Day Saints.”

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:37.179
And we all politely stood and then she said
how in the afterlife all families will be

00:22:37.179 --> 00:22:38.179
reunited.

00:22:38.179 --> 00:22:43.470
You’ll be with your families forever, so
I put my hand up and said, “What happens

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.470
if you’ve been good?”

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.990
And she said, “Could you leave please?”

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:51.120
Because everyone started laughing, but I mean
what a ridiculous idea.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.900
How is that supposed to be attractive that
you’re going to be stuck with every aunt

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.250
and every cousin and every…?

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:01.789
Good gracious, every you know alcoholic or
slightly deviant uncle.

00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:07.700
I mean Jesus, it’s just the most awful destiny
imaginable and they think that’s a USP.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:08.700
That’s a…

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.180
Yeah, that’s what our church promises.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.180
Good Lord.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.320
Well of course, what it does.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:17.539
You don’t have to be that smart to spot
is what it does is that church focuses entirely

00:23:17.539 --> 00:23:24.700
on women the d’un certain âge as the French
say, woman of a certain age and who have lost

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:29.240
their children because they’ve grown up
and have lost their parents because they’ve

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:35.529
died and they’re lonely and they’ve still
got that family queen bee mother nesting instinct

00:23:35.529 --> 00:23:40.080
and they’re the ones the Latter Day Saints
hone in on and say, “You follow us and we

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.460
promise you that you’ll be your family all
around you again in heaven.”

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.450
And they think that’s a cool thing.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:49.620
Everyone else would go yuck.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.559
Anyway.

00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:56.930
I say and I think it’s true that for the
most, the first moment with Oscar was language.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:02.029
I was youngish, eleven-ish, twelve-ish, too
young really to be... well, to be entirely

00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:04.580
sure of my sexuality or what that sexuality
meant.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.690
I think I’ve always been aware of my sexuality,
but I never quite knew what it meant, but

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:09.690
what I…

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:12.679
So that side of him I would come on to, but
first it was language and I remember there

00:24:12.679 --> 00:24:18.600
is a line of Algernon’s in The Importance
of Being Earnest and I was watching the film

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:23.190
The Importance of Being Earnest and Algernon
says to Cecily, “Would you be in any way

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.620
offended if I said that you seem to me to
be in every way the visible personification

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:27.620
of absolute perfection?”

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.289
And I leaned forward and I…

00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:38.230
There were no videos and instant pauses and
on TiVo in those days and I replayed it in

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:39.230
my brain.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.900
“Would you be offended if I said that you
seem to me to be in every way the visible

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.370
personification of absolute perfection?”

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:49.330
And I thought how unbelievably beautiful,
the swing, the balance the rhythm.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:53.480
How clever to make a sentence that’s all
full of Latinate words ending in ation, to

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:57.929
make that sing and poetical because mostly
in the English language the words that are

00:24:57.929 --> 00:25:01.039
lyrical and beautiful are not words like the
personification.

00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:06.060
They’re rather technical clunky words, but
just simply by colliding them together it’s

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.720
funny and beautiful and breathtaking and I
had never…

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.539
I’d know that you could use language to
say, “Can I be excused?”

00:25:12.539 --> 00:25:13.929
“I need to go to the men’s room.”

00:25:13.929 --> 00:25:17.590
I knew that you could to say, “I want some
more.”

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:21.929
I knew that language had that function, but
the idea that it could be used to dance, that

00:25:21.929 --> 00:25:27.110
it could be used to delight, that it could
be used to enthrall quite so magnificently

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.929
was new to me, so I read.

00:25:29.929 --> 00:25:32.919
We had right in the country the library would
come and visit us.

00:25:32.919 --> 00:25:33.919
It was what is called a mobile library.

00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:38.230
It’s like a big van and it would come about
you know a half a mile from the house and

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:42.610
walk down a country lane to where it used
to stop and get in and that’s where I get

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.980
all my books and so I said, “Do you have
any Oscar Wilde?”

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:46.980
And they said, “Yes.”

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.920
I said, “I want a play called The Importance
of Being Earnest.”

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.800
And they said, “Yes, I think we’ve heard
of that one.”

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.270
And then it gets to me and I’m saying it’s
there in front of me and I read it and I kind

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.940
of learned the whole play off by heart.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.529
I mean I can still to this day, “Did you
hear what I was playing on the piano just

00:26:00.529 --> 00:26:01.529
now?”

00:26:01.529 --> 00:26:02.529
“I didn’t think it polite to listen sir.”

00:26:02.529 --> 00:26:03.529
And so on and that’s how the play begins.

00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:04.960
“I’m sorry for that for your sake.”

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.570
“I don’t play the piano well.”

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.779
“Anyone can play the piano well, but I play
with wonderful expression.”

00:26:09.779 --> 00:26:10.779
And so on.

00:26:10.779 --> 00:26:14.210
Anyway, I just became obsessed and then I
saw a biography by a man called Montgomery

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:19.770
Hyde of Wilde, so I read the biography and
this is where it all changed because not only

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:28.820
was this man as I said before, a lord of language,
it’s a phrase of his own actually, but he

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:35.470
was if you’d like a kind of secular messiah,
a Bohemian prince of the most fantastic power

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:44.120
and beauty and grace and gravity and he collected
friends and he looked at the world and he

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:49.299
showed you the true colors of things as no
one had and on top of that he shared what

00:26:49.299 --> 00:26:56.820
I knew instinctively was my sexual preference
of my own kind and not only that, but it caused

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.870
of course him the most appalling suffering.

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:06.070
He was despised and rejected of man in the
most terrible way and then when I read “De

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:12.380
Profundis”, the letter he wrote to Lord
Alfred from Reading Jail I think it was perhaps

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.330
one of the most extraordinary moments of my
life.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:19.409
Now of course like a lot of people in my generation
that meant I grew up with a sense of doom

00:27:19.409 --> 00:27:24.760
being allied to sexuality, that there were
no…

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:34.740
Literature and biography offered no examples
of happy endings for homosexual people.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.659
Gay wasn’t used then.

00:27:37.659 --> 00:27:44.120
So I had an immense and obvious sense of the
fact that my life would be doomed, would be

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:51.570
fatal and would probably end in prison or
in shame and something horrible, but the knowledge

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:56.830
that I would be joining Oscar Wilde and then
after that of course through bibliographies

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:01.909
you find out other people you know Andre Geed
or whoever, Michael Angelo.

00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:08.269
I would be joining a kind of Olympia of fabulous
men and women who were better than others.

00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:10.590
They had a special inside.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:17.590
They vibrated at art and beauty with a sort
of greater frequency and gave off a more wonderful

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:23.649
harmonic than most people did and so I was
proud to be an elect even if it was a doomed

00:28:23.649 --> 00:28:24.649
elect.

00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:30.090
That was my sentimental and adolescent I suppose
response to my sexuality.

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:33.210
I can’t imagine how different it would have
been if I had been born twenty years later

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.710
into a world of the internet and much more
open things.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:42.120
I’m sure it would have been a lot less doom
laden, but I suspect I would have read a lot

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.850
less literature and I would have been a lot
less interested in the intellect and the life

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:46.871
of the mind.

00:28:46.871 --> 00:28:50.740
I would have been much more interested in
just getting my rocks off I suppose because

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.429
it would have been easier to do so I guess.

00:28:52.429 --> 00:28:55.529
I would have been…felt less guilty for so
long.

00:28:55.529 --> 00:28:59.800
There are compensations though for the era
in which I grew up and that is as I say, the

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:04.890
fellowship of literature.

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:08.060
Yes.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:14.250
I never thought of course when I grew up loving
Wilde and collecting his books and even trying

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:18.820
to collect early editions that I would one
day play him onscreen.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:23.990
It was simply unthinkable, but it did come
to pass.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:31.480
I became aware as I entered my thirties that
it was just being shall we say, I was disposed

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.510
to the adipose.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:39.019
I was getting a little plump, that I could
if I grew my hair look a little like him and

00:29:39.019 --> 00:29:43.220
although that is a completely irrelevant basis
on which to be qualified to play someone is

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.220
it…

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:50.380
It just sets the thing on your mind and the
English player Bennett once stopped me in

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.669
Jo Allen’s in London just as he was passing
the table and he said, “I was looking at

00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:57.320
you from across the room and it suddenly occurred
to me you look terribly like Oscar.”

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.279
“You know, you should play him one day.”

00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:01.279
And I thought… and I looked in the mirror.

00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:04.720
I went to the gent’s and I looked in the
mirror and I thought gosh and I really didn’t

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.610
think much more of it.

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:13.809
Occasionally people would use that tediously
predictable phrase born to be wild and then

00:30:13.809 --> 00:30:17.720
suddenly I was approached by Julian Mitchell
the writer and Brian Gilbert the director

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:22.820
and Marc Samuelson the producer who had this
project and saying would I play Oscar Wilde

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:27.409
and it was overwhelming and what was even
more overwhelming was they had as a consultant

00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:34.000
this wonderful charming man called Merlin
Holland who was Oscar’s grandson who was

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.260
younger than Wilde was when Wilde died and
that connects us to is and it just so happens

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:45.110
that Wilde’s younger son Vivian Holland
married very, very late and had a very late

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:52.340
child and hence Wilde’s grandson lived you
know a hundred years after Wilde was Wilde’s

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.419
age, which is rare.

00:30:55.419 --> 00:30:58.840
So anyway, that seemed so exciting and novice
and I prepared it.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.390
I read as much as I could of course, but nothing
can prepare you for the…

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:04.460
I don’t know.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:08.050
Everyday getting up and worrying about whether
or not you’re going to let him down, whether…

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:14.039
I mean the one thing I was absolutely determined
was that Wilde was not just a sort of epigram

00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:20.620
factory, just a machine for spouting witticisms
in a camp brittle pea cocky manner going oh,

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.020
how to, to utterly utter.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:27.159
Everyone who described him described the mellow
gravity of his voice, the seriousness of which

00:31:27.159 --> 00:31:31.400
he looked into your eyes, which is what made
him so funny because he you know everything

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:36.950
he said was said as if it was absolutely true,
so when it was a dazzling paradox or a mother’s

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:41.760
aphoristic turn of phrase, literal turn of
phrase, you know where the thing is inverted

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:47.110
you know like, “Work is the curse of the
drinking classes.”

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:50.120
He didn’t say it in inverted commas as if
he knew it were a joke.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.000
He said it as if he had just seen it as the
truth and that made it funnier, but it was

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.730
also part of his whole manner is that there
was a direct simplicity about him, not an

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:00.179
arch campiness, which is…

00:32:00.179 --> 00:32:05.179
So even if I was hopeless I hoped the one
thing I could set straight about Wilde was

00:32:05.179 --> 00:32:12.720
that, so that was a heck of a feeling.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.820
Another side to him is of course that naturally
people think of him as a gay martyr and a

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:24.360
gay icon and a gay symbol for the age, but
that he was a marvelous father until he wasn’t,

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:28.500
until of course he created such a scandal
or it was embroiled that the scandal obviously

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:34.140
was disastrous for his family and that betrayal
was not a piece of good father, good piece

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:38.870
of good fatherhood, but while he was a father
he was a kindly father, a loving father and

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:42.799
he created one of the greatest gifts to children
that there ever was, which is his fairy stories,

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:44.740
which I don’t think are well known enough.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:52.260
I think they rank absolutely with the Grimm
fairy stories and the Hans Christian Anderson

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.260
fairy stories.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.260
They’re marvelous tales.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:59.139
They have all his qualities and something
extra, greatness of heart and the beauty and

00:32:59.139 --> 00:33:05.940
the charm and then amazing, I think the word
is proleptic, a sort of prophetic vision almost

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:10.070
of what suffering and pain and sacrifice he
would go through, although they were written

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:13.580
at the height of his happiness and his riches
and his popularity.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:22.350
There is a sort of doom in the way the stories
play out, which is quite staggeringly as I

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:25.330
say proleptic.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:34.460
I suppose I mean yes, Wilde teaches us much,
even from a 120 years in the past seems as

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.130
true as ever it was.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:39.730
He wrote marvelously in his essay “The Soul
of Man under Socialism” about the press.

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.870
In medieval times they had the rack.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:45.410
Now we have the press.

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:46.410
He…

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:50.820
I think he predicted really quite brilliantly
the enormous growth of the press, the impertinence

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:57.769
of the press, how wrong it was that the emphasis
on the press was on the individual lives of

00:33:57.769 --> 00:34:07.500
private people rather than on sharing truth
and beauty and innovation and I’m afraid

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:12.390
I don’t really enjoy the press at all.

00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:16.820
I like to know what is going on in the world,
but that’s a very small part of what the

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:21.730
press delivers, so I haven’t read a newspaper
for fifteen years I think, twelve years certainly

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:24.800
and certainly not a British one.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.260
I just don’t and I find I get on with an…
without them incredibly well.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.710
It is actually not just that it makes me less
unhappy.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:34.480
It actually makes me actively happier.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:40.620
It’s as if some huge weight is rolled off
me not to read the opinions of others and

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:45.000
I can quite understand why others wouldn’t
want to read the opinions of me and they don’t

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.320
have to and that’s the beauty of it is let’s
not…

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.560
But there is a sort of I think a more…

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:57.040
Wilde understood, but there is a sort of furious
anger in certain class of journalists that

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:01.980
they’re not being heard even though they
have access to everyone of their readers the

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:06.340
fact that someone else isn’t listening or
isn’t paying attention drives them slightly

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:11.960
potty and they actually want to bellow their
malice into the ear of the person to whom

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.820
it is directed and if they felt that person
wasn’t getting it, it would really annoy

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.790
them because they want to hurt.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:20.270
They actually want to hurt people and that’s
unfortunate.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:27.760
I just don’t want to be a part of it and
the thing was I was a part of it.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:36.050
I’m really not speaking as some giant noble
spirit who is easily wounded and must be sympathized

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.050
with.

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:41.130
I was a journalist or at least a columnist,
which is not… which is what my objection

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:42.340
is in news galleries.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:46.790
I was a columnist for several years for The
Daily Telegraph in England which is the most

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:54.660
successful or at least sells the most copies
at least of the serious newspapers and I could

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:58.540
see how easy it was to become this poisoned
figure because the…

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:03.671
You know there is nothing easier than writing
and article against something, which is so

00:36:03.671 --> 00:36:04.671
simple.

00:36:04.671 --> 00:36:05.671
It writes itself.

00:36:05.671 --> 00:36:10.820
You just got to be angry about something and
just got to puff and wheeze with indignation

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:15.230
and fury and resentment and bile and malice
and the thing writes itself and if you write

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:20.970
anything that’s for something it looks sentimental
and cutesy and you know so much… and so

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:24.170
much harder to write, so much harder to write
well.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:29.950
So all the successful columnists are… certainly
in the British press are vicious and they’re

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:34.640
good at being vicious and admirable and if
you share their politics mostly their viciousness

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.440
is something you can applaud.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.200
If you don’t then you just call them beasts
and animals and revolting.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.200
It just gets so annoying.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:45.990
It’s such a pity and that’s one of the
reasons I love the online world is that although

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:52.190
that exists in abundance you can choose absolutely
which part of the online world you want to

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:53.190
live in.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:56.930
You can make your own kingdom in that sense,
so things like Twitter or whatever I’m sure

00:36:56.930 --> 00:37:03.510
there are all kinds of Twitter you know clusters
of people who have politics that I would find

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:08.030
horrific and really just views that I would
preposterous and impertinent, but I just don’t

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:13.451
have to follow them and I can block them and
I will never know they exist and that’s

00:37:13.451 --> 00:37:14.451
glorious.

00:37:14.451 --> 00:37:17.700
And similarly as long as you don’t lower
your eyes when reading a blog, as long as

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:22.630
you don’t go down to the comment section
where the trolls lurk, where the viciousness

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:23.630
is because that’s…

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:29.030
I mean there really is just suppurating, boiling
seas of acid where if you just so much as

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:33.330
dip a toe you’ve lost your limbs you know,
just vileness abounding.

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:38.600
Again, there is this resentment, “I will
be heard and not only will I be heard I will

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.600
offend.”

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.600
“I will tear.”

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.600
“I will lacerate.”

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.600
“I will wound.”

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:47.790
“I want the sensibilities of anyone who
disagrees with me to be bruised beyond mending.”

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:51.920
That kind of attitude is very strong on the
net and for all that we can be advocates for

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:58.320
the glory and the democracy that exists online
we must be aware too that that dark side of

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.210
humanity that just needs to be heard and can’t
bear people like me for example who have access

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:10.020
to greater numbers of followers on Twitter
or whose website gets more hits and the more

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:16.440
they see that, the more the web becomes a
reflection of their view of the meanness and

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:22.020
wrongness of society where somebody will get
it all and others get none and then the more

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:29.780
bitterness there is and I think it’s difficult
because I don’t certainly want there to

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.141
be aristocracy on the net.

00:38:32.141 --> 00:38:34.120
I don’t want there to be that.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:43.380
I think that whole beauty of it at its best
is that there is genuine equality and genuine

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:50.450
reciprocity between you know a Twitterer and
his or her followers or between a blogger

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:53.230
and their readers and that it’s not…

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:59.330
You know it’s not an audience going to one
site that is permanent and stable and is like

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:05.530
the equivalent of the old models of the broadcaster,
but that it’s much more fluid and the broadcaster

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:12.630
becomes the broadcasted too, you know the
TV station becomes the audience and as long

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:20.330
as people believe that and behave as if that
is true then there is real hope in the way

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:27.010
information is going.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:28.100
Who was my first love?

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.230
Well I shan’t give you his name because
that’s unkind and he is married and has

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:39.400
children and I wouldn’t want to embarrass
his children, but I’ve given him various

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.490
names in novels and in books.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:47.940
Like a lot of first loves, certainly first
loves for sensitive people such as I was then

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:54.690
I guess I have what I have is called the primary
writer’s arrogance of assuming that my experiences

00:39:54.690 --> 00:40:00.420
are common to everyone else’s experiences,
sometimes it is true, mostly one hopes it’s

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.580
true and therefore that’s what one likes
in a writer.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:04.500
You think oh, I feel that too.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.710
Just occasionally you might express a feeling
and everyone goes, “What?”

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:14.550
Then it’s very embarrassing, but I’m assuming
that most people their first love when they’re

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:21.120
teenaged that unbelievable hole that opens
up inside them of longing and yearning, of

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:27.920
pain, of joy, that huge great bundle of toxic
emotions and allied to beauty and opening

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:33.620
out into nature and to glory and suddenly
connecting you with every love poet and every

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:40.000
love song ever written that that explosion
in my head and heart will never be matched.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.770
You can never hope to recapture the first
fine careless rapture as the poet put it,

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:49.300
but it stays with you like a good acid trip.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.920
You know you get a little flashback every
now and again.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:57.040
It will never leave you and it teaches you
to look at things differently and to feel

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.040
things differently.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:06.090
It educates your soul if you like and all
first love is unrequited ultimately because

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:08.110
it’s so huge.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:13.630
It’s such an act of giving and it requires
so much back that it can never be given back

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:18.480
and in that you wouldn’t necessarily want
to give them back.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.260
It’s just like a…

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:23.000
It is like an atom bomb.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
It is like…

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.980
It’s all the energy of who you are and who
you want to be and what you love and what

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:35.630
you hope to be explodes and it is impossible
for a single human being to offer that back

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:36.940
to you in a mutual way.

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.210
It would be like matter meeting antimatter.

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:45.990
It’s sort of almost important that what
you do is worship and yearn and long, but

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:50.940
so that was to me of course the single most
important thing in my life and occasionally

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:55.951
I get dreams and I’m back there again and
I’m still as trembly as every I was and

00:41:55.951 --> 00:41:58.490
I get… because I’ve written about it I
get emails and Twitters, whatever from people

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:03.180
in you know in adolescence who are going through
the same thing and say, “Oh, I read your

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:09.010
book and it was the same for me and it is
the same for me and he’ll never look at

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:10.430
me, she’ll never look at me.”

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:11.430
“What can I do?”

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:12.510
“I’ll make a fool of myself.”

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:13.690
“Should I write them a poem?”

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:14.870
And, “What if they reject me?”

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:15.870
And, “oh my God.”

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:23.710
And I read that and … You know these vast
sagas, these romantic sagas that are played

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:28.910
out in every school, in every village and
every town and every country in the world.

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:30.650
It’s going on.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:40.600
It’s all this massive emotional energy just
spreading outwards and some of it is… and

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:47.910
totally unhappily, so the only thing that
saddens me is that the, I suppose the default

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:54.680
community attitude of kids is to suppress
it and to smother it and to pretend it isn’t

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:59.010
there and to be ashamed of it, not because
it’s transgressive or because it’s gay

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:00.010
necessarily.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.830
It’s just as, just as, just as problematical
if it’s straight.

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:07.530
It’s nothing to do with that, but because
the school yard attitude is that you don’t

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:08.530
talk about these things.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:09.530
There is no…

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:13.720
You know you feel all this emotion, but the
language for it is forbidden really.

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:19.500
You just don’t do it, unless I think girls
are probably better at it and maybe the online

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:20.980
community helps with it.

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:25.630
Chat rooms and things you can express yourself,
but generally speaking boys of fifteen, sixteen

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:29.580
are much more interested in sport or even
if they’re not more interested in sport

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:37.210
and their soul is yearning they’re not going
to say it and if only they could it would

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:39.940
be good.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:44.090
I suppose ask whether you’re looking to
be loved or to love or whether you really

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:55.850
do because I think you know the risk of using
the parallel of the slightly vulgar or carnal

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:59.630
parallel of the gay community as it is amusingly
called.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:01.520
Why don’t straight people have a community?

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:07.440
Why don’t you say so what’s the view in
the straight community of dot, dot, dot?

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:12.200
Anyway, you know there is this thing of tops
and bottoms, which I find completely ridiculous

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.200
and nonsensical.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:17.920
But anyway, the idea of passive and active
is an obvious thing we can sort of grasp the

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:23.320
point of and I think that emotionally more
important there is an equivalent of that.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.450
There are…

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:28.550
It may be there are some fifty-fifty people
in the world who want to give love and receive

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:33.360
love in equal measure, but most of the problem
I see amongst friends and I’ve experienced

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:40.980
amongst myself is when people haven’t accommodated
the inequality that they want, they haven’t

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:44.630
understood that their partner wants to give
more love and receive less or they haven’t

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:47.800
understood that their partner wants to receive
more, but sort of give less.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.800
You know what I mean?

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:56.600
And as long as they fit in what they you know
then it’s wonderful, but I think people

00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:02.270
talk about one love, but there is the need
to love and the need to be loved are not the

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:13.950
same thing and I suppose that’s… and it’s
working that out is part of growing up.

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:15.330
What makes love last?

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:17.410
I wish I knew.

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:19.210
It can get ill and it gets better again.

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:23.320
I suppose I mean you know awful things that
cliché is that you got to work at it and

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.470
communication, laughter.

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:30.450
Laughter is deeply important.

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:40.790
Realizing that flaws are to be loved rather
than to be ignored or denied, that once you

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:46.250
admire and if you love someone enough you
actually love their flaws I suppose and you

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:52.710
hope they love your flaws, but I couldn’t
claim that I have a secret as to what makes

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.920
it last.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:46:02.380
Hope is another thing that makes it last.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.420
Yes.

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:09.000
I was first diagnosed actually not to my knowledge
as being possibly bipolar when I was about

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
fifteen.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.620
I didn’t know this until much later when
I made a documentary about my life as a manic

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:22.190
depressive or someone with bipolar disorder,
whatever you choose to call it, an uppy-downy,

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:23.510
mood-swingy kind of guy.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:28.830
In fact, technically I believe the correct
diagnosis for my condition is psychothymic,

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:33.460
which is like also known as bipolar light
in America, which is rather nice and makes

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:40.410
it sound like a variety of cola, but bipolar
disorder is a mood disorder rather than a

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:45.010
personality disorder such as that might mean
to anybody, but I think we all kind of get

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.010
what that is.

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:49.940
To me mood is the equivalent of weather.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.010
Weather is real.

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:53.860
That’s the important thing to remember about
weather.

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.000
It is absolutely real.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.211
When it rains it rains.

00:46:56.211 --> 00:46:57.211
It is wet.

00:46:57.211 --> 00:46:58.211
You get wet.

00:46:58.211 --> 00:46:59.211
There is no question about it.

00:46:59.211 --> 00:47:01.880
It’s also true about weather that you can’t
control it.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:08.140
You can’t say if I wish hard enough it won’t
rain and it’s equally true that if the weather

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:14.020
is bad one day it will get better and what
I had to learn was to treat my moods like

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.040
the weather.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.500
On the one hand denying that they were there
and saying I can’t…

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:19.500
I’m not really depressed.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.500
Why should I be depressed?

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.500
I’ve got enough money.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.500
I’ve got a job.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:23.500
People like me.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:24.500
There is no to be depressed.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.860
That’s at stupid as saying there is no reason
to have asthma or there is no reason to have

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:28.980
the measles.

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.050
You know you’ve got it.

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:31.390
It’s there.

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:32.970
It’s not about reason.

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:35.590
You don’t get depressed because bad things
happen to you.

00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:37.690
That’s getting pissed off and annoyed.

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:38.710
That’s reasonable.

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:42.970
Someone hits you in the face you go ow, you
know that’s… but depression is something

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:48.010
that happens like weather to you inside you
and it’s not about…

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:51.260
It could be triggered by something unfortunate,
but it isn’t…

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:54.490
You know it’s not enough to talk yourself
out of it by saying but I shouldn’t be depressed

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:57.890
because I’ve got people who are nice to
me, which is frustrating for people outside.

00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:59.340
They go, “Don’t be depressed.”

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.340
“Everyone loves you.”

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.340
“You’re really happy.”

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:02.340
“You’ve got a good life.”

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.340
I know.

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:04.340
That is what is so depressing.

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:05.740
I can’t help it.

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:07.100
So but once you…

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:10.960
It’s not a solution, but anyway, it’s
very important at least to get that stage

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.930
of it out of the way is to recognize it as
a mood disorder as something that is akin

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:19.950
to weather, but the nature of manic depression
or bipolar disorder is it is bipolar.

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:20.950
It is two poles.

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:21.990
It’s not just depression.

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:25.060
The point is that there is this other side
to it.

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:26.300
You have a depressed mood.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:33.120
You have an elevated mood that is mania, which
is the manic side of manic depression and

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:39.740
these are hypomanic or hyper manic states
in which you can be grandiose.

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:46.520
You can be absurdly extreme in your optimism
and your creativity and your energy.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:50.090
You can go for ages without sleep.

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:52.520
You can be sexually promiscuous.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.640
You can be a shopping addict, but people have
different ways in which they’re elevated

00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.060
moods are expressed and they talk nineteen
to the dozen.

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.370
They can’t stop thinking, their mind races.

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:05.150
They think they can solve the problems of
the world.

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:07.800
They think they have a unique insight.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:13.870
It can be a very blissful and exciting and
extraordinary state of mind to be in and then

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:16.250
comes the crash.

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:19.440
The problems of it are manifested in tens.

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:24.270
One is that people, most people outside family
and friends are more annoyed, are more uncomfortable

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:26.840
at the manic phase than the depressed phase.

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.310
The depressed person you can deal with because
all they want to do is just sit there and

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:34.000
they want to be in dark in the bedroom sleeping
and not doing any work and just hating themselves

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.830
and as long as they’re not you know really
considering suicide, as long as the pain isn’t

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:42.490
that bad then you can manage them whereas
a person in an elevated state is unmanageably

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:43.490
annoying.

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:44.490
They won’t stop talking.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:49.200
They won’t stop shaking their knees up and
down and getting excited and talking about

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:53.710
things and changing things and re-tidying
rooms and oh, like that.

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:59.240
So you know it can be a very frustrating for
people around you.

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:01.670
At its worst it can be very dangerous.

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:05.510
Obviously suicide is the down side of depression.

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:12.720
I had several suicide attempts in my life,
but also really and this always sounds like

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.300
a feeble excuse, but it is true.

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:19.110
The most natural way you would attempt to
cope with something inside you that is affecting

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:26.020
your moods and your energy levels is to intervene
with chemicals to help and because medical

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:29.590
science hasn’t come up with pharmaceuticals
that do particularly well you tend to reach

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:39.030
for the chemicals that are outside the Pharma
counter, i.e. narcotics and alcohol because

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:41.860
they can guarantee your mood more or less.

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:47.910
They like, like the condition itself will
store up a big crash or big reverse, but you

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:53.730
just keep at it and you keep getting drunk,
keep getting wired and you’ll stave off

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:57.310
the inevitable disaster of being alone with
your moods.

00:50:57.310 --> 00:51:01.850
So for a long time I was I suppose dependent
is the word on cocaine powder and naturally

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:06.670
when you take a lot of cocaine powder you
tend to take a lot of alcohol with it as well,

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:14.720
so for many years really I never went out
without at least four or five grams of cocaine

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:20.670
powder on my person and I would ingest it
intranasally as was the fashion through the

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:25.730
use of some sort of straw or rolled up currency
note and managed to get by on it.

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:28.480
I never did that when I was working.

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:32.210
I didn’t do it onstage or on while filming
or anything.

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:33.410
It was a way of ending…

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:34.970
As soon as you…

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:37.550
Because work provided its own high, but as
soon as I finished work that was it.

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:38.550
I was out.

00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:39.550
I was in clubs and things.

00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:40.550
I can’t believe it now.

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:43.030
I don’t know how I managed to do it.

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:48.730
It’s just extraordinary, but I did and anyway,
then I had a bit of a disaster in the mid

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:49.730
nineties.

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:53.900
I was in a play and it just all went wrong
and horrible and I ran for the hills as it

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:54.900
were.

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.980
Well actually I ran for Belgium which are
not hills at all.

00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:02.240
I ran for the low countries and through Belgium
went to Germany and I was… and so declared

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:08.170
missing by the British for awhile and then
I was found and it was all very ghastly, but

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:14.970
it sort of made me confront the whole business
of this diagnosis and I saw doctors and things

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:17.450
and they confirmed the diagnosis and then
a few years later when I was back on a more

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:22.980
even keel and more used to dealing with things
and a little bit more clear about myself I

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:28.740
made a program about… called Manic Depression
and Me or The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:29.880
was the proper title.

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:30.880
And in which I…

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:35.900
It was two one hour films in which I went
around America and England actually and talking

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:40.380
to people with the problem, talking to doctors,
talking my own history and my own condition

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:45.290
and it was really interesting because it was
considered something of a success this program

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:50.000
and something of a breakthrough and because
aside from all the problems I’ve spoken

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.130
about one of the major problems is not the
person who suffers with the disease.

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:56.840
It’s with the rest of the world and mental
health disorder and its stigma.

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.840
People just are terrible at coping with it,
other people.

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:01.230
They don’t like anyone mentioning it if
possible.

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:08.960
I had the great pleasure of dinner last night
here in New York with Dick Caveat, the talk

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.450
show host of the sixties and seventies, a
brilliant talk show host.

00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:15.000
Look him up on YouTube if you don’t know
his… the show he…

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.720
I mean he is absolutely wonderful, but his
career was pretty much stalled in many ways

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:25.970
by his fight with depression and he has written
about it superbly and he talked about it and

00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:31.260
we were chatting about it last night and it
is that problem of you know say to someone

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:35.470
I’ve got a broken leg or I’ve got diabetes,
particularly if you say diabetes and asthma

00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:37.910
say, which are both chronic conditions that
won’t go away.

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:42.530
People go, “Oh, do you take insulin or do
you take that little wheezer thing for your

00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:43.530
asthma?”

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:44.530
You go, “Yes.”

00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:49.370
If you say I’ve got a mental health condition
they go, “Oh, do you?”

00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:50.370
“That’s nice.”

00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:51.540
And they want to be somewhere else.

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.910
They don’t want to be anywhere near you
and I can understand that.

00:53:54.910 --> 00:54:00.160
Of course I can understand it, but you know
that it’s like six degrees of separation

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.160
I think.

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.180
You know that you know all six of Kevin Bacon
or whichever.

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:06.250
I don’t think that you’re ever more than
three or four steps away from someone close

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:09.690
to you who has a mental health problem and
I think the more we accept that it is us,

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:14.289
it is part of being human then the better
we are because then we can start concentrating

00:54:14.289 --> 00:54:18.700
on the things that matter in terms of coping
with it.

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:22.390
It’s a really…

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:30.490
It’s a really tricky business that of diagnosing
children.

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:35.510
On the one hand it is very good if the diagnosis
is sound and you believe in it to spot the

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:41.140
early signs of what could be a very difficult
growing up for a child, on the other hand,

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:48.370
to give Ritalin or powerful antipsychotic
drugs to a child as young as four or five.

00:54:48.370 --> 00:54:50.870
I spoke to a professor of psychiatry at Stanford
University.

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:56.560
He is one of the leading people in his field
who is quite prepared to diagnose very young

00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:02.080
children as being bipolar, not just ADHD and
things that we’re used to in children and

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:06.870
his point is that non intervention is not
a neutral act.

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:12.910
Not giving someone drugs when you’ve diagnosed
it is in itself allowing the brain as he would

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:18.870
put it to toxify itself, that whatever is
happening as the brain is forming if it is

00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:24.620
forming in a bad way, bad pathways, bad neural
signals are being sent and they’re creating

00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:30.750
bad pathways as it were or you know bad demands
for you know because let’s face it.

00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:36.770
We don’t really understand that balance
between hormone… if you like or hormone

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:43.930
and neurotransmitter, but that’s his argument
is that nonintervention allows the brain to

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:48.330
build itself badly, but it’s a heck of a
thing to give a child as young as…

00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:52.540
Well as young as ten or even as young as fourteen
frankly some of these powerful drugs when

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:54.670
the brain is still growing.

00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:59.360
I find it tricky and certainly in Europe it’s
considered outrageous, but it happens a lot

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.870
in America, but then you have more mad people.

00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:03.210
No, I mean sorry.

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:06.930
You have a bigger population and better scientists.

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:14.360
Yes, I’m always asked what was your favorite
city, what was your favorite state.

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.750
City, well I love New York.

00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:16.750
I just adore it.

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:22.230
I do like Chicago, but I think if I could
choose any city to live in I’d probably

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:25.080
choose San Francisco not just because the
beauty of San Francisco itself.

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:29.141
It’s a great town, but because of its nearness
to northern California generally and there

00:56:29.141 --> 00:56:33.110
is so much in northern California right up
through to the Sequoia National Park up to

00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:40.850
Oregon the Oregon state line and down below
in also Big Sur area and the vineyards and

00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:45.190
you know that part of America is just simply
unbelievable, so I would probably say the

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:50.200
favorite city is San Francisco and maybe northern
California if called it a separate state,

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.200
but So.

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:56.670
Cal. as they call southern California has
its charm to, but I loved Kentucky actually.

00:56:56.670 --> 00:57:01.450
I loved South Carolina, the lowlands of South
Carolina, Buford.

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:04.800
Montana takes a heck of a lot of beating just
for sheer physical beauty.

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.970
The lower of New England is wonderful, New
Hampshire, Maine.

00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:09.350
Maine people are so great.

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:11.220
Maine is the lovely…

00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:12.960
Down east as well, which is the absolute…

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:19.010
Ironically up east is what it really is, but
it’s called down east and marvelous people,

00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:20.040
marvelous, marvelous.

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:23.000
I mean it’s just a hell of a country.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000
It really…

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:31.050
You’ve got yourself quite a nation here.

00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:34.560
The worst career advice I’ve ever gotten
well, is to something because it paid more

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:35.690
money.

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:36.690
I mean it’s…

00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:44.010
I know it sounds obvious and cheesy, but it’s
just if you got two jobs and one pays a lot

00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:47.770
more than the other and they seem the same
maybe you go for the one with the more money,

00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:51.970
but even then I just think toss a coin because
if you go for it for the more money somehow

00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:56.800
you always end up paying more in terms of
ease and peace of mind.

00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:00.560
Of course one does things just for money and
everyone knows that when you do a commercial

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:04.960
you’re not doing it because it’s a statement
of personal belief, but it’s a fun film.

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.900
You try and choose a commercial, TV commercial
that’s good.

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:11.180
It’s made by a good nice people and it’s
a product that you’re perfectly happy to

00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:17.100
be associated with, so but obviously you do
those in order to earn time to do other things,

00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:22.490
but no, I don’t think I’ve ever been given
disastrous advice.

00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:26.800
We’ve mentioned some of my heroes.

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.820
Oscar Wilde is certainly one.

00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:33.680
I like people who are as unlike me as possible,
which is not an expression of self disgust

00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:37.850
or self hatred, but it’s just that you know
you obviously particularly admire things that

00:58:37.850 --> 00:58:47.170
you recognize yourself as not having, so ornery
artists, people who speak their mind and don’t

00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:52.080
care who knows it because I fear that one
of my greatest faults is my desire to please

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:55.360
all the time and my dislike of offending people.

00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:57.160
I think it’s a good thing in many ways.

00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:04.460
I’m absolute attacking my own instinct for
politeness, but I think I admire artists who

00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:09.830
just speak out or who are strong, so it’s
very hard.

00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:16.170
You know if I name them I’ll go home thinking
why didn’t I name this person or that person

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:20.100
and obviously the usual suspects of the you
know.

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:22.110
Your Mandela’s and your whatnots, how can
you not admire them?

00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:27.400
But also and this will sound sentimental,
people who live quiet ordinary lives of unremembered

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.860
kindness, people like my brother.

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:30.860
I’m not saying he is ordinary.

00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:39.650
He is remarkable, but you know he is a reminder
to me of the you know the… just the virtues

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:43.460
of being a good person.

00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:48.030
What keeps me up at night?

00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:51.910
My minds races with guilt at things I haven’t
done, things I’ve got to do.

00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:54.240
Things are always worse in the steady watches
of the night aren’t they?

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:57.630
The things you think oh my God, I’ve got
to do that, I’ve got to do that.

00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:58.980
Will I have time to do this?

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:03.560
I better set my alarm for an hour earlier
to do this.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:04.820
And also if I’ve…

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:05.850
I don’t know.

01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:06.850
You know and laziness.

01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:11.290
I still feel that I’m being watched you
know by my grandfather or somebody who is

01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:19.200
shaking his head at me and going you know
you let yourself down there.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.770
Who would I go to dinner with?

01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:21.990
Well obviously Oscar Wilde.

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:27.390
I mean I know it’s just he seems to be the
theme of our conversation, but he would be

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:28.390
a good one.

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:29.390
I’d like to go to…

01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:30.390
And I’ll tell you who else.

01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:31.390
I’d like to go…

01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:34.390
I’d like to meet F. Scott Fitzgerald.

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:36.410
I mean I love his lectures.

01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:41.160
I think he writes amazing letters and someone
who is just about the best writer his age

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:46.250
I think, just sentence after sentence were
simply perfectly made and I just want to know

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:47.270
how he did it.

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:48.530
That’s terrible.

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:50.420
I just want…

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:55.780
I mean there are other writers who you know
you could regard as just as great, but something

01:00:55.780 --> 01:01:00.930
about him just so technically perfect and
yet so I don’t know what it is.

01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:03.930
Whenever I read a sentence of his I think
it’s so simple.

01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:04.930
There it is.

01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:11.210
It’s in front of me and all the words are
easy and yet just wow and you know from his

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:15.060
letters that he did work very, very hard at
it, but I just want to know where it came

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:16.060
from.
