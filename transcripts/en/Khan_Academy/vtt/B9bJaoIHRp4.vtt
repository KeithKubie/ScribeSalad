00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.921
- [Voiceover] Hello
grammarians and hello Paige.

00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:03.017
- Hi David.

00:00:03.017 --> 00:00:04.813
- So today, we're gonna talk about

00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:07.309
the three different
ways to end a sentence.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.615
This is what we call a terminal
punctuation of English.

00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:13.171
Paige, what are those three ways?

00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:15.103
- So, the first is a period.

00:00:15.103 --> 00:00:15.936
- Okay.

00:00:15.936 --> 00:00:17.361
- And then exclamation point.

00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:18.194
- Poom.

00:00:18.194 --> 00:00:19.244
- And a question mark.

00:00:19.244 --> 00:00:20.435
- Swoosh. Poom.

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:21.518
- A period is

00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:24.923
just sort of the standard
ending to a sentence.

00:00:24.923 --> 00:00:25.756
- Sure.

00:00:25.756 --> 00:00:26.714
- Right, it's...

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:30.168
It goes at the end of,
I think, most sentences.

00:00:30.168 --> 00:00:32.133
I would say that all of the sentences

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.672
that we have spoken so far
would probably end in periods.

00:00:34.672 --> 00:00:36.573
- So what's a good example sentence

00:00:36.573 --> 00:00:38.842
that we can use a period at the end of?

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:41.347
- My mom ate a cookie.

00:00:41.347 --> 00:00:42.688
- So that's just sort of a

00:00:42.688 --> 00:00:44.829
straight up, regular ol' sentence?

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:45.662
- Yeah.

00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:49.045
- Just a standard declaration of a fact.

00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:49.898
- Exactly.

00:00:49.898 --> 00:00:51.778
- This is a thing that is
true. My mom ate a cookie.

00:00:51.778 --> 00:00:52.685
- Yes.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:55.343
- Cool, and then we just
put this period there to say

00:00:55.343 --> 00:00:57.227
that's the end of a...

00:00:57.227 --> 00:00:58.604
End of line.

00:00:58.604 --> 00:01:01.849
So then what is, what is
an exclamation point for?

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:03.256
What would we use that for?

00:01:03.256 --> 00:01:06.302
- Yeah, so an exclamation
point is pretty much

00:01:06.302 --> 00:01:09.436
if someone is excited
about what they're saying.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:10.269
- Okay.

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:12.019
- So if I were to say

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:15.112
I'm gonna eat so much
candy when I get home!

00:01:15.112 --> 00:01:16.785
I think that was probably an exclamation.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:17.618
- Sure.

00:01:17.618 --> 00:01:19.363
- And ends in an exclamation point.

00:01:19.363 --> 00:01:22.445
- But its not just like
good excitement either.

00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:24.763
It's not just like, wooh, this is awesome!

00:01:24.763 --> 00:01:27.978
- Totally. There can
be, you know, anger like

00:01:27.978 --> 00:01:28.993
go to your room!

00:01:28.993 --> 00:01:29.864
- Right.

00:01:29.864 --> 00:01:32.364
- Or like fear. If you said...

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.593
- Aaah!

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.032
- Yes. Exactly.

00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:39.598
- We have the period,
which kind of all purpose

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:42.540
terminal punctuation you
can just say a regular

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.647
declarative sentence. Here is a fact,

00:01:44.647 --> 00:01:45.814
my mom ate a cookie.

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:48.566
Or you can use exclamation points to

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.638
demonstrate excitement or strong emotion

00:01:50.638 --> 00:01:53.337
whether good or bad, so
like an interjection like

00:01:53.337 --> 00:01:55.950
aaah! Or a command like go to you room!

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.937
Or if your super excited,
I'm gonna eat so much candy!

00:01:59.937 --> 00:02:03.299
What is this thing used for? Huuuh?

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.067
- Well, I think that was a perfect example

00:02:06.067 --> 00:02:08.663
but that thing is used for...

00:02:08.663 --> 00:02:13.225
That is a question mark which
goes at the end of a question.

00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:16.238
So it basically just signifies

00:02:16.238 --> 00:02:19.320
I don't know the answer to this thing

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.413
and I would like an answer to it please.

00:02:21.413 --> 00:02:23.551
- So okay. So Paige,
what's an example question

00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:26.182
that we can throw out
using a question mark?

00:02:26.182 --> 00:02:28.654
- How about, is this edible?

00:02:28.654 --> 00:02:30.449
- Well it's the eternal question.

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:31.614
(Paige laughs)

00:02:31.614 --> 00:02:32.782
- I ask myself that everyday.

00:02:32.782 --> 00:02:33.983
(David laughs)

00:02:33.983 --> 00:02:37.502
- Okay so we have periods,
just statement of facts,

00:02:37.502 --> 00:02:39.923
exclamations, expressions
of strong emotion,

00:02:39.923 --> 00:02:43.074
or question marks, which
ask a question? I guess?

00:02:43.074 --> 00:02:44.571
(Paige chuckles)

00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:45.404
- Yeah.

00:02:45.404 --> 00:02:46.592
- Cool.

00:02:46.592 --> 00:02:47.429
Thanks Paige.

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:48.351
- Thank you for having me.

00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:50.480
- You can learn anything. David out.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.313
- Paige out.
