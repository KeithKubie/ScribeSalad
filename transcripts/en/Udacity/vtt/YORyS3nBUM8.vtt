00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.420
Now we need to change the behavior of
our edit text preference appropriately.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.330
What we'd like to do is
disable the okay, or

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.850
positive button,
until the user's typed enough text.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.610
The first part of this is easy.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.730
We'll override the show dialogue method
which is called the show the dialogue.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.630
After the superclass is called,
the dialog should be present, so

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.600
we can safely fetch the edit text
view by calling get EditText.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.750
We'll use a special callback of
EditText called an EditTextListener.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.440
We'll add an EditTextListener
which will get

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.550
called when the user changes the text.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.130
We'll only utilize the after
text change callback.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.170
Now there is a tricky part.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.110
We'd like to get the alert dialog that
is used by our edit text preference.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.550
But, there's no supported
way to get at it.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.890
We know it has to be there, because the
dialogue preference provides an alert

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.390
dialogue builder to
customize the dialogue.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.660
Let's take a quick look at
the Androids source that implements

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.550
dialogue preference.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.730
First of all,
let's grab a Chrome extension.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.220
This extension not only makes it
easy to search the Android SDK, but

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.850
it also adds an Android View Source
link to developer.android.com.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.660
So now we can just type AD to search for
edit text preference.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.688
And when we see DialogPreference
we also get a link to its source.

00:01:16.688 --> 00:01:20.420
As you can see, there's
an internal member called Mdialog.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.940
This is what is returned in Get Dialog.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.960
But where is it created?

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.140
As we can see, it's created for
our builder as we expected.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.200
So at least in current
versions of Android.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.990
We can expect this to
be an alert dialog.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.990
Great.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.690
But just in case this changes in
the future, we'll protect the code.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.470
We'll use the instance of
operator to verify that

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.350
the dialog return using Get Dialog
is an alert dialog as expected.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.490
If so, we can call dialog.get
button AlertDialog.button_positive

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.650
to get the button we need to enable and
disable.
