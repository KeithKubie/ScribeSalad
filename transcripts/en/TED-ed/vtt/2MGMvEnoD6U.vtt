00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:09.954
As you can see,

00:00:09.954 --> 00:00:13.029
I was born without fingers on my right hand.

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:16.002
And also my right leg was several inches shorter

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:17.374
than my left one.

00:00:17.374 --> 00:00:19.764
They broke the bones in the leg,

00:00:19.764 --> 00:00:23.000
then they screwed metal spikes into the bone.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.806
It has not only spikes,

00:00:24.806 --> 00:00:26.707
but wires that go all the way through the leg

00:00:26.707 --> 00:00:28.211
to stabilize it.

00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:29.418
I have to walk on it.

00:00:29.418 --> 00:00:30.747
I have to stretch it out

00:00:30.747 --> 00:00:33.894
so that my muscles don't just get all atrophied.

00:00:33.894 --> 00:00:35.416
People always ask me, "Does it hurt?"

00:00:35.416 --> 00:00:36.647
Yes, it does,

00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:38.751
but I focus on what I can do,

00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:40.415
not on what I cannot do.

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:41.561
I want to talk with you guys

00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:43.524
about overcoming obstacles.

00:00:43.524 --> 00:00:45.279
Everybody has obstacles,

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:46.442
a disability,

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:47.250
a hurdle.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.587
We face a choice:

00:00:48.587 --> 00:00:50.862
Let the obstacle overcome you

00:00:50.862 --> 00:00:52.865
or overcome the obstacle.

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:55.457
Maybe some of you have heard of Jim Abbott.

00:00:55.457 --> 00:00:57.670
He was a Major League baseball player.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.758
He won a gold metal in the Olympics.

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:01.589
He played for the Yankees, the Angels.

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.781
But he threw a no-hitter,

00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:05.885
and he only had one arm.

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:07.251
When he was a kid,

00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:09.635
he came home mad one time

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:10.500
and told his dad,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.332
"The kids won't let me play baseball

00:01:12.332 --> 00:01:14.303
because I only have one hand."

00:01:14.303 --> 00:01:15.253
His dad replied,

00:01:15.253 --> 00:01:16.918
"No, the kids won't let you play baseball

00:01:16.918 --> 00:01:19.573
because you stink at baseball.

00:01:19.573 --> 00:01:22.650
You can't change the fact that you only have one hand,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.172
but you can change the fact that you stink."

00:01:25.172 --> 00:01:27.635
So, his dad began to practice with him,

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:28.898
and he got good.

00:01:28.898 --> 00:01:30.665
He overcame obstacles.

00:01:30.665 --> 00:01:33.484
Teams would try to exploit his weak side.

00:01:33.484 --> 00:01:34.862
They would try to bunt to the side

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:36.517
that he had a missing arm.

00:01:36.517 --> 00:01:37.839
But they never succeeded

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:39.923
because he practiced and practiced

00:01:39.923 --> 00:01:41.918
fielding bunts to that side.

00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:45.254
There's no dishonor in having a disability,

00:01:45.254 --> 00:01:48.746
and I won't let anyone diss my ability,

00:01:48.746 --> 00:01:50.713
but I don't want anyone's pity either.

00:01:50.713 --> 00:01:53.252
I will not use the obstacles I face

00:01:53.252 --> 00:01:56.332
as an excuse for having a pity party.

00:01:56.332 --> 00:01:57.755
I will practice harder,

00:01:57.755 --> 00:01:58.635
play harder,

00:01:58.635 --> 00:01:59.753
and push myself harder

00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:01.589
to keep getting better.

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:03.172
Last season I started

00:02:03.172 --> 00:02:05.895
on my varsity high school basketball team

00:02:05.895 --> 00:02:06.939
as a freshman,

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.277
and I won Rookie of the Year.

00:02:09.277 --> 00:02:11.794
I was one of the top scorers on the team.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.679
One of the things that I find funny

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:17.957
is that people judge me by appearance.

00:02:17.957 --> 00:02:18.605
They say,

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:21.380
"Oh, look at this one-handed whitey with the limp.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.068
I don't want him on my team!"

00:02:24.068 --> 00:02:24.958
But what they don't know

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.650
is that I don't just have a disability,

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.537
I have an ability.

00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:32.319
One of my favorite moments from this last season

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.163
was we played a team

00:02:34.163 --> 00:02:36.005
that we had never played before.

00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:37.672
And when the game started,

00:02:37.672 --> 00:02:40.296
you could tell that they were dissing my disability.

00:02:40.296 --> 00:02:44.056
I mean, they double-teamed our tallest player.

00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:46.803
They just were playing really soft on me,

00:02:46.803 --> 00:02:47.662
and they just,

00:02:47.662 --> 00:02:48.977
you could tell they thought,

00:02:48.977 --> 00:02:50.933
"What can this guy with one hand do?"

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:52.657
So, they left me open for a three.

00:02:52.657 --> 00:02:53.912
I made that one.

00:02:53.912 --> 00:02:55.438
They left me open for another one.

00:02:55.438 --> 00:02:56.413
I made that one.

00:02:56.413 --> 00:02:58.370
Then, they started to get frustrated,

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.817
so they actually fouled me.

00:02:59.817 --> 00:03:01.495
I made both free throws.

00:03:01.495 --> 00:03:03.364
And they called time out.

00:03:03.364 --> 00:03:04.819
And as we were in the huddle,

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.864
I could hear the other coach

00:03:06.864 --> 00:03:09.406
yelling at his players about me.

00:03:09.406 --> 00:03:11.546
They went from not covering me at all

00:03:11.546 --> 00:03:13.700
to double-teaming me.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.654
It's all about overcoming obstacles.

00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:17.840
It's true, I have a disability,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.296
but so do you.

00:03:19.296 --> 00:03:20.755
I also have an ability,

00:03:20.755 --> 00:03:21.826
so do you.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:24.100
Everyone has obstacles to overcome.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.146
Some are visible like mine.

00:03:26.146 --> 00:03:28.070
Some are less visible.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.220
Maybe your obstacle is

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.932
that you come from a poor neighborhood.

00:03:30.932 --> 00:03:33.967
Maybe people say you'll never amount to anything.

00:03:33.967 --> 00:03:35.352
Prove them wrong.

00:03:35.352 --> 00:03:37.886
Maybe your obstacle is that you have a learning disability,

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:39.774
and people think that you're dumb.

00:03:39.774 --> 00:03:41.110
Prove them wrong.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.491
Maybe people judge you

00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:44.216
because of the color of your skin

00:03:44.216 --> 00:03:46.070
or your family background.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.452
Prove them wrong.

00:03:47.452 --> 00:03:48.577
I know a lot of people

00:03:48.577 --> 00:03:50.622
who take one look at me and judge me.

00:03:50.622 --> 00:03:51.492
They say,

00:03:51.492 --> 00:03:53.652
"Oh, that kid can't be any good at basketball.

00:03:53.652 --> 00:03:55.408
One leg, one hand."

00:03:55.408 --> 00:03:57.658
If someone things you can't overcome the obstacles,

00:03:57.658 --> 00:03:59.591
prove them wrong.
