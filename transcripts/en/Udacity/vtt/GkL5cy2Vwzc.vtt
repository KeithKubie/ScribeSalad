00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.084
&gt;&gt; First, you want to
understand the business goals.

00:00:03.084 --> 00:00:07.035
If you're not making money, if you're
not responding to where the business

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:10.316
needs to grow and to the culture
that the business is promoting,

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:12.463
then the solution might
be the wrong one.

00:00:12.463 --> 00:00:15.307
Second, you want to
understand engineering.

00:00:15.307 --> 00:00:18.407
The technologies,
which makes the ideas come to life.

00:00:18.407 --> 00:00:21.053
So without understanding
where the technology's at and

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:24.840
what the team is able to deliver,
it kind of doesn't matter.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.580
That's it.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.160
So we covered the business perspective
and then we covered the technology.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.095
What's missing?

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:33.337
What do you think is
the third perspective?

00:00:33.337 --> 00:00:34.253
&gt;&gt; The users?

00:00:34.253 --> 00:00:35.356
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:40.501
If there's something that's important in
design solution, it is who it is for.

00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:45.418
The designers and the whole team need to
understand who are the potential users

00:00:45.418 --> 00:00:47.068
and what are their needs?

00:00:47.068 --> 00:00:50.855
When you circle problem in this
manner and you look at it from all

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:55.430
perspectives, business, technology,
design, you're creating a more

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.870
holistic approach, so that the solutions
that come have wisdom to them.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.727
That they're not rushed,
that they're better targeted.

00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:06.627
&gt;&gt; And what would you say is the most
important thing in this stage?

00:01:06.627 --> 00:01:10.587
&gt;&gt; I think in this stage, it's important
to hear different perspectives.

00:01:10.587 --> 00:01:13.581
If you are over focusing on one and
not the other,

00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:16.367
you might have a solution
that's lopsided.

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:20.599
So in sprint, we try to be balanced in
the beginning and hear from everyone

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:25.331
who'll be involved in making the product
or who'll be involved in approving it.

00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:27.411
If you're in a large company,

00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:32.298
this may be the director of the product
and the director of engineering.

00:01:32.298 --> 00:01:34.838
They represent the business and
the technology.

00:01:34.838 --> 00:01:39.134
Similarly, the user researchers or
the marketing and sales teams.

00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:40.838
Now, if you're in a startup,

00:01:40.838 --> 00:01:44.651
you might not have a person
representing every single perspective.

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:46.773
&gt;&gt; You could be the single person
who represents everything.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:47.899
&gt;&gt; You could be the three things, right?

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:48.457
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:51.208
&gt;&gt; In a startup, you often
are wearing all these different hats.

00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:53.855
So, it's useful to consider and pause.

00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:55.529
Even if you're one person or

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:59.576
even if you are small team that
doesn't have diversified roles yet,

00:01:59.576 --> 00:02:03.204
what are the perspectives on this
problem as looking in it from

00:02:03.204 --> 00:02:07.910
a business perspective, there's one
set of issues that they're important.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.627
Those are about the metrics,
the goals, the revenue.

00:02:10.627 --> 00:02:12.702
Looking in from
a technology perspective,

00:02:12.702 --> 00:02:14.389
there's another set of problems.

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.408
That is generally,
what is the code able to do?

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:19.705
What are the features
that are being developed?

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:23.561
What's available to outsource or
what APIs are available to bring in?

00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:25.489
And then from a design perspective,

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.668
it's about what are the user
needs that you want to address?

00:02:28.668 --> 00:02:31.000
When you look at it from
these three perspectives,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.485
even if you have a small team, you're
helping people stretch their minds.

00:02:34.485 --> 00:02:38.036
They're really opening up, so
that they can consider and

00:02:38.036 --> 00:02:39.709
not miss out on a good idea.

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.785
&gt;&gt; Right and
what could go wrong in this stage?

00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:44.701
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's a great question.

00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:48.800
Often, I see teams take a very
long time in this stage.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.962
If the team doesn't know each other
well, this may be a rare opportunity for

00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:57.125
them to start talking to each other and
they're so excited to learn from each

00:02:57.125 --> 00:03:00.397
other that the stage can drag on and
take two or three hours.

00:03:00.397 --> 00:03:04.062
The goal of the sprint is to understand,
but then quickly move towards the other

00:03:04.062 --> 00:03:07.579
stages in which people are defining
a strategy and starting to make things.

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.515
So what could go wrong is the team
can spend too long in this stage.

00:03:11.515 --> 00:03:14.968
&gt;&gt; So they could be circling
around until they understand and

00:03:14.968 --> 00:03:17.018
never to get to an understanding.

00:03:17.018 --> 00:03:21.615
&gt;&gt; What could go wrong is they
could be like really circling.

00:03:21.615 --> 00:03:25.795
Another thing that could go wrong,
which is actually a chance for

00:03:25.795 --> 00:03:31.450
something to go right is that the
challenge might be improperly defined.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.876
Sometimes people who are beginners
in the art of being a sprint master,

00:03:35.876 --> 00:03:38.839
approach the challenge
in a very specific way.

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:41.997
And when they offer to the team,
they learn that actually the team has

00:03:41.997 --> 00:03:45.654
a different need and there's something
else that's more important to solve.

00:03:45.654 --> 00:03:48.393
That is a mistake that's easier
to correct in the beginning

00:03:48.393 --> 00:03:50.378
of this program and
not during this phase.

00:03:50.378 --> 00:03:54.764
But if a sprint leader finds themself
confronted with a team that says,

00:03:54.764 --> 00:03:57.104
we should be solving something else,

00:03:57.104 --> 00:04:00.120
it is a great opportunity
to seek to understand.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.997
Open your ears and help your team agree
on what is the right thing to do,

00:04:03.997 --> 00:04:04.600
quickly.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.238
&gt;&gt; Very cool.

00:04:05.238 --> 00:04:09.570
So what I hear from you is that
the basic of these stages to understand.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.048
To understand the business,
to understand the technology and

00:04:12.048 --> 00:04:13.133
to understand your users.

00:04:13.133 --> 00:04:13.690
&gt;&gt; That's right.
