00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.770
ELIZABETH ANCARANA: So we
have four faculty members,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.680
your colleagues here today.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.120
Two are associate
professors, and two

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.190
are tenured faculty members.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.100
And so we thought it would
be helpful for each of them

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.760
to provide some remarks
on helpful advice

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.580
that they would give you from
their various academic career

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.180
stages on navigating life
and your professional path

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.380
as a scholar at Harvard.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.430
So we're going to
start with Gina Kim.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.070
Jinah Kim is the Gardner
Cowles Associate Professor

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.600
of History of Art
and Architecture

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.850
in the faculty of
Arts and Sciences.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.440
She's trained as
an art historian

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.020
of South and Southeast
Asia with an emphasis

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.790
on Buddhist material.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.210
Her research and publications
explore a wide range of topics,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.820
from issues of female
representation and patronage

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.330
of art in medieval South
Asia to reappropriation

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.810
of religious sites and objects
in post-colonial contexts

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.300
of South and Southeast Asia.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.000
Jinah's first book,
Receptacle of The Sacred--

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Illustrated Manuscripts
and the Buddhist Book Cult

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.780
in South Asia earned the Bernard
Cohen Prize honorable mention

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.610
in 2015.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.870
Her second monograph, Garlands
of Visions-- color, tantra,

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.120
and a material history
of Indian painting,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.030
demonstrates how pothi
manuscripts transformed

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.520
Indian painting into
a portable media that

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.180
can transform a vast amount
of visual knowledge in color.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.540
She's also developing a digital
humanities project on color

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.510
which will serve as a searchable
open database for research

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.850
on pigments.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.590
Jinah received her Bachelor
of Arts in Archeology and Art

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.010
History from Seoul National
University and both

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.470
a master's degree in and
a PhD in History of Art

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.100
from the University of
California at Berkeley.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.040
From her perspective as
an associate professor,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.680
Jinah will talk about finding
resources for scholarship

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.010
and research, navigating
Harvard and your department,

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.220
managing work and life,
and pleasures of being

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.030
on the faculty at Harvard.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.790
After Jinah provides
remarks, we'll

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.910
turn to Nicole Maestas, who
is an associate professor

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.370
of Health Care Policy at
Harvard Medical School

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.830
and a research associate
of the National Bureau

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.930
of Economic Research,
where she also

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.730
serves as the director of NBER's
Disability Research Center.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.400
Her research studies how the
health and disability insurance

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.220
systems affect individual
economic behaviors

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.360
such as labor supply and the
consumption of medical care.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.090
Nicole's work has shown how the
federal disability insurance

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.140
system discourages employment
by people with disabilities.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.350
She's also examining how
population aging affects

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.840
economic growth and how
working conditions affect

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.630
individual's ability and
desire to sustain employment

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.550
at older ages.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.520
Nicole earned a Bachelor of
Arts in English and Spanish

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.740
from Wellesley
College, a Master's

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.930
of Public Policy from the
Goldman School of Public

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.500
Policy at UC Berkeley
and a PhD in Economics

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.050
also from UC Berkeley.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.060
From her perspective
as a recently promoted

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.760
associate professor, Nicole
will talk about priority

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.925
setting and managing your
workload and work and life.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.400
Then we'll turn to
Matthew Weinzierl.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.430
Matt Weinzierl is the Joseph
and Jacqueline Elbing Professor

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.930
of Business Administration
in the Business, Government,

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.200
and the international Economy
Unit at Harvard Business

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.290
School, and he's also a research
associate at the National

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.540
Bureau of Economic Research.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.190
His academic
research has largely

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.070
focused on the optimal
design of economic policy

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.530
and the role of
government in the economy.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.720
His current projects
identify and formalize

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.580
the goals for tax
policy that hold

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.860
sway among the
public, political,

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.740
and economic leaders
and leading tax thinkers

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.930
and then characterize
the implications of using

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.100
those objectives in the
analysis of optimal taxation.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.810
Recently, Matt
has launched a set

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.900
of research projects focused
on the commercialization

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.380
of the space sector and
its economic implications.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.480
Matt didn't earn his
degrees from Berkeley.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.150
However, he earned a
Bachelor of Arts and a PhD,

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.000
both in Economics, from
Harvard University.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.400
From his vantage point as
a recently tenured faculty

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.350
member, Matt will
provide to those

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.860
who've not spent time at Harvard
before advice on what you might

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.540
want to know about
the university

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.470
when joining the faculty here.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.700
And finally, Hopi Hoekstra is
the Alexander Agassiz Professor

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.240
of Zoology, jointly appointed
in the Departments of Molecular

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.890
and Cellular Biology and
Organismic and Evolutionary

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.120
Biology.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.640
She's also an investigator
with the Howard Hughes Medical

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.280
Institute and the
curator of mammals

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.860
in the Museum of
Comparative Zoology.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.530
Hopi also serves on
the FAS's Committee

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.070
on Appointments and Promotions,
otherwise known as CAP.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.110
As an evolutionary
geneticist, Hopi

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.710
studies the molecular basis
of adaptation in wild mice.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.380
Her work spans the fields
of evolution, behavior,

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.760
morphology, genetics, genomics,
development, and neurobiology.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.569
She has received many awards
for her research and teaching,

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.860
including the Richard Lounsbery
Award from the National

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.770
Academy of Sciences,
election into the National

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.250
Academy of Sciences, the
Fannie Cox Prize for Teaching

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.640
Excellence, and an appointment
to a five-year Harvard College

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.840
professorship.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.710
Alas, Hopi does hold a
BA in integrative biology

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.460
from the University
of California Berkeley

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.790
and a PhD in zoology from
the University of Washington.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.740
From her vantage point
as a tenured faculty

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.050
member at Harvard, Hopi
will talk about resources

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.140
for teaching and mentoring
and managing your workload

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.910
and life.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:36.630
Jinah?

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.890
JINAH KIM: All right.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.480
Thank you, Elizabeth, for
that wonderful introduction.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.820
And good afternoon, everyone.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.930
While I was just introduced,
my name is Jinah Kim,

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.450
and I teach history or art.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.000
I'm in history of
art and architecture

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.690
in Arts and Humanities
Division in FAS.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.330
And I'm excited to see
so many new colleagues

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.970
in our division,
Arts and Humanities,

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.300
and also including one
in my own department

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.060
and in FAS and all other
professional schools.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.970
And when Judy asked me to be
on this new faculty institute,

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.060
I readily agreed,
because I found

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.700
it very helpful when
I joined this campus

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.200
like five years ago.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.200
And also because
I've got so much

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.690
help from her office and
also all the resources

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.010
available to Harvard
faculty on this campus.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.560
And I felt I should share.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.280
And so I was speaking about--

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.340
I just condensed it
into three aspects

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.770
of finding resources for
scholarship and research

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.550
and maybe a little bit
about managing work and life

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.220
and pleasures of the
faculty position at Harvard.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.420
So finding resources for
scholarship and research--

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.640
and you will find
there is a good amount

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.860
of administrative
support on this front.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.520
I'll just speak from
being faculty on FAS

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.200
that we have the FAS
Research Development

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.440
Office that can help
you find funding

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.020
sources for your projects.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.480
When I was developing
this exhibition project

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.790
on Nepalese Buddhist
ritual art, I really

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.600
needed to find funding
to support this project.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.750
And I met with folks at the
FAS research development,

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.730
and they did all this
research and came up

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.060
with all these resources
that I could apply internally

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.780
and externally.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.990
And they were super helpful.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.480
And that is, in a way, time
saving for your own research

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.400
and work that you will do.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.340
And I'm sure there are other
services campus-wide that's

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.810
available like that.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.080
But for me, finding resources
for research and scholarship

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.210
is intimately tied
to really navigating

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.560
Harvard and your department,
because the possibility to tap

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.650
into the resources, the
human resources, the eminent

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.380
scholars that are now
your campus colleagues,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.510
and being able to
connect with them

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.440
for new possibilities
and research engagement

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.590
is just enormous.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:00.660
However, in practical
terms, as everyone

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.660
has been talking about,
making connections

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.470
on the Harvard campus takes
extra efforts and time.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.300
I think more so than
some other campuses.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.580
So this is partly because
everyone is so busy,

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:19.490
them being eminent and
very popular and on demand.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.780
And we joke about how you
will hear your colleagues

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.040
speak at some other
big universities

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.890
but not in your own
department, because you just

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.200
don't get to have that kind of
chance, and they're so busy.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.120
And you have to make that extra
effort to schedule meetings

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.650
and coffee and lunch.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.409
And I was looking back
on-- so in preparation

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.809
for this institute,
I was looking back

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:45.020
on my calendar for fall 2013.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.700
And I realized,
there are just so

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.640
many meetings, lunch meetings,
tea, coffee meetings,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.490
with all these faculty members
in my department and elsewhere.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.550
And this is partly
thanks to the advice

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.280
I was given by a
senior faculty member

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.220
on this campus who
said, make sure

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.580
that you meet with your
senior members or members

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.120
of your department and
have individual meetings.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.720
You really connect with them.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.310
And I try.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.860
I didn't get to do all
of them in one year,

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.130
because everyone goes on
leave, and it's just hard.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:21.440
And my list of to do, of
having to have lunch with list

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.700
keeps growing.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.220
But it is a great
chance to introduce

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.177
yourself and your work and
learn about their research

00:09:28.177 --> 00:09:28.760
and interests.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.120
And the unspoken
rules for new faculty

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.030
seems to be that senior
colleagues and colleagues who

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.670
have been here
often take you out

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:42.020
for a meal or coffee for
all these initial meetings

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:42.680
as a welcome.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.900
So it's a free lunch.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.950
So always invite
yourself for a meeting.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:53.270
And I'm happy to take anyone
out for lunch or coffee.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.630
So I will do the same,
because I've been always given

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.580
these opportunities.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.180
And one of the unique aspects
of Harvard that was iterated all

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.900
year is that-- and it took
a while for me to comprehend

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.370
actually, by heart--

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.580
is how much autonomy
and independence

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.860
each academic department has.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.500
And this system really ensures
that each academic unit

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.530
keeps its integrity
and really sustains

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.260
a kind of excellence
while promoting

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.050
deep scholarship in each field.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.600
But downside of this
is that it can also

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.970
be a barrier that
blocks connecting

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.340
with scholars and experts
outside your immediate fields.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.260
And you will notice there is
no shortage of scholarly events

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.490
on Harvard campus.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:41.400
When I arrived on this
campus five years ago,

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.630
the senior scholar in
the Cambridge residence

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.050
mentioned to me that
Harvard is like a Disneyland

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.880
for scholarly minds.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.320
And I think that's
sort of an apt analogy.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.570
Just there are a number of
exciting and interesting talks

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.180
and symposium at any given time.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.960
On the other hand, because
of this siloed nature

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.880
of its academic
units, sometimes one

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.040
does not get to learn
about it or know

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.590
about this scholar
giving a talk or there

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.770
is an event that's really
crucial to your own research

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.730
that is happening until the
day of or after it's over,

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.100
which is quite a loss, actually.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.160
So for example, an eminent
Buddhist studies scholar

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.300
was giving a talk on campus,
and I learned about it

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.620
like two days before the talk.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.520
And I barely managed to
make parts of that event.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.550
But if people and scholars
in Buddhist studies

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.670
known about my research
interest in Sanskrit Buddhist

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.010
manuscripts and
Tantric Buddhism,

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.810
they might have
actually alerted me

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.240
that somebody working
on that is coming.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.210
And I would have actually
arranged the meeting in advance

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.510
when he was just here
briefly from Hamburg.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:53.300
So I'm not about to go out
to see him, but if he's here,

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.970
I might as well have seen him.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.330
So my point being, the
more people on campus

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.700
know about your research
interests, the better

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.830
your chances of
getting connected

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.780
with scholarly resources.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.850
And you think now
you're at Harvard,

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.460
everyone should know
what you're working on.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.550
That's not the case.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.270
And you need to be
your own spokesperson,

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.092
and that's really important.

00:12:17.092 --> 00:12:18.800
And of course, the
campus-wide gatherings

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.860
that Judy's office provides
are really great opportunities

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:26.210
to meet and connect
with scholars who are

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.920
working outside your own field.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.790
And I also recommend looking up
all these institutes, centers,

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:35.360
that are so cognate in
your cognitive fields

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.240
and making efforts to connect
with them, because even

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.870
just signing off for the
event letters or newsletters

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.960
is actually helpful to know
about these events going on

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.010
around the campus.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:49.310
And you can decide to go
or not to go, but at least

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.680
just to actually have
an understanding of what

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.080
goes on around the campus
is actually helpful.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.190
And I thought I would
be part of these groups.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:00.830
But it's not automatic you would
be plugged into these existing

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:01.350
communities.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.500
You really do need
to make efforts to be

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.620
connected to these resources.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.270
So in my first year here,
I organized an event

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:15.910
on Nepal and a talk on
Southeast Asian art, let's say.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.340
And I reached out to
South Asia Institute,

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.440
now named Lakshmi Mittal and
Family South Asia Institute,

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.190
the executive director,
basically asking for money,

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.690
right?

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.840
And I really needed funding
to sponsor these events.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.450
And that actually was the
beginning of many collaborative

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.480
efforts which culminated
in my hosting my field

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.330
symposium on the
Harvard campus, which

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.170
really was a great success.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.760
And being part of
this institute,

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.100
which actually is kind of
result of this one unit,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:50.500
"one Harvard" effort,
that I can also get

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.420
plugged into many
different networks

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.000
that I would have not access to.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.440
And being part of and being
plugged into these networks

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.649
are really important doing
research in South Asia.

00:14:01.649 --> 00:14:03.190
I don't know how
many of you actually

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:04.866
do research outside the US.

00:14:04.866 --> 00:14:07.240
But if you actually have to
go somewhere and do research,

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.250
you really do need connections.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.820
And it really serves to have
these kind of connections

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.990
well established.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.540
And of course, Harvard
name does carry weight

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.400
when representing
serious research.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.462
So you do get a lot more access.

00:14:20.462 --> 00:14:21.670
There is no doubt about that.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.610
But having these
connections that

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.460
are really concrete that can
introduce you to these people

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:31.420
can actually open archives and
reserve collections that would

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.882
never be have been accessible.

00:14:33.882 --> 00:14:35.590
And of course, the
Mittal Institute being

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.830
part of this "one
Harvard" motto,

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.950
I get to actually meet
people from Kennedy School,

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.790
public health, business
school, medical schools, GSD,

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:46.760
School of Education.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.400
So it's a great milieu where
I can actually talk to people

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.340
and learn about their
exciting projects.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.300
And in fact, given
this opportunity

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.850
of having all these scholars
from different schools,

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.770
I will actually shamelessly
plug in my project on this.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.830
This is total humanities project
on mapping color and history,

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.230
because I'm discovering
this is really

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.500
trying to create a
online database that

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.670
is searchable on historical
and scientific information

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.530
on pigments in these paintings.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.990
And I'm discovering this
is so hard to deal with,

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.590
not having any background on
data science or statistics.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.300
And I heard a lot of data
science and statistics

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.126
in the crowd.

00:15:30.126 --> 00:15:34.640
Any of you experts, I would
love to talk to you afterwards.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.670
So it's just making these
kinds of connections.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.480
And finding centers
that you can help set

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.260
can actually connect you through
these different nodal points

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.990
I think are really important.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.220
And you need to
make that effort.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.030
So my basic attitude in
advancing scholarship

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:56.290
and research is really to ask,
to ask and to ask, shamelessly

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.040
ask.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.740
And whether it's for funding
or any other connections

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.400
you need, and you
will find an answer.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.950
I'll talk a little bit
about managing work and life

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.680
from the perspective
of a working

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.730
mother of a 10-year-old boy
who constantly sort of suspects

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:17.770
that his mother loves
her work more than him.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.556
And I arrive on this campus
with a five-year-old son.

00:16:21.556 --> 00:16:22.930
And my husband
works in New York,

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:27.130
so that presents a challenging
situation for child care.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.100
And the child care
and funding supports

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.060
that come from Judy's
office-- and also,

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.630
FAS has funding support-- and
these are all very helpful.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.830
And I did use the dependent care
fund to travel internationally

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:39.910
to give talks.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.780
And I had to take
my child with me.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.110
And that was a great support.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:48.130
And I have to say, as much
as my 10-year-old likes

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.620
to give me a hard
time by saying,

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.880
you love your work
more than you love me,

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.200
but he loves being part
of my work and research.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:16:59.860
I have to say.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.770
And he, from the
tender age of four,

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:10.450
he said he would be my research
assistant and help Mommy.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.660
And finally, on the pleasure
of being on Harvard faculty,

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.819
and in addition to these
incredible resources

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.400
and scholarly assets,
I'd say working

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.640
with these exceptional
students are just phenomenon.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.800
It is phenomenal
to be working with

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.880
these exceptional students.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.400
When I taught a freshman
seminar in one fall,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.790
I was just so stunned by the
amount and quality of the work

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.680
that freshmen produced.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.500
And this sort of leads to the
last tip I will share here,

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.090
which my department
colleague, Jennifer Roberts,

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:47.680
shared with us at my new faculty
institute, which is to say,

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.460
you should design your courses
to advance your research.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.280
And don't try to teach a new
course every year, because it

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.220
will take a while to figure out
the demographic and the needs

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.620
of the course, of any course.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.930
And I think other
panels would touch

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.990
upon the work-life balance
and managing your time,

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.050
but I'd like to add that
it takes really discipline

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.350
to be protective of your
research and writing time.

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:14.560
And as much as I emphasized
reaching out, collaborating,

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.190
being part of an active
member of the community,

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.920
at the end of the day,
your scholarly contribution

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.650
does require a lot of
these solitary moments.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.130
And this really
requires discipline.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.691
So thank you.

00:18:29.691 --> 00:18:34.164
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.530
NICOLE MAESTAS:
Hello, so I'm Nicole.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.140
I'm an economist at
Harvard Medical School.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.490
I've been here for
about three years.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:47.110
And I came as an
associate professor.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:50.320
So I have six pieces
of advice for you

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.690
based on my experience
of being new.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:56.830
And I kind of marvel at this,
because I still feel new,

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:00.130
and maybe I am compared
to many others here.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.420
But here goes.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.310
OK, and some of these
are going to echo

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:06.010
things you'll hear from others
that you have heard so far.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:11.230
But my first very important
one is simply meet people.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.840
Now, this is why
many of us are here.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.850
We came to Harvard
because of the people.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.760
It's an incredible place
filled with incredible people.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.750
And believe me, it is
layers deep in terms

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.859
of opportunity, experience,
potential collaborators.

00:19:25.859 --> 00:19:26.650
It's like an onion.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:30.390
It will take you years to
kind of unpeel that onion.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.040
But now is really the
only time you'll ever

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.140
be a new professor at Harvard.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.480
It goes so fast.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.560
It's gone in a flash.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.910
Next thing you know, you're
sitting on a panel like this.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.520
And trust me, you'll
be far too busy

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.870
then to invest the kind
of time you could put now

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.600
into meeting people later on.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.430
But I promise you,
if you invest early,

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:57.430
it will pay dividends
down the line.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.080
Make a list of names.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.190
Work your list.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:02.740
If you're an introvert, just
force yourself to do it.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.030
Calendar it.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.170
Schedule those meetings.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.394
Invite someone for lunch.

00:20:06.394 --> 00:20:07.810
And the important
thing to realize

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:12.050
is that people actually
expect to hear from you.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:12.850
They really do.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.310
And if you don't reach
out, they might wonder why.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.080
Just do it.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.850
For me, it was
important that I met

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.610
other economists, economists
at the other schools.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.500
I also work a bit in
the field of aging.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.760
It was important to meet
other non-economists working

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.350
on aging across the schools.

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.960
And there are so many
of them, but again,

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.960
not just within your
discipline, but across schools

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.210
and across other disciplines.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.400
I recommend the events
held by the university,

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.180
held by Judy's office,
held by Radcliffe,

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.030
by all the other various
centers around here.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:49.240
These are great ways to meet
people that you otherwise

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.610
wouldn't naturally meet.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.340
I figure that if I've
met one new person

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.160
and had an authentic
interaction with that person

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.230
at an event like that that
it was a good use of my time.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.550
And just to give you an
example, I attended since--

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.200
my office is in the
Longwood campus,

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.540
but since I was here
today, I went to an event

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.600
at the Harvard Kennedy
School and met my one person.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.360
He was a senior
faculty member that I

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.740
had admired for a long time
in the sociology department.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.810
And I had my chance.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.910
It wouldn't have happened
if I hadn't just shown up.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:28.420
Side tip-- flights out of
Boston to just about anywhere,

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.320
but especially DC, are
loaded with Harvard faculty.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.750
I have had some of
my best interactions

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.760
just by talking to
the person next to me

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.250
on a flight out of Boston.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:44.210
So anyway, it's a very
efficient way to meet somebody.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.210
Now people often say that
it takes too much time

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.520
to get to events.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.570
And it is true it can
take a bit of time,

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.670
but you need to kind of
recognize that upfront

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:53.590
and just work around it.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.164
As I mentioned, my
office is in Longwood.

00:21:56.164 --> 00:21:57.580
A short time after
I arrived here,

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.620
someone offered me
a desk in Cambridge.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.130
In fact, I had multiple
offices for desks in Cambridge.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:04.840
So if they come, grab them.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.710
I jumped on this offer, and
I now have a place to sit.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.020
I sat there today knowing
that I wanted to be here

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.250
for this event today.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.659
But it just makes it easier
to meet with anybody.

00:22:15.659 --> 00:22:17.200
It reduces the time
costs, and that's

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.370
what you're really looking for
is a way to reduce those travel

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:21.610
and time costs.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.220
I have faculty members,
maybe faculty colleagues,

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.400
they might not have
an office to sit at.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.510
But they have their spot.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:32.230
It's a special cafe in Cambridge
or a place in the library.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:33.864
And that'll be where they go.

00:22:33.864 --> 00:22:35.030
Actually, it's kind of nice.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.500
You get some kind of quiet
time and a change of scene

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.800
for a day to enable you
to do some of the things

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.130
in different part of campus.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:47.800
OK, I promise the rest won't
be quite as long as that.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.160
Number two, figure out what
are the most important things

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.220
for you to accomplish
in your new role.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.044
OK, now, no matter
what level you're

00:22:56.044 --> 00:22:57.460
at in the academic
ladder, there's

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.520
always a next step on
that trajectory for you.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.460
And even for two people at
the same spot, that next step

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.620
might be might be different.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.690
Figure It out early,
and figure it out

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.200
by talking to the people who
will actually make decisions

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.500
about whether or not you're
fulfilling those goals.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.260
But even more
important than that,

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.810
figure out where you are
relative to the goal.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:24.234
So, early on, I heard from
my other associate professor

00:23:24.234 --> 00:23:25.900
colleagues in the
medical school that it

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.450
was very important
to demonstrate

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.030
international influence
for promotion.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:32.890
And I observed them
traveling all around

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.660
and giving international talks.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:38.560
So I went hog wild and lined up
a bunch of international talks

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.840
and spent a lot of
time on airplanes

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.520
going and giving talks.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.680
It wasn't clear to me
that I'd kind of already

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.090
done enough of that until
my chair said to me,

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.420
why are you traveling so much?

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.264
So the point just being that
what's right for somebody

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:54.055
is not necessarily the
thing that you need.

00:23:54.055 --> 00:23:56.590
And in my instance, I
had taken care of that.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.720
That was in good shape,
and that time was better

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.310
put on something else.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.177
Number three, once
you find out what

00:24:07.177 --> 00:24:08.760
the most important
things are for you,

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.410
make those things sacrosanct.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:15.630
OK, for me, it's
about protecting time

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.400
to do the things that feed into
those most important things.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.050
So for me and for many
of us, writing time

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:23.760
is really the thing, right?

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.670
So for me, I write
in the mornings,

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.420
and I do not take
meetings in the mornings

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.710
unless I absolutely have to.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:29.880
It's just a rule.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.860
I have an assistant
who schedules

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.380
my meetings with
all my colleagues

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.720
and project staff and the like.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.690
And everybody knows that I don't
take meetings in the mornings

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.490
because that's when I write.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.594
And it's just
arbitrary, but it works.

00:24:44.594 --> 00:24:46.260
The other thing to
recognize about that,

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:49.320
though, is that often things
sort of change over time.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.904
And I used to work and
live on the West Coast.

00:24:52.904 --> 00:24:54.570
So my writing time
was in the afternoon,

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.736
because I needed to talk
to people on the East Coast

00:24:56.736 --> 00:24:57.650
in the mornings.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.720
OK, so be flexible,
but figure it out.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.490
So number four, optimize
your schedule for you.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.000
OK, we're all
different, but you need

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.190
to figure out how you're
going to do your best work

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:09.840
and when you do your best work.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.570
I find that how I
start my day determines

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.000
how the rest of the day goes.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.920
If I start out focused
writing a paper,

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.140
then I tend to do
more writing that day.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.380
But if I start my
day answering emails,

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.350
I tend to get caught up in
the administrative stuff,

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.760
and I spend less time
writing that day.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.960
I also wind up frittering
away the time of day

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.270
that's most productive for me.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:37.050
Now, I used to be most
productive like after 10:00 PM.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:38.550
That's no longer the case.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:42.930
For me, my most productive time
is first thing in the morning.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.150
Another small thing,
but if I drive to work,

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:46.680
I find I arrive tired.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.810
If I take the train,
I arrive more awake,

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.360
because I've had to walk 15
minutes to get from the station

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.440
to my office.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.900
These small details can
make a really big difference

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.000
in how you start the
day, and that really

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.290
sets you on a trajectory.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.730
It's important to recognize
those small things that

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.390
can make that difference.

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:08.670
OK, number five,
find your boundaries.

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:12.840
Many of us experienced
an exponential increase

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.290
in invitations and opportunities
after arriving at Harvard.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.630
For me, it was absolutely
overwhelming at times.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:22.330
It's just one example,
and it's a small one,

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.990
but I began getting so many
requests for [? review ?]

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:29.040
reports from journals, for
grant review committees, letters

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.070
for people who were
up for promotion,

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.290
that I felt that if I
accepted all of them,

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:38.070
I could spend all my time
commenting on other people's

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:42.746
work instead of
actually doing my work.

00:26:42.746 --> 00:26:44.370
So it goes without
saying that you need

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.590
to figure out when to say no.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.890
OK, something has
to give, and you

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.830
have to recognize that
really early if it's

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.300
something you should do.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.950
And it's often
good to get advice

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:59.130
from the people who know
what really matters for you,

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:03.350
back to item number
two on the list.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.200
If it's something
you really should do,

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.000
then you ask yourself,
OK, what am I

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.254
going to cross off my list in
order to make room for that?

00:27:10.254 --> 00:27:12.420
It's really important to
do that, because many of us

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.970
just acquire more and more
service activities as life

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:19.050
goes on without actually letting
go of things that we've already

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.790
done, that we've
already mastered.

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.520
And another thing
is that many people

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.500
think that you have to
give an explanation when

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.570
you say no to an activity.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.560
But really, you don't.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.430
You just say no.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:30.490
Nobody really cares.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:31.890
They don't need to hear why.

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:33.690
Mostly they just
want a timely no so

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.280
they can move on
to the next person,

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.000
and there is always
a next person.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.430
Make time to keep yourself
happy and healthy.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.440
This job isn't
everything in life.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.710
Self care matters.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:49.500
And it matters an
incredible amount.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.210
You have to exercise.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:53.190
You have to sleep.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.090
Your family matters.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:56.190
Your friends matter.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:58.560
In my case, I found
that moving here

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.050
from another place-- before
this, I lived in Los Angeles.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.220
I arrived here without friends.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.810
And I still to this day am
working on finding things

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:11.940
in this new city, but it
takes a lot of effort when

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.770
you're very busy with--

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:18.250
I have three kids and
this job and the like.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.670
But these sorts of
things are really

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:26.040
essential for sustaining a
good pace over a long horizon.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.990
OK, so with that,
I will leave you

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:33.900
with parting words
which are, above all,

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:38.494
don't be too serious about
things and just have fun.

00:28:38.494 --> 00:28:41.679
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:43.304
MATTHEW WEINZIERL:
Can I just stand up?

00:28:43.304 --> 00:28:45.240
Thank you.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.500
Hello, I'm Matt.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.850
I'm with the business school.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.392
And we teach very
interactively, so I have

00:28:50.392 --> 00:28:51.600
to be able to see all of you.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.500
It's just a bug in the system.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:57.360
OK, so we have a colleague
from the philosophy department.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.090
So I have a question to ask
Samantha, I believe, right?

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.240
So why did the dolphin join
the philosophy department when

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.510
she came to Harvard University?

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:08.400
To discover her
porpoise in life.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.486
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:09.486 --> 00:29:10.860
OK, very good,
that was terrible.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.400
Come on, people, seriously.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.500
OK, don't take
yourself too seriously.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.050
Did you hear Nichole's
last piece of advice?

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.550
All right, so I have--

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:23.747
I'm not really sure why
exactly I was invited here

00:29:23.747 --> 00:29:25.830
to give you my thoughts,
although I have been here

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:26.560
quite a while.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.650
So I came here from
Minnesota, where I grew up,

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.440
when I was 18 for undergrad.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.100
That was '96.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.620
A couple of years in New York
and a year in DC in between,

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.230
but otherwise, I was
here for grad school too.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:38.940
So I've been at
Harvard literally half

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.255
of my life, which is
kind of an amazing thing.

00:29:41.255 --> 00:29:43.380
And so even though it's
still just one perspective,

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.145
at least it's a perspective
I've kind of evolved over time.

00:29:46.145 --> 00:29:47.520
So that's what
I'm hoping to give

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.060
you are some thoughts about
how this place feels to someone

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.980
who's been here for a while.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.450
And as our colleagues
were talking,

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:57.080
I kept writing more things
I wanted to tell you.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.430
So I'm going to try to go
fast so that I don't go over

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:00.280
my time.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.220
But the first thing is,
I was the only one who

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.369
wasn't asked to speak about
work and life balance,

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:05.410
but I'm going to anyways.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.545
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:06.545 --> 00:30:07.920
ELIZABETH ANCARANA:
We knew that.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.685
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:08.685 --> 00:30:10.380
MATTHEW WEINZIERL:
And I would say--

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.755
the most important thing I
would say about balancing work

00:30:12.755 --> 00:30:15.210
and life is balance
your work and life.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:15.930
Actually do it.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:16.620
It's important.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:19.020
I actually don't think
it's as much of a trade off

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.060
as your instinct is
telling you it is.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.210
I think the more you balance
your family or your friends

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:26.040
with your work, the
more creative you are,

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.020
the broader a thinker
you are, probably

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.850
the happier and
healthier you are.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:32.910
And so even though, of
course, you will feel bad

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.487
if you don't get
tenure, and you'll

00:30:34.487 --> 00:30:36.570
wonder like, if I just
spent more sleepless nights

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:37.680
in the office.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.170
I think you'll feel even
worse if you do get tenure,

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:42.990
and you don't know your
spouse or your kids.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.910
I think that's an
even worse outcome.

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.077
So just remember that
as you're going on.

00:30:47.077 --> 00:30:48.660
And I have to say,
I'm not just saying

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.670
this for a self-serving
reason but actually also

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:53.220
to leave at 4:45 to go
pick up my daughter.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.980
So please forgive
me for doing that.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.960
OK, now, my three things
that I had prepared

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.160
before though, the
first one, thoughts

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.037
about Harvard University--

00:31:04.037 --> 00:31:06.120
I'm not sure it's a
particularly friendly thought,

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.820
so brace yourselves
a little bit.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:13.260
I would say that I think Harvard
expects you to define yourself,

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.880
and that can sometimes be hard.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.047
So I want to give
you a little example.

00:31:17.047 --> 00:31:19.380
Five years ago or so, I got
promoted to associate, which

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.210
is, of course, without tenure.

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:23.700
And so I met with our department
head to sort of debrief.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.658
And this should be a
happy occasion, all right,

00:31:25.658 --> 00:31:27.330
congratulations, all this stuff.

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:28.010
It was not.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:31.410
So he was a very
senior macroeconomist.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:33.949
Unfortunately, he's
no longer with us.

00:31:33.949 --> 00:31:34.740
And he sat me down.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.350
And he said, so, Matt,
here's how I see it.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:40.890
You've chosen to play in
a subfield of economics

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:46.800
that has attracted many of their
highest IQ people in the field.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.050
You're not going to
win in that field.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:53.490
OK, that was sobering,
because, of course, implicitly,

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:56.430
he's saying something
about my IQ, right?

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:57.614
We all got that part.

00:31:57.614 --> 00:32:00.030
But also, look, I'd just been
promoted to associate, which

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.800
means I have four
years, basically,

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:07.080
three, till a packet goes in,
until to make tenure, right?

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.610
And it was hard at first.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:10.230
But then as I look
back on it, I think

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.771
it was some of the
best advice I got.

00:32:11.771 --> 00:32:15.090
Because, first of all it, was
right, the fact part of it

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:15.990
about the IQ.

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:19.620
But more importantly, it forced
me to say, what can I do?

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.030
In economist speak, what's
my comparative advantage?

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:24.870
What can I actually do at
this place that will earn me

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.050
tenure in a few years?

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:27.990
What do I bring to the table?

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:32.269
And Harvard, as loving as
it is, and Judy's office--

00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:33.810
to be clear, I've
been here a while--

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:35.700
has made big
strides in making it

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.040
more of a supportive community.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.660
It isn't exactly the
handholding place, right?

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.950
This is a place of ambition.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.124
It's place with a lot
of hard driving people,

00:32:44.124 --> 00:32:46.290
and the place expects you
to be one of those people.

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:49.780
So find your path and chart it.

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.140
And so I think that's important.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.910
The one little caveat I would
make to that, which I actually

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.950
thought of when
Larry was talking,

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:57.990
was at my grad
school orientation,

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:59.590
President Faust gave a speech.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:02.880
And she said, at some point
during grad school, each of you

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.830
will feel like you
don't belong here,

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:06.870
like you're a failure,
like somehow it was

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:08.350
a mistake that they let you in.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:11.010
And I was like, that's not
going to happen to me, right?

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:12.570
I totally belong here.

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.250
And then two years
into grad school,

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:15.820
I had exactly that feeling.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.390
It felt like, oh, my gosh, what
if I'm not going to make it?

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:20.306
I started calling hedge
funds to see if they'd

00:33:20.306 --> 00:33:22.204
give me a job on Wall Street.

00:33:22.204 --> 00:33:23.620
And so I went
through that moment.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.920
And I would guess that that
will happen to a lot of us

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.840
as junior faculty, a lot of
you as junior faculty too.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.714
It certainly happened
to me where you wonder,

00:33:29.714 --> 00:33:31.080
how's this going to work out?

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.310
And all I would say
is, know that that

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.950
does happen to a lot of people
who are here as junior faculty.

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.000
And it's OK.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.350
You can make it through.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:38.440
You're here for a reason.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.920
It's not a mistake
that you got hired.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.509
OK, the second thing I
will go very quickly, which

00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:45.300
is because everyone's
covered this already.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.530
This is a big place.

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:47.710
That can be a challenge.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:50.279
But of course, the economies
of scale are incredible.

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:52.320
I'm interested in the
commercialization of space.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.278
The minute I started
talking about that, people

00:33:54.278 --> 00:33:56.160
from all over the
university popped up

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.327
who were interested in this.

00:33:57.327 --> 00:33:58.784
And I think that's
not an accident.

00:33:58.784 --> 00:33:59.910
We're all interested.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:01.860
We're all looking for
the big stuff, right?

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.944
So that's going to matter.

00:34:02.944 --> 00:34:04.651
And so when you find
one of those things,

00:34:04.651 --> 00:34:06.552
other people have
probably found it too.

00:34:06.552 --> 00:34:08.010
So raise your hand,
and you'll meet

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:10.690
people who can help you
to partner with them.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:15.172
OK, so the last
thing, which again,

00:34:15.172 --> 00:34:17.130
I think it's a little
more controversial maybe.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:18.780
But I'll say it.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.969
So the university works
in what sometimes can

00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:24.179
seem like very mysterious ways.

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:26.130
And you'll be tempted
to wonder about that,

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:29.550
but I would urge you to
think that it deserves

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:31.800
your help and your trust.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.760
OK, so the trust in
particular, I think,

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.280
is going to be the
keyword for me.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.882
So, look, as I've been here
as an undergrad and then

00:34:38.882 --> 00:34:40.590
a grad student and an
assistant professor

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.810
and so on, at each
point, you're tempted

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:46.739
to think that person above you
is making some crazy mistake,

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:47.790
like a terrible decision.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:49.730
Why would they do that?

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:52.290
And of course, that
is true sometimes.

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:55.920
Sometimes, professors or
even deans or even presidents

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.360
make mistakes.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.040
But one thing I've
also learned as I've

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.123
taken on different positions
is that sometimes you

00:35:01.123 --> 00:35:02.760
don't know the full
set of complexities

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:06.690
that that person is dealing
with in those roles.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.150
A short a little example, so
we have these teaching groups

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:10.200
at the business school.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.750
So we teach by the case
method like the law school.

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:15.130
And that means there's
several professor-- well,

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:16.410
we have these large courses.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:17.520
Anyways, there's
several professors

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.510
teaching the same course.

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:20.176
And we get together
to discuss how we're

00:35:20.176 --> 00:35:22.270
going to teach these cases.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:24.000
And I remember as
a new professor,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.270
we would teach a couple of cases
that I knew the year previously

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:28.497
had not worked very well.

00:35:28.497 --> 00:35:30.580
Why in the world are we
teaching this thing again?

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.330
We only have 30 classes
with our students.

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.890
Why would we waste a session?

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:37.110
Now I'm course head for
one of those courses.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.610
And I realize we
have a norm, which

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.401
is that when a new
professor writes a case,

00:35:40.401 --> 00:35:42.345
we leave it in the
curriculum for two years.

00:35:42.345 --> 00:35:44.220
OK, so no matter what
happens the first year,

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.600
you leave it in.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.740
And it does have that cost.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.701
Sometimes it does
not work very well.

00:35:48.701 --> 00:35:50.700
But it's the right norm
for a couple of reasons.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.040
It shows that we're committed
to that junior professor.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.140
We're not throwing
them under the bus.

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.300
And it makes us work
harder as a teaching group

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.640
to figure out how to
teach difficult cases

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.710
and how to learn how to
teach cases that don't

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:03.252
work in an easy sort of way.

00:36:03.252 --> 00:36:05.460
Because it's one of those
things that as course head,

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.890
you see the rest of it that you
wouldn't have seen underneath.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:09.931
And that's happened to me
1,000 times at Harvard,

00:36:09.931 --> 00:36:11.560
as I've been here
for a long time.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:15.240
So to be clear, I'm not saying
the university is perfect.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.785
If you see something,
say something.

00:36:16.785 --> 00:36:18.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.750
But it's important, right?

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:23.236
You might be the first
one to spot the mistake.

00:36:23.236 --> 00:36:24.360
But I would just have you--

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.030
I would urge you maybe to think
while you're doing that or as

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:28.560
you're about to do
it that it could

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.080
be that 100 other of the
brilliant people around you

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.449
have also seen that.

00:36:32.449 --> 00:36:33.990
And they've mentioned
it, but there's

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:37.194
some constraint you haven't
quite understood yet.

00:36:37.194 --> 00:36:38.610
And then that's
why the university

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:39.670
is doing what it does.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:41.669
So Larry said this, and
I would just repeat it.

00:36:41.669 --> 00:36:43.710
Everyone at this university
wants your colleagues

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.057
to succeed, your students
to succeed, you to succeed,

00:36:46.057 --> 00:36:47.640
because that is the
university, right?

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.675
What is the faculty?

00:36:48.675 --> 00:36:50.550
The faculty is your
colleagues, and it's you.

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.980
And we're in the service of
our students and our alumni.

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.160
And so we all want to
make this work together.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.940
And so I think it
deserves our support

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.790
and our constructive
criticism and our trust.

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:01.042
Thanks.

00:37:01.042 --> 00:37:04.479
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:04.479 --> 00:37:07.150
HOPI HOEKSTRA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:09.150
I think I'm going to stand
up here too because I

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.410
can see only half of you.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:17.160
Great, thanks for
letting me go last.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.050
So I guess I'm the most senior.

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:22.470
I've been here-- can
you guys hear me?

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:24.210
I've been here for
about 12 years now.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:29.520
And as Elizabeth mentioned,
I'm part of FAS, OEB, MCB, MCZ,

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:34.110
HBI, CBS, HHMI,
and I serve on CAP.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:36.164
So as you guys already
probably have figured out,

00:37:36.164 --> 00:37:37.830
the first challenge
you're going to have

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.050
is figuring out all the
acronyms at this place.

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:42.390
It's incredible.

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:46.170
I'm still figuring
them all out myself.

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:49.530
I did want to mention
one thing to reiterate

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:50.370
what Elizabeth said.

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:53.040
And that is, I serve on CAP,
and that's the Committee

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.930
of Appointments and Promotions.

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:57.280
And so I want to mention
this for two reasons.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.850
But the first thing to
say is that I'm really

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:01.750
excited to see you here.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.360
So for those of you who
came through tenure,

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.830
and you're at FAS, I
know a lot about you.

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.150
I've read your files.

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:11.310
I've read some of your papers.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:13.590
We've had discussions
about you, and it's

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.970
great to see your faces.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:17.610
For those of you who are
on tenure track, at least

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:20.460
through FAS, I look forward
to seeing your dossiers

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.050
in about eight years.

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:25.710
So this is one of the most fun
committees that I've served on.

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:29.550
I feel a lot of responsibility,
and we take our jobs

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:30.270
very seriously.

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:33.660
But I just wanted to put at
least one of the several faces

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.990
behind that committee
who makes decisions--

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:38.910
or sorry, we make no decisions.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:43.540
We make recommendations
about tenures and promotion.

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.420
So just to see a face
behind that committee,

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.029
because I know when
I first arrived here,

00:38:48.029 --> 00:38:50.070
I thought a lot about
tenure, and I thought a lot

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:51.870
about that process.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:54.270
And there were some mysterious
steps along the way,

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:57.310
and CAP was one of them.

00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.990
So I was tasked with telling
you a little bit about teaching

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:04.120
and teaching resources
here on campus.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:09.960
So the first thing I'll say,
I'm wearing my cap of CAP.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:13.440
And that is that teaching is
taken really seriously in terms

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.320
of tenure and promotion.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.330
And I don't think
that's just lip service.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:23.220
I can say on the CAP
committee that maybe half

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.440
of the discussion for
each person's dossier

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.620
is really about the
contributions to teaching.

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:30.360
And so it's something
that I think

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.570
it's good to hear early
on and to really digest,

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:35.760
because I think
that a lot of advice

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.400
you get from people who went
through tenure 20 years ago

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.010
or people from the
outside of Harvard,

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.080
you'll hear it's
all about research.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.350
But it's really about
research and teaching.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.110
And on a more sort
of happy note,

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:53.790
not thinking about tenure, is I
think this is a fantastic place

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:55.170
to be a teacher.

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:57.720
Because I think
that, within reason,

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.570
you're really only limited
by your imagination.

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:02.940
Harvard hired you
for your creativity

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.520
not just in research,
but also in teaching.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.270
And I'd like to think that you
came here, chose to come here,

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:11.430
for this environment.

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:15.210
There are a ton of resources
available to help you

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:16.350
with teaching.

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:18.412
I am still learning
about all of them.

00:40:18.412 --> 00:40:19.870
So I'm just going
to mention a few.

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:21.960
And again, this is really
going to be FAS focused,

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.830
because that's my home.

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:25.620
I just wanted to give
you the perspective

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.140
that I teach in a large
introductory genetics course.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:30.737
I have between 300
and 400 freshmen.

00:40:30.737 --> 00:40:32.820
And I do want to reiterate
the point that teaching

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.400
freshmen here is the best.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.880
They're great, wide eyed,
super eager, excited, slightly

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.390
freaked out.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:43.470
But so the first resource
I wanted to mention

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:45.840
is the Bok Center.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.670
The Bok Center is
the place to go

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:50.116
when you are thinking
about teaching,

00:40:50.116 --> 00:40:51.740
when you want to kick
off a new course,

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.480
you have a project, even
when you just have an idea.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:57.060
There are people
literally waiting for you

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:02.280
to come to them, and all
they want to do is help.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.710
They're great people
to bounce ideas off of,

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:07.080
talk about courses,
designing new courses,

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.190
syllabi, everything.

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:09.720
They will help you
with everything,

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.580
and they can't wait to help you.

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:14.550
They will also be of great
help if you're struggling.

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:16.590
So if you run your
first course, and it

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:20.550
didn't go as smoothly as you
expected, which happens a lot,

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:21.300
they are there.

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.160
They will come to your class.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.510
They will videotape you.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:26.730
They will make you
watch that video.

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:30.870
They will give you
advice, et cetera.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:32.920
They will also
help your students.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:36.300
So if you have maybe
not a 300 person course,

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.820
but you have a smaller course,
and you want the students

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.310
to run projects, to
make their own videos,

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:46.770
to do hands-on projects, you
can send them to the Bok Center

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:47.660
with--

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.350
you have to get
pre-approved, of course.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:51.516
Send them to the Bok Center,
and they will help them

00:41:51.516 --> 00:41:53.650
with those projects.

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:56.340
And then importantly, they also
can help you with assessment,

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.850
so learning about if you are
doing a good job teaching,

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:02.400
as good as you think
you're doing, right?

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.250
So I just wanted to give you one
quick example from the course

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:07.830
that I was teaching in, or
I have been teaching in,

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:09.490
for the last five years.

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:12.990
And that is we
decided that instead

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.880
of having sort of
review sessions,

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.494
we would make videos,
two, three minute videos,

00:42:18.494 --> 00:42:20.910
of difficult concepts, the
concepts that students struggle

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:23.470
with every term.

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:24.590
And so we had this idea.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.090
We went to the Bok Center, and
we said, is this a good idea?

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:30.090
They worked with us and
made it a better idea.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:32.670
Then we were able to get money.

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:36.000
So this is another
point I wanted to make

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.720
is that there are
pots of money around

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.580
to help you with teaching.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.220
So we used course
innovation funds.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:47.220
And I sent an email
to the assistant dean

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.380
of undergraduate education,
and we got more money

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:53.400
from a different pot to hire
somebody who made these videos.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.900
But then what she
wanted to do was

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:58.900
turn making videos into a
project in and of itself.

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.650
And then she recruited not
only our teaching fellows

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:05.260
but undergraduates who
would test these videos.

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.710
And now we have this
library of 20 or so videos

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:08.944
of these difficult concepts.

00:43:08.944 --> 00:43:10.860
The really good ones
we'll keep for next year.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.120
We'll make some new ones.

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:15.520
This is now an idea that other
courses are starting to adopt.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.660
And it's been just a super
exciting and fun project

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:21.030
that we could have,
and I certainly

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:22.320
couldn't have done on my own.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.820
But with the help
of the Bok Center,

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.250
these little pots of money,
and then lots of imagination

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:30.160
and energy, it came to be.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.230
Another resource that
I want to mention,

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:34.960
and you've probably already
started getting emails from,

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.710
is HILT, Harvard Initiative
for Learning and Teaching.

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:40.900
See, another acronym.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:44.170
They run an annual single
day conference, usually

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:47.080
in the fall, that
has different topics.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:50.170
And so you'll hear
some amazing speakers

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:54.400
that specialize in how to
teach, how to teach well.

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:58.540
And then usually we break
out into small lunches

00:43:58.540 --> 00:43:59.920
and little workshops.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.760
And you can choose among
a variety of topics

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.190
that are most relevant to you.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:05.980
This is another great
way to meet colleagues.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:08.680
I've certainly met several
colleagues through that.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.320
And then HILT also
then funds projects.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.782
So if you have an idea,
an innovative idea,

00:44:13.782 --> 00:44:15.490
in terms of teaching,
this is another way

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:17.510
that you can get money
to support that idea.

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.790
All of that said,
I've found that one

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:26.660
of my most valuable resources
in thinking about teaching

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:28.280
is my colleagues.

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:32.487
So in the MCB department,
Molecular and Cellular Biology

00:44:32.487 --> 00:44:34.070
department, we have
a program in which

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:36.140
colleagues come
to your lectures,

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.360
watch, and provide feedback.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.550
We do this on an optional
basis if you're tenured.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:42.050
I did it.

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:44.450
I got great feedback
even post-tenure.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.982
But we do it for all our
tenure track faculty.

00:44:46.982 --> 00:44:49.190
It's a great way not only
to get feedback and improve

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:54.350
your courses, but you have your
colleagues get to know you.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:56.690
And when they write letters
in support of your tenure,

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:58.606
they have more to say
than just your research.

00:44:58.606 --> 00:45:03.900
They can comment directly
on your teaching as well.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.320
And one of the things that
I learned from my colleagues

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:11.120
that I think was most
exciting about teaching here

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.040
is that there's a
great opportunity

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.320
to be super creative.

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.050
You can do sort of whatever
you want in terms of teaching.

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.680
And so I just wanted to
give you two quick examples

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.310
of some courses that I
developed when I first got here.

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:27.980
The first one I taught was
a graduate level course

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:31.400
on speciation, so
how new species form.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.320
And this was a course
that we were going

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.260
to read the primary literature.

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.810
And so as we were
thinking about this,

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:42.100
I picked a couple of faculty
and a couple of their papers

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:43.380
from across the world.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.800
And we would talk about
each one of those topics

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.600
over the course of 12 weeks.

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.100
And they started
thinking about this

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.722
like running a journal club.

00:45:51.722 --> 00:45:53.180
The students would
ask me questions

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:55.346
like, well, why did they
do the experiment this way?

00:45:55.346 --> 00:45:56.660
Or why did they choose that?

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.900
Or why does this
figure look like this?

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.830
I didn't actually know.

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:03.470
So what we decided to do
was to Skype the professors.

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:07.190
And so this is now
not so new anymore.

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:08.257
Lots of places do this.

00:46:08.257 --> 00:46:10.340
But 12 years ago when we
first started doing this,

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:11.180
it was a lot of fun.

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:14.240
And it got a lot of
support to do teaching

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.510
in kind of a new way
using video conferencing

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:20.700
to talk to the primary sources.

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.630
Another example was
that I'm a curator

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:25.820
of mammals in the Natural
History Museum here.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:30.917
And I had four freshmen knock
on my door one day and say, hey,

00:46:30.917 --> 00:46:32.000
there's a course on birds.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.100
There's a course on herpetology.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.629
But there's no
course on mammals.

00:46:35.629 --> 00:46:36.920
Let's have a course on mammals.

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.086
And so we designed a course.

00:46:38.086 --> 00:46:40.100
And they designed the
syllabus themselves.

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:43.830
They had designed
their own projects.

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:47.510
And at the end of
that year, what

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:49.010
we decided to do
as our end of year

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:50.600
project was go into
the collections

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.140
and actually revise all of
the nomenclature for all

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:56.030
of the species in the
Great Mammal Hall--

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:59.930
which I encourage you all
to go see, 26 Oxford Street.

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:02.360
It's a rare gem on campus.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:06.324
And this was a
hands-on experience.

00:47:06.324 --> 00:47:07.490
They were out in the museum.

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:09.380
And we actually had
to move specimens,

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.270
because some of the
systematic relationships

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:14.600
actually changed since
that was first installed.

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:15.560
So it was a lot of fun.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.370
So I encourage you to
be really creative.

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:20.270
And I think that creativity
is really valued here.

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:27.210
I think the main thing that I
want to leave you with in terms

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:30.870
of teaching is that for every
problem, issue, question

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:34.060
that you have, there is
someone here to help you.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.480
And I think the big
challenge is starting

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:40.080
to learn where to find the right
people to answer your question.

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:45.430
So they exist, and you
just have to find them.

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:47.700
I think I'm not going to
comment just so that there's

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.530
time for questions
on work life balance.

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:53.080
And I agree with everything
that was said previously.

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.720
And it's worth
putting in the time

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.930
to figure out your
work life balance now

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:00.160
and getting good habits
now because those

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:03.166
are the habits you're going
to have 12 years later.

00:48:03.166 --> 00:48:04.968
Great, thank you.

00:48:04.968 --> 00:48:09.369
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:14.580
ELIZABETH ANCARANA: Thank
you again to all of you.
