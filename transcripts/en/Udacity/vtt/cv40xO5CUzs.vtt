00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.971
What's so great about factoring is that we can check our solution. If I multiply

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:09.236
these 2 binomials together, we would do this process in reverse and end up with

00:00:09.236 --> 00:00:14.678
our original problem. If you want to get faster at factoring trinomials, you

00:00:14.678 --> 00:00:19.884
want to find the factors of 2 times 6 or 12 that add up to 13. You always want

00:00:19.884 --> 00:00:25.250
to find factors of a times c that sum to b. Finding these 2 factors allows us to

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.033
rewrite the middle term. And then allows us to use factoring by grouping.
