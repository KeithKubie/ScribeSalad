KRISTIN GENIS-LUND: Hi,
thank you for coming.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.530
My name is Kristin Genis-Lund.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.150
And I'm a Googler and an opera
singer, so it is my pleasure

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.160
and I'm honored to be able to
introduce Sheri Greenawald who

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.510
is the director of the
San Francisco Opera Center

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.255
as well as the artistic director
of the Merola Program in San

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:22.800
Francisco.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.350
Most of you have already read
her bio, so I won't read it.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.840
However, I can tell you
that suffice it to say she

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.120
is an amazing
international artist that

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.110
has sung so many roles in so
many prestigious opera houses

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.800
around the world.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.750
Since then, she's been
one of the cornerstones

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.972
of vocal mentorship in the
Bay Area for young singers.

00:00:44.972 --> 00:00:46.430
If you'll indulge
me, I'd just love

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.140
to tell a quick story
how she and I met.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.950
My brother was actually the
third spirit in San Francisco

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.160
opera productions of Magic
Flute back in the '80s

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.384
when Sheri sang "Pamina."

00:00:57.384 --> 00:00:59.300
So I got to meet her
when I was a young child,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.170
and then was having
a crisis deciding

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.379
whether to be a concert
violinist or a singer.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.460
And so my violin teacher,
who was friends with Sheri,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.000
told me to go and visit her.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.370
And she said, close
your eyes and imagine

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.050
you being in an orchestra
rehearsal for eight hours,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.750
and imagine you singing
for eight hours.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.020
Which would you rather do?

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.311
And that answered the question.

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:20.980
So there you go.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.079
Anyway, I'm pleased to
introduce Sheri Greenawald.

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.370
Please give her a warm welcome.

00:01:27.323 --> 00:01:28.864
SHERI GREENAWALD:
Thank you, my dear.

00:01:28.864 --> 00:01:29.346
KRISTIN GENIS-LUND: Mm.

00:01:29.346 --> 00:01:29.971
You're welcome.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.170
SHERI GREENAWALD: Well, she's
given a few my bona fides,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.530
as we call it.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.980
You know a little about me.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.664
I did sing internationally,
absolutely.

00:01:43.664 --> 00:01:45.330
And I was lucky enough
to sing with some

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.910
of the great conductors,
including-- I had some really

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.530
great time with
Leonard Bernstein.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.420
I premiered his
final opera and got

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.710
to hang out with Lenny,
which is never bad and got

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.950
to ask Seiji Ozawa
how he-- I asked him,

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.495
do you have a
photographic memory?

00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:07.870
Because I was
always so impressed

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.681
with Seiji Ozawa's
ability to never

00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:10.889
have a score in front of him.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.260
And he said no,
I work very hard.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.470
And that was a
great thing to say.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.180
Because I thought, ah-hah.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.795
You see?

00:02:18.795 --> 00:02:20.670
You don't have to have
a photographic memory.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.961
You just have to work hard,
ladies and gentlemen, which

00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:24.880
is what I'm always
telling my singers.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.580
You've just got to be down in
that practice room at 8:00 AM.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.300
Get down there.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.590
I'm not a pedagogue.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.540
I wasn't trained as a
pedagogue, and I only

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.350
sang opera professionally,
lead roles,

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.020
for 30 years of my
life to earn my living.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.210
That's how I did it.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.910
So I do have the hands-on
knowledge, as it were,

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.010
and I also have been teaching
formally, more or less,

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.732
for about 20 years now, taught
at the Boston Conservatory.

00:02:53.732 --> 00:02:54.440
I've been around.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.840
But I grew up in the middle
of the cornfields of Iowa,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.660
so I came to this in as weird
a way as anyone can, I think.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.520
Except we did have the
Firestone Hour back in my day.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.570
And you watched Eleanor Steber
and people like that sing,

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.400
and you get stimulated, I think.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.050
So that was a good thing.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.120
How does the voice work, right?

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.120
People are always curious.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.090
Of course, we can go
into a lot of pedagogy,

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.400
and I do like to
know the reality.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.940
I was telling someone at lunch
that I went to a teacher,

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.580
and his solution for most things
was, well, bite the apple.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.210
And unfortunately,
I was the daughter

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.200
of two science teachers.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.380
And so I would say, well,
how big is that apple

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.180
and what color is it?

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.290
And I don't know, because I knew
large apples and crab apples.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.910
And so that didn't work for me.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.820
Then I finally did me the
teacher named Audrey Langford,

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.890
who was British.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.460
I met her in Santa
Fe, New Mexico,

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.630
where she taught every summer.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.340
And Audrey was the
first person to say

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.700
to me, where's your tongue?

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.070
I said, I don't know.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.752
And she said, well, it's
halfway down your throat.

00:04:09.752 --> 00:04:10.566
I said, OK.

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:11.320
OK.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.320
So we got the pliers out,
and we got rid of that.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.829
And so Audrey would say to
you, I can tell you so much.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.940
Then you've got to go
read "Gray's Anatomy."

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.050
Well, I am a girl that
owns a "Gray's Anatomy,"

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.670
and it sits by my piano at home.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.060
So I did do that.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.930
So what do we do?

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.110
This is interactive.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.730
I just wanted you to know this.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.550
You're going to help
me out here today.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.320
The first thing
we do, of course,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.590
is we have to figure out
what do these vocal cords do?

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.110
They close.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.780
It's an act.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.794
We call it closure.

00:04:44.794 --> 00:04:45.710
It's called adduction.

00:04:48.752 --> 00:04:50.210
There's another
terminology for it,

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.330
but anyway, there are a lot of
terminologies for what this is.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.060
The vocal cords sit
open, and then they

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.670
close to create sound.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.230
Of course, the tongue
is right there too.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.630
And so this whole
part of your throat

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.060
is involved in several things.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.660
The tongue is
protecting the windpipe.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.700
So you've got the windpipe
right behind the larynx.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.060
So there's a lot of stuff going
on in that area of your throat.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.480
But these little cords, in the
male, they're a little longer.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.260
They're about two, maybe
to 2.5 centimeters.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.220
And in the female, they're
anywhere from 1.75 centimeters

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.660
long to two something.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.770
Teeny pieces of gristle
that I earn my living

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.500
with for all these years.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.740
They're little bitty
things, but they sit open

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.520
for the most time.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.930
And then when you phonate--
phonation-- they close, right?

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:43.890
That's what they do.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:44.930
That's how we do it.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.050
And you can feel it.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.360
I always say we can all do
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.500
Can you hear that?

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.910
I'm just touching my
cords without sounding.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.150
Can you do that?

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.620
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.810
You feel that point.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.120
Singers become so
familiar with that point

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.210
because that is, particularly
if you have a gentle onset,

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.810
you know exactly where
that point of contact is.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.670
You have an incredible
relationship

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.680
with that sensation
of that touch.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.790
You know exactly where that is.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.200
The perfect
phonation, the breath

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.480
becomes exactly as
the cords close.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.080
But there are other types
of onset that can happen.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.929
You can have what we
call a breathier onset,

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:30.970
and that's when the cords
don't close right away,

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.690
and you get sort of ahhh.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.140
And it's sort of ahhh.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.170
And I'm keeping a little
more space, actually

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.190
between my cords.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.350
Perfect closure, they're not
completely closed either.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.980
There's a teeny small gap
if that's a perfect closure.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.700
But a breathier one, you
keep them even further apart.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.880
And they don't close
quite all the way.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.340
But then there's also
the glottal attack.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.540
We use glottal stops in the
German language, particularly.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.770
That's one you may
know because you

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.780
have to put a glottal
stop before the vowel

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.160
onsets in German language.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.020
So the glottal stop is just--
the stop happens a little

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.830
before the breath.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.581
And so it's ah, ah.

00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:17.830
You bring your cords together.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.330
Try that.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.570
You bring them together.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:20.270
Ah.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.680
And then you bring the breath.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.320
That sort of a
glottal stop onset.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.522
That's what that is.

00:07:25.522 --> 00:07:27.730
And that is used, like I
say, in the German language.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.920
And so if you're singing
beautiful Schubert songs,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.170
you're doing a lot of glottal
stopping here and there.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.840
So those are the different kinds
of onsets that we can produce.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.940
So the breath is coming
through the vocal cords

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.230
and making them phonate.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.930
And of course, one of the
most interesting things

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.020
about singing is also
the Bernoulli Effect.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.430
I know you're bunch of
engineers in here possibly.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.350
How many of you know
the Bernoulli Effect?

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.730
Here, we got one--
several over here, right?

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.080
It's what gets the
airplane into the air?

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.090
It's what makes
that baseball spin?

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.720
And believe me, I don't
understand it very well,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.490
but I do understand this.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.740
I do understand that when
I close my vocal cords

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.210
and send air, which is what
we do, you're sending air

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.840
and you've closed this space,
it's creating a compression.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.100
And on me, you can
actually see what we call

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.580
the subglottal compression.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.730
Maybe you can see it.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.320
I'll walk closer to you.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.005
It looked like a bladder
filled up on my neck.

00:08:23.005 --> 00:08:24.200
It really well.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.040
And this is called
subglottal compression.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.139
So here we go.

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:27.930
I'll give it a try.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:28.520
Here we go.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.240
So it's going to go
(SINGING) ahhhhhhhhh.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.370
You see how that totally fell
in when I stopped singing?

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.059
That's subglottal compression.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:46.290
So I built up air under the
cords, and what that does

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.080
is it then blows that cord open.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.650
And that's how you get this
oscillation that's happening.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.530
And the cords, as they
come back together,

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.130
you get a slight variation
in the pitch because of this.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.460
Because the vocal
cords are doing this.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.960
They're coming
together, turning,

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.360
and then blowing apart,
coming together, turning,

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.170
blowing apart.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.570
When you're on an A in
the middle of the voice--

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.515
an A is about 440-- your vocal
cords are slamming together

00:09:13.515 --> 00:09:17.830
at about 440 times a second, OK?

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.260
So about where I
was-- (SINGING) ahh--

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.920
that's probably a little
high even. (SINGING) Ahhh.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.140
My cords are slapping
at 440 a second.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:31.140
If I sing a high C, somewhere
around-- (SINGING) ahhh!--

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.900
that's going to be about 1,000
times a second that your vocal

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.270
cords are slapping together.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.570
And they're doing
this wild thing.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.240
So the only way to really see
them as under a strobe light.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.630
You can't really
isolate this vision

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.680
without strobes when they
do hard scopes at the voice

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.260
doctor.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.570
So that's what's happening
in that throat, which

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.542
I think for some people feels
rather violent in a way.

00:09:56.542 --> 00:09:58.250
And it is sort of a
violent little action

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.960
that's going on there.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.560
And what I call singing
is sustained scream.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.690
Because when we talk, we
don't sustain the pitch,

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.940
unless you're like me
and a little sing-songy

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.360
and you start to
stretch out a word,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.460
then you're sort of
sustaining as a singer does.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.380
But what a singer
is doing is really

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.767
sustaining more-- (SINGING) no!

00:10:21.767 --> 00:10:23.350
That's me screaming
at my friend who's

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.210
about to step off the curb
and get hit by the Muni bus.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.680
So I always yell no at them.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.680
And that is what
we do when we sing.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.590
Because you're going
to elongate that pitch,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.510
and you're going to
keep on that pitch.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.040
And so that is what we do.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.180
It's a sustained scream.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.232
And then you're bringing
this breath into the mouth.

00:10:42.232 --> 00:10:43.315
You're bringing the sound.

00:10:43.315 --> 00:10:45.660
It's the transference
of energy, obviously.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.410
This is what it's all about--
transference of energy.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.490
Then you come to something
called the vowel formants.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.260
And you are going to
create vowels in the mouth.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
The vowels are not formed
in your throat, ladies

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.900
and gentlemen, just in
case you ever thought that.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.050
Of course, one
could argue that ah

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.720
is a laryngeal
vowel in that ah is

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:11.860
the vowel that ends up in the
most words for the word mother.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.570
Because when a child starts
to speak, guess what?

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.720
Their mouth is closed,
and they will phone an m.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.900
Because when your mouth is
closed-- mmm-- that's an m.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.610
Mmm.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.730
So you get an m, and then
if you just open the mouth,

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:27.610
you go mmmahh.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.960
That little section,
that M-A will end up

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.780
in most words for mother
oftentimes in most languages.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.690
It certainly is in Italian
and French, God knows.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.940
Of course, I don't know how
the Germans got to Mutter,

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.440
but anyway, maybe their
tongues work differently.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.280
But I know I think in
Chinese it's [? omah, ?]

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.350
and a lot of the
words for mother

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.710
always have this M-A
in it because that

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.550
is the most primal sound
that a child usually makes.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.850
So we bring to the
vowels in the mouth.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.160
Now, I'm always
willing to demonstrate.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.210
The vowels themselves have
formants, the frequencies

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:14.640
that create these vowels.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.320
And one of my favorite
factoids about vowels

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.390
is about the ee vowel.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.910
And let's all try
an ee, and you'll

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:24.310
see what makes ee
unique as opposed to ah.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.620
If you all say ah--
let's all say ah.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.120
Ahhh.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.550
You see it's very formless.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.740
Your tongue is sort
of flat in the mouth.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.250
You're not creating any
specific shape for it.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.000
However, when you do
ee-- let's all say ee.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.960
Your tongue comes up under those
teeth on the side, generally.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.280
And your tongue-- I call it
the hump-- it's a humped vowel.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.500
The tongue comes into this
shape inside your mouth.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.020
It humps up in the middle.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.459
And I always call it ee spot.

00:12:56.459 --> 00:12:57.750
I always feel there's a point--

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.550
[CHUCKLING]

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.280
Yes, I know.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.200
There's a spot in the
middle of your tongue

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.850
that if you want to
make a nasty, nasty ee,

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.090
that's the little spot.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.730
So if you went, ee-eeh!

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:10.890
Try that everybody.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.780
Ee-eeh!

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.690
You see what you did?

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.720
You pulled the
center of that tongue

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.430
toward the roof of your mouth.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.730
And that increased that formant.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.280
That increased that
ee formant and made it

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.990
a little nastier too.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.260
And so that's the ee vowel.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.820
It's shaped in a
very specific way.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.140
Most singers love ee because
it does have a specific shape.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:35.080
It's about the easiest vowels to
teach because you can actually

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.860
really demonstrate the space.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.930
Whereas to find a good set of
formants for the ah vowel--

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.180
there are so many different
ahs in various languages.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.410
In many of the Asian
languages, the ah

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.130
is centered very far back.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.460
And so when we are dealing
with our Korean students

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.390
and Chinese students
and so forth,

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.290
you have to pull those
vowels out of the throat.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.630
Here's a demonstration of
an ah vowel coming away

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.970
from just glottal fry, what
we call vocal fry, which

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:08.510
is when I leave that energy
completely just there, when

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.410
I'm not going to try to move
it into my mouth at all.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.850
So you go ahh.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.360
You can all do vocal fry too.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.550
Ahh.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.328
It's just ahh!

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.107
And it often sounds like some
crackling and frying literally.

00:14:23.107 --> 00:14:23.690
It's sort of--

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.010
[GURGLING]

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.590
That sort of sensation.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.380
And we call that vocal fry.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.140
And so you can
come from vocal fry

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.470
all the way forward into
a very frontal resonance.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.400
And I'll try to
demonstrate this.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.256
So you sort of go ahhh.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.750
Now that one, the last one,
was totally focused right

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.690
behind my front teeth.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:53.840
The great Caruso would always
say, my voice, she is here.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.720
And take thumb and stick it
up behind his front teeth

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.580
because indeed a
singer who's really

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.410
producing in the
resonant pocket, which

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.360
is what your speech
therapist will call it,

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.930
in the resonant pocket,
that's what your sensation is.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:10.840
It's sitting right behind
your teeth-- right there.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.630
And so ohs and oohs
are interesting too

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.870
because you can really
form them from above.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:21.710
So if you say "you"--
say "you," everybody.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:26.280
Do you see how this middle
muscle here under your nose

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.880
gets a little involved?

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.190
And a singer learns to use that
to increase those formants.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.940
And this musculature is
very involved in oh and ooh.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:40.240
So if you say, "no
you don't"-- say,

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:45.460
"no you don't." "No you don't."

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.396
You feel how those
all sort of tumble?

00:15:47.396 --> 00:15:49.270
To me, they always feel
like they tumble down

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:50.310
the front of your face.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.684
Ohs and oohs always just feel
like they're rolling around

00:15:52.684 --> 00:15:54.870
up here like little marbles.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:59.180
They feel like they look on
the page, to me, oh and ooh.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.980
So oh and ooh are great vowels.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.640
Ooh I would say is
the cover vowel.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.930
Does anybody know
the term cover?

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:09.720
Ah, good.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.310
Or passaggio.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:13.820
The term passaggio?

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.540
And here's another
lady who knows it.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.470
How many of you have
sung, by the way?

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:21.710
How many of you sing in a choir,
a rock band, in the shower,

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.321
anywhere?

00:16:23.321 --> 00:16:23.820
Good.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.790
So you know what we're
talking about here.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:27.970
So cover is this thing.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:32.650
What I call cover, the
Italians called it coperto.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.186
Coperto means, literally,
a lid on something.

00:16:35.186 --> 00:16:36.560
So it's something
that supposedly

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.440
happens over the vowel.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:44.470
And what I think cover
is, frankly-- they're

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.560
just describing what
they're sensing.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.490
I think it's just the
shift of resonance.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.210
Cover is simply a
shift of resonance.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.550
And I can demonstrate that.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:55.080
You will hear a major
shift on the third pitch.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.910
I will sing a five-note
scale, and you

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:02.320
will hear the sound shift
on three and slightly

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.360
on five as well.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.530
Because I always say
about every two pitches

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.450
that larynx has to
go a little further,

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.599
and that resonance
shifts quite a bit.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:12.280
Because that's what
shifts the resonance

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.560
is the shift of the larynx.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.359
As we change pitch,
the larynx tilts over.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:19.680
He tilts down and
elongates that muscle.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.900
And that's what gives
you higher pitch.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.859
The longer muscle gives
you the higher pitch,

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:26.040
the shorter muscle
gives you a lower pitch.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.210
Go figure, right?

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:33.160
Doesn't seem logical to me,
but anyway-- Where was I?

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.020
The vowels.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:34.750
We were where?

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.150
AUDIENCE: The passaggio.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.590
SHERI GREENAWALD: The
passaggio, the cover.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.110
So I'll sing a five-note
scale, and like

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.610
I said, listen to three and five
and how they differ slightly.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:45.320
OK.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.900
I have to get in the
right area of the voice.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.400
Let's see.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.540
How about here?

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.466
[SINGING SCALES]

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:53.892
Do you heart that sort of?

00:17:53.892 --> 00:17:56.302
[SINGING SCALES]

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.580
And five also?

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.030
[SINGING SCALES]

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.300
And you hear that top pitch.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.460
You keep hearing the
resonances shift,

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.870
and this is what
we call the cover.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.150
The passaggio is this incredibly
interesting part in the voice.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.370
Every singer struggles
initially with their passaggio,

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.200
generally, unless they are
these lucky, lucky people that

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.500
don't struggle with it.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.980
I have met two of them.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:33.566
But the passaggio is where--
I asked Dr. Courey who

00:18:33.566 --> 00:18:35.190
is the head of the
Voice and Swallowing

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.710
department at UCSF, with whom we
have a wonderful relationship.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.350
I said to him one
day, Dr. Courey,

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:46.330
can you look in the throat and
tell a baritone from a tenor?

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.660
And he said, I can't even
tell a male from a female.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.930
Well, that blew a lot of
preconceptions out of my mind.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.302
Because we all think
that we're very unique.

00:18:58.302 --> 00:18:59.010
Well, guess what?

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.180
We're not.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.810
Not very unique at all.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:05.590
No, the vocal cords, he did say
that certain vocal cords are

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:06.620
maybe a little thicker.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.310
There might be a little thicker
cord, a slightly thinner cord,

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.680
but basically, you can't even
tell the male from the female.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.260
And so I always love
it, because men always

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.530
think you have to treat
their voices differently

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:19.430
than a female voice.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.290
And I'm going what?

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.390
No.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:23.240
No, you don't.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.530
Not really.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.770
But anyway, where was I?

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.051
I'm always losing my track here.

00:19:30.051 --> 00:19:31.050
AUDIENCE: The passaggio.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.260
SHERI GREENAWALD: The passaggio.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.120
The passaggio.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.427
I asked Dr. Courey what it was.

00:19:36.427 --> 00:19:38.010
And he said the
problem about studying

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.697
the passaggio is you'd have
to put electrodes in someone's

00:19:40.697 --> 00:19:43.280
vocal cords and have them sing,
and no one's going to do that.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.360
Because that wouldn't work.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.150
But the working
theory Ingo Titze

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:54.420
is one of the leading research
persons in the voice world

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.420
and a physicist himself.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.450
And their theory,
the working theory,

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:03.070
is that there is a switch of
where the tension in the cord

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:08.190
is from the thyroarytenoid
into the cricoarytenoid.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:12.450
And so it really is an internal
switch of energy placement

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:13.720
within the cord itself.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.560
And that's what
the passaggio is.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.100
Now, singers experience
the passaggio

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.260
almost as though
they're hitting a wall.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.830
They'll start up
a scale and go--

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.047
[SINGING SCALES]

00:20:24.047 --> 00:20:26.130
And then they hit this
wall, and they're not quite

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:27.910
sure what they're experiencing.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.364
And all it is that, if
you're having difficulty

00:20:31.364 --> 00:20:32.780
in your passaggio,
you're probably

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.110
creating too much tension
around the larynx itself

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.660
or within the larynx itself.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.900
And so this natural switch
of the energy placement

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.740
is being interrupted.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.670
And so when I teach
the passaggio,

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.400
I just say keep
your vibrato loose.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.490
Just let that vibrato go wild.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:51.520
And usually that
helps them because it

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.960
keeps that larynx a little
more active and able to make

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.850
that switch on its own.

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.486
And that's what
the passaggio is.

00:20:59.486 --> 00:21:02.556
And so knowing that also takes
the mystery out of it as well.

00:21:02.556 --> 00:21:04.680
And I always think we need
to take more mystery out

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.670
of it, because when you get
your vocal technique organized,

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.380
that's just the beginning.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.970
That's not the end product.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.786
Having a good vocal technique
is the very beginning.

00:21:14.786 --> 00:21:17.160
Because there's so much more
that goes into this business

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.670
than just having a
perfect vocal technique.

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.450
It might help if you
understood your words

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.460
and could walk and talk and
act at the same time as well.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.920
That helps.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.270
So that is what we do.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.500
We create these formants
and these vowels.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.980
And the speech
therapists do talk

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.110
about this resonant
pocket of the voice.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.480
And that's when the
energies are not

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.980
being blocked by tensing
in the laryngeal area

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:46.310
somewhere or not
supporting properly.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.450
The breath is a big thing.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.420
Because singers experience
this compression

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.610
in their body in
very different ways.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.680
As many people as are
singing would probably

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.890
describe the act of
inhalation and exhalation

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.780
during singing in
completely different ways.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.140
However, I think one of the
most simple ways for you

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.830
to experience what we
experience is simply

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.500
we're all going to
do a sibilant S.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.416
And you are going
to just hold this S.

00:22:12.416 --> 00:22:13.790
And what you're
trying to do, you

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.710
don't want this S to go wavering
like a candle flame, you know?

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.970
You want to keep this S straight
down the middle of your tongue.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.310
And you're just going
to go, and you're

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:27.820
going to experience the
slow the release of your air

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.036
through resistance.

00:22:29.036 --> 00:22:31.160
Because that is what the
vocal cords are providing,

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.570
resistance on the air.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.110
And so an S will
provide this resistance.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.160
And you can experience what
the singer feels in their body

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.820
as they're slowly,
slowly releasing air.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.470
So here we go.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.660
How about a sibilant S?

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.513
So we're all going
to just go sss.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:55.550
Do you feel your ribcage--
your ribcage is holding out

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:56.450
a little more, right?

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:00.960
You sense this ribcage
being held out.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.510
Your stomach muscles
will suddenly

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:06.800
start to contract here and move
up the middle of your belly,

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.710
right?

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:09.220
Keep going, keep
going, keep going.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.575
And when you get near the
end, then push it all out.

00:23:12.575 --> 00:23:14.950
And do you feel how your
muscles in the stomach area just

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.550
then grip underneath, right?

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:18.290
Sss!

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:19.270
Right, if you-- sss!

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:20.790
Push it all out.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.420
You feel that musculature.

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:26.850
That's what singers feel,
and that's what we're doing.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.950
It is the relationship
of the amount

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.920
of breath pressure to the
amount of pressure into the cord

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.130
itself, which is critical.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:36.800
And we learn to
control that slightly,

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.410
but the most critical thing is
that it's constantly flowing

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:41.910
and that you constantly
have a wealth of breath

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:47.730
in the reserve for
the voice to be using.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.700
Breath motion is
critical, but every singer

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:55.900
has a different description for
what they sense in their body.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.620
So Marilyn Horn
will say, push down.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.240
I would never think of down.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.110
I always think of
up with the breath.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.980
But every singer has a different
response in their body.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.084
And so they feel it
in a different way,

00:24:08.084 --> 00:24:09.750
and they describe it
in a different way.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:12.750
Of course, that's one of the
complications of teaching voice

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:17.070
in general, is that the
experience is internal.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.280
Unless you've got a
scope in your house

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.956
and can scope yourself while
you're singing or something,

00:24:21.956 --> 00:24:23.330
you don't know
what you're doing.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:29.580
It's not like a pianist who
can adjust his wrist height,

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.820
a violinist-- I
played string bass--

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.900
adjusting the pressure of
how you hold your wrist.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.320
You can see it all, and
it's much more simple.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.120
This is a hidden
art form, in a way.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.974
It's all in our
deep, dark throats.

00:24:41.974 --> 00:24:43.390
One thing I wanted
to let you know

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:46.970
about the ee vowel--
all the vowels have

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.600
their set of formants.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.560
And ee has a set of formants
out here at 2,000 and 3,000

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.570
hertz out here.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:55.590
Guess what?

00:24:55.590 --> 00:25:01.490
The 3,000 hertz is where the
human ear canal resonates.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:03.560
So that's why the ee
vowel is usually one

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.550
of the most annoying vowels.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:08.670
And I think voice
teachers, they teach away

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:12.270
from it a little bit, because
that ee really hits your ear.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:16.940
Because if you go
ah, ee, ah, ee--

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.000
that ee-- ah comes
at you fairly well,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.760
but ee, it just really
is more pungent.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.970
We think of it as
the pungent vowel.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:27.520
It is a pungent vowel.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.430
But that's because
of a good reason.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.650
It's the one that's
making your eardrums,

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.550
your actual ear canal vibrate.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:39.960
So it literally has a
physical response for you.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.050
So that's a good thing to know.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.990
Because a physicist
asked me to show him

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:45.710
what I did in the
middle of my voice

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.664
to create more sound
if an orchestra got big

00:25:47.664 --> 00:25:49.455
and I'm suddenly in
the middle of my range,

00:25:49.455 --> 00:25:53.050
where a soprano
doesn't have much

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.337
punch in the middle
of our range.

00:25:55.337 --> 00:25:57.670
And so he hooked me up to the
oscilloscope and all this,

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:59.397
and I showed him what I did.

00:25:59.397 --> 00:26:01.480
And lo and behold, he said,
well, what you've done

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.360
is increase the ee formant.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.230
Instinct on my part, but
that's what I was doing.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:09.710
I instinctively
knew that that ee

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.793
formant what was going to
cut the orchestra better

00:26:11.793 --> 00:26:13.000
than the other vowels.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.520
So you learn those things.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.162
So the vowels support.

00:26:18.162 --> 00:26:19.745
Like I say, the
breath is so critical.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:26.490
Now, of course, then we learn to
do fancy things with our voice.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:29.470
I thought we could all
try doing staccati,

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.760
because staccatos
are very violent.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.140
They should be anyway.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.760
There are actually
two different kinds

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.880
of ways of accomplishing
this sort of a staccato.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.410
One is what we call a laryngeal
staccato, where you're really

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:46.230
just using the cords themselves
rapidly and not really

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.250
diaphragmatically
impulsing this.

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:51.300
So that would be like--

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.592
[SINGING STACCATO]

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:57.490
It's not quite as strong for me.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:58.910
I don't use those.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:02.210
I use what is diaphragmatic.

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:03.980
The diaphragm is
that muscle that

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:08.460
lays in your body this way.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.720
He is not flat.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.070
This is not my diaphragm.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.820
These are my stomach muscles.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.110
My diaphragm is
in here this way.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:19.700
He's under here, and when you
inhale-- it happens for us all.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.570
When we inhale, the
diaphragm lowers and then

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.280
it slowly-- it's
what's controlling

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.400
this inhalation a little bit.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.250
And it slows the inhalation
and the exhalation.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:36.076
So here's a
diaphragmatic staccato.

00:27:36.076 --> 00:27:38.566
[SINGING STACCATO]

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.880
And you can see
how violent I am.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.944
[SINGING STACCATO]

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:51.510
And so guess what it's like?

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.180
Barking.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:58.120
So if you always ah, ruff, ruff!

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.603
Everybody, barking?

00:27:59.603 --> 00:28:00.529
Ruff!

00:28:00.529 --> 00:28:01.455
Ruff!

00:28:01.455 --> 00:28:02.850
Ruff!

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.460
But do you feel this?

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.340
You feel how this is
violently contracting on you?

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.742
That is a staccato.

00:28:09.742 --> 00:28:10.700
That's what we learned.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.930
Of course, your favorite
of the Queen of the night,

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:13.967
you know the--

00:28:13.967 --> 00:28:16.402
[SINGING]

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:19.324
All that?

00:28:19.324 --> 00:28:20.680
That's good staccato.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.230
And a good queen of the
night has a really good

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:24.880
diaphragmatic action.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.009
She knows how to get there.

00:28:27.009 --> 00:28:27.800
So that's staccato.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.570
And then a trill is one
of the hardest things.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:31.630
You can't even teach it.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:33.410
I've asked speech therapists.

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:34.917
I've asked everybody.

00:28:34.917 --> 00:28:36.750
If you haven't got the
instinct for a trill,

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.291
it's probably not
going to happen.

00:28:38.291 --> 00:28:40.540
And believe you me, I know
lots of really good singers

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.080
who can't trill.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.060
But a trill is just
this oscillation

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.190
between two pitches.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.750
That's what a trill is.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.147
And there are trills on
half steps and trills

00:28:49.147 --> 00:28:50.280
on whole steps.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.610
But in the old days, guess what?

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.770
Back in the good old days,
when the baroque singers

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:57.790
were going wild, they
would trill on fifths.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.450
So the baroque singer would go,

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:01.836
[SINGING]

00:29:03.802 --> 00:29:05.510
They actually would
trill back and forth.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.180
It's a little like yodeling.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:12.370
But the trills that became
standard then from Mozart on,

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:15.740
basically, were mostly either
half step trills or full step

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:16.720
trills.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.987
And those sound like,

00:29:18.987 --> 00:29:20.448
[SINGING]

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:29.970
So I am literally setting
my larynx into a spasm.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:32.870
It's really a spasm
of the larynx.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:36.895
And like I say, I have never
been able to successfully teach

00:29:36.895 --> 00:29:38.520
a trill.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.330
But I can show you sort
of what it feels like.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:42.948
And that's if you go,

00:29:42.948 --> 00:29:44.352
[SINGING]

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.480
It's a little like doggies
again, a little barking.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.280
But if you start on a
higher pitch and go down--

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.456
[SINGING]

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.160
We got some trills going on.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.250
You see?

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.300
You can all trill.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.070
So that's a trill,
and it's just being

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.600
able to get that larynx
to go into spasm.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.190
My speech therapist friend,
I asked her and she said,

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:17.640
can't tell you how to teach it.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.300
So if she doesn't know,
trust me, nobody does.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:28.510
So the trill is this inherent
skill that you can develop.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:33.875
So trills and-- oh gosh.

00:30:33.875 --> 00:30:35.250
Where do we want
to go from here?

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:35.620
Let me see.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:36.370
What have I got?

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:37.435
Staccato, coloratura--

00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:40.140
Oh, singing fast,
singing fast notes.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.302
We all know the-- I have
a baroque singer that

00:30:43.302 --> 00:30:45.260
works with me who sings
a lot with Philharmonia

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.680
Baroque, a wonderful
girl named Celine Ricci.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.400
And I always say to her, you can
sing faster than I can think.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:58.350
My teacher always said,
because pitch is thought.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:04.930
If you say to me
sing a high C, yeah?

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:08.510
If you don't indicate
what that pitch is,

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:11.120
my larynx doesn't know that.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:15.200
I mean, if I hear the pitch,
my larynx goes-- bing!

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.290
He knows exactly.

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:17.800
So pitch is thought.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.830
You can't come to a pitch
without thinking it.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.470
So pitch being
thought, my teacher

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:25.920
would always say as fast as
you can think those notes you

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.560
should be able to sing them.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.040
So one of my students
sitting back there,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.930
the first thing we worked
on was "Rejoice Greatly"

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.890
from "The Messiah,"
which is something

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:37.160
that has a ton of coloratura.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.785
And that's what I
taught myself to sing

00:31:38.785 --> 00:31:40.780
my freshman year of college.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.960
Because I was told I
was thinking that aria

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:49.950
at the big concert in
the basketball gym.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.980
That's where you always have
to perform at Christmas.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.040
And I went into that room.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.150
I started at about 88
beats to the second.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:03.740
And I got it up to about 132
by the time I was finished,

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.640
which as pretty quick.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.570
So you know--

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:12.674
(SINGING) Rejoice,
rejoice, rejoice greatly!

00:32:12.674 --> 00:32:16.330
Rejoice, O daughter of Zion.

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:17.130
All right.

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:20.750
So all this-- (SINGING)
O daughter of Zion.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.742
Rejoice, rejoice.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:26.920
Right?

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:31.370
So you learn those patterns,
and as long as you can think it,

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:32.590
I can go there.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:34.670
But like I say,
my friend Celine,

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.190
she thinks faster than me.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.430
That's for sure.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:38.710
It's always astounding to me.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:42.730
The really rapid coloratura
is always amazing.

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:43.779
Let's see.

00:32:43.779 --> 00:32:46.070
Oh yes, and one of the other
things I wanted to mention

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.630
was that I could
go around this room

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:53.250
and probably pretty much nail
what kind of a voice type

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.620
you are.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:58.300
Because there are body
types and head shapes,

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.680
neck shapes that sort of go--

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.360
Like, I see a
coloratura right here.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.670
You see this lovely lady
in the purple jacket?

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:09.200
She has this beautiful,
long, swan neck.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.680
And that always goes with
either the dramatic coloratura

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.160
or a lyric mezzo.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.880
So I would say
she's either a lyric

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.050
mezzo or a dramatic coloratura.

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:23.000
Now, I see a possible
helden-something

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.740
back there, this gentleman
in the green t-shirt here.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.420
Yes, you with the beard.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:32.450
He's got this big head.

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.590
And he's got a nice thick neck.

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:38.920
And it looks like he's got a
nice long torso and a rather

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.637
wide torso.

00:33:41.637 --> 00:33:43.720
He's either going to be a
heldentenor or some kind

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.540
of a big thick baritone.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:48.080
Right back there, there he sits.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:48.930
I'm looking at you.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:51.635
I would suggest possibly a bass.

00:33:51.635 --> 00:33:53.010
He looks like he
could be a bass.

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:55.190
Basses are often tall and lean.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:57.010
Of course, there are
the basses also--

00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:00.430
there are the short
little basses also.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:02.160
But for instance,
coloraturas, there

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.760
are two kinds of the coloratura.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:08.679
There's the French coloratura,
and they're usually short,

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:12.230
little short necks,
big round heads.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.219
And those are the
French coloraturas.

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:16.389
And then the German
coloraturas are often

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:18.989
the bigger ones, more like
this with the long necks

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:20.900
and what I call the horse head.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:25.620
It's a head that goes from here
to there, like a big cylinder

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:26.350
here.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:29.540
And that's often the
dramatic coloraturas.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.090
And believe me, it bears out.

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:37.679
I probably hear somewhere
between 800 and 1,000 singers

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:40.080
every year live in auditions.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.546
And so when they walk in,
it's like I already know.

00:34:44.546 --> 00:34:46.170
And some kids will
walk in, and they'll

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:47.253
say I'd like to sing this.

00:34:47.253 --> 00:34:48.869
And I say, no you wouldn't.

00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:50.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:51.715
No, you wouldn't.

00:34:51.715 --> 00:34:52.590
Because I could tell.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.320
I can tell by their
body type that they

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.480
couldn't sing that aria if
their life depended on them.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:01.050
In reality, I mean,
to my standard

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:02.870
anyway-- to my
standard, they wouldn't

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:06.350
be able to execute it
because that body doesn't

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:07.520
sing that music.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.502
It just doesn't happen.

00:35:10.502 --> 00:35:12.210
This was one of the
most wonderful things

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.043
that happened to me.

00:35:13.043 --> 00:35:15.490
After Dr. Courey had said
to me this whole business

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:20.480
about how you don't tell men
from females even if you stare

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.810
at the larynx all day long.

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:25.430
So one night, I'm doing
a public education class

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:28.990
on singing just like this,
just what I'm doing with you.

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:31.990
The orchestra members come
later and do their bit.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.650
My friend, Emil Milan,
who's one of our cellists

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:37.510
in the orchestra, walked
in the room with his cello.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:41.150
And I looked over there,
and I went, oh my god.

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:43.050
I thought, well,
whether you have

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:47.240
a Stradivarius or
a Suzuki, you're

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.020
walking into the
same music store

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:52.090
or emailing Amazon
for it, whatever,

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:56.090
how we do it anymore because
there are no music stores left.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:58.740
They're purchasing
the same string.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.240
It's not like he's got
a unique string that's

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.910
only the Stradivarius string.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:04.920
No, he's going into a
store and buying a string,

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:08.290
replacing that string just
like any other violinist.

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:10.260
So guess what?

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.660
It ain't the string
that's so important.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.690
It's the box.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.450
So that's why these body
shapes are so critical.

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:20.400
Because my good
friend Dolora Zajick,

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.890
who has been one of the
world's famous dramatic mezzos

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:28.440
for years and years,
trained at the San Francisco

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.000
Opera, former Adler
Fellow, ding ding, right?

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.821
Dolora always says, when
I'm at a dinner party, when

00:36:34.821 --> 00:36:36.570
we're sitting down,
I'm one of the tallest

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:37.430
people at the table.

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:39.890
When we stand up, I'm
one of the shortest.

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.930
Because she's all torso.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:44.430
She is just nothing
but here to here,

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:48.240
big, long upper body,
and then teeny little

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.790
legs-- teeny little legs.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:52.320
But that's her calling card.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.121
That's why she is who she is.

00:36:54.121 --> 00:36:56.120
And of course, she has a
head like a basketball.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.430
My friend Jane
Eaglen, who was one

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:00.980
of the great
Brunhildes of her day,

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.780
you know, Jane, I literally
always just look at her head

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:04.580
and go, oh my god.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.010
It's just a basketball.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.270
It's a huge, huge head.

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:10.990
I've sung with [? Cort Mal, ?]
the famous bass.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:12.080
It's just a mound!

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.340
He's a mound of a man.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.360
He's just giant.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.900
And that's what that voice is.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.560
The body's tell you the truth.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.320
Your body is your vessel.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.090
And that was one of the great
things about seeing Emil

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:27.520
that night because it really
confirmed to me how important

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.820
this is to the act of singing.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.440
So I always find that
very fascinating after all

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.720
these years of being
in this business.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.850
So I think I'm about done
with what I have to say,

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:42.584
but I'm really anxious to hear
what you might want to know

00:37:42.584 --> 00:37:44.000
and what questions
you might have.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.370
Yes?

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:47.861
AUDIENCE: So I've been going
to the San Francisco Opera

00:37:47.861 --> 00:37:48.610
since I was a kid.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:49.693
SHERI GREENAWALD: Oh cool.

00:37:49.693 --> 00:37:51.590
AUDIENCE: Huge opera fan.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.310
But I have a question for you.

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:53.650
SHERI GREENAWALD: Yes.

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.900
AUDIENCE: It's not just about
the San Francisco Opera.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.260
So I'm a native Russian speaker,
and I go to Russian operas

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.740
at the San Francisco Opera
and even other places.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.890
And sometimes I'm
just horrified,

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:05.940
because there are some
singers that are just

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.310
butchering the language--
very sonorously--

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:09.520
but they're butchering it.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.840
And there's another one who may
be not just Russian speakers.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.515
You might have a Polish or
a Czech singer who are fine.

00:38:15.515 --> 00:38:16.890
Same thing with
the Czech operas.

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:18.220
I'm hearing the same thing.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:21.500
And then there's the one who
can't pronounce it correctly,

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.550
and I just cringe.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.990
It's like grating on my ears.

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:26.640
I hear the same thing
with French operas.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:30.400
Why do you guys hire people
who can't pronounce correctly?

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.100
And why do opera singers go
through all this training

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.890
and not learn to do the
French R, the rolling--

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:37.710
the Russian R and all these--

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:40.020
SHERI GREENAWALD:
French R-- French R,

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:43.000
even the French coaches don't
want us doing French R's.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.240
French R's are left to
Edith Piaf and the crowd.

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:49.200
No, the preeminent
French coach is

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.650
Janine Reiss, who is one of
the famous French coaches.

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:54.400
You just don't use the French
R, basically, in what we do,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.990
because it is a guttural thing,
and it's not good for singing.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:00.320
If you're bringing it
[GURGLE] all the time,

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.620
you're going to irritate
your vocal cord, literally.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.020
So you avoid that French R.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:08.010
However, I'm with you.

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:10.740
One of my bugaboos in
the training of singers

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:14.850
is that we do not insist
upon language classes enough,

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:18.090
and language as a
language, not as

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:21.870
what we call the International
Phonetic Alphabet, IPA.

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:23.040
That's not enough, kids.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.360
That's just not enough.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.750
So when I was in
school I made a point

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:29.550
of studying these languages
individually-- German, French,

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:30.300
and Italian.

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.970
I made that point for myself,
but a lot of the schools

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:33.740
aren't doing it.

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:35.770
And that's the crime.

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:37.150
The Europeans, of
course, usually

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.100
come in much better
shape because they

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.230
speak many languages usually
growing up in their households.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:45.310
I lived in Europe for 12 years.

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:49.780
I watched Italian TV,
French TV, German TV.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:50.540
We watched it all.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.744
British TV, thank goodness,
there was British TV.

00:39:52.744 --> 00:39:54.160
"Ready, Steady,
Cook," I love you.

00:39:57.992 --> 00:40:00.450
I mean, when Pamela Rosenberg
hired me at the San Francisco

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:02.070
Opera to be the head
of the training, one

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:03.320
of the questions she
asked me, she said,

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.020
what do you feel is the
most important thing

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:05.850
for a young singer?

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:07.110
And I said, languages.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.890
And she, coming from Europe,
I think she appreciated that

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:10.580
tremendously.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.630
And I think that's
why I got the job.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:17.190
But I've been appalled at
really the paucity of language

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:18.630
training in the schools.

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:21.230
And it's just not
enough, and I'm with you.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.300
I'm with you.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.270
And I always get upset too
when they change the surtitles

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:27.645
to justify a thing.

00:40:27.645 --> 00:40:29.020
And you know the
language and you

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:33.040
go, what's that got to do
with what they just said?

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:33.890
So anyway--

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:36.004
AUDIENCE: So how are
these singers even hired?

00:40:36.004 --> 00:40:38.503
Because if they're competing
with singers coming from Europe

00:40:38.503 --> 00:40:40.879
who may have better
language skills?

00:40:40.879 --> 00:40:42.920
SHERI GREENAWALD: Well,
they could be a big star,

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.580
and so you know they're going
to pull in the audience.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:48.680
So that's part of it.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.450
The person hiring them
may not know any better,

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:53.619
may not know the
language either.

00:40:53.619 --> 00:40:55.660
And so we forgive a lot
of stuff in this business

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.430
just because the person in
charge doesn't know it either.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:59.142
But trust me.

00:40:59.142 --> 00:41:00.850
When you come to the
San Francisco Opera,

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:05.920
we have coaches who are
absolute, assiduous hard

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.740
drivers.

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:11.940
But then there are
incorrigible people as well.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.840
There are incorrigible
artists who just

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.010
aren't interested in changing.

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:18.170
But the coaches at the
San Francisco Opera,

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:19.120
I have been there.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:19.960
I know.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.480
They come after you.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.520
You finish a stage rehearsal
and the diction coach

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.431
is chasing you down.

00:41:26.431 --> 00:41:26.930
No!

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:30.650
You know, with a long
list, and you go ahh!

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:31.420
Believe me.

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:34.810
It's not like we want this
to happen, but like I say,

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:38.510
there are certain singers
who will be incorrigible.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.904
Yes?

00:41:39.904 --> 00:41:41.892
AUDIENCE: Sort of related.

00:41:41.892 --> 00:41:44.874
So as with orchestral
play, voices

00:41:44.874 --> 00:41:49.844
have to sound more homogenized
since the end of World War II.

00:41:49.844 --> 00:41:52.577
But when you hear records
of some French singers,

00:41:52.577 --> 00:41:56.305
some Russian singers,
some German singers,

00:41:56.305 --> 00:41:58.790
there's a characteristic sound.

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:00.778
And I'm really curious
about your thoughts

00:42:00.778 --> 00:42:03.263
about how these different
singing traditions wind up

00:42:03.263 --> 00:42:06.742
with really such
distinctive sounds.

00:42:06.742 --> 00:42:10.770
There's that Slavic sound
that's totally unmistakable.

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:12.320
SHERI GREENAWALD:
It's the language.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.500
It will be their
native tongue that

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.040
has led them to a
certain set of resonances

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.780
that create a particular
style, if you will.

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.450
And so that is
absolutely-- I think it all

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:26.590
stems from the language itself.

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.670
Because if you want to get
very stylistic for anything,

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:34.390
if your language is incorrect,
the style will not be correct.

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:38.860
I think all of that comes
out of the language.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:45.090
Also I think there is a
certain thing, for instance,

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:48.810
in the Asian face,
the way the nose is

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:52.160
on the Asian face or an
African-American face,

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:56.360
how our noses go on our face,
all of this kind of thing also.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.410
So in certain ethnic groups,
a particular head shape

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:03.970
and a certain physiognomy
that is common to that race,

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:07.890
if you will, will also perhaps
influence a particular sound.

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:10.470
But I would say mostly
it'll come from the language

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:14.270
and what the native vowels
are creating for you.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:17.180
That's where it
comes, I would say.

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:17.770
Yes?

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:19.660
My heldentenor, yes.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.775
AUDIENCE: I have no idea
what that means though.

00:43:21.775 --> 00:43:23.941
SHERI GREENAWALD: Oh, I
think he's a heldenbaritone.

00:43:23.941 --> 00:43:26.146
Now that I hear him talk,
he's a heldenbaritone.

00:43:26.146 --> 00:43:28.040
AUDIENCE: We want you
to take voice lessons.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.915
AUDIENCE: I just started
like two months ago.

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:35.326
You were talking about {} our
meat box and the resonances.

00:43:35.326 --> 00:43:37.200
How does that change
when you're on the move,

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.546
standing still versus acting?

00:43:39.546 --> 00:43:41.462
When you were singing,
you were kind of like--

00:43:41.462 --> 00:43:41.934
SHERI GREENAWALD: Moving around.

00:43:41.934 --> 00:43:42.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:48.730
SHERI GREENAWALD:
Well, a singing actor

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:50.780
has to be able to move and sing.

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:56.480
So what a singer
will do, always,

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.120
if you watch them on stage,
what they're going to try to do

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:03.190
is to keep this part of
their body equalized, sort

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:08.910
of the support box, if you
will, the cello part of it all.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:12.710
You will try to keep that
in line a little bit.

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:13.420
But trust me.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:20.560
I've sung laying down, falling
down, rolling down, on a sled.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.850
I've sledded.

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:24.600
That was one of the
scariest things I ever

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:30.460
had to do was time a sled ride
down a hill to hit the tenor.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.470
I had to hit the tenor.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:34.980
That was the fun part.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.900
The scary part was getting
that timing down with my sled.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.650
I was in "Intermezzo"
in Santa Fe.

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:44.460
But yeah, you just
learn to do it.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.590
If you think about Steph Curry
out on the basketball court--

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:52.910
go Warriors-- the positions,
his body gets into it.

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:55.315
You know that the core
strength has to be there.

00:44:55.315 --> 00:44:57.590
So it's a lot about the
core strength for a singer.

00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:58.973
AUDIENCE: You're really
using that movement

00:44:58.973 --> 00:45:00.360
to help you hit some
note or something?

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.020
SHERI GREENAWALD: No, except
that it can liberate a singer.

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:05.610
Oftentimes, if I'm teaching
and their breath isn't moving,

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:09.270
if they're like, I
want to go home now

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:12.030
and you feel that sort
of strangled sense,

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:15.520
if you start getting them
to walk, they lose that.

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.630
And so sometimes you will
lead a singer around a room.

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:21.830
Or my colleague Mark Morash at
the opera, he always has them

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:22.650
twist.

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:24.350
Of course, now I say
to somebody twist,

00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:26.884
and I have to explain
what a twist is.

00:45:26.884 --> 00:45:28.880
Ahh!

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.660
But oftentimes we
will actually ask

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:35.480
them to move because that
will free up their breath.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.070
Because that's so critical.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:40.520
But you get used to singing
in lots of positions.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:41.020
Yes?

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:42.603
AUDIENCE: In the
production, typically

00:45:42.603 --> 00:45:45.340
who [? shapes ?] the
implementation of the piece?

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.260
Is it the conductor, the singer?

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.259
And does that change
depending on the reputation

00:45:49.259 --> 00:45:49.860
of the singer?

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.110
SHERI GREENAWALD: It can, yes.

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:53.290
I have watched
interesting confrontations

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:55.280
between conductors
and famous stars.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.190
That can be very interesting.

00:45:57.190 --> 00:46:00.690
I never had to worry about that.

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:05.910
But it's mostly the director,
in this day and age.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:09.290
The concepts are going to come
from the director, of course,

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:10.740
for the production.

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:13.170
The conductor can come
in and influence it

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:16.020
in a great way, just
simply through tempo.

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.320
And oftentimes, there
will be a disconnect

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.810
between what the director
is wanting dramatically

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:23.170
and what the conductor
is thinking of the music.

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:26.600
And so sometimes, the
singer will end up

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.870
being the mediator
between the two of them

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:32.750
to find a compromise that
works for the dramatic side

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:35.640
and the musical side,
what he wants to create.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.120
But in the old days, the
music dictated much more.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:43.580
In today's world, the director
is a lot more ascendant

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:45.150
in the power struggles.

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:47.220
The singer is the last
one on the totem pole,

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.760
generally, unless
you're a big, big star.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.250
When you're Renee
Fleming, when you're

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:55.590
Joyce DiDonato, when
you're Maria Callas,

00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:57.780
you can dictate a lot more.

00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.784
But even then, I'm
sure Callas was always

00:46:59.784 --> 00:47:01.950
happy to have a [? seraphim ?]
in the pit, you know?

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:05.070
Someone who's strong, and
powerful, and can lead them.

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:08.360
You really do want to have
help when you're up there.

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.040
You're not looking to be
out there on your own.

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.040
You didn't get in the
business to be on your own

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:17.169
necessarily, so-- yes?

00:47:17.169 --> 00:47:19.654
AUDIENCE: You've been
talking about formants

00:47:19.654 --> 00:47:22.636
and the resonances for different
pitches and things like that.

00:47:22.636 --> 00:47:28.600
I mean, like a flute or a guitar
is a one dimensional thing,

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.085
but in voice, you're
working at least

00:47:31.085 --> 00:47:33.570
on maybe a height and a depth.

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:37.050
Things are happening in
at least two dimensions.

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:38.740
SHERI GREENAWALD:
Yes, I would say so.

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:44.834
Things are happening in all
dimensions, I think, with us.

00:47:44.834 --> 00:47:45.750
It's very interesting.

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:48.850
I work with a flute player
who's studying voice with me.

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:52.030
And it's always interesting
to see the things

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:56.490
that I have to correct from
her because of the habits

00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:58.120
she creates.

00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:03.000
And flute players hold
their flute with their chin,

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.594
and so the chin becomes--
you've got to go, OK, ugh.

00:48:06.594 --> 00:48:07.760
Get that thing out of there.

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:16.140
And it's very interesting,
the Meyer sound systems

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.290
that are coming
out now, which they

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:20.630
have in restaurants,
and theaters now,

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:22.120
and all of this sort of thing.

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:25.070
It's very interesting,
because I call them Ursula.

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:28.040
Because what they're doing
is taking my sensation away

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:28.540
from me.

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:32.220
A singer's relying very
much on a sensation.

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.189
It's too late when you hear it.

00:48:34.189 --> 00:48:35.730
Like, the conductor
is always saying,

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:37.974
if you're waiting to
hear it, it's too late!

00:48:37.974 --> 00:48:39.890
Conductors are always
yelling that at singers,

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:49.680
because oftentimes, you're
anywhere from 20 to 40 to maybe

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:53.250
even 50 feet away from the
source of the sound in the pit

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:54.540
and from the conductor.

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.490
And so you can't rely
on your ear at all.

00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:57.920
You have to rely on your sight.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.700
That's why the conductor is
important, believe it or not,

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:05.720
with the arms and so
you rely on your eyes

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.140
a lot more than
you do your ears.

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.450
And so that's one
of the things that's

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:10.500
complicated for me with
a Meyer sound system

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.330
is that they've taken away
the sensation that I rely on.

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:16.670
That's the thing that's
a problem for a singer,

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:17.724
I would say.

00:49:17.724 --> 00:49:20.194
AUDIENCE: But when you know
a pitch that you want to

00:49:20.194 --> 00:49:22.911
hit, you're going to have
to effectively choose how

00:49:22.911 --> 00:49:25.134
to shape your vocal tract to--

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.840
SHERI GREENAWALD: I think
that pitch and I go.

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.540
What I just think about
is shaping the vowel.

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:34.820
I don't think about
shaping the tract,

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.390
because I really don't have
that much control over anything

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:39.832
except pitch when I'm
really down there unless I'm

00:49:39.832 --> 00:49:41.540
doing things that I
think are going to be

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.230
detrimental to the production.

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:46.950
If I'm tightening this
band alongside the larynx,

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:51.200
or if you tighten the
atlas joint back here.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.660
Guess where those muscles come?

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.610
Directly to your larynx.

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:57.870
And so if that joint is locked
up, you're screwed up too.

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.180
So there are a lot of
kinds of physiognomy things

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:02.650
that you deal with, but I
don't ever think about anything

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:04.670
but pitch laryngeally.

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:07.400
So everything else is
transferring that energy

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.550
past the larynx into
the resonant chamber.

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:14.730
So I'm working past my
larynx at all times, almost.

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:17.610
Because I only think of the
larynx as a pitch source,

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:18.430
and that's it.

00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:20.138
AUDIENCE: Then how
are you going to teach

00:50:20.138 --> 00:50:23.060
the students to create an
effective resonance so they

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:24.040
get enough volume?

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.660
SHERI GREENAWALD:
You've got to get

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:27.450
the vowel resonance correct.

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:28.900
That is the major thing.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.000
You can't control the
pitch resonance other

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.110
than creating the pitch
correctly, or just creating

00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:34.610
the pitch.

00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:36.769
The pitch will have its
own set of resonances

00:50:36.769 --> 00:50:38.310
that come with it,
but then the vowel

00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:39.440
has its set of resonances.

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.150
And that's the
thing you can affect

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:43.540
is how they create
the vowel formants.

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:48.180
I would say that is what
teachers spend at least 80%

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:51.150
of the time doing, is actually
helping a student create

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:53.480
the vowel formants properly.

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.530
AUDIENCE: Along that line, so if
the conductors asking for more

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:59.350
volume, as a singer, we
think more resonance and ping

00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:01.544
to get more volume
instead of push.

00:51:01.544 --> 00:51:03.043
Do you do that
through vowel formant

00:51:03.043 --> 00:51:05.740
or do you do that
through height?

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:09.240
SHERI GREENAWALD: Vowel formant,
working at the formants.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:13.370
I was telling a story when
we were having lunch earlier.

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:15.430
Oh, I think I just I
told you that what I do

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:17.150
is increase that ee formant.

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:18.710
I told you that, yeah.

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:21.330
So that's about the only
thing I can do in an area

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:23.130
where I'm less resonant.

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:27.220
Now, of course a soprano
on a G, let's say.

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:30.100
You have middle C, C,
and then this G up here?

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:32.020
That's usually one
of our loudest notes.

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:36.244
We can get on that sucker and
go to town with most of them.

00:51:36.244 --> 00:51:37.410
Put me up against a trumpet.

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:37.909
I'm there.

00:51:37.909 --> 00:51:39.420
OK.

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.890
I'm ready to do it.

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:43.577
So you learn to do
it through formant.

00:51:43.577 --> 00:51:44.910
Oh, that's an interesting thing.

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:47.520
That brings up the
subject of resonance.

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:51.177
There are two sides
of the resonance.

00:51:51.177 --> 00:51:52.760
There's that thing
I talked about when

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:56.030
I talked about the breathy
onset, a more breathy onset

00:51:56.030 --> 00:52:02.030
as opposed to a glottal or a
proper onset, a perfect onset.

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:07.380
There's also loft in the
sound or twang in the sound.

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:10.260
So loft is when
I talk like this.

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.720
There's a lot of
loft in my song.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:16.080
I'm making a lot of back
space, and all of this,

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.190
it's very pharyngeal, really.

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:24.750
It's all more pharyngeal
space and breath back there.

00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:29.250
But then twang, I'm closing up
space in the back, actually.

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:31.340
[TWANG]

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:35.070
We were watching a video
of Sam Ramey singing

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:37.050
the "Semiramide" aria.

00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:39.900
And we were sitting
there, and Soha Al-Jurf,

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:44.170
my speech therapist friend
who used to be at UCSF,

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:50.590
would say loft,
twang, twang, twang.

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:51.610
Sam's from Kansas.

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:54.040
I said, Sam will
have a lot of twang.

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:56.010
He's a good Midwestern boy.

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:58.700
But those are sort of the
two shades of the resonance.

00:52:58.700 --> 00:52:59.970
You can go from

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:01.720
[SINGING]

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.236
I have to go higher.

00:53:03.236 --> 00:53:05.716
[SINGING]

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:10.750
You can get-- you can
bring more twang into it.

00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:14.106
So that's the two sides
of that resonant coin.

00:53:14.106 --> 00:53:17.890
AUDIENCE: Can you tell us about
countertenors [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:23.100
SHERI GREENAWALD: Countertenors,
basically, they're

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.125
singing on the
edges of the cords.

00:53:26.125 --> 00:53:27.250
That is what they're doing.

00:53:30.819 --> 00:53:33.360
And there's also a muscle that
runs through it, which I can't

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.360
think of the name of this vein.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:37.680
And that thing is part of it.

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.870
But what they're
doing is that they

00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:40.260
sing on the edge of the cords.

00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:45.450
Females even, we
also have falsetto.

00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:47.710
You just don't hear it
as such necessarily.

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:50.200
We call it whistle voice.

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.982
I'm sure you know about
whistle voice, right?

00:53:52.982 --> 00:53:53.940
There's a whistle tone.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.360
We actually have a falsetto too.

00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.630
It's when you really get
to the edges of the cords,

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:00.150
and that's where
they're singing.

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:01.816
I've worked with a
lot of countertenors,

00:54:01.816 --> 00:54:03.590
and it's very interesting work.

00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:06.200
Because sometimes that
will just crack on them,

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:09.330
and it'll-- goes away.

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:11.225
But that's basically
what they're doing.

00:54:11.225 --> 00:54:14.460
They sing with the
edge of the cord.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:14.960
Yes?

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.542
AUDIENCE: So a few weeks
ago, the San Jose Opera

00:54:16.542 --> 00:54:18.125
had a production of
"The Magic Flute."

00:54:18.125 --> 00:54:21.006
And I had a friend who worked
in the tech crew, and he said,

00:54:21.006 --> 00:54:22.229
I can't believe it.

00:54:22.229 --> 00:54:23.895
These singers, when
they're on the stage

00:54:23.895 --> 00:54:25.686
and they have to speak,
you can't hear them

00:54:25.686 --> 00:54:27.443
in the back of the hall.

00:54:27.443 --> 00:54:28.026
And it's true.

00:54:28.026 --> 00:54:30.699
I had one of the
cheap seats, and I

00:54:30.699 --> 00:54:32.400
was like, I can't
hear what they're

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.816
saying when they had to speak.

00:54:33.816 --> 00:54:35.316
And because they
didn't know German,

00:54:35.316 --> 00:54:36.165
they actually had
to speak in English

00:54:36.165 --> 00:54:38.511
and sing in German, which
was kind of bizarre.

00:54:38.511 --> 00:54:39.010
Why?

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:40.480
Why is this?

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:43.464
If they can sing so well
and then when they speak--

00:54:43.464 --> 00:54:45.880
SHERI GREENAWALD: Because it's
what I always say to girls.

00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:47.800
I imagine, did you
hear the men better

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:49.260
than you heard the women?

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:50.270
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:52.660
SHERI GREENAWALD:
Because men are generally

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.730
singing where they speak.

00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:56.840
So a baritone is,
basically-- I always

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.923
say baritones never learn
how to sing because they

00:54:58.923 --> 00:55:00.080
sing where they speak.

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.040
That's my little joke.

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.990
Sorry, my baritone friends.

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:04.400
But they sing where they speak.

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:08.310
The problem for
us, for sopranos,

00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:11.165
the modal-- that's called
the modal part of the voice.

00:55:11.165 --> 00:55:12.920
It's where you are
speaking all the time.

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.830
And as you hear me,
I speak quite low.

00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:18.800
I'm a soprano, but I generally
am speaking at below middle C,

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.260
almost invariably.

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:22.320
So if I try to
project down here,

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.100
I don't have any sound down
here unless (LOW VOICE)

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:28.380
I were to go into a
chest voice and do that.

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:29.950
But there's no
character that I would

00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:32.110
do that would have that voice.

00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:33.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:34.390
Well, there just wasn't.

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:40.740
For instance, I did a lot of
"Rosalindas," but in English,

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:41.560
in Santa Fe.

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:42.810
I did a ton of them.

00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:45.500
And so I always
said, would it not

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:49.320
be stupid if I was on stage
talking like, (LOW VOICE)

00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.640
well now, Alfred.

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.139
Come over here, Alfred.

00:55:52.139 --> 00:55:54.263
And then all of a sudden,
I start to sing and I'm--

00:55:54.263 --> 00:55:57.372
(SINGING SOPRANO) At night,
when I'm alone with you--

00:55:57.372 --> 00:55:59.410
It's like, what kind of
a disconnect is that?

00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:01.950
(HIGH VOICE) So
when I'm on stage,

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:04.643
I will speak much more up here.

00:56:04.643 --> 00:56:06.950
Oh darling, really, must you?

00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:09.430
Because now I'm in
a pitch range where

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:13.110
I have resonance that
I can use to project.

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:15.130
And so I bet you those
women weren't pitching

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:16.529
their voices very high.

00:56:16.529 --> 00:56:17.070
AUDIENCE: No.

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:19.310
SHERI GREENAWALD: No,
that's the mistake.

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:21.720
Females have to pitch
their voice higher on stage

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.390
if you're going to project.

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:26.110
I mean, most theaters
where actresses and stuff,

00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:28.117
they're not as big
as what we sing into.

00:56:28.117 --> 00:56:30.700
They don't have that same issue
because they're not projecting

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:32.540
into this larger space.

00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:35.161
But a singer, if you're on
stage at the San Francisco--

00:56:35.161 --> 00:56:36.702
(SINGING SOPRANO)
Opera, you'd better

00:56:36.702 --> 00:56:39.830
be up here, where you've
got a little resonance

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:41.650
and you can make some noise.

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:44.970
And probably you can
hear me back there.

00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:47.340
So that's what I
would say is that they

00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.580
weren't using their
upper resonances nearly

00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:51.630
enough to speak.

00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:54.524
That's what would happen.

00:56:54.524 --> 00:56:58.853
AUDIENCE: You talked about
the passaggio and [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:58.853 --> 00:57:01.739
Could you describe what
happens physiologically

00:57:01.739 --> 00:57:05.610
when you use what, I guess
you call the mixed voice?

00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:09.050
SHERI GREENAWALD: Well, I would
say the mixed voice is probably

00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:12.130
where those two muscles,
the thyroarytenoid

00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:15.490
and the cricoarytenoid,
are evened out.

00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:18.180
That's where I would say
the tensions from both

00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:20.810
are of an equal tension.

00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:22.440
I would say that
that's what you sense

00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:26.350
and you experience as
the mix in the voice.

00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:29.620
The mix in the voice is where
you have this head voice

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.470
and you chest voice.

00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:32.782
Ahh.

00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:34.740
And that's just the two
ends of the instrument.

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:37.150
And in the middle,
where they start to mix,

00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:39.650
we call that the
mix in the voice.

00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:42.390
And so a mixed voice, if I'm
coming down from the head

00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:43.990
voice, I'm going--

00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:46.767
[SINGING]

00:57:46.767 --> 00:57:47.600
Now I'm in my mixed.

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.260
Did you hear?

00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:50.410
Suddenly, it became thicker.

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:52.880
[SINGING]

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:56.650
Right there, the chest sound
came much more into my sound

00:57:56.650 --> 00:57:57.810
there.

00:57:57.810 --> 00:58:00.530
[SINGING]

00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:01.722
Now if I go down--

00:58:01.722 --> 00:58:04.300
[SINGING]

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:06.194
Now I let myself
go into full chest.

00:58:06.194 --> 00:58:07.110
And that's full chest.

00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:10.350
So you've heard the
head, mix, and chest.

00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:12.920
That's the three
descriptions of what

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.810
we experience acoustically.

00:58:14.810 --> 00:58:16.960
That's what that is.

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:21.490
But it's really just a function
of the pitch resonances,

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:22.420
really.

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:25.070
That's a pitch resonance thing.

00:58:25.070 --> 00:58:27.090
Yes, my tenor.

00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:29.990
AUDIENCE: I'm vaguely aware
of professional singers, not

00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:32.330
necessarily opera singers,
who have to go on rest

00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:35.470
or they drink fancy tea
or weird stuff happens.

00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:38.710
Physiologically,
what's going wrong?

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:39.710
SHERI GREENAWALD: Well--

00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:40.810
AUDIENCE: It's all in our head.

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:41.220
SHERI GREENAWALD: That's right.

00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:42.178
It's all in their head.

00:58:42.178 --> 00:58:43.270
Usually, it is.

00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:44.415
Well, it's so interesting.

00:58:44.415 --> 00:58:46.870
My speech therapist friend
always says, remember,

00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:48.580
a singer is a human being.

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:51.950
And human tissue is
a lot more delicate

00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:56.700
than a piano string, for
instance, or the cat gut

00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:58.260
that the cellist plays on.

00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:01.600
So we are dealing
with living tissue.

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:08.870
And so singers get obsessed
about that sensation.

00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:11.930
Every singer has their fetishes.

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:15.670
I had one baritone friend.

00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:18.280
You'd walk into
his dressing room,

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:21.570
and there would be little
towel in the middle.

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:23.780
And all the brushes
were neatly laid out.

00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:27.120
And this was his fetish.

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:27.980
This is my prep.

00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.920
Now, my room wasn't
anything like that.

00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:34.330
However, I went through
my phase of Ricola tea,

00:59:34.330 --> 00:59:36.780
where I dropped
about 10 Ricola drops

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:38.870
into a canister of hot water.

00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:41.200
And that was the Ricola
tea for the night.

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.620
Singers will experience
things like cotton mouth.

00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:46.720
You if you get nervous,
all of a sudden,

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.540
you feel like your mouth
has just dried up entirely.

00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:53.170
So the good thing about
Coca-Cola and Ricola tea

00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:55.310
is that they've
got sugar in them

00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:57.320
and they'll stimulate
your saliva.

00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:00.490
So that helps you keep
a sense of moisture.

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:02.930
And of course, you
have to stay hydrated.

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:03.870
That is critical.

01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:07.544
Because you are bringing
a lot of hot air.

01:00:07.544 --> 01:00:08.930
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:10.281
A lot of hot air in and out.

01:00:10.281 --> 01:00:11.780
There's a lot of
hot air in and out.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.540
So you are drying tissue.

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:17.580
So staying hydrated
is very critical.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:21.942
I don't know any singer--
I'm an old singer

01:00:21.942 --> 01:00:24.460
and I'm still traveling
with my water bottle.

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:28.650
So we just get
obsessed with water.

01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:30.660
That's what we do.

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:32.720
And it's just
because we're human.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.620
We have to be.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:34.310
That's it.

01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:37.560
But every singer has a
fetish about their routine

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:40.380
coming into the theater.

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:43.540
So it's always amusing.

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.980
I always am amused, anyway.

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:48.670
Anyone, yes?

01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:50.670
AUDIENCE: What was the
most challenging language

01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:53.550
to sing in?

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:55.390
SHERI GREENAWALD: I
love singing in Russian.

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:57.020
I loved Russian.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:02.260
Actually, I never found
any of the languages

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:05.430
thus far too difficult. I
love singing in Spanish.

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:11.490
Italian was my least
favorite, actually.

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:13.370
Oddly, I loved
singing in German.

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:14.750
I loved Russian.

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:15.850
I like the consonants.

01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:17.220
Ahh.

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:19.130
I like consonants.

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:20.860
And of course, I spoke French.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:22.815
I lived in France.

01:01:22.815 --> 01:01:24.610
I love singing in French.

01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:27.530
But yeah, there was
nothing, no language

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:31.320
that I ran into in my end of
the business that frustrated me.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.310
I liked them all.

01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:35.130
I was always fascinated by them.

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:37.890
I mean, any singer probably
has this weird vocabulary

01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:39.510
because you have
words that you've

01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:42.650
learned in a particular
language that are so fitting.

01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:45.551
Like, I'm always calling-- I
have to even stop and think

01:01:45.551 --> 01:01:46.050
in English.

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:49.360
The litter box-- to
me, that's the bakje.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.074
That's a Dutch term, the bakje.

01:01:52.074 --> 01:01:52.990
That's a perfect word.

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:54.160
It's short, succinct.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.950
You don't have to
say "litter box."

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:57.180
That's too long.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:57.690
Bakje.

01:01:57.690 --> 01:01:58.880
There it is.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.720
So every singer
has all these terms

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:03.410
from all these other languages
that you constantly are

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:06.700
peppering your statements with.

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.190
Because you just like language.

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:09.890
Hopefully, you like languages.

01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:11.970
That's critical, as
we spoke earlier.

01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:12.492
Yes?

01:02:12.492 --> 01:02:14.200
AUDIENCE: Who's your
favorite pop singer?

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:14.820
SHERI GREENAWALD:
Favorite pop singer?

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:16.280
Oh.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.840
Well, right now, I got Tom
Petty going on in the car.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.350
I love that album,
the White Album.

01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:22.516
I called it the White Album.

01:02:22.516 --> 01:02:26.810
I don't even know what the
album is, but I love the line, "

01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:31.420
(SINGING) "You gotta have
rhino skin if you're gonna fit

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:34.500
in this world."

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.650
So I love Tom Petty.

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:37.680
I like me some Annie Lennox.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.590
Give me some Bette Midler even.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.080
Bette Midler's on tour again.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.240
I love it.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.270
I've seen her in Amsterdam.

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:48.210
I've seen her in all
kinds of places, Bette.

01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:50.560
So I like all kinds of music.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.080
Every opera singer does.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.800
Most opera singers have a lot
of rock 'n' roll on their iPads.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.380
Believe me.

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.440
They really do.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.070
They love their rock.

01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:00.440
Love to go Country
Western dancing too.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.820
Well, Country Western
singing is really nice.

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:04.260
It's a lot of twang.

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:06.210
Got a lot of good resonance
in Country Western

01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:10.130
singing, like the Country
Western singers a lot.

01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:11.940
Good twang.

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.220
Anybody in from Iowa?

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:15.430
We got a bottle of twang in it.

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:18.770
I always laughed about the Loud
family on "Saturday Night Live"

01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:21.280
because I thought
that's where I grew up.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.570
That was my family,
the Loud family!

01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:26.880
So we're very loud in my family.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.697
Anyone else?

01:03:28.697 --> 01:03:29.708
Yes.

01:03:29.708 --> 01:03:31.499
AUDIENCE: What role
outside your repertoire

01:03:31.499 --> 01:03:35.240
would you love to sing if
you had that voice type?

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:38.600
SHERI GREENAWALD:
Brunhilde, no doubt.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.300
I always say with the
way things are digitizing

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:42.940
and everybody's
doing all this stuff,

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:45.570
I said, just put on the
Birgit Nillson recording

01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:47.830
and let me at it.

01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:49.000
I was a good lip syncher.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.250
I did a lot a lip
synching as a young girl.

01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:54.220
So I'm sure I could
figure it out.

01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.840
So Brunhilde would be the role.

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:59.270
AUDIENCE: You'll have to
settle for [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:01.720
AUDIENCE: So after "Britain's
Got Talent" had Susan Boyle

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.900
and I forgot the man's name
who was a cell phone salesman

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:06.608
and then became an
opera singer, and then

01:04:06.608 --> 01:04:08.261
now with the
simulcast, my parents,

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:10.344
they're like, why go all
the way to San Francisco?

01:04:10.344 --> 01:04:13.840
I can just drive you to the
AMC and watch a movie there?

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.601
Do you think that's sparking
more interest in opera?

01:04:16.601 --> 01:04:18.517
Because I know it's very
difficult financially

01:04:18.517 --> 01:04:20.220
with arts funding and all that.

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:22.314
What do you see as the future?

01:04:22.314 --> 01:04:24.730
SHERI GREENAWALD: Well, I think
it's a double-edged sword.

01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:33.070
Unfortunately, I do feel that
a lot of all this simulcasting

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:38.470
and stuff does cannibalize the
audience for the actual opera

01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:39.240
houses.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.760
And the problem is opera is an
expensive art form to produce.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:47.080
And so if you start that, then
you won't have even the source.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.000
If you don't support
the source company,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.590
then you won't have the source
to even make your simulcast.

01:04:52.590 --> 01:04:55.030
So it's a complicated
question, and it's one

01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:57.290
that I don't think has
gotten sorted out at all.

01:04:57.290 --> 01:05:00.924
Like, I think the Met having
a simulcast a few blocks

01:05:00.924 --> 01:05:03.340
from their house, I think has
cannibalized their audiences

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:05.360
rather.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:09.180
So it's a complicated
question business-wise.

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.660
Is it good for the people?

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:12.004
Absolutely.

01:05:12.004 --> 01:05:12.670
Are you kidding?

01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:13.800
It's fantastic.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.320
Get opera.

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.550
Let people see it.

01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:19.720
You can go online and see
opera almost anywhere any time.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.440
That's amazing.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.900
But for the financials
of our business,

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.560
it's a complicated question.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:28.106
It's more complicated than
people think, I think.

01:05:28.106 --> 01:05:28.970
So yeah.

01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:29.470
Yes?

01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:31.820
AUDIENCE: So I'm more familiar
with the symphony side,

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:35.870
going [INAUDIBLE] and seeing
the vocal soloist there,

01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:37.590
and the chorus, and all that.

01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:41.812
What is the behind the
scenes for the vocal soloist?

01:05:41.812 --> 01:05:43.812
And if you had an opportunity
to go the symphony

01:05:43.812 --> 01:05:45.776
and sing something
versus the opera,

01:05:45.776 --> 01:05:49.270
other than in one you act and
in the other you generally

01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:50.686
don't, are there
other differences

01:05:50.686 --> 01:05:53.214
in performing in the two spaces?

01:05:53.214 --> 01:05:54.880
SHERI GREENAWALD: No,
I was lucky enough

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.390
I got to do both, of course.

01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:59.070
Most singers do get to do
symphonic work as well.

01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:04.280
It's not really
that much different.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.550
I mean, however, for instance,
the great Tatiana Troyanos,

01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:10.786
who was one of the
famous mezzo sopranos,

01:06:10.786 --> 01:06:15.241
I remember I was sitting in her
manager's apartment in New York

01:06:15.241 --> 01:06:15.740
City.

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:18.640
And the phone rings, and
it's Tatiana on the other,

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.770
and she's singing the Alexander
Nevksy suite with the Chicago

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:24.880
Symphony, with Schulte
conducting, right?

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.110
This is not a small profile gig.

01:06:27.110 --> 01:06:29.130
This is a big profile gig.

01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:31.970
Phone rings, and it's Tatiana.

01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:35.250
(PANICKY) I can't sit on
the stage the whole night

01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:36.850
and have people looking at me!

01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:38.500
I can't do this!

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.670
And she was completely
flipping out

01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:44.600
because she was going to
have to sit on the stage.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.340
And I've seen her on stage.

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:49.720
I saw her on stage at the San
Francisco Symphony in concert.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.150
She was completely
uncomfortable with that.

01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:55.650
As long as she had a character
to hide behind, she was fine.

01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:57.550
But the whole idea
of sitting on stage

01:06:57.550 --> 01:07:01.030
as yourself was really
freaky for some singers.

01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:02.810
So I would say that
that's the difference.

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:06.612
It's that you are more yourself
when you're doing a concert.

01:07:06.612 --> 01:07:08.320
Of course, at the
opera, you are involved

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.560
in a complete
character development.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:15.790
So it's more naked singing
symphonic pieces, in a way,

01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:16.460
if you will.

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:19.190
It feels more naked, in a way.

01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:22.110
So some people are better
suited to that than others.

01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:23.342
Like I said, help!

01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:28.640
But that didn't bother me.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.730
Happy to deliver my
message wherever.

01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:33.070
I love singing "The Messiah."

01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:36.400
I loved singing that down.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.310
My favorite recording
of "The Messiah"

01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:42.060
is one with the great
dramatic tenor John Vickers.

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:45.345
Because I always say, when
John Vickers opens the thing

01:07:45.345 --> 01:07:50.837
and goes, comfort
ye, you go, yes, sir.

01:07:50.837 --> 01:07:52.920
There's no doubt you're
going to comfort yourself.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.440
Yes, sir.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:53.690
I will.

01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:54.189
I will.

01:07:54.189 --> 01:07:55.034
I will.

01:07:55.034 --> 01:07:56.700
And the great thing
about that recording

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:59.560
is it's the great Birgit Nilsson
singing the soprano solos.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:00.310
It's hilarious.

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:01.960
It's one of my
favorite recordings.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.520
This giant dramatic
voice like, rejoice!

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.200
And it's like heaven on a stick.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.817
You've got to love it.

01:08:08.817 --> 01:08:10.400
But I would say
that's the difference.

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.870
It's that you feel
more naked when

01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:15.410
you're out there as a
soloist than in a symphony.

01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:20.979
And so many symphonic disasters
in that little stupid things

01:08:20.979 --> 01:08:23.300
will happen like
my girlfriend, who

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:25.550
was singing "The Messiah"
with me at the San Francisco

01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:29.729
Symphony, the conductor
had changed the order

01:08:29.729 --> 01:08:30.970
of a few of the pieces.

01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:34.954
And so during one
thing, she got up.

01:08:34.954 --> 01:08:36.745
And I'm sitting there
going, wait a minute.

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:41.574
Don't-- And then she smiled
very nicely and sat back down.

01:08:41.574 --> 01:08:42.719
It's like, OK.

01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:43.229
OK.

01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:45.604
And one of my favorite stories,
my friend Neil Rosenshein

01:08:45.604 --> 01:08:47.689
loves to tell this
story about himself.

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:50.479
He was singing "Loge"
in some final scene

01:08:50.479 --> 01:08:54.729
of-- must have been "Valkyrie,"
or maybe "Goetterdaemmerung."

01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:57.090
Might have been
"Goetterdaemmerung," actually.

01:08:57.090 --> 01:08:59.899
"Goetterdaemmerung" it was.

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:03.120
And he had one line to sing.

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.580
He was an apprentice
artist there,

01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:11.090
and they filled in all the
smaller roles in this scene.

01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:14.180
And he too, he said, I got
up and the conductor didn't

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:17.050
cue me, and I sat back down.

01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:18.460
Those are my favorite stories.

01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:20.090
I like those.

01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:21.410
Whoops.

01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:21.910
Oh, well.

01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:23.180
Sorry, sorry.

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.760
There's nothing worse than
you make a wrong entrance

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.000
and you-- whoa.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.370
(SINGING) Now, I think I'm now!

01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:33.040
Here I am now, all right.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.887
Hopefully, a conductor's there.

01:09:34.887 --> 01:09:35.970
You know a good conductor.

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:37.310
They got a good left hand.

01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:39.340
Shh.

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:40.200
Now.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.779
That's what they
do-- stick a hand up.

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:44.364
Stop you.

01:09:44.364 --> 01:09:45.630
Now.

01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:49.136
But a good conductor has that
independent hand, you know?

01:09:49.136 --> 01:09:52.150
He can keep this tempo going
and this one stopping you.

01:09:52.150 --> 01:09:53.900
I don't know that I'd
be that coordinated,

01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:56.920
but anyway, a good conductor
can do that though.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.340
Thank goodness they're there.

01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:02.180
Anybody else?

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.540
It's fun singing.

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.520
Please, come to the opera.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.060
Support us one way or the other.

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:13.800
Go to the simulcast, but
coming live is even better.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.430
I always refer back to
this wonderful statement

01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:18.740
by a friend of mine
who's a doctor.

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:22.710
He's a radiologist in
the St. Louis area.

01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:25.050
And he was on the board
of the St. Louis opera.

01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:30.450
So I said to him, Doc, why is it
you're so obsessed with opera?

01:10:30.450 --> 01:10:32.620
And he said when
I'm in that theater,

01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:35.250
and that voice
comes, and hits me

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:37.870
in the chest, that's
what I love and that's

01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:39.240
what I'm addicted to.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.210
So you can't have that,
I'm afraid in the theater.

01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:46.297
That's a live experience, and I
hope you come in and enjoy it.

01:10:46.297 --> 01:10:47.880
KRISTIN GENIS-LUND:
Thank you so much.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.180
SHERI GREENAWALD: Thank you.

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:50.180
KRISTIN GENIS-LUND:
Everybody, you're wonderful.

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:50.880
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.030
SHERI GREENAWALD:
You're welcome.
