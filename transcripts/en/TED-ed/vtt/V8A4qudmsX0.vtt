00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.640
Take a series of still, sequential images.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.800
Let's look at them one by one.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.960
Faster.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.256
Now, let's remove the gaps,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.480
go faster still.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.440
Wait for it ...

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.576
Bam!

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.800
Motion!

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.976
Why is that?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.536
Intellectually, we know we're just looking
at a series of still images,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.496
but when we see them change fast enough,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.096
they produce the optical illusion
of appearing as a single, persistent image

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.360
that's gradually changing
form and position.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.456
This effect is the basis
for all motion picture technology,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.176
from our LED screens of today

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.056
to their 20th-century
cathode ray forebearers,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.215
from cinematic film projection
to the novelty toy,

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.096
even, it's been suggested,
all the way back to the Stone Age

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.120
when humans began painting on cave walls.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.016
This phenomenon of perceiving
apparent motion in successive images

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.416
is due to a characteristic
of human perception

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.576
historically referred
to as "persistence of vision."

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.816
The term is attributed

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.816
to the English-Swiss physicist
Peter Mark Roget,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.456
who, in the early 19th century,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.376
used it to describe
a particular defect of the eye

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.976
that resulted in a moving object

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.680
appearing to be still
when it reached a certain speed.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.696
Not long after, the term
was applied to describe the opposite,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.736
the apparent motion of still images,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.520
by Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau,
inventor of the phenakistoscope.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.456
He defined persistence of vision
as the result of successive afterimages,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.216
which were retained
and then combined in the retina,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.936
making us believe that what we were seeing
is a single object in motion.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.856
This explanation was widely accepted
in the decades to follow

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.976
and up through the turn
of the 20th century,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.296
when some began to question
what was physiologically going on.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.336
In 1912, German psychologist
Max Wertheimer

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.976
outlined the basic primary stages
of apparent motion

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.256
using simple optical illusions.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.096
These experiments led him to conclude

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.920
the phenomenon was due to processes
which lie behind the retina.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.616
In 1915, Hugo MÃ¼nsterberg,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.056
a German-American pioneer
in applied psychology,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.936
also suggested that the apparent motion
of successive images

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.496
is not due to their being
retained in the eye,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.440
but is superadded
by the action of the mind.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.096
In the century to follow,
experiments by physiologists

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.496
have pretty much confirmed
their conclusions.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.856
As it relates to the illusion
of motion pictures,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.576
persistence of vision
has less to do with vision itself

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.856
than how it's interpreted in the brain.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.416
Research has shown that different aspects
of what the eye sees,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.696
like form, color, depth, and motion,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.296
are transmitted to different areas
of the visual cortex

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.216
via different pathways from the retina.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.736
It's the continuous interaction

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.856
of various computations
in the visual cortex

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.136
that stitch those different
aspects together

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.056
and culminate in the perception.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.936
Our brains are constantly working,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.696
synchronizing what we see,
hear, smell, and touch

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.016
into meaningful experience

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.616
in the moment-to-moment
flow of the present.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.816
So, in order to create the illusion
of motion in successive images,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.856
we need to get the timing of our intervals

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.720
close to the speed at which our brains
process the present.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.936
So, how fast is the present
happening according to our brains?

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.176
Well, we can get an idea

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.656
by measuring how fast
the images need to be changing

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.896
for the illusion to work.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.896
Let's see if we can figure it out
by repeating our experiment.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.976
Here's the sequence presented
at a rate of one frame per two seconds

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.416
with one second of black in between.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.656
At this rate of change,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.776
with the blank space
separating the images,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.936
there's no real motion perceptible.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.256
As we lessen the duration of blank space,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.016
a slight change in position
becomes more apparent,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.496
and you start to get an inkling
of a sense of motion

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.920
between the disparate frames.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.720
One frame per second.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.800
Two frames per second.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.920
Four frames per second.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.616
Now we're starting
to get a feeling of motion,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.576
but it's really not very smooth.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.816
We're still aware of the fact
that we're looking at separate images.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.760
Let's speed up. Eight frames per second.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.680
12 frames per second.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.240
It looks like we're about there.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.936
At 24 frames per second,
the motion looks even smoother.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.760
This is standard full speed.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.816
So, the point at which we lose
awareness of the intervals

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.416
and begin to see apparent motion

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.120
seems to kick in at around
eight to 12 frames per second.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.776
This is in the neighborhood
of what science has determined

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.896
to be the general threshold
of our awareness

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.216
of seeing separate images.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.656
Generally speaking,
we being to lose that awareness

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.056
at intervals of around
100 milliseconds per image,

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.216
which is equal to a frame rate
of around ten frames per second.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.616
As the frame rate increases,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.776
we lose awareness
of the intervals completely

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.720
and are all the more convinced
of the reality of the illusion.
