00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:11.380
Intro...yay

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.700
Depression can be difficult to explain

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.979
Like any mental illness it feels different for every person

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.250
But we at Psych2Go on to bring people together to will share their experience and maybe even help others out

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.890
So we asked our readers and viewers

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.479
Who has experienced depression and how would you explain what it feels like to others?

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.739
Here we've made a list of 16 analogies for Depression

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.619
Disclaimers some submissions have been edited for length and/or Clarity number one

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.649
It's like you have weights built into your arms and legs

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.909
They're heavy and they make any basic activity feel like I'm dragging around dumbbells that are too much for me number, two

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.100
It's like you're screaming and pain

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.980
But there's no sound coming out of you number three my depression feels like a black hole

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.390
But you're not in the black hole you are the black hole your mind

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.820
Is. It sucks in anything that might make you feel emotion, and it turns it into darkness

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.430
nothingness

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.330
number four

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.740
Depression feels like I'm in black and white and the rest of the world is in color

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.389
I can't be a part of it. No matter how much I might want to I don't belong

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:30.209
Number five it's like a prison without bars. You're trapped by an invisible force preventing you from being happy

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.590
Number six, it's like the waves of the ocean

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.539
Sometimes the waves recede and you see the beautiful sand with the pretty sea shells

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.909
Soon the tide will come and swallow all that beauty up and drag it away from you

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.859
What helped me fight that feeling is knowing that the waves will recede again?

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.370
number seven for

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.560
Me, it's like a heavy mist

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.240
Sometimes it's far enough away, but at other times it presses me down

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.270
it can enter your body and lungs brain stomach and limbs everything feels sick as

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.689
if you haven't had fresh air in a while, and it's

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.300
exhausting and frustrating

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.510
Number eight to me. It's completely like the dementors from Harry Potter's Jk

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.569
Rowling's representation of that struggle was on point

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.800
number nine the fog that lingers in the early morning, sky

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.850
Never completely fading always present and blurring your vision

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.449
Number ten it feels like being in the middle of a large body of water without seeing shores

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.529
Something tugs at your leg, and you struggle to keep your head above the surface you gasp and struggle

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.860
But it's exhausting and tiring and frightening at the same time

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.730
sometimes you truly doubt if you'll ever make it out of there if the thing tugging on your leg will ever let go

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.010
number 11

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.099
To me it feels like being snowed in by an avalanche you're disoriented

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.379
And you don't know which way is up so you dig tirelessly in the wrong direction while being starved of oxygen

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.610
Everything around you is cold and looks the same

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.439
Number 12 it's a weight on your chest holding you down

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.300
No matter what you do. It stays there, and it spreads throughout your body and everything else takes more effort than ever

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:33.460
Number thirteen it's like trying to run underwater. It's exhausting and annoying and it gets you nowhere

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.770
number Fourteen

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.930
For me Depression was an old TV that lost its signal all

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.880
colorful images turned into noisy strange black and white mess of Spots

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.980
All of the good things I'd lost and all the bad things I've still got

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.860
Sounds turned into buzzing noises and my favorite things everything I liked turned invisible

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.410
number 15

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.130
It's like all of the Joy was sucked from my body

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.129
In my chest is nothing only emptiness, and I'm bearing the weight of the world on my shoulders

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.520
Everything that I loved makes no sense anymore

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.209
The only thing I want to do is crawl into the darkest corner of my room curl up and cry even though

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.569
I'm ill crying won't help is just feeling nothing at all

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.390
number 16

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:34.399
The feeling of being chained around your neck connected to all of your fears and getting tugged around ruthlessly until you choke

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.860
And that's our list

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.449
maybe you can use one of these to explain your problems to the people in your

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.020
surroundings who have trouble understanding what you're going through if

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.630
