00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:03.428
- [Instructor] So let's
say we have a sheep

00:00:03.428 --> 00:00:05.500
and it is hungry.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.836
So that is my sheep.

00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:10.626
My best, quick drawing of a sheep

00:00:10.626 --> 00:00:12.748
and it is just following the grass

00:00:12.748 --> 00:00:15.419
wherever it finds good grass to eat

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.687
and so in pursuit of tasty grass,

00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:22.020
it first goes 10 kilometers to the east,

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:26.941
10 kilometers east

00:00:28.553 --> 00:00:31.053
and then it takes a right turn

00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:35.590
and then it goes five kilometers south,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.340
five kilometers south

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.609
and then it takes another right turn

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:44.192
and it goes 10 kilometers west,

00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:48.354
10 kilometers west.

00:00:50.873 --> 00:00:55.040
My question to you is how
far has this sheep traveled?

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.860
And pause the video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.527
How far has that sheep traveled?

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:08.242
Alright, now let's try
to answer this together

00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:10.272
and it's a little bit of a trick question

00:01:10.272 --> 00:01:13.761
because depending how
you interpret the idea

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:16.167
how far something has traveled,

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:19.391
there could actually be
two valid answers here.

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:20.371
One answer is you could say

00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:23.608
what is the total distance traveled?

00:01:23.608 --> 00:01:25.120
So let me write this one down.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.134
This is an important concept.

00:01:27.134 --> 00:01:28.551
Distance traveled

00:01:31.303 --> 00:01:34.375
and this would be the
total length of its journey

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:37.032
or the total length of its path.

00:01:37.032 --> 00:01:40.546
So the distance traveled in this situation

00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:44.213
would be 10 kilometers
plus five kilometers,

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:50.198
plus five kilometers plus 10 kilometers,

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:56.162
plus 10 kilometers which
would give us 25 kilometers.

00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:00.070
That would be 25 kilometers.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.659
So some of you all might have said

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.386
that the sheep traveled 25 kilometers.

00:02:05.386 --> 00:02:06.693
If that's what you came up with,

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:11.556
what you calculated is the
total distance traveled.

00:02:11.556 --> 00:02:14.334
Now, some of you might have
said, wait, hold on a second,

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:16.214
the sheep was here before

00:02:16.214 --> 00:02:19.355
and then it ends up right over here

00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:21.155
at the end of its journey

00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:24.067
and so its change in position
is it would have moved

00:02:24.067 --> 00:02:26.412
a net five kilometers south.

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:28.462
From this point to this point

00:02:28.462 --> 00:02:31.629
would have been five kilometers south.

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.089
It doesn't matter what
it did along the way,

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.673
what its path was.

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:40.016
At the end of the day, it
ended up five kilometers south

00:02:40.016 --> 00:02:44.265
of where it started out and
this would also be a valid way

00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:46.557
of saying how far it traveled

00:02:46.557 --> 00:02:49.974
and this notion is known as displacement.

00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:56.141
So the displacement would
be in this situation

00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:57.974
five kilometers south.

00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:01.916
So pause this video.

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:05.768
What do you think is the
definition or the difference

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:09.161
between saying the
distance something traveled

00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:11.161
versus its displacement?

00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:15.997
Well, as we mentioned, the
distance something travels

00:03:15.997 --> 00:03:18.703
is the entire length of its journey.

00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:22.870
It's the entire path and this
thing will never be negative.

00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:28.745
You could travel zero kilometers
but as long as you are,

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:32.444
your position keeps changing,
this thing will only increase

00:03:32.444 --> 00:03:35.589
because it's the total
length of your path.

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:39.844
Your displacement is
your change in position

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:41.965
and since it's a change in position,

00:03:41.965 --> 00:03:45.245
not only will we mention
the five kilometers,

00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:47.081
we'll say in what direction.

00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:50.558
The position of the sheep
has changed five kilometers

00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:52.027
to the south.

00:03:52.027 --> 00:03:53.819
So let me write this down.

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.236
This is total length of path,

00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:01.241
total length of path is
the distance traveled

00:04:04.943 --> 00:04:09.737
while the displacement is
the change in position,

00:04:09.737 --> 00:04:11.320
change in position.
