00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.327
All right, I'm now sharing a Googler
shopping list with Frank, Jenny,

00:00:04.327 --> 00:00:05.320
and Abe.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.000
The sharing feature is pretty slick.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.090
&gt;&gt; I'm glad you like it.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.115
It certainly wasn't an easy
road to get to this point.

00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:12.970
Let's take a look at what we've
accomplished in the wire frames.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.760
At the start of version 0.4, we added
some basic sorting functionality to make

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.790
it easier to find shopping lists.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.760
&gt;&gt; This helped users
organize their lists.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.980
But what we really needed was sharing.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.410
After some prophetic guidance,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.820
we decided to go with a denormalized
data structure that would support

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.260
our need for
quick look ups of users' shopping lists.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.340
This increased the amount
of data we were storing but

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.230
ultimately saved the users time.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.735
&gt;&gt; Right, and after that data change,
you were able to make a sharing flow.

00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:41.660
Where users added other
users to a friends list, and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.720
then turn sharing on and off.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.770
&gt;&gt; Furthermore, we simplified this
flow by adding auto complete search

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.390
functionality when
typing in user emails.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.350
&gt;&gt; Great work.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.040
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.610
And now I'm off to do
some guerilla marketing.
