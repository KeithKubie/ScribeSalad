four and using all four fours you have
 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.180
four and using all four fours you have
to create using the mathematical

we're doing level one for Falls will be
all the you're allowed to use is

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750
all the you're allowed to use is
 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.720
all the you're allowed to use is
addition subtraction multiplication and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
addition subtraction multiplication and
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.380

well let's start at naught and we're

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
well let's start at naught and we're
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.040
well let's start at naught and we're
going to link it to one and we added two

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050
going to link it to one and we added two
 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.800
going to link it to one and we added two
so it was not how do you get four fours

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810
so it was not how do you get four fours
 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.299
so it was not how do you get four fours
tweaked we'll north it's kind of easy

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
tweaked we'll north it's kind of easy
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.690
tweaked we'll north it's kind of easy
you can go four minus four plus four

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700
you can go four minus four plus four
 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.479
you can go four minus four plus four
minus four that's not brilliant

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489
minus four that's not brilliant
 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.069
minus four that's not brilliant
we've got naught okay let's at the four

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079
we've got naught okay let's at the four
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.770
we've got naught okay let's at the four
falls again to equal one well we could

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780
falls again to equal one well we could
 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.110
falls again to equal one well we could
do 4/4

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
do 4/4
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.350
do 4/4
now that's one plus four minus four or

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
now that's one plus four minus four or
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.340
now that's one plus four minus four or
we could have done four divided by four

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350
we could have done four divided by four
 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.860
we could have done four divided by four
divided by four divided by four which is

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870
divided by four divided by four which is
 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.439
divided by four divided by four which is
1 divided by 1 which is 1 again that's

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
1 divided by 1 which is 1 again that's
 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.090
1 divided by 1 which is 1 again that's
one there are also different ways and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
one there are also different ways and
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.470
one there are also different ways and
they get a little bit more complicated

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
they get a little bit more complicated
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.229
they get a little bit more complicated
and we can give you two and we can carry

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
and we can give you two and we can carry
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.320
and we can give you two and we can carry

can make every number up to infinity
 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.850
can make every number up to infinity
it's a fantastic little proof and we're

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
it's a fantastic little proof and we're
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.200
it's a fantastic little proof and we're
going to get next we need to actually be

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
going to get next we need to actually be
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.780
going to get next we need to actually be
really clarifying the operator sir we

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
really clarifying the operator sir we
 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.840
really clarifying the operator sir we
can get up to 10 just with these plus

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850
can get up to 10 just with these plus
 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.929
can get up to 10 just with these plus
minus multiplication and division to get

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
minus multiplication and division to get
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.740
minus multiplication and division to get
up to 20 we need to introduce some other

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
up to 20 we need to introduce some other
 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.240
up to 20 we need to introduce some other
things what we need to introduce is

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250
things what we need to introduce is
 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.499
things what we need to introduce is
concatenation which means that just like

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509
concatenation which means that just like
 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.399
concatenation which means that just like
we've got 4 4 4 4 we can bring them

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
we've got 4 4 4 4 we can bring them
 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.440
we've got 4 4 4 4 we can bring them
together so we can actually bring them

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
together so we can actually bring them
 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.770
together so we can actually bring them
together and consider that say 44 we

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
together and consider that say 44 we
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.840
together and consider that say 44 we
introduce a decimal point so one of

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850
introduce a decimal point so one of
 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.639
introduce a decimal point so one of
these could be 0.4 and we introduce the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
these could be 0.4 and we introduce the
 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.760
these could be 0.4 and we introduce the
factorial which means it's 4 times 3

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770
factorial which means it's 4 times 3
 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.570
factorial which means it's 4 times 3
times 2 times 1 and also we need the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580
times 2 times 1 and also we need the
 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.860
times 2 times 1 and also we need the
square root

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
square root
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.320
square root
so square roots for w-2 you might think

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330
so square roots for w-2 you might think
 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.839
so square roots for w-2 you might think
well that's spoiling this other this was

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849
well that's spoiling this other this was
 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.660
well that's spoiling this other this was
a beautiful simple puzzle but actually

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670
a beautiful simple puzzle but actually
 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.610
a beautiful simple puzzle but actually
factorial concatenation vessel and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620
factorial concatenation vessel and
 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.650
factorial concatenation vessel and
square roots are really basic they're

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660
square roots are really basic they're
 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.839
square roots are really basic they're
kind of in our basic armory so I think

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849
kind of in our basic armory so I think
 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.820
kind of in our basic armory so I think
that's fine well how far can we do with

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830
that's fine well how far can we do with
 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.890
that's fine well how far can we do with
all of these we can definitely get up

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900
all of these we can definitely get up
 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.190
all of these we can definitely get up
all the way to 50 higher than 60 we get

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200
all the way to 50 higher than 60 we get
 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.080
all the way to 50 higher than 60 we get
up pretty high we get up to 100 but in

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090
up pretty high we get up to 100 but in
 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.750
up pretty high we get up to 100 but in
fact we need to start introducing other

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760
fact we need to start introducing other
 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.449
fact we need to start introducing other
ones and I'll shade someone one of the

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459
ones and I'll shade someone one of the
 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.580
ones and I'll shade someone one of the
ones that doesn't work with all these is

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590
ones that doesn't work with all these is
 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.020
ones that doesn't work with all these is
say 99 I'm going to show you how to do

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
say 99 I'm going to show you how to do
 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.920
say 99 I'm going to show you how to do
99 99 there are different ways to do

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930
99 99 there are different ways to do
 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.080
99 99 there are different ways to do
this but this is the one I quite like it

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090
this but this is the one I quite like it
 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.670
this but this is the one I quite like it
all depends which is an assembly you're

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680
all depends which is an assembly you're
 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.190

going to do 4 over 4 as a percentage is

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200
going to do 4 over 4 as a percentage is
 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.280
going to do 4 over 4 as a percentage is
a hundred minus 1 is 99 so that's quite

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290
a hundred minus 1 is 99 so that's quite
 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.259
a hundred minus 1 is 99 so that's quite
a clever way and the good fun thing

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269
a clever way and the good fun thing
 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.119

because actually the logs that we need

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560
because actually the logs that we need
 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.250
because actually the logs that we need
is log base 4 cool I'm cool that's it

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260
is log base 4 cool I'm cool that's it
 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.809
is log base 4 cool I'm cool that's it
before and we're also going to use a log

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819
before and we're also going to use a log
 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:00.860
before and we're also going to use a log
base 1/2

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870
base 1/2
 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.300
base 1/2
there's your breeze refresher on what a

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310
there's your breeze refresher on what a
 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.190
there's your breeze refresher on what a
log is ok so if a equals B to the C then

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200
log is ok so if a equals B to the C then
 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.550
log is ok so if a equals B to the C then
C log base B of A equals C so that's

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560
C log base B of A equals C so that's
 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.530
C log base B of A equals C so that's
basically the same thing let's put some

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540
basically the same thing let's put some
 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.969
basically the same thing let's put some
numbers in because we're going to be

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979
numbers in because we're going to be
 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.949
numbers in because we're going to be
doing log 4 so 4 is equal to 4 to the 1

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959
doing log 4 so 4 is equal to 4 to the 1
 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.029
doing log 4 so 4 is equal to 4 to the 1
okay

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039
okay
 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.200
okay
it's 4 to 1

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210
it's 4 to 1
 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:34.400
it's 4 to 1
for so the log base 4 of 4 is 1/16 is 4

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410
for so the log base 4 of 4 is 1/16 is 4
 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.490
for so the log base 4 of 4 is 1/16 is 4
squared so the log base 4 of 16 equals

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500
squared so the log base 4 of 16 equals
 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.600
squared so the log base 4 of 16 equals
264 equals 4 cubed so log base 4 before

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610
264 equals 4 cubed so log base 4 before
 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.939
264 equals 4 cubed so log base 4 before
equals 3 but can you see there's a

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949
equals 3 but can you see there's a
 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.730
equals 3 but can you see there's a
pattern here basically log to base 4 of

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740
pattern here basically log to base 4 of
 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.999
pattern here basically log to base 4 of
4 to the N equals n n doesn't have to be

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009
4 to the N equals n n doesn't have to be
 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.600
4 to the N equals n n doesn't have to be
a whole number so the square root of n

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610
a whole number so the square root of n
 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.939
a whole number so the square root of n
is the same thing as n to the half

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949
is the same thing as n to the half
 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.860
is the same thing as n to the half
so let's translate that here we've got

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870
so let's translate that here we've got
 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.870
so let's translate that here we've got
log to base 4 of the square root of 4

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880
log to base 4 of the square root of 4
 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.149
log to base 4 of the square root of 4
which is actually log base 4 of 4 to the

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159
which is actually log base 4 of 4 to the
 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.700
which is actually log base 4 of 4 to the
1/2 equals 1/2 and let's do the square

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710
1/2 equals 1/2 and let's do the square
 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.460
1/2 equals 1/2 and let's do the square
root of the square root of n which is

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470
root of the square root of n which is
 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.240
root of the square root of n which is
the same thing as n to the 1/2 times 1/2

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250
the same thing as n to the 1/2 times 1/2
 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.149
the same thing as n to the 1/2 times 1/2
which is the same thing as n to the

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159
which is the same thing as n to the
 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.770
which is the same thing as n to the
quarter we get log base 4 of square root

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780
quarter we get log base 4 of square root
 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.980
quarter we get log base 4 of square root
of the square root of 4 equals log the

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990
of the square root of 4 equals log the
 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.200
of the square root of 4 equals log the
base 4 equals 1/4

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210
base 4 equals 1/4
 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.730
base 4 equals 1/4
now you're going to carry on because

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740
now you're going to carry on because
 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.499
now you're going to carry on because
although I say log base 4 square root

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509
although I say log base 4 square root
 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:43.820
although I say log base 4 square root
the square root the square root of 4

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830
the square root the square root of 4
 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.570
the square root the square root of 4
equals logs to base 2 of 4 becomes 1 x

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580
equals logs to base 2 of 4 becomes 1 x
 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.439
equals logs to base 2 of 4 becomes 1 x
equals 1/8 so we are half the way there

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449
equals 1/8 so we are half the way there
 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:52.820
equals 1/8 so we are half the way there
to proving the fall 4 to infinity

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830
to proving the fall 4 to infinity
 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.339
to proving the fall 4 to infinity
because what was actually done we've got

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349
because what was actually done we've got
 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:56.930
because what was actually done we've got
two fours we know that this expression

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940
two fours we know that this expression
 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.620
two fours we know that this expression
here we know log 4 the square root of 4

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630
here we know log 4 the square root of 4
 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.959
here we know log 4 the square root of 4
is half log thought the square root of

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969
is half log thought the square root of
 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.659
is half log thought the square root of
the square root of 4 is 1/4 so we know

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669
the square root of 4 is 1/4 so we know
 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.260
the square root of 4 is 1/4 so we know
that just using two fours we can get the

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270
that just using two fours we can get the
 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.999
that just using two fours we can get the
Hartness to having sequence which goes

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:11.009
Hartness to having sequence which goes
 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.860
Hartness to having sequence which goes
half quarter aches so we've got two

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870
half quarter aches so we've got two
 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.110
half quarter aches so we've got two
fours left and let's see how we can get

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120
fours left and let's see how we can get
 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.520
fours left and let's see how we can get
there another bit of paper we're going

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530
there another bit of paper we're going
 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.200
there another bit of paper we're going
to do all on this next bit of paper we

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210
to do all on this next bit of paper we
 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.249
to do all on this next bit of paper we
had log 4 of 4 to the N is n it's

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259
had log 4 of 4 to the N is n it's
 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.610
had log 4 of 4 to the N is n it's
actually the same whatever we have here

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620
actually the same whatever we have here
 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.080
actually the same whatever we have here
that would be the same log 1/2 1/2 to

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090
that would be the same log 1/2 1/2 to
 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.529
that would be the same log 1/2 1/2 to
the N equals n right and so let us now

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539
the N equals n right and so let us now
 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.350
the N equals n right and so let us now
try to find the log base 1/2

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360
try to find the log base 1/2
 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.119
try to find the log base 1/2
of these things here what I'm going to

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:39.129
of these things here what I'm going to
 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:43.469
of these things here what I'm going to
do the answer is always log base 1/2 of

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479
do the answer is always log base 1/2 of
 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:51.719
do the answer is always log base 1/2 of
1/2 that's 1 log base 1/2 of 1/4

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:51.729
1/2 that's 1 log base 1/2 of 1/4
 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:53.820
1/2 that's 1 log base 1/2 of 1/4
ok we get to fourth to do that is the

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830
ok we get to fourth to do that is the
 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:00.589
ok we get to fourth to do that is the
same thing as log base 1/2 of 1/2

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599
same thing as log base 1/2 of 1/2
 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:06.809
same thing as log base 1/2 of 1/2
squared which equals to log base 1/2 of

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:06.819
squared which equals to log base 1/2 of
 

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:13.589
squared which equals to log base 1/2 of
an X is log base 1/2 of 1/2 cubes which

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599
an X is log base 1/2 of 1/2 cubes which
 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:25.679
an X is log base 1/2 of 1/2 cubes which
equals 3 so we know that two fools goes

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:25.689
equals 3 so we know that two fools goes
 

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:28.140
equals 3 so we know that two fools goes
into here and then here in a here we

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.150
into here and then here in a here we
 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.700
into here and then here in a here we
just need to find a way of expressing

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:29.710
just need to find a way of expressing
 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:35.610
just need to find a way of expressing
log base 1/2 with poofles so we need to

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:35.620
log base 1/2 with poofles so we need to
 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.830
log base 1/2 with poofles so we need to
find a way of dressing 1/2 in two fours

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840
find a way of dressing 1/2 in two fours
 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.839
find a way of dressing 1/2 in two fours
but half is obviously 2 over 4 but that

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:42.849
but half is obviously 2 over 4 but that
 

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:47.369
but half is obviously 2 over 4 but that
same thing as root 4 over 4 so here we

00:07:47.369 --> 00:07:47.379
same thing as root 4 over 4 so here we
 

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:51.119
same thing as root 4 over 4 so here we
can say that log to the base root 4 over

00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:51.129
can say that log to the base root 4 over
 

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:59.430
can say that log to the base root 4 over
4 of log 4 root 2 is 1 because that is

00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440
4 of log 4 root 2 is 1 because that is
 

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.610
4 of log 4 root 2 is 1 because that is
1/2 and that's log 1/2 and so that's 1

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:02.620
1/2 and that's log 1/2 and so that's 1
 

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.740
1/2 and that's log 1/2 and so that's 1
so you use all four all of them so I've

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:04.750
so you use all four all of them so I've
 

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.170
so you use all four all of them so I've
got all 4 Falls earlier I showed you how

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:07.180
got all 4 Falls earlier I showed you how
 

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.450
got all 4 Falls earlier I showed you how
you can use a full force to make one in

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:09.460
you can use a full force to make one in
 

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.059
you can use a full force to make one in
a very very simple way you pull divided

00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:12.069
a very very simple way you pull divided
 

00:08:12.069 --> 00:08:15.269
a very very simple way you pull divided
by 4 plus 4 minus 4 is 1 but you can

00:08:15.269 --> 00:08:15.279
by 4 plus 4 minus 4 is 1 but you can
 

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:18.029
by 4 plus 4 minus 4 is 1 but you can
also do it here log to the root 4 over 4

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:18.039
also do it here log to the root 4 over 4
 

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:21.510
also do it here log to the root 4 over 4
of long to the base full of root 4 is 1

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520
of long to the base full of root 4 is 1
 

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.240
of long to the base full of root 4 is 1
but log to the base 4 over 4 of log base

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:27.250
but log to the base 4 over 4 of log base
 

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.950
but log to the base 4 over 4 of log base
4 on the square root of the square root

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960
4 on the square root of the square root
 

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.420
4 on the square root of the square root
of 4 equals 2 so this will expand out

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:33.430
of 4 equals 2 so this will expand out
 

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.149
of 4 equals 2 so this will expand out
and there are many square roots times

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159
and there are many square roots times
 

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.759
and there are many square roots times
you put there is equal to the number so

00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:38.769
you put there is equal to the number so
 

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:39.930
you put there is equal to the number so
you think is like what you just give you

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:39.940
you think is like what you just give you
 

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.639
you think is like what you just give you
put a billion square roots times where

00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:41.649
put a billion square roots times where
 

00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:43.709
put a billion square roots times where
you get do you yeah if you have a bit of
