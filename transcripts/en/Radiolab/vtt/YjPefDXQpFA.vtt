WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:02.890
Oh wait, you're listening.

2
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.750
<v 1>You are listening to radio lab radio from W N Y S C</v>

3
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.130
three two one. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

4
00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:25.970
This is radio Lauder for today. Do, do, do, do. Yeah.

5
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.360
We're going to begin with a conversation we had actually quite awhile ago.

6
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.230
I would benefit from a little bit of framing about kind of what we're like our

7
00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:35.840
goal of this session. Sure. We can frame it, uh,

8
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.740
can make you blab a lot and then we edit it later. Right. That's kind of it.

9
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.430
It's a conversation that we had with a reporter.

10
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.790
I see someone we used to work with. Yeah. X intern. Yeah.

11
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.460
One of our great interns has gone off in the world. Amy O'Leary is her name.

12
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.320
Amy O'Leary is her name. Uh, she at the time was a New York Times reporter,

13
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.470
but he's now the editorial director of upworthy.

14
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.410
<v 2>Um, so this started actually, uh, through a personal interest.</v>

15
00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:03.710
So I was in a relationship with an alcoholic and um, was very open about that,

16
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:06.580
talked about it with all my friends and we opened with him about it too. Yeah.

17
00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:10.170
I mean, I would say he was in some denial and, but yeah, it was,

18
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.490
I mean I regularly would tell him, hey,

19
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:14.740
like you have a problem with this and you know,

20
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.570
and he would be clear back and say, you know,

21
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:19.360
if you're gonna make me choose between me and vodka, I'm gonna Choose Vodka.

22
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.080
So you would say that. And you're lucky to say that once. Yeah. Wow. And I was,

23
00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:26.800
you know, young, but every night after 11 o'clock, my life became,

24
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.030
<v 1>without getting into a lot of detail, there were fights, arguments,</v>

25
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.220
<v 2>a lot of rage and I didn't know what to do and felt really out of control.</v>

26
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:35.881
And you know,

27
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:39.600
I had been to Allen on meetings and just seemed like this like terrible,

28
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:41.340
tragic problem that like a really smart,

29
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:43.620
cool person would turn really awful on you.

30
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.660
<v 1>But then one day Amy found yourself in Barnes and noble on Union Square,</v>

31
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.810
<v 2>Union Square. Think I'm on the third floor.</v>

32
00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:52.810
And there was a table of mostly self help books.

33
00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:55.210
And there was this one called the end of my addiction.

34
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.680
She picked it up. This book was super fascinating.

35
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:03.440
It was the memoir of a French cardiologist,

36
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.670
this French doctor who had had his life completely ruined by alcoholism and I

37
00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:11.570
looked at it and I f I probably stood there like feet glued to the floor and

38
00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:13.220
just like read 70% of the book.

39
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.250
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

40
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.380
<v 4>the book described in very vivid detail,</v>

41
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.530
this successful doctor just sliding off the rails. He'd been in, you know,

42
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.490
detoxes and medical treatment facilities, you know,

43
00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:27.520
upwards of a half dozen times. His practice had fallen off.

44
00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:29.590
He was losing everything in his life.

45
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.920
At one point he describes this terrifying moment of waking up in the back of a

46
00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:36.640
taxi. Blood all over himself does know whose blood it is,

47
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.100
does know where he's going. He was totally desperate.

48
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.910
<v 2>He killing himself was the next option.</v>

49
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.890
And then at one point he says that he had read this tiny nugget, New York Times,

50
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.860
and this is like the early nineties I think, barely.

51
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:52.800
He'd stumbled across this short piece about a guy who had been addicted to

52
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:57.660
cocaine taking some muscle relaxes and his cravings for cocaine completely

53
00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:00.190
ceased. It was just one guy, one guy's experience,

54
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.360
but he saw that and he basically just felt like, well I might as well try this.

55
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.070
I'm just going to experiment on myself.

56
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.900
So he gets the drug starts taking it and he slowly like doses up,

57
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:11.783
<v 5>uh,</v>

58
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.790
<v 4>more and more amounts of the drug. Nothing happens, nothing happens.</v>

59
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.080
And then at one point he says

60
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.970
<v 2>the switch flipped</v>

61
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.830
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

62
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.240
<v 2>and once the switch hit you just became absolutely indifferent to alcohol. Boom.</v>

63
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.260
Yup.

64
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.430
Apparently this obsessive need for alcohol that had burdened him his entire life

65
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.180
just went away. Total indifference. What is the drug called, by the way?

66
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.480
Baclofen. P. A. C. L. O. F. E. N. Baclofen.

67
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.830
Amy says at this point, standing there in the Barnes and Nobel,

68
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.680
she was interested, skeptical but interested. Yeah. So I,

69
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.030
I've found an email address with like you do as a reporter.

70
00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:53.940
I googled every combination of his name til I found some little dot,

71
00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:57.120
fr email address and emailed him and he, you know,

72
00:03:57.121 --> 00:04:00.990
he wrote back right away and they set up a time to talk. You know, I'm already,

73
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:03.090
we have it planned in advance. I confirm it with them.

74
00:04:03.091 --> 00:04:06.780
I'm all set up at my desk in New York and he picked up and I was like,

75
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.330
you and Dr Emison and how are you? It's so good to speak with you.

76
00:04:09.331 --> 00:04:13.590
And he iMusic Amy, Amy, I'm so sorry. I'm rescuing my girlfriend.

77
00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:17.070
We are in the Alps. I'm carrying her down a mountain side. Can I call you back?

78
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.500
Did you hear wind in the background and, and the sound of a,

79
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.280
I heard no sound effects. No, no. But he,

80
00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:29.990
he did seem like he was exerting themselves to some, some extent. So, you know,

81
00:04:29.991 --> 00:04:31.470
we schedule a second appointment

82
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.393
<v 7>and</v>

83
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.500
<v 2>um, you know, I've recorded the phone call.</v>

84
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.460
<v 7>Hello? Hello. Is this Dr Emison? Yes. Is Amy? Yes. Amy. And like, hi Ed.</v>

85
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:45.330
Nice to talk to you. And then like miracles happened either way.

86
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.640
The last time we spoke I was, I was rescuing my girlfriend like God,

87
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.430
it was like a hit sprayed it, it doesn't make me a,

88
00:04:52.431 --> 00:04:55.520
we were in Switzerland in that 10,000 feet.

89
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.930
<v 2>So he launches into the mountain story and then</v>

90
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.490
<v 7>wrong. And this kind of goes off. Yeah.</v>

91
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.860
<v 8>When Moses opened direct,</v>

92
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.180
see people paid for the miracle [inaudible] fame like me to become who you are

93
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.140
and I am who I am. When did Einstein might have been wrong and

94
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.090
the Einstein was right and I mean to do the whole Rubinstein told me he's never

95
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:18.800
heard of can expect me. He's her ground man. He knows her.

96
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.680
I'll wait for tico data if comes to new bet. You never know.

97
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.160
People tell me you may have made the discovery of inquiry.

98
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:26.940
I mean there was no way

99
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.460
<v 2>he like literally went on for 20 minutes before I got in.</v>

100
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.880
I wanted to ask you with a little question.

101
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.230
You know I read your book I think close to when it first came out in the United

102
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.380
States.

103
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.030
<v 8>Oh really? Yeah. It's really makes a thriller. I mean it's fun.</v>

104
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.220
I mean then he was off again instead of times read it cause [inaudible] went to

105
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.720
Seattle and I see that. Did that not happen?

106
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.250
But I mean if you look in the back you don't [inaudible]

107
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.620
<v 2>then like literally it was 20 minutes of how important our shared was to like</v>

108
00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:58.454
save the world.

109
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.880
<v 1>You see red flags going off left and right.</v>

110
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.350
And I sort of started to downshift my thought of doing a story.

111
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.710
And right about this time my reporting group got disbanded,

112
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:11.720
do it and do to an internal reorganization.

113
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:14.870
And so I moved to a different desk and it was just like, okay,

114
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.760
maybe somebody radio lab will be interested in cause we'll eat anything.

115
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.600
<v 2>No. In all fairness, Dr. Mason who unfortunately passed away a few years ago,</v>

116
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.230
uh, may have been in the middle of a manic episode,

117
00:06:29.231 --> 00:06:32.490
which doesn't necessarily negate his, to the story he was telling him. No, no,

118
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.460
no. And uh, even after dropping the story, Amy as,

119
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.580
as a journalist and as someone who had been personally affected by alcoholism,

120
00:06:39.581 --> 00:06:40.840
I was incredibly torn.

121
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.680
As a journalist you have to be skeptical of everything,

122
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.450
but at the same time,

123
00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:49.330
like wouldn't it be great if we lived in a world where you could

124
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.930
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

125
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.180
<v 2>deal with this problem, which, you know, tears apart.</v>

126
00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:57.240
So many lives kill so many people,

127
00:06:57.241 --> 00:07:02.241
creates all kinds of pain and agony with like a medication that just seems

128
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.460
great. Yeah.

129
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:06.543
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

130
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.920
<v 2>and like the question for me is like,</v>

131
00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:12.760
we often see addiction as like this thing that you've got a morally conquer,

132
00:07:12.761 --> 00:07:17.200
like a spiritual calamity that you've got to somehow reorganize your entire

133
00:07:17.201 --> 00:07:20.530
being in order to get through. But what if it's not that way?

134
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.593
<v 1>What if it's,</v>

135
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.220
what if it's simply a switch in your brain that got stuck in the on position and

136
00:07:26.221 --> 00:07:29.850
you can use a pill to just switch it right off. Oh, be nice.

137
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.460
Now we were super skeptical of this idea,

138
00:07:32.461 --> 00:07:34.830
but we also couldn't stop thinking about it. Yeah,

139
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.930
so recently we started making some calls. Hi, it's Anna Rose Childress.

140
00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:40.764
I'm all here.

141
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.890
Dr. Anna Rose Childress is an addiction researcher at the University of

142
00:07:43.891 --> 00:07:48.390
Pennsylvania and Amy pointed us to her because it was her work that actually

143
00:07:48.391 --> 00:07:50.730
inspired Dr. Mason. I don't know if you mentioned throbbing,

144
00:07:50.731 --> 00:07:53.040
pulsing desire states, but somehow that comes to mind.

145
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.990
So that's their specialty, throbbing,

146
00:07:54.991 --> 00:07:58.230
pulsing desire states and that sounds great.

147
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.690
She spoke with a producer,

148
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.300
Andy Mills and I in the studio and for decades she has been studying that

149
00:08:03.301 --> 00:08:06.390
craving state and addiction. She's interviewed people about it,

150
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.350
but what patients described to me is that they would sometimes describe as sort

151
00:08:10.351 --> 00:08:11.700
of a wave of sensation,

152
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.420
<v 10>some enormous wave just pulsates throughout your whole body.</v>

153
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.030
<v 1>Go from their toes, up to their head and back down. Yeah.</v>

154
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.910
<v 10>My toes to my head, to my toes, to my head, my zoom,</v>

155
00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:26.690
a zoom room, rushing, pulsating.

156
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.100
<v 1>Okay. One day in 1995 she's at a conference,</v>

157
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:35.750
she bumps into a guy who tells her he has managed to get some rats addicted to

158
00:08:35.751 --> 00:08:39.050
cocaine, give them Baclofen, and they totally lost interest in the coke.

159
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:43.580
They were disinterested for several hours. So I saw this and I thought, wow.

160
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.690
So she began to give back often to people who were addicted to crack small

161
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:51.590
doses. And initially there was a lot of disappointment. Results weren't great.

162
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.800
Then she says, one day she was sitting in the staff lounge, just chilling,

163
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.430
<v 2>and a colleague granted and said, you know, there's this,</v>

164
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.700
this guy over at the hospital next door, and you know, Anna was,

165
00:09:03.701 --> 00:09:06.280
you've got to talk to him. So when the desire,

166
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.950
his name was Ed Coleman is a paraplegic. He had had a drug deal gone wrong,

167
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.380
been shot in the neck, paralyzed from the waist down.

168
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:15.300
So he was in a wheelchair taking baclofen.

169
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.080
<v 11>I was having more bed space</v>

170
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.540
<v 2>because he was having these spasms in his legs and he recounted this to me and I</v>

171
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:22.680
actually have the tape of it.

172
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.730
Low dose at first and that was 10 milligrams four times a day.

173
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.210
And then you upped the dose. Tell me why you upped the dose,

174
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:30.741
<v 11>the dose,</v>

175
00:09:30.741 --> 00:09:35.741
because from that 10 10 dose was a tear in the muscle spasm

176
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.560
was to just tidy up shame. So I said,

177
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.530
well maybe if I take two [inaudible] with them.

178
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.020
When did you notice

179
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:54.080
<v 2>what Edward found was that when he doubled his baclofen dose,</v>

180
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.550
<v 11>I would try to use cocaine</v>

181
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.700
and facts that really cool.

182
00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.010
<v 2>King no longer had the high</v>

183
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.230
<v 11>when I was taking it, I didn't have any cravings.</v>

184
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:07.990
<v 2>No,</v>

185
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.690
he then went on to tell her that when he stopped taking baclofen cause he did

186
00:10:10.691 --> 00:10:11.620
stop for two days.

187
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.880
<v 11>I was having bad spasms. The leg spasms came back,</v>

188
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.220
but I was getting the full effect.

189
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.100
<v 2>They could get the high again and the craving went through the ceiling.</v>

190
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.693
<v 12>Ooh.</v>

191
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.500
<v 2>So Edward had been doing his own experiments. He had doubled the dose.</v>

192
00:10:28.501 --> 00:10:32.130
He had have the dose to see what was the dose where he could still feel the

193
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:35.340
cocaine high, but his spasms wouldn't be driving him crazy. Wow.

194
00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:38.580
So he was like a one man study. Yeah, no.

195
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:42.940
This was actually the specific story that inspired Dr. Mason to do his one man

196
00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:44.190
study and to write that book,

197
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.260
which held Amy glued to the floor in Barnes and noble. Now,

198
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.580
even though none of this was rock solid science by any means,

199
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.740
Amy says that since then,

200
00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.010
those people have begun to quietly take this drug in some doctors if you're

201
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.130
going to prescribe it. You know,

202
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.200
I talked to a guy who runs a halfway house in Youngstown, Ohio,

203
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:08.130
who is using Baclofen with people that were under his care and there was a

204
00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:12.480
doctor in Chicago who was prescribing it to a lot of people that this is all off

205
00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:14.690
label use. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. She still does it.

206
00:11:14.691 --> 00:11:16.680
After Mason's book message boards popped up,

207
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.220
hundreds of people on these boards swapping stories about how much they took

208
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:24.690
when they took it. They were crowdsourcing their own cure in effect.

209
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:29.110
But the really surprising thing is it, as we kept calling around,

210
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:33.370
we realized that Baclofen was just the tip of the iceberg.

211
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.260
<v 13>Yes, yes. Well, there's another drug, uh, a camper Seder, Camp Hall,</v>

212
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:42.020
and this other drug Gabba Pinton. There's to pyramid or Topamax, a dice cell.

213
00:11:42.021 --> 00:11:45.440
Fran Chantix, suboxone, naltrexone, buprenorphine.

214
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:46.910
This is doctor Mark Willan brain.

215
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.060
I'm an addiction psychiatrist here in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

216
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.320
Mike says that some of these drugs try to target the craving trend,

217
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.190
blocked the craving.

218
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.570
<v 1>Others tried to target the high that you get. The simple way to put it as this,</v>

219
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.470
it's a buzzkill. It's a buzzkill. Interesting. So you drink,

220
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:05.050
but you don't get the, you don't get the happy warm feeling.

221
00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:07.310
<v 14>[inaudible]</v>

222
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:08.780
<v 1>apparently it takes all the fun out of it.</v>

223
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.780
According to one journalist that we talked to, Gabrielle Glazer,

224
00:12:11.781 --> 00:12:14.780
who does a ton of reporting about mental health and addiction tech,

225
00:12:14.781 --> 00:12:15.800
my six 30 pill.

226
00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:20.420
She tried one of these drugs during the course of reporting and honestly it made

227
00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.480
a second glass of wine seem about as enjoyable as a big glass of Dimetapp.

228
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:31.130
Why didn't you really, it was, it was just, it was like drinking water. The why.

229
00:12:31.131 --> 00:12:33.140
What is the drug supposedly doing? Well,

230
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.830
it blocks opioid receptors in the brain, which is our pleasure system.

231
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:41.000
According to Dr Dr. Wilson Brain. What basically, if you think of like,

232
00:12:41.001 --> 00:12:45.110
if you think of a good buzz as a initially as like a chemical handshake,

233
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:50.590
like you've got the alcohol molecules and they need to click in with the

234
00:12:50.721 --> 00:12:54.050
receptors in your brain and that's what creates ultimately the good feeling,

235
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.350
right? What these, what this category of drugs do is they,

236
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.120
they get in the middle of the handshake,

237
00:12:59.121 --> 00:13:02.730
they sort of like a blanket prevent the hands from shaking or muffled them sort

238
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.690
of. Right. And if you're not getting as much enjoyment out of the drinks,

239
00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.920
then the idea is you're not going to drink as much and these are home run drugs

240
00:13:09.921 --> 00:13:14.480
that you didn't do use are drugs that you just don't see these kinds of effects.

241
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.480
Uh, in medicine in hardly anything.

242
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:22.550
Mark pointed us to some studies that have been done in Finland, the Netherlands,

243
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.350
the UK, Iran,

244
00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.830
a bunch that have been done in the u s they look at this one particular drug

245
00:13:27.831 --> 00:13:32.000
called Naltrexone and show that it has a very high success rate.

246
00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:36.440
Like one particular study in Finland with about 150 people showed that this drug

247
00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:41.441
had a 78% success rate in helping very heavy drinkers reduce their drinking to

248
00:13:42.531 --> 00:13:44.050
normal levels. Right, right.

249
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:51.470
So are these drugs being used? No. No.

250
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.010
Basically the pickup has been near zero.

251
00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.070
This is something that we heard over and over again.

252
00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.130
These drugs are out there that there's, there is some evidence that they work,

253
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.600
but they're kind of invisible. Yes, exactly. That's real glazer.

254
00:14:05.601 --> 00:14:06.890
Again here,

255
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.820
about 1% of people who suffer from alcohol use disorder are ever given the

256
00:14:13.371 --> 00:14:18.100
choice or an option to take any sort of medication. She has been maybe one,

257
00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.620
2% at best. Yes. Which is particularly weird. She says,

258
00:14:21.621 --> 00:14:24.590
because that drug now tracks on that was using the finished study that did well,

259
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.220
it's been out for a while.

260
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:32.250
This drug was approved by the FDA in 1994 and by the core purpose of treating

261
00:14:33.161 --> 00:14:37.100
alcoholics. Wow. Wow. We never heard about it. That's so weird.

262
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.480
Why wouldn't we've heard of that? Well, that's a very complicated question.

263
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.950
Should, it's sorta hard to pin down,

264
00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:45.970
but there has basically just been this psychic barrier that we've all had to

265
00:14:45.971 --> 00:14:50.260
seeing addiction as something a pill can help. I mean, just look at Med schools.

266
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.670
I think there are something around 140

267
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:57.670
<v 2>medical schools in the United States and only 14 medical schools.</v>

268
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.940
Was there a single course in addiction medicine.

269
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.670
That number has since gone up a little bit, but not a lot.

270
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:07.310
And so we asked her why would that be? And she said, well,

271
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.930
it's just the addiction treatment has never really been part of the rest of

272
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:14.840
medicine. It has been completely segregated.

273
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.820
It's been its own self contained world.

274
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.140
And this actually goes back to how it was set up at the very beginning.

275
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:23.840
And this I found fascinating. If you go back about 80 years,

276
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:28.430
we had in hospitals at the time in the late 1930s and early 1940s we had but

277
00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:32.150
white plague, tuberculosis, TB words.

278
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.430
But then suddenly after World War II, t TB, how to cure,

279
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.570
you got better.

280
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.440
You didn't have to stay in the hospital in the sanitarium just took recover and

281
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.230
suddenly these TB units were empty.

282
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.060
And she says it was just a few years earlier that a group of mostly men had

283
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.480
gotten together to form alcoholics anonymous.

284
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:54.970
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

285
00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:59.260
<v 1>no, at the time doctors had no idea what to do with alcohol addicted people.</v>

286
00:15:59.261 --> 00:16:03.730
They were called drunkards in me. Brit was another word that was commonly used.

287
00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:05.860
They are basically seen as hopeless cases.

288
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.720
And of course the founders of AA knew this.

289
00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:10.300
So when they saw all those MTTB wards,

290
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.630
they went to the hospitals and said,

291
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.980
let's make those alcoholism units in your hospital.

292
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.750
Really? Yes. Doctors fought. Okay, we don't have an answer for these guys,

293
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.970
so we'll just let them, we'll let them do it.

294
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:29.740
And thus began 80 years of separation.

295
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:35.050
And that's where we are now. Out of this physical separation, according Gab,

296
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.200
Gabrielle Glazer, you got a cultural separation,

297
00:16:38.201 --> 00:16:41.590
two very different ways of seeing addiction. Cultural. All right,

298
00:16:41.591 --> 00:16:43.780
what does that mean? Just to state it in the extremes.

299
00:16:43.781 --> 00:16:46.780
On one hand you've got like someone in the medical sciences who might be

300
00:16:46.781 --> 00:16:50.470
inclined to see addiction as a purely biological phenomenon. You know,

301
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.100
that's all this is and we'll just fix it. We'll just fix it. On the other hand,

302
00:16:54.101 --> 00:16:55.720
you have other, the idea that there is no,

303
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.380
that you can't just fix this biologically. There's something deeply wrong here.

304
00:16:59.381 --> 00:17:01.450
There's something in the person, in the spirit,

305
00:17:01.451 --> 00:17:05.170
in the soul is a reflection of your inner broken self. Yeah.

306
00:17:05.171 --> 00:17:07.930
Which just has to be addressed at a higher level

307
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.570
<v 2>in the AA curriculum. Um,</v>

308
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.760
I may have my facts wrong. I believe five out of the 12 steps mentioned,

309
00:17:16.761 --> 00:17:20.840
God actually when we checked, it's six out of the 12th half. And the big book,

310
00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:23.390
which is the Bible of, of alcoholics anonymous,

311
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.700
there's a mention of God or him or your higher power on almost every page.

312
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.550
What is the recovery rate from the AA crap. Well,

313
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:36.410
what many researchers say is that the success rate of AA is in the single

314
00:17:36.411 --> 00:17:37.244
digits.

315
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:42.550
One study show that for every 100 people who show up in an AA meeting on January

316
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.330
1st,

317
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:49.100
only five of those people will be sitting there on December 31st of the same

318
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.460
year in that same year.

319
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.210
<v 1>Really? So then, yeah, so the, what you call that the dropout rate is,</v>

320
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.560
is 95%. Yeah. I was really surprised to find that out.

321
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:03.630
Now to be fair. Hmm. I think we should be fair. We have to say that. Um,

322
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.950
a couple things like first of all, a is a, is a volunteer organization.

323
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.810
It's a support group, doesn't claim to be a treatment.

324
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.570
And also when you start talking about success rates, uh,

325
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.980
that gets really squishy. I mean, if a person doesn't show up today a beating,

326
00:18:16.981 --> 00:18:19.080
it doesn't necessarily mean that they're drinking. Again,

327
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.290
they may be doing just fine or perhaps they have switched groups. They've moved.

328
00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:26.280
Exactly. So it's really, really hard to sort of define your terms here.

329
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.420
Clearly a is important to a lot of people and that's something that actually

330
00:18:30.421 --> 00:18:34.050
Gabrielle Glazer found out last spring when she published an article in the

331
00:18:34.051 --> 00:18:37.560
Atlantic where she basically laid all this out. When that article came out,

332
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.700
I received thousands of emails. You are a horrible person.

333
00:18:41.701 --> 00:18:43.770
You deserve to die. A saved my life.

334
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.020
I hope your kids get killed by drunk drivers.

335
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.500
But so there was this article in the Atlantic and April when we talked to Dr

336
00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:53.760
Willing brain who a glazer mentioned in the article is somebody who believes

337
00:18:53.761 --> 00:18:57.240
more in medication than 12 step. He said that when that article came out,

338
00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.650
<v 13>since then, our phone is ringing off the hook.</v>

339
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.580
We got about half of our calls from out of state.

340
00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:08.910
Is there anybody in North Carolina or in New York or in Texas or in California

341
00:19:09.971 --> 00:19:11.770
or wherever it is, and they're desperate.

342
00:19:11.771 --> 00:19:16.330
And the families are desperate for an alternative and they can't find one.

343
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.730
He says all of this makes him think back about 30 years. When I was a resident,

344
00:19:21.731 --> 00:19:26.020
there was this debate raging. Um, there was this big debate about depression,

345
00:19:26.021 --> 00:19:28.570
whether people should be treated with antidepressants,

346
00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.050
but he says the debate completely shifted and we go,

347
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.380
it comes to Prozac. When we got Prozac,

348
00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.380
doctors have prescribed Prozac to 2 million Americans.

349
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.000
<v 1>Suddenly you had this drug that was a massive success,</v>

350
00:19:41.001 --> 00:19:45.350
spawned other drugs and in the process changed how people fundamentally see

351
00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:45.950
depression.

352
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.810
<v 13>And now most people, you know,</v>

353
00:19:47.811 --> 00:19:52.130
get treatment for anxiety or depression with antidepressants compared to

354
00:19:52.131 --> 00:19:55.190
psychotherapy. Do you think we're heading in the same place with addiction? Oh,

355
00:19:55.191 --> 00:19:57.650
we are. Oh, we are. We are. There's no question.

356
00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.920
I do predict in 10 or 15 years we'll have a Prozac moment.

357
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:14.203
<v 3>Okay.</v>

358
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.970

I love getting to talk with you on my show every single day.

364
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.900
But when the cameras stopped rolling, the conversation isn't over for,

365
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.000
I decided to start a podcast in order to dive deeper into the issues and ideas

366
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:55.690
that I love sharing with you. It's health unfiltered.

<v 17>[inaudible]</v>

371
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.910
<v 1>all right, welcome back. I'm Jad Robert, and if you know this music,</v>

372
00:21:20.911 --> 00:21:25.770
you already know it's the Brian Lehrer show on Wny C. Good morning everyone.

373
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:30.960
This is the Brian Lehrer show at our own home station. Wny C in New York.

374
00:21:30.961 --> 00:21:33.840
Very, very popular show. Yes. And A to explain,

375
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:38.730
we wanted a gut check cause we'd been hearing all of these, uh,

376
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.780
things from experts saying that we're undergoing a sea change and a,

377
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.560
we're going to know is that actually happening out there in the world and the

378
00:21:46.561 --> 00:21:49.740
world, at least our local world is full of Brian Lehrer listeners.

379
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.150
It's your stories of what kinds of treatment you were offered and actually used

380
00:21:54.151 --> 00:21:56.310
for alcohol and substance abuse.

381
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.350
So we asked the Brian Layer team if they would help us out,

382
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.240
call us at two one two, four, three,

383
00:22:00.241 --> 00:22:04.850
three and they helped us out big toe and we'll explain more now with Radiolab.

384
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.680
Hosts get up a broad hijack. Hey Brian, thank you for having me on.

385
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:12.450
And you believe we're in the midst of a cultural and medicinal shift for the way

386
00:22:12.451 --> 00:22:15.660
we both view and treat people with addictions, right? Yeah.

387
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:19.320
So I mean we were not sure to be totally honest. You know,

388
00:22:19.321 --> 00:22:23.370
we bumped into a reporter a couple of years ago who told us the story of a guy.

389
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.930
So I sorta summarized a Amy O'Leary story about Dr. Mason.

390
00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.380
He described a moment where the addiction just switched off.

391
00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.840
Then I sort of summarize what the experts have told us.

392
00:22:33.841 --> 00:22:37.230
It may be something is happening, but we weren't sure. We're just not sure.

393
00:22:37.231 --> 00:22:41.310
And so I, we're curious to hear from people who struggled with substance abuse.

394
00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.280
So I'm wondering what sorts of treatments they've been offered.

395
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:49.110
If they have they seen pills like naltrexone or baclofen. Have they used them?

396
00:22:49.111 --> 00:22:49.980
Have they worked?

397
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:54.960
What's been the experience so listeners and just like that help Chad report this

398
00:22:54.961 --> 00:22:55.580
story.

399
00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.760
<v 16>Hi. Hi.</v>

400
00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.410
<v 18>Well, my name is Nicole. I'm calling from New Hampshire. Oh,</v>

401
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:04.420
actually in Afghanistan I've overdosed many times on heroin, cocaine,

402
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.730
so agree to year of sobriety. X month

403
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:11.860
<v 1>there was an explosion of calls, ginger and Mayo Pack. You're on w NYC.</v>

404
00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.220
<v 18>Hi, how are you?</v>

405
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:17.690
I'm an alcoholic and an addict and I've been in recovery for 18 years.

406
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.220
Sitting outside of an AA meeting for thanks to this,

407
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.900
<v 1>we hear from a lot of people who felt like this idea of a pill that can treat</v>

408
00:23:23.901 --> 00:23:26.150
addiction was idiotic.

409
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.460
<v 18>I just don't see psychotropics, vision, really a solution.</v>

410
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:32.940
There is no quick fix. There is no magical medication.

411
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:36.150
If it was just the physical disease, they would all be cured,

412
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:39.970
<v 1>but we also heard from a lot of people who had just been offered these drugs.</v>

413
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.060
<v 18>I was prescribed Campbell.</v>

414
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:46.160
I have been offering a proxy soon and I'll turn it on and it is very effective.

415
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.260
It does help cut the craving.

416
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.910
One guy who called or just so incredibly crazy that I heard the show for me as

417
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:54.420
I'm about to embark upon this,

418
00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.880
<v 19>he just got prescribed addiction medicine that morning.</v>

419
00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:59.660
<v 18>One way or another I'm going to fix this.</v>

420
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.290
<v 19>He was excited as we are a lot of the colors in this category because</v>

421
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.333
<v 18>if the shoes,</v>

422
00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:08.220
<v 19>if these pills worked for them, it kind of means that they're just sick.</v>

423
00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:09.350
They're not bad people.

424
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.750
<v 18>Well, it's not something that people choose even though it seems that way</v>

425
00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.350
<v 19>tomorrow in Manhattan. You're on Gabby land, Rice. Say hello tomorrow.</v>

426
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.440
<v 18>Hi. Yeah. Um,</v>

427
00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.980
<v 19>one caller called in to say that, uh,</v>

428
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.810
her dad had had a terrible time with alcohol. It was destroying the family

429
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:27.530
<v 18>and you know, we were thinking about putting him in rehab or something,</v>

430
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:30.870
but afraid of the stigma of it. And my mom is a doctor,

431
00:24:30.871 --> 00:24:32.450
so she was working in the hospital.

432
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.580
She told me that one day if she took matters into her own hands and she gave him

433
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:42.590
injection shots of um, something called Voltaren or you know,

434
00:24:42.591 --> 00:24:44.180
the way we say it is like [inaudible]

435
00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.370
<v 19>it's actually turns out to be a muscle relaxing,</v>

436
00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.030
not too dissimilar from baclofen

437
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:52.360
<v 18>and it's work one day. Like everything was okay and he was over it.</v>

438
00:24:52.361 --> 00:24:55.420
I mean it wasn't something that was controlling our life anymore.

439
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.730
<v 19>Well let me ask you this. Um, cause I, that's producer. Any males, again,</v>

440
00:24:58.731 --> 00:24:59.960
after the Brian Lehrer show,

441
00:24:59.961 --> 00:25:04.190
we had so many calls that he set up a Google voicemail and he talked with an

442
00:25:04.191 --> 00:25:07.430
additional 40 or so people and he asked everyone,

443
00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.520
do you feel that we're headed toward a sea change where we're going to start

444
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.370
treating addictions in a new way?

445
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:16.360
<v 18>No, I completely do. You know, you've got a drug problem.</v>

446
00:25:16.361 --> 00:25:18.460
Find the drug that fixes the drug problem.

447
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:21.910
There's no pills that will make you want to put down the drink and the truck.

448
00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:23.610
<v 20>[inaudible]</v>

449
00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:28.080
<v 19>hello Billy. Hey, will you just introduce yourself? Tell me who you are. Yeah,</v>

450
00:25:28.081 --> 00:25:31.620
and you can use my, you can use my full name if you want. My name is Billy Webb.

451
00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:35.970
I am from Shaker Heights, Ohio and I currently live in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

452
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:40.080
Hey, this is Andy. So, uh, in talking to all those people on the phone Billie's,

453
00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.930
it was the story that I just kept thinking about over and over again.

454
00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:45.390
And so eventually we ended up getting him into the studio.

455
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.720
Do you remember what it was like the first time that you had alcohol?

456
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:51.750
Yeah,

457
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:56.750
it was the summer that I turned 16 and I was a quieter kid and I was kind of a

458
00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:02.580
nerd. You might say I was into computer games,

459
00:26:02.581 --> 00:26:06.690
but then it's the tide sort of swung and I got into music and most specifically

460
00:26:06.691 --> 00:26:08.940
punk rock and sky.

461
00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.570
He says it was this time that he was coming out of his shell.

462
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.630
He learned how to play the bass, started practicing all the time.

463
00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:19.170
I made these new friends and they started a band and we were horrible,

464
00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:23.280
but we were willing to put ourselves out there and we started playing gigs and I

465
00:26:23.281 --> 00:26:27.450
had gotten my first girlfriend at that time and I was very excited and nervous

466
00:26:27.451 --> 00:26:31.260
to see her. So I figured, why not?

467
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.420
Why not loosen myself up a little bit?

468
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.480
So one day he breaks into his father's liquor cabinet,

469
00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.420
takes a couple shots of mountain gay rum. It was euphoric,

470
00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:43.500
to be honest with you. And I finally felt like I was myself. Huh.

471
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.980
And it just felt like I was on top of the world and I could do anything.

472
00:26:46.981 --> 00:26:49.290
And I had all these creative ideas that came to me.

473
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.220
I wanted to talk to people that sort of, when things started to take off,

474
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.060
by the time Billy was 24 Bios, becoming an entrepreneur,

475
00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.530
he was running his own business.

476
00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.340
It was a storage facility that he planned to convert into art spaces where we

477
00:27:02.341 --> 00:27:05.640
would have shows and maybe even a little small record shop.

478
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.080
I was in a relationship, we had a dog, he was a new band that toured.

479
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.090
It was fun. I can say that for sure.

480
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.320
I could even conduct business out of the bar down the street if I wanted to

481
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:18.300
cause the business line forwarded to my cell,

482
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.440
but he said that it was also around this time that he started to wake up in the

483
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.250
morning with the shakes and I remember drinking beer in the morning in the

484
00:27:26.251 --> 00:27:28.950
bathroom. How much do you think you were drinking at this point?

485
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:33.330
20 drinks a day. 25 sometimes. Wow. And usually the night before,

486
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.960
before I passed out or went to sleep, I would say, you know,

487
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.960
I'm going to turn it around in the morning. I'm going to,

488
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:41.610
I'm going to get out of bed and work out, eat a full meal.

489
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.860
And that never ended up happening.

490
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.880
What eventually did end up happening is that Philly asked for help,

491
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.200
both his mom and his sister,

492
00:27:49.201 --> 00:27:52.740
they flew Billy up to Minnesota where he checked into one of the best rehab

493
00:27:52.741 --> 00:27:54.900
centers in the Midwest and when I got there,

494
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.680
it looks like a small college campus. I mean it's very serene,

495
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.180
sort of peaceful setting, very welcoming. He started going to group meetings,

496
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.930
started working out and was like, alright, I, I was actually excited.

497
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.270
I thought that things would turn around when I got back.

498
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.440
But within just a day of being back in Cleveland,

499
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:17.670
it was right back to where I was 20 drinks a day, 25 sometimes.

500
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.450
So I ended up back in treatment. We figured, you know,

501
00:28:21.451 --> 00:28:24.390
I just didn't do it right the first time. So if we go back,

502
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.380
we'll get it right this time. And once again, you know,

503
00:28:28.381 --> 00:28:31.860
I crashed and burned this time. Not even in Cleveland.

504
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:35.880
I had relapsed at the airport. I didn't even make it to Cleveland and he said,

505
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:38.460
this is just how things went for years.

506
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.600
It was just the same old story of in and out, in and out.

507
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.460
In the span of about four years time,

508
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:48.450
Billy tried seven different treatment centers and detox centers.

509
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.350
Lots of AA meetings. I went to 110 meetings in 70 days.

510
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.530
I went to 28 and one week, one time nothing worked.

511
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.230
He says that his AA sponsors would tell him, you know, you can do this.

512
00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.930
She'll get it right. So we'd leave those meetings feeling positive,

513
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.400
end up at the liquor store.

514
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:06.500
I just considered myself a failure at this point in time that I was never going

515
00:29:06.501 --> 00:29:09.870
to get better and that led to more and more drinking.

516
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.490
He said that he lost his girlfriend pretty much all his friends got fired from

517
00:29:14.491 --> 00:29:15.840
his job due to drinking.

518
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:19.780
And my day is just consisted of walking to the liquor store,

519
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.690
buying two fifths and walking home. That's all I did.

520
00:29:22.691 --> 00:29:25.570
I just laid in bed and and drank.

521
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:30.220
It's hard to even think about without being completely horrified that that's

522
00:29:30.221 --> 00:29:32.080
what my life had turned into.

523
00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.320
And then I woke up one day with severe,

524
00:29:35.321 --> 00:29:40.321
severe pain in my abdomen and I couldn't move or walk or keep water down and was

525
00:29:41.321 --> 00:29:43.600
really scary and it was pancreatitis.

526
00:29:43.601 --> 00:29:48.601
So I ended up checking myself into a hospital in grand rapids and I saw these

527
00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:50.770
people and they said, wow, we don't even,

528
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:55.830
we don't see this condition until people are usually in their mid forties Billy

529
00:29:56.441 --> 00:29:59.080
was only 29 years old when I got out.

530
00:29:59.081 --> 00:30:04.081
I moved into a sober house in Saint Paul and that's when I got hooked up with

531
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:05.280
the alterior clinic?

532
00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.680
<v 21>No, at the Altair Clinic, which I should say really quick is run by Dr Mark.</v>

533
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.910
Then bring who we talked to earlier,

534
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.700
a there they do something that they call evidence based treatment,

535
00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.040
so if a patient shows up looking for help,

536
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:20.120
they are given a therapist to treat any underlying mental health conditions that

537
00:30:20.121 --> 00:30:23.330
they may have and for everything connected to their addiction.

538
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:27.530
They're given medications and Billy's case, they gave them naltrexone.

539
00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.600
When I took the Naltrexone, I actually was able to limit my drinking too,

540
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.440
<v 19>two to six drinks a night,</v>

541
00:30:35.441 --> 00:30:40.441
which was quite frankly felt like a normal amount to me.

542
00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:45.580
He was able to drink moderately? Yeah, almost overnight I was blown away.

543
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.940
That's all I wanted was to be like everyone else who can write,

544
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.020
have a couple drinks and set it down. Well what does that tell you though?

545
00:30:53.021 --> 00:30:54.610
That tells you that you are

546
00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:55.970
<v 3>okay.</v>

547
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:58.640
<v 19>Cured. I just felt like there was,</v>

548
00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.180
there was no compulsion to keep going and going. Like what? What was,

549
00:31:02.181 --> 00:31:04.970
what was different though? Like did it, did it not taste as good?

550
00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.430
It tasted as good. I can say that for sure,

551
00:31:07.431 --> 00:31:10.850
especially if it was a micro brew or something like that, but

552
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.233
<v 3>okay.</v>

553
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:17.120
<v 19>I didn't get that same brush in my head and being able to drink without that</v>

554
00:31:17.121 --> 00:31:21.860
rush for awhile. That made all the difference. For a couple months I was, okay,

555
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:23.450
you know, now I can just have a couple,

556
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.290
but what happened was I

557
00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:32.540
was taking it and then on one weekend I just decided, you know what?

558
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:36.560
You know what? I'm not going to take it this weekend. It's a long weekend.

559
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.150
I don't need it. Billy says that even though the urge to drink,

560
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.610
which was something that had been nagging at him for years,

561
00:31:43.611 --> 00:31:45.620
even though that was now gone,

562
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.910
he told me that there was just some part of him that missed being drunk.

563
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:53.000
I wanted to be to be intoxicated.

564
00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:56.900
Even with this medication that was helping you, you missed it.

565
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:05.520
Yeah. Knowing all that it costs you. What about it did you miss?

566
00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.680
I missed feeling like myself.

567
00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:14.790
<v 3>Okay.</v>

568
00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.700
<v 19>I didn't, I, I didn't. Hey guys, this is Corey. The engineer,</v>

569
00:32:17.701 --> 00:32:20.390
I hate to interrupt, but we have to the studios,

570
00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:23.430
it is being booked in like the next 10 minutes of sorry guys.

571
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.540
So with poetically bad timing, um,

572
00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:29.970
we got kicked out of the studio. Um, and this was,

573
00:32:29.971 --> 00:32:31.620
this was several months back actually

574
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.060
and it took about another month and a half before we could all get back in the

575
00:32:36.061 --> 00:32:40.100
studio again. Villi. Hey, well I uh, yeah I do. I,

576
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.990
so I started by asking him, so when you said that you didn't feel like yourself,

577
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.790
what, what did that mean? I didn't picture life being possible without alcohol.

578
00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:51.770
That's the only person that I knew.

579
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:55.520
And basically what he told me is that if you think back to the beginning of the

580
00:32:55.521 --> 00:33:00.410
story, he came out of his shell alongside alcohol being creative,

581
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.020
writing music, performing music alcohols there.

582
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.930
His first girlfriend alcohol was there.

583
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:11.080
He's had drinking associated since puberty with the best parts of himself.

584
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.431
And so like,

585
00:33:13.431 --> 00:33:17.270
you know how we all have this sense of like who we are inside of us. Like,

586
00:33:17.271 --> 00:33:18.200
you know I have like you have Vic,

587
00:33:18.201 --> 00:33:21.590
your inner Jed where like people can think what they want about you and you've

588
00:33:21.591 --> 00:33:26.030
got your reputation but like you, you've know who you are down deep.

589
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.870
Well his, it was all wrapped up in alcohol so you take that alcohol away.

590
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:34.290
What was left was an empty guy that I didn't know,

591
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:37.920
just this void and filling up that void.

592
00:33:37.921 --> 00:33:41.640
He says was this like on slot of these terrible memories,

593
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:46.710
sequestered detox words and punitive treatment and all the people I've alienated

594
00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.081
over the years,

595
00:33:50.081 --> 00:33:54.370
all the lost opportunities and all the failed attempts.

596
00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:58.090
He says that's what he would think about when he was sober and he just wanted

597
00:33:58.091 --> 00:34:02.440
not to. Last time we talked to Billy, he was doing really well.

598
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.680
I had the job, I had the girl, I had a band back,

599
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:09.190
but he says that in the course of just this month and a half since the last time

600
00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.760
that we talked last, the girl isolated a bunch of friends and lost it.

601
00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:17.800
Good job that I wanted to keep for awhile until I could get into Grad school.

602
00:34:17.801 --> 00:34:20.170
So kind of having to start over now.

603
00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:24.910
Even just listening to your voice right now. You, you, you sound so different.

604
00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.230
I know that I sound different because I was,

605
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:32.260
I was coming in here with more of a positive spirit last time. Um,

606
00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.680
I really was flying high last time.

607
00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:39.370
People were excited for me to come in and now they're, they said,

608
00:34:39.371 --> 00:34:43.370
are you sure you sure you want to come in today and talk to them? I mean, the,

609
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:46.980
the people who even talk to me right now, um,

610
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:52.330
so it's hard to do a triple back flip. You know, I tried to,

611
00:34:52.331 --> 00:34:56.290
I didn't want to come in here crying or anything, but you know,

612
00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:02.350
uh, it's pretty sad. It's pretty sad. But at the same time, you know,

613
00:35:02.351 --> 00:35:04.390
I feel hopeful that I can beat this.

614
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:07.063
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

615
00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.050
<v 21>not really. Still seeing a therapist, he's still going out here.</v>

616
00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:13.740
He's actually on this new medication now called Gabba Piton of which she says

617
00:35:13.741 --> 00:35:14.580
has been helpful.

618
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:19.050
And I know I was pretty staunchly against the 12 steps last time,

619
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.300
but I am actually going back to meetings these days.

620
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:27.150
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

621
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:29.100
<v 21>just to be with people who are in the same boat.</v>

622
00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:32.680
<v 19>So who's doing both? Yeah. Huh.</v>

623
00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:38.160
I hear a story like that and I think, yeah, I think

624
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.670
<v 1>we're ready to see addiction in a new way and we're definitely,</v>

625
00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:44.310
I think pills will be a big part of that. Seems to me.

626
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:49.740
But the pills can't get all the way down, you know? Right.

627
00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:52.920
The dark, the thing that makes the addiction go is really deep.

628
00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:56.990
And like this reminds me of, of when we were talking to Nora Volkow

629
00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:00.850
<v 2>fine. I'm director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse at the NIH.</v>

630
00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:04.870
She sort of pointed out this same idea in a really interesting way.

631
00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:08.890
One of the questions that I've always got in my brain is, um,

632
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:10.960
why do we become addicted? I mean,

633
00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:16.050
why is it that we can fall into a state where we actually become obsessed about

634
00:36:16.331 --> 00:36:18.580
something and compulsive? Um,

635
00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:23.610
despite the fact that it can have negative consequences and romantic love is

636
00:36:24.701 --> 00:36:27.010
exactly that situation. Norris is a,

637
00:36:27.011 --> 00:36:30.040
one thing that biologists know and actually have known for a while,

638
00:36:30.041 --> 00:36:35.041
is that drugs hijack systems in our brain that are there for other purposes.

639
00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:40.980
She says literally drugs will light up the same circuits in your brain that are

640
00:36:41.141 --> 00:36:43.300
usually engaged. Like when you're in love,

641
00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:45.760
when you're hanging out with your friends,

642
00:36:45.761 --> 00:36:47.950
when you know you're being hugged by your kid,

643
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:52.210
since it's almost like randomness of chemistry that you have these chemical

644
00:36:52.211 --> 00:36:56.260
compounds that can go directly and activate these,

645
00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:57.580
these centers.

646
00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:01.200
<v 1>So it hijacks the very things that make us, you know,</v>

647
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.470
good friends and good parents. Correct.

648
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:07.350
So it's like a weakness born of a strength in a way.

649
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:10.860
<v 21>Yeah. And actually, um, according to Andrew's children's,</v>

650
00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:14.530
so we had talked to earlier people with addictions,

651
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:18.750
ironically they are the fittest of the fit in evolutionary terms right there.

652
00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.410
The people who would have been earliest for the,

653
00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.100
the food earliest for the sexual partner.

654
00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.440
The idea here is that deep down inside of them,

655
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:30.520
like we're talking about a genetic level, they have the greatest sensitivity.

656
00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:34.690
They would be exquisitely attuned to the promise of rewards.

657
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:38.470
And most of the time, and for most of the Millennia,

658
00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:43.770
all the priorities were on being good reward appreciators that that was our only

659
00:37:45.071 --> 00:37:45.904
job.

660
00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:51.240
But now we're in a different environment where we've got huge opportunities for

661
00:37:51.371 --> 00:37:55.810
many sexual encounters that carry lethal viruses rather than just, you know,

662
00:37:55.811 --> 00:37:59.250
the possibility of survival of the fittest. And we've got, you know, uh,

663
00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.100
calorie dense meals that we can acquire without expanding a calorie and see,

664
00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:06.460
and almost every circumstance that you can think of except for the last,

665
00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.473
you know,

666
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:12.630
50 years being on the side of being overly responsive to reward was probably

667
00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:16.090
mostly an advantage. You know,

668
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:19.150
<v 2>that's so interesting. I've never heard it said that way.</v>

669
00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.580
And for our patients in some sense,

670
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:25.030
they're the fittest of the fit and being punished for it.

671
00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.160
<v 1>Yeah, it's like a terrible well</v>

672
00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:27.993
<v 21>joke</v>

673
00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:34.270
and the terrible reality of that joke is something that just kept showing up on

674
00:38:34.271 --> 00:38:36.040
our voicemail over and

675
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:36.873
<v 1>over again.</v>

676
00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.980
<v 8>Hello? Yes, this is pat reus.</v>

677
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:44.970
I was listening to the Brian Lehrer show 'em the way home from work today. And,

678
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.810
uh, I have a son who died of heroin addiction,

679
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.800
alcohol abuse last May.

680
00:38:53.801 --> 00:38:57.610
And since then I've been trying to come to terms with it.

681
00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:01.940
This is my son. He was a great person.

682
00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:05.210
I think he just couldn't see

683
00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:12.640
how to be sober in this world that he knew that was really hard for him.

684
00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:20.180
How do you live your life when you have to be sober?

685
00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:48.853
<v 12>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>
