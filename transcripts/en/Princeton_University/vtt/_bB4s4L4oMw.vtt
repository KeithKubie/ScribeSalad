00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.550
I am Catherine Toppin, and I graduated from
Princeton in 2002 in electrical engineering,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.810
and IÕm currently a patent attorney at Edwards
Angell Palmer &amp; Dodge in Boston, Massachusetts.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.110
ItÕs my job as a patent attorney to serve
as an advocate for inventors and companies

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.340
who own intellectual property rights.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.220
The framers of the constitution thought of
this as something that was important:

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.610
Thinking of an idea, being innovative and
then being rewarded for doing so.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.630
To be an engineer means to be an analytical
thinker, to approach problems in a very systematic

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.630
way, and to have a general level of comfort
with technology in whatever form.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.630
I definitely felt like I was at an advantage
having an engineering background going to

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.630
law school.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:47.829
Once you learn what it is that your legal
professors were expecting of you and how they

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.440
wanted you to approach legal problems it was
very, very easy to transition those analytical

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.440
skills to legal problems in law school.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.440
I feel as though engineers can do any type
of job.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.510
ItÕs just that problem-solving mindset that
is very useful in

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:17.210
a broad range of career paths.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.230
The reason I keep going and come in to work
hard every day is because I feel as though

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.120
my contribution is going to be extremely vital
to the success of other people.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.660
I have to admit that there are some personal
goals and things I would like to obtain.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.150
There are also siblings and people coming
behind me whom IÕm kind of helping to pave

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.590
the way for.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.090
I love walking to work because itÕs my personal
time. Not only is it just great exercise,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.550
but Boston is a beautiful city.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.710
It provides me with a couple hours of my day
thatÕs solely focused on me.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.480
And I also call my mom from time to time and
let her know how IÕm doing in the big city...

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.480
or the small city.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.850
IÕm very involved in the Princeton alumni
community. IÕm the president of the Association

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.590
of Black Princeton Alumni, vice president
of the Princeton Association of New England

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.420
and IÕm on the national board of the Princeton
Prize in Race Relations.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.180
IÕm not sure that any Princeton volunteer
exactly knows all the reasons they do as many

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.219
Princeton functions as they do.

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:29.849
But I have to say that Princeton is like a
big family to me. I have mentors and colleagues

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.249
who are Princetonians. Some of my best friends
are Princetonians.

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:40.230
And I just find that the network continues
to produce a number of high quality people

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.959
that you donÕt just come across every day.

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:52.219
IÕm Catherine Toppin, and IÕm a Princeton
engineer.
