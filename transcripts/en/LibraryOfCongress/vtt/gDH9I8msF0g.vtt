00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.740
&gt;&gt;Joan Weeks: good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.460
On behalf of my colleagues, and
in particular, Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.000
who's Chief of the African
and Middle Eastern Division,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.090
I'd like to extend a very
warm welcome to everyone.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.620
I'm Joan Weeks, head of
the Near-East Section,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.370
the sponsor of today's
program, and we're very pleased

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.600
to present this program on the
Icons of the Coptic Church,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.130
but before we start today's
program and introduce our speaker,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.730
I'd like to give you a brief
overview of the division

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.290
and its resources in the
hopes that you'll come back

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.820 position:56%
and do research in our reading room.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.400
This is a custodial division, which
is comprised of three sections

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.540 position:56%
that build and serve the collections

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.900
to researchers from
around the world.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.760
We cover over 78 countries and
more than two dozen languages.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.140
We have the African section, which
includes all the countries of sub-

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.100
Sahara Africa, Hebraic section,
which is responsible for Judaica

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.670
and Hebraic worldwide, and the
Near-East section, which covers all

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.560
of the Arab countries,
including North Africa, Turkey,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.330
Turkic Central Asia, Iran,
Afghanistan, and the Muslims

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.460
in western China, Russia,
the Balkans, and the people

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.230
of the Caucuses, a
very extensive reason.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.720
Now little bit about
just logistics here.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.240
After the program, we'd like to
invite you to a fill in our survey

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.590
that we placed in your seats.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.720 position:56%
This you can leave in your seats, or
at the information desk at the front

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.130
as you leave, and I'd also
like to invite you to try

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.500 position:56%
out our new Four Corners blog, where
we have curators and specialists

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.150
who give very special insight on
parts of the collections, and also,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.200
we have a Facebook page for
our area studies collection.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.310 position:56%
So both of these are a very exciting
venture for us, and we left flyers

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.960
about this, and you can
learn about other programs

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.370
by visiting our Facebook page.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.590
Also, we like to videotape
these presentations.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.430
So researchers and others
around the world can see them.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.450 position:56%
And so, in that regard, if you would
like to ask questions at the end,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.930
you're just saying and reminding
you that you are being filmed,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.940
and you're implicitly giving
your permission to be filmed.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.660
So now I'd like to call upon
my colleague, Dr. Fawzi Tadros,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.200
our Arab World Specialist,
to introduce our speaker.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.500
Thank you.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.000
&gt;&gt; Fawzi Tadros: Thank you.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.770
Ladies and gentlemen, it
is my pleasure to introduce

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.490
to you Mrs. Evelyn Rophael.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.120
Throughout the years, Ms. Evelyn
Rophael has been an active

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.010
participant in the Coptic Church.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:21.710
She has come to love and admire
the determination to survive,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.250
to keep its Christian identity
against overwhelming odds,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.910
to maintain its ancient
traditions and to honor

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.350
and venerate its heroic sense.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.240
Mrs. Rophael has painted numerous
icons, girls in the altar area

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.670
of many Coptic churches in
the USA, Canada, and Egypt.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.070
She has assisted in the
establishment of the Coptic Chapel

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.480
at St. Vladimir Orthodox
Seminary by preparing

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.890
and restoring all the
painting and painted new ones.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.020
She has illustrated 15
books on Coptic Saints

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.120
and several other children's books
concerning Coptic sacraments.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.780
Among her impressive publications,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.060
a book on one of the major
monasteries in Egypt.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.830
She has painted an estimated
600 icons over the years.

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.720
She has also presented lectures
concerning the Coptic Church

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.840
at the US government
agency that were broadcast

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.490
to government offices
around the world.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.470
Among her icons, one was used
to illustrate a Swedish book

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.190
about the Coptic Church and in
various international publications.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.420
Ms. Evelyn lives with her Egyptian
husband near the West River,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:50.890 position:56%
Maryland, enjoys almost anything
involving art, history, and science.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.510
Please join me to welcome
Miss Evelyn.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:01.510
[ Applause ]

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.120
&gt;&gt;Evelyn Rophael: it's really
such a great honor and privilege

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.200
and blessing to be here today,
and thank you all for coming.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.760
In addition to what Dr.
Fawzi Todros said about me,

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.410
I'd like to introduce
myself a little more.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:23.750 position:56%
I'm and iconographer for the Coptic
Church, which is the Orthodox Church

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.640
of Egypt, and before I went
to Egypt the first time,

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.300
I really wasn't aware of the
Christian presence in Egypt.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.050
I rented a National Geographic,
something about monks living

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.700
in the desert, and
that's all I knew.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.210
So when I went to Egypt, I was
there to see the ancient monuments,

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.310
and part of my tour of Egypt,
I was on a Nile cruise ship,

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.080
and I spoke with the captain of
the cruise ship, and he mentioned

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.690
that he was a Coptic Christian.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.720
So he was the first Coptic
Christian I had spoken with.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.020
So I married him.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.000
So anyway, I began doing
icons for the Coptic Church,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.210
and I'm going to take you through
a couple thousand years of history

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.040
of Coptic icons, and then I'm going
to talk about the icons that I do,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.590
the process behind doing an icon,
and so, get your seatbelts buckled.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.640
We're in for a 2000-year trip.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:37.560
Coptic art is a continuation of
the ancient art of the pharaohs

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.490
that has always been
a very unique art,

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.350 position:56%
always identifiable as that's Egypt.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.990
And when I was talking to some
monks about the presentation today,

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.810
I asked, what do you
think I should mention?

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.660
And they each said, you need

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.800
to mention it's a continuation
of Egyptian art.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.410
It's not something separate.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.810
It's a continuation that art
has always been unique to Egypt,

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.700
and even though it's a
different style involved,

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:19.010 position:56%
and it's a different faith involved,
it's a continuation of Egyptian art,

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:24.510
and on the screen you see kind
of that very quick continuation.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.980
The pharaonic art, and then you see
a blending of pharaonic and Roman,

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.760
and then an early Coptic icon.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.280
Ancient Egyptian art
influenced Coptic art.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:44.560
You can see that in so many of the
details of ancient and Coptic art,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.560
like the pharaonic picture
below where the god Anubis

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.050
and Tahuke are recording
the deeds of the soul.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:08:02.440
They're using a scale to weigh
the soul, and in the Coptic images

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.750
of the Archangel Michael,
you frequently see

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.820
that he's holding a scale,
and in ancient Egypt,

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:17.350
the soul of the deceased person is
shown by little winged creature.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.660
That was called the Ba.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.180
In Coptic art, well in
any of the Christian art,

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:29.160
you see the winged Holy Spirit,
and then the Egyptian ankh,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.160
which was considered a symbol of
eternal life in ancient Egypt,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.390
that was an early Coptic cross, and
even today, you see some reference

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:45.480
to it as being the Coptic
cross, an early Coptic cross.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:52.550
Ancient Egyptians were used to
seeing the image of an infant god,

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:58.050
and many scholars feel
that this was preparation

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.280
that helped them except
the new faith

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.870
of Christianity when
it came to Egypt.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:09.590
It was brought by St. Mark within
a few decades of the crucifixion

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:14.460
of Christ and over the
next couple centuries,

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:19.060
Christianity spread very
quickly throughout Egypt,

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.130
and for several centuries,
it was a Christian nation.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:29.390
Among some of the best-known
art of this period

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:36.310
of Egypt is the Fayoum mummy
portraits, which were dated

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:44.270
from about 50 BC to about 350
A.D. incredibly realistic images

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:50.140
that were done basically with hot
wax, and there's a lot of division

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:56.120
on who painted them
and for what purpose.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.090
Some say that it is Roman art.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.200
Yes, you see the, encaustic
paintings

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.450
like this throughout
the Roman Empire.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:10.340
Other say that, well,
it was Egyptian art

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.700
that may be the Romans copied.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:20.360
Some say it's Roman people who
are the subject of this art,

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.370
because it was a Roman
area at the time.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:30.100
But I look at these
pictures of these people

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:35.110 position:56%
in these very realistic portraits,
I see the faces of Egyptians I know.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:39.370
So I really feel these
were Egyptian people.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.660
I don't think they were religious
Christian images because, you know,

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.130
women are wearing nice
jewelry and everything.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.700
But look at the eyes.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.800
The eyes are very prominent.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.260
They're in large, and
that became a hallmark

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:59.010
of Coptic art, large,
expressive eyes.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:07.420
Between Fayoum and a few centuries
later, there were other encaustic,

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:13.070
again the wax, the hot wax that
was used to make portraits.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.740
My different populations in Egypt.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.130
There was a Greek population and
Syrian, and there's one like that,

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.770
and because of this network
of different populations,

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:30.790
it's hard to follow an exact line,
straight line, because again,

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.860
they didn't document everything
that so-and-so painted this,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.500
and he was from such and
such nation, but if you look

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:46.000
at this encaustic icon of St.
Peter, from the seventh century,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.020
you can see a connection to
the Fayoum mummy portraits

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.220
that were several centuries
earlier, but to me,

00:11:53.220 --> 00:12:00.220
if you look at these three small
images on top of St. Peter,

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.460
the one of St. Mary and
the one of the young man

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.270
on the left, to me they are Coptic.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.570
Now look at the eyes.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.290
The eyes are very large,
very expressive.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.840
These are Coptic.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:19.460
We see images that echo
some of the main features

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:24.260
of the Fayoum portraits but a
different style is evolving.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.610 position:56%
Here we see more of the Coptic look.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:31.650
The one on the right is from
the Codex Washingtonian,

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.430
which is an early Bible.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.410
Some say this is from
the fourth century.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:39.930
Others say this is more from
the first or second century.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.920
Notice a large eyes.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.450
They are expressive,
and the long nose.

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.110
In the Coptic art it's
with a thought

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:54.000
that the large eyes
are looking to God.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.890
The nose is long and thin.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.170
The mouth is small,
because we are not talking.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.310
We're listening to God.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:08.420
Below we see from ancient
monasteries the same large eyes.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.290
The proportions of the
body are not realistic.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:16.980
It's with the thought that
it's not the body that counts.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.800
It's the spirit, and so when
you look at Coptic icons, again,

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.130 position:56%
it's not the proportion of the body.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.740
Realism is not attempted.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:32.760
And monastic art, you find that the
icons have a or drab appearance.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.160
They're not as colorful.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.100
Obviously, the monks are
not looking for beauty.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.440
They're looking for a
statement in the icons.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:47.200
The small flask on the
right is an ancient flask.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.080
They're about this big from an
ancient monastery of St. Menas.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.840
And notice, there's
an image of the Saint.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.400
He's noticed to have his hands out
with a couple camels behind him,

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.650
and these flasks are found
as far away as Ireland,

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:09.760
in ancient archaeological
digs in Ireland.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.720
And it's not known whether
pilgrims made it to Egypt

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.490
and brought these flasks
back to them,

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:22.050 position:56%
or that monks traveled that far out.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.470
There were many nationalities

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.730
in ancient Egypt, even
in the monasteries.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:31.710
This is from the Syrian monastery,
which was owned and operated

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:38.520
by Syrian monks in Egypt, and
this is an interesting portrait

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.320
of the patriarchs Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.040
Notes they're holding little
tiny figures in their arms.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:52.830
These are representations of
the souls of the deceased.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:15:01.040 position:56%
This representation of like a heaven
and an upper level of heaven is

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.080
from an ancient monastery.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.940
Below we see St. Mary
in the infant Jesus,

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.950
and they have different
saints with them.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:16.400
But above, Jesus is in a
circle, and he has these

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.070
like flames coming
out from the sides.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.610
He surrounded by angels.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:29.140
And this is the first icon that
is showing Jesus as the King

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:34.820
of all things, and that
he's above everything.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.880
And speaking of above, we
have three representations

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.780
of Jesus here the one on
the right, the upper right,

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:47.650
is from St. Catherine's
monastery, which is in Egypt.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:53.940
It's been owned and operated by the
Greek orthodox for many centuries,

00:15:53.940 --> 00:16:00.600
but they have icons there and
manuscripts from all nations,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.520
and this one was done in
about the sixth century.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.200
It's considered the first
standard icon of Jesus

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.320
that we know still
today of that image,

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:16.370
and we don't know whether it was
done by Greek or whoever there

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.180
in the sixth century,
but if you look

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:26.280
over at the large one beside
it, you see the same face.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:32.660
And this larger one, this
is from an icon or a dome

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.060 position:56%
in an ancient church in upper Egypt.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.950
Look at the Angels.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:44.280
They're beautiful, and Jesus is
holding his hand in blessing,

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.730
and he's holding a gospel.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.900
To me, this is a beautiful
piece of work.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:56.860
On the other side is a modern
dome of a church in Egypt.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:02.120
It's a cathedral in
St. Mina Monastery.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.600
It's European, a little bit
of the Byzantine influence,

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.350
but basically, it's European art.

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:14.780
This is one of my main concerns
about the Coptic Church.

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:24.600
Instead of just really utilizing
their beautiful, ancient heritage

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.930
of Coptic art, you see a lot of
them turning to European art,

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:36.610 position:56%
and I think they shouldn't -- you
know, okay, if you want European art

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:39.170
in your home, that's fine.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.200
In the Coptic Church,
it should be Coptic art.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.750
You go to a Greek church,
it's Greek art.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.210
You go to a Russian church, it's
Russian art, and I just really,

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:54.320
really hope that the Coptic church
gets back into any new church,

00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:00.900
any new cathedral, Coptic art,
because it's worth keeping.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:06.690
These are a couple more images
of both the ancient Coptic art.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:10.460
This one on the left is
from St. Anthony Monastery.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:15.410
It's considered the oldest,
continuously habited monastery.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.490
It's on the Red Sea.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:23.500
And this is a modern translation of
the same design, the Pantocrator.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:29.520
In the mid-1700s, this was
during like the Ottoman Empire,

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.980
and somehow, and Armenian
name Johannes came to Egypt,

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:40.380
and he did hundreds and hundreds
of icons throughout Egypt.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:45.330
They're in churches and
monasteries, and they're beautiful,

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:49.860 position:56%
and they have their own unique
style, and just, the last time I was

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.240
in Egypt, I was taken
to a church that had --

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.810
it started in the fourth century,

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.950
and it had several
different chapels.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.120
Each chapel came from
different centuries,

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.170
but they had this incredible
collection

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.670
of icons by Johan the Armenian.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:13.720
Coptic iconography was
redefined during the mid-1960s

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:19.210
by two people -- well, three if
you count the couple, Badour Latif

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:25.140
and her husband Yussef
Nessif, and Dr. Issac Fanous,

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:31.730
and in the main cathedral
in Cairo the Badour Latif,

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:37.220
her icons are in the main
level at the icon stand,

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:43.070
and Issac Fanous's icons
are in a different level.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.900
So both of them are very highly
esteemed, and a few years ago,

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:52.890
I had the really great honor of
meeting Badour Latif at her home,

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:57.890
and you can see that she's working
on an icon here of St. Mark.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:02.210
She died about four years ago,
but it was really a great honor.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.000
I considered her that
someone who taught me,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.710
even though I never met
her before that point,

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:14.360
even with the modern Coptic
art, which you see on the right,

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.310
you still see the influence
from the past.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:24.640
This ancient hymnbook from 1743
showing Moses and the burning bush,

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:32.920
Isaac Fanous did this icon of the
burning bush, and he put St. Mary,

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.910
represented and it,
showing that just

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:43.100
as the flames did not consume
the burning bush, which was God,

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:49.190
that St. Mary was not consumed
by having God within her.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.650
So here we have some
nativity scenes.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.650
The one of the top left
is by Badour Latif.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:21:01.340
What I always liked about her
art was she has flowers and it.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:09.020
She has animals that it,
and just very natural,

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.320
and I always like that.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.240
I kind of reflect that in my icons.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.570
Beside hers is a nativity
by Isaac Fanous.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.780
His are very beautiful.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:28.330
His or more geometric, and I like
the placement of his figures,

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:31.680
and so I always try to just kind
of pick out what I like best

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.180
from the two styles and use that.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:42.400
Below is one by Johan the
Armenian, and his is more

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:47.330
of a Byzantine theme,
and then the one I did.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:52.910
So now we have, you know, up
into the twentieth century,

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:58.120
and now we're going to talk
about some of my icons.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.290
First of all, something
about the creative process.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:05.970
I found this on the Internet,
and yes, whatever span of time,

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:11.760
let's say I agree a I'm going
to have an icon done by the end

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.910
of the month or within
one month time.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:16.880
Okay, work begins.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.120
My husband, Wafik, will cut
the wood and prepare it,

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.350
and everything's ready to go.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.650
Okay, yes, I'll do it.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.040
It'll be ready by the
end of the month.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:31.150
The next 25 days, I'm goofing off.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.910
And then a couple days, I
like, yeah, I've really got

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:39.070
to get started, and all the work
while crying -- and I'm not crying,

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.030
I'm just kind of kicking
myself that, you know,

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:45.140
I really should've started this
earlier, and the last two days is

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.900
like hurry, hurry, hurry.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.460
So yes, the creative process.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:54.780
So when I get an assignment
for an icon,

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:58.560
I first draw out a very
rough painting or drawing.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.030
I don't really like to
do a detailed sketch.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:03.640
I just -- I don't.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:10.250 position:56%
It's a rough drawing, and I work out
placement and everything like that

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:16.760 position:56%
and what I want written on it, and I
have a few monks who are kind enough

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:22.480
to look over my Coptic and
make sure spelling is correct,

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.060
make suggestions about
the icon design itself,

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.940
and then I start painting.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:34.760
I use acrylic, because it's a paint

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.560
that works quickly,
and it dries quickly.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:46.500 position:56%
In most iconography, you find people
say that they use the Tempera paint,

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:51.670
which is with egg white and
pigments and sort of like that,

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.810
but that takes longer
to work with, and monks

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:59.790
and bishops have told me,
just get the job done.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:06.230
So okay. The Coptic art of today,

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.670
it's accepted that the
figures have round heads,

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.350
and again, the large eyes.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:16.960
And it's a simple -- it's
not trying for realism.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.670
It's a style.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:22.520
It's a simple style, and one thing
about Coptic art which I really,

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:27.920
really enjoy is that the
figures look peaceful,

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:33.620
and it's with the thought that
whatever they have suffered,

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.720
even if it's a martyr,
whatever they have suffered,

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.800
the suffering is over.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.920
They're in heaven,
and they're at peace.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:49.740
So that's one way to always, you
know, recognize a Coptic icon.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.980
The subject is at peace.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:58.440
I recently did a sign for
our church, and again,

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:05.700
you can see the process
involved, just a crude sketch.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.880
And I sent it to one of my monk
friends what I wanted to put

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.720
on the sketch, and he
nicely wrote it out for me,

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:17.560
and whatever the languages, I
always dread doing lettering,

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.780
a lot of lettering, because surely,

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.620
I'm going to make a mistake
somewhere, and it's like, oh,

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:28.890
I left out such and such letter,
and I have to find a way to fix it.

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:36.070
By the way, one of my main rules of
art is that if you make a mistake,

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:39.880
and you can't paint over it,
make it part of the design.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.990
So that's happened many times.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:46.310
This is an icon of St. George.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:50.340
You can see where I
roughed in the shadows,

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:55.390
and then the finished
painting, and with any icon,

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:59.770
there's going to be several
layers of paint involved.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:06.560
Usually with an icon, it's -- you
start out with the dark colors

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:11.750
and you apply the lighter colors,
showing the progress of the soul

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:18.380
from darkness to the light, and
it's nice that acrylic works

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:21.060
out that way, that you
start with the dark,

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:28.590
and then with gold
leaf, putting that on.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:34.410 position:56%
It's a process that depending on the
icon involved, depending on my --

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:38.610
do I really want to paint
today, which is terrible,

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:42.960 position:56%
I've done some icons within one day.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.940
I've done some icons that
just seem to drag on forever.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:54.800
So there's no real how long
does it take to do an icon?

00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:01.160
A few years ago, I did altar of a
church, and I worked with the monk.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:07.150
And he drew out the design that he
wanted, or he told me the design,

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:11.680
and so you can see in the
middle picture to the right,

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.970
the basic design that became
the central Jesus Christ,

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:19.660
and you can see there's
elements from the past and it

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.430
like the Angels overhead.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:29.340
That's a direct connection to
the ancient image of Jesus,

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:36.310
the image of Jesus being carried
by angels, and below is Abraham,

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:43.890
the patriarch, Abraham being given
bread and wine by [inaudible].

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:48.230
How do you say it?

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.530
Yeah, thank you.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:56.430
When I was doing this, looking
at this picture reminds me,

00:27:56.430 --> 00:28:00.250
one of my concerns was
the monk wanted a rainbow.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:06.630
This particular altar area
had several angles involved,

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:12.940
and trying to figure a rainbow
that was going to be even was --

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.940
I was measuring here and then
the measure here, go up 2 inches.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.060
Measure here, go up 2 inches.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.410
So this monk said, "No-no-no."

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:25.250
So he found a piece of chalk,
and he taped it to a broomstick,

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:28.400 position:56%
and he stood, and he drew a rainbow.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.900
And it was like, wow.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.590
Why didn't I think of that?

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:38.280
And when I was working on the image
of the face of Jesus being held

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:42.860
by the two angels, I was on
a ladder, but it was in front

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:47.820
of the steps to like
where I'm standing now,

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:50.010
and it was difficult to reach.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:53.400
The ladder was at a difficult
angle, and I'm trying to reach it,

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.670
and the monk was saying,
"But, you know,

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:58.670
you've got one ear a little
bit lower than the other.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:28:59.970
Can you fix that?"

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:01.950
So I was trying to get it.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:03.600
Again, it was a difficult angle.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.820
So he said, "Do you mind if
I try, because I'm taller?"

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:11.540
So he climbed up the ladder,
and he was getting it correct,

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:15.630
and the young man from
the church came in.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:21.680
So he looks at me, and he looks up
at the monk at the ladder painting,

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:25.620
and he looks back at me like,
so the monk is doing the work.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.530
What are you doing here?

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:33.490
And this seraphim, really,

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:36.480
this is one of my favorite
things I've ever painted.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.340
I love doing angels,
and so this is just one

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:44.070
of the favorite things
that I've done.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:50.390
This is kind of a, again, different
styles of the entry into Jerusalem.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:55.410
The one on the left
is eighteenth-century.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:58.240
It's from upper Egypt.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:04.100
It's a more simple style, but I
really love this because first

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.780
of all, the dark blue,
but if you look carefully,

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:11.710
you see the palm leaves in the
background that are being used,

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.430
you know, to welcome Jesus.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:19.780
And you see the others throwing
cloths at the feet of Jesus,

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:25.210
and in this one -- the upper
one done by Fanous, again,

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:29.950
you see the palm leaves, and you
see the people throwing cloths

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.090
at the feet of Jesus.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.900
The bottom one is one I did.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:41.920
And what I did with the
entry into Jerusalem,

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.890
and the disciples are all
wearing the same uniform.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:49.680 position:56%
They're wearing white with red, just
so we all know they're disciples,

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:56.050
and all of them except one
has a happy expression.

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:59.080
One of them, if you look
carefully, is kind of glowering,

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.790
and we all know who he is,

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:08.440
and all of them are holding a palm
leaf except for one, and also,

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.590
what I do and almost every
entry into Jerusalem,

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:17.470
and you see that in the
little insert to the left.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:23.020
I like to put myself and my
husband, Wafik, into the picture

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:27.920
that we're watching entry into
Jerusalem, but we're copticized.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:33.140
The closest thing about this
one is that she has the long,

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:37.440
light brown hair, but at least
we're there watching the entry

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.740
into Jerusalem.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:43.430
This is another one that I
did a couple of years ago.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:50.030
It's one of my favorites, and
it's the baby Moses being taken

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:58.160
from the Nile River, and I was
asked to do this by a Jewish man,

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.350
and so it was fun doing
the ancient temple

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:07.440
and Miriam hiding in the papyrus.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:11.820
Actually, it's on my
list of things to do,

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:19.290
that someone wants a large painting
of this, and just more temples

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:20.590
and and so I'm like that.

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.590
So I'm looking forward
to starting that.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.970
Go through my creative
process again.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.380
Noah's Ark.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:35.170
Basically, this is kind of a
standard, Coptic Noah's Ark.

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.990
As an animal lover, it was
great fun for me to do.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:46.310
If you look closely near the
boat, you see a pair of dogs,

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:48.750
and I have them sitting
down, looking up,

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:52.250
waiting for their human
friends to come off the boat,

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:58.030
and then over to the left, there's
two cats, and they're looking

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:02.550
at the pair of mice that just came
off the boat, and they're thinking,

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:06.470
should we eat them now or
wait until there's more mice?

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:12.640
So a monk said to me on this
one, but really, next time,

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:17.180
you need to keep with
the clean animals.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:22.010
And I'm, yeah, sure.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:25.600
The icon of the Virgin Mary,
I've gotten into the habit,

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:31.880
I like to put for stalks of
papyrus and an icon of Jesus

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:37.130
or the Virgin Mary, because not
only is it a symbol of Egypt,

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:44.470 position:56%
the earliest known Bible fragments
that exist were on papyrus and found

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:49.590
in Egypt, and then with the
Virgin Mary, I like to have lotus,

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:54.900
just a nice flower to remind
her of her time in Egypt.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:34:03.140
Some exceptions to Coptic art
that I do, like if it's a saint

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:07.120
who has died recently, I mean
within the past 50 years,

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.730
where there's photographs
of him, yes,

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:12.830
I will do a more realistic face.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:20.370
The one at the bottom is from
a monastery in upper Egypt,

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:25.220
and this is a very
unsophisticated painting,

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:28.410
but I love this icon of this saint.

00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:33.750 position:56%
It might be unsophisticated, but you
can see the painter put his heart

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:39.500
into it, and so I've made
copies of that icon before,

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:46.330
and when I was asked to do an
icon of this saint for a church,

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:51.550
I did a more realistic looking, so
he could look proper next to Jesus,

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:56.220
but the monk holding
the picture down below,

00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:58.210
he's holding the original icon.

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:04.200 position:56%
So I could the original icon in,
and a more realistic-looking picture

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.950
of this thing, and these are
just some of my favorite icons.

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:10.250
I love doing angels.

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.570
Doing the archangels was great fun.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:16.220
I call this the family
portrait of archangels.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:20.580
The one of Jesus rescuing the lamb.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.140
Again, as an animal lover, to me,

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:25.900
this was great fun
on several levels.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:30.870
Notice that the lamb, he's caught
in thorns, and he's crying.

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:36.890
He's so sad, and he feels lost,
and Jesus is coming to rescue him

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:41.800
and comforting him and saving him.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:47.050
And any excuse to do a pretty night
sky, I always enjoy doing that.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:51.310
Whether it's the prayer Desimone
or Jesus walking on water.

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:56.010
And the flight into
Egypt, you can see elements

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.340
from the ancient flight into Egypt.

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:05.420
So if it's a large icon, I
often lay it flat to work on.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.940
Some of it has to be
done standing up.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.260
I can't do a face when
it's laying flat.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.940
It has to stand up.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.710
And you can see two of my helpers.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:18.360
One of them below is
holding the paintbrush,

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:22.420
and the other one is keeping
the feet of Jesus warm.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:28.340
These two icons were going
to a church in Pennsylvania.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:31.520
I thought I was finished
with them the night before.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.240
We were going to transport them.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:38.570
And then I tore the gold leaf

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:41.850
under the inscription,
the Coptic inscription.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:43.150
I tore the gold leaf.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.780
I tried to repair it.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.730 position:56%
It looked like it had been repaired.

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:48.030
I tried a different way.

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:50.250 position:56%
It looked like it had been repaired.

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:54.380
So I ended up painting an Angel --

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:56.210
but if I paint the
angel on one side,

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:59.340
it's going to have to
be on the other side.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:03.520
Now if it's on one icon, it's going
to have to be on the other icon.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:08.220
So I was up until like 6
o'clock painting little angels

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.490
on these icons and varnishing them.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:18.440
I finished that icon at six in
the morning, last coat of varnish,

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:24.540 position:56%
and we got up like at seven or eight
to load them up and transport them.

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.550
And it's not the first time
I'm letting the varnish dry

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.280
as we're carrying it
out to a trailer.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:35.990
And then I have my other helper,
my husband Wafik, and what he does,

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:40.310
he cuts the wood to size,
and he prepares the word.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:44.200
He gives of the primary
coats of white paint,

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.770
then he also makes
a lot of the frames.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:56.340
What we see here is at a show that
was all the Orthodox churches,

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.830
the icons from all
the Orthodox churches.

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:02.330
They asked me if I would
demonstrate painting icon.

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:04.390
I had one just about
finished anyway.

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:08.010
So I brought that, and
they put me up on a stage,

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:12.200
and as I stood there painting,
a couple people walked by

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.680
and said, "Oh, nice icon.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.320
Yeah, okay."

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.830
So after a while, I said
to my husband, well,

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:21.120
I'm going to go get
something to drink.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.720
If you want to do something,
just take the paint and on each

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.390
of these white dots
put another white dot.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:32.600
It's representing the
stars of heaven.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.650
So he's doing that.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:35.980
I go get a drink.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:41.010
I come back, and there's like about
30 people crowded around the stage,

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:44.540
and they're doing like,
wow, what an artist!

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.560
What a beautiful icon!

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.000
And you know, he's standing there.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.650
All he needed was a beret.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:58.250
A beret. And so that was -- so
I just sat there entry I Coke

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:59.830
and let him be the great artist.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:06.230
And the other one he was -- I was
doing this icon that was going

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:11.000
to be traveling to Egypt within the
next couple of days, and so he gets

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.590
up at 4 o'clock to go to work,

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:14.210
and his soon as he
walks into the kitchen.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:16.770
I've been up all night
working on the icon.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:18.070
He comes into the kitchen.

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:19.880
I'm, Wafik, you've got
to write this in Arabic.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.750
"I just woke up."

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:23.050
I'm, no, no.

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:24.810
Come on. It won't take -- come on.

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:28.390
So he was very nice to
put the Arabic on that

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:31.320
at 4 o'clock in the morning.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.890
We went to Jerusalem a
couple of months ago,

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:41.310
and we went to a monastery
in Jericho that was named

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:44.390
for the Zaccheus, who was
in the tree that Jesus said

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:46.900
to him, "Zaccheus, come down."

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:50.030
And this small Coptic monastery,

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:54.930
all of the icons were the Coptic
style except one which was in front

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:59.750
of the candle stand, and
that was a European print

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:03.040
of the scene of Jesus and Zaccheus.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:08.500
And so monk said, "I really wish I
could get a Coptic icon of that."

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.570
And I said, I wish I
could do it to you,

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:14.200
but I don't know how
I would get it to you.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:20.080
So we went back to Jerusalem, and I
was telling the hotel manager that,

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:25.200
you know, if only, and he said
tell me the size wood you need,

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.800
and of course, it has to
the high-grade plywood.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:32.020
Not just regular plywood
high-grade plywood, and so he said,

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:35.180
"I'll get it for you,"
and the desk clerk said,

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.620
"I'll find you nearby art store
where you can buy the paints."

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:48.440
So within two days I did a Coptic
Zaccheus, and I signed their names

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.430
on the icon also that I
had an assist from them.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:55.730
And by the way, I signed Wafik's
name on all my icons, too,

00:40:55.730 --> 00:41:01.420 position:56%
because really and truly, I
wouldn't be doing icons without him.

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:06.050
Not only does he cut the wood and
prepare it and stuff like that,

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:10.890
but when I'm doing my last-minute
rush and just all day on painting,

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:16.770 position:56%
all night I'm painting, he's really,
okay, he does so he comes home

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:18.410
after a long day of work.

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:19.710
He does the dinner.

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.010
He does the housecleaning.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:22.310
Just get the icon done.

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:23.610
Get the icon done.

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:27.920
So he deserves a place
on the icon too.

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:32.740
Don't expect such niceness
out of me on a regular basis.

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:40.830
This is, I went to a large
family conference of a church

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:43.570
in Connecticut, and
they had a bishop there

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.450
that I worked with him before.

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:48.740
And he called me just before
we got there, and he said,

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.650
"We need two icons
of the resurrection."

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:55.200
And I said, oh no,
no one told me that.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:59.920
He said, "Can you do two icons by
Sunday so I can consecrate them?"

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:05.330
Okay, so in two days I did
two icons of the resurrection,

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:12.650
and this is him consecrating
them, and my priest here,

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.870
Father Chanute [assumed spelling],
please don't get any ideas

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:17.960
to ask me can you do to
icons within two days.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:27.380 position:56%
No. This the icon that I did of a
saint who was recently made or named

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:35.500
by our church, and this bishop
had asked me to do this icon.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:39.200
The body of this saint
is in his church.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.410
So he took the icon
with him to Egypt,

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:47.620
and you see him consecrating it.

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:54.060
An icon is either on the walls
the church or they're also used

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:57.090
in zeffas, which is a procession

00:42:57.090 --> 00:43:00.070
around the church in
honor of a saint.

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:05.550
Like if we have relics of a
saint, then on the anniversary

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:11.790
of that saint, we take the relics
around after they're anointed

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:16.060
with holy oil, and the
icons go around with them.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:21.120
So to me, it's really a
great pleasure to contribute

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.770
to the honoring of a saint.

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:27.750
I've got to say that
when working on an icon,

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:31.780
you really do feel a certain
closeness to the saint.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:35.170
It's really hard to
describe, but you do feel,

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:40.460
if not in actual communication,
it's a closeness,

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:44.500
and it's a really,
really nice feeling.

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.050
One of the things I really
like about Coptic art,

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:51.550
especially the Coptic Last Supper,
is that instead of a table full

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:57.340
of food, the table has two things
on it, the wine and the bread,

00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.770
which will become the
body and blood.

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:02.990
The whole thing is
about the communion.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:06.500
Leonardo da Vinci has
the famous Last Supper

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.290
where the table is full of food.

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:12.590
There's up plate full of
lemon slices and everything,

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:14.820
and the message gets lost.

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:17.440
But the Coptic art, it's basic.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.480
It's the blood in the body.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:25.720
The ancient icon of this to
the right, it's not Coptic.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:31.240 position:56%
It's actually Syrian, but I loved it
so much I wanted to show it to you.

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:36.390
It's looking down from the point
of view of God, and it first,

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:40.740
you see a table with maybe
a leg of lamb in the middle

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:44.380
for the Passover meal, but I
read an interpretation of it.

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.860
It's actually the communion cup.

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.390
The whole table is
the communion cup.

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:53.260
Jesus pointing at it
saying drink this.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:45:01.240
So the whole thing is a cup, and
is being offered to the viewer.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:05.700
While we were in Israel, we
saw the Mount of Temptation,

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.560
which I thought was really
neat, and next time I do an icon

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:13.650
of the Temptation of Christ,
that will be utilized.

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:18.560
In this one that I did, I put,
because of the Bible verse,

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:23.230
"And he showed them the cities
as if in a moment of time."

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:27.220
I put various cities,
Athens and Rome.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:32.240
I even put Washington DC,
because this is a moment in time,

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:37.230
and so that was a fun icon to do.

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.900
Different angels from
different times.

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.620
Minus the one on the right.

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.590
Again, you see the
beauty of Coptic art.

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:48.480
Not just the modern Coptic art,
but the ancient Coptic art,

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.710
and to me it's just so beautiful.

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:55.720
I just feel that Coptic
churches here, in Egypt,

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.330
everywhere there's a Coptic
church, they really need

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:01.240
to embrace their heritage.

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:05.820
So right now, well,
actually there's more pieces

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:07.210
of wood sitting there now.

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:09.370
This is my living room.

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:14.500
The big icon is like 8 feet across,

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.460
and then there's other icons
there in various stages.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:18.760
I have more.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.560
Wafik just keeps bringing
them out saying, "Here,

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.660
and this one is for so-and-so."

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:27.550
And this is what doing
icons is all about.

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:29.800
It's putting you in touch with God.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:36.700
It's a window into heaven, and it's
really a great honor and privilege

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.780
and blessing to me
that I can do this.

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:46.690
That hopefully, I can get people
to look at an icon and tell a story

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:50.690
and make them want to
be in touch with God.

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:56.510
And that's my story of being an
iconographer in the Coptic church.

00:46:56.510 --> 00:47:02.110
[ Applause ]

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:04.620
Yes, and if anyone
has any questions.

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:06.030
Yes?

&gt;&gt; I'm someone who can
only draw stick figures,

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:23.640
and I take my [inaudible],
but I studied art history.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:29.130
So wonder if you could tell us
is the cart before the horse

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:31.210
of where you studied art?

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.940
Was it after you got
fascinated with icons?

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:37.330
&gt;&gt;Evelyn Rophael: I've always done
art in one form or another, yes.

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:38.690
I've always loved icons.

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:41.870
I only knew Greek icons, you
know, until I went to Egypt,

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:45.750 position:56%
but once I went to Egypt and started
looking at their icons it was just,

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:47.050
you know, I've got to try this.

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:50.470
I did not have a formal study
except that I really threw myself

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:52.810
into studying what
is it about this icon

00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:57.110
that not only is telling the
story, but what do I like about it

00:47:57.110 --> 00:48:00.400 position:56%
that I can translate into what I do?

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:04.230
Like the one icon I was
pointing out that she likes

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:06.870
to put flowers in them in animals.

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:11.090
And I really like putting nature
in there, and when I was talking

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:14.050
to this iconographer
about, oh, you know,

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.950
I love the way you have the animals
smiling and something like that.

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:19.630
She said, "You know, that's
just what the Pope said to me."

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.510
So.

[ Inaudible Speech ]

&gt;&gt; Evelyn Rophael: No, self-taught.

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:34.130
Self-taught, which is not
always the best teacher.

Anyone else?

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:36.730
Yes.

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:55.600
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much
for this presentation.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:01.090
It's fascinating.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:02.390
[inaudible].

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:10.080
These are not standard paintings.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:16.180
So they're different from what
a standard painting would be.

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:17.480
[inaudible]?

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.290
&gt;&gt; Evelyn Rophael: Well, first
of all, it's technically,

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:22.820
you're writing an icon
that, you know,

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:24.840
because of the Greek
word iconography,

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:29.380
it actually means writing a
picture, and that picture,

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:32.950
especially since you're writing
it, you're telling a story.

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:42.370 position:56%
You're telling a story either of a
saint or a holy scene, and so to me,

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:53.010
you want to show the person in
the icon as brave and good-looking

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:56.190
or beautiful, because
that's what their soul is.

00:49:56.190 --> 00:50:02.780
And I want that -- the viewer
to look at an icon and say,

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:05.160
yes, I'm seeing a story here.

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.360
I don't want them to look at
it and say, that's not pretty.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.960
So to me, it has to be attractive.

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:14.660
It has to have symbols in it.

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:17.360
Almost everything in
the background is going

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.810
to have either three
symbolizing the Holy Trinity

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:28.650
or four symbolizing the Gospels or
seven, the days of creation, or 12,

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:37.410
the apostles, and I want the person
to study the icon and just look

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:39.990
around it and see what's going on.

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:43.200
Because that's one of the
reasons icons were first done,

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:46.770
to educate people who
could not read.

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:50.440
Most people could not read back
then, and so is telling the story.

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:56.590
It's illustrating a story, and
today, in the Orthodox churches,

00:50:56.590 --> 00:51:00.690
we have a front to stand that's
full of icons, the Last Supper,

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:06.470
the apostles, Jesus, St. Mary,
the Archangel, et cetera,

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:12.150
and so that's really the main
element, telling the story.

00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:15.380
Why is St. George on a horse?

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:16.930
He's killing the Dragon.

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:18.930
What is the Dragon?

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:20.730
Evil, the devil.

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:25.000
And let's say one of a monk.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.220
Well, why is he standing there
holding the cane the way he's

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:31.520
doing it?

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.820
Why is he standing there --

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:38.360
why is he wearing something
different than another monk?

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:42.730
It's telling the story, and that's
really the elements important

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:44.330
to me for an icon.

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:49.630
It's telling the story, and it has
to look nice to hold the attention.

00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:55.850
Somebody once said to me that you
try to make your icons too pretty.

00:51:55.850 --> 00:52:00.170
That's not Coptic, and
by the way, several monks

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:04.410
and bishops said don't
listen to him, Evelyn.

00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:09.680
But I have seen icons
that are done carelessly,

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.290
and to me, you lose your story.

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:12.750
You lose the attention.

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:17.300
Once you lose the person viewing
it, and they're thinking, wow,

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.400
she looks like she has a mustache.

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.660
You've lost telling the story.

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:24.630
And maybe the story was
something that was going

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:26.650
to get the person closer to God.

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:31.910
So it has to be attractive,
and it has to tell a story.

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:33.520
Anything else?

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.820
Yes?

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:38.180
&gt;&gt; How are the icons consecrated?

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:41.360
&gt;&gt;Evelyn Rophael: They use
holy oil, and it's a Bishop,

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:45.740
and they use holy oil, and
the ones they showed you,

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:48.350
I did two of them in two nights.

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:52.820
I knew what was involved, and I'd
given each one of them two coats

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:59.460 position:56%
of varnish, fast-drying varnish, and
as the Bishop was pouring oil on it

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:01.420
and doing like this,
I'm thinking oh, God,

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:06.770
please don't let the varnish
just be eaten up by the holy oil,

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:13.920
and they pray over it,
and they breathe upon it.

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:18.020
And it's kind of symbolic about,
you know, the Holy Spirit,

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:20.780
and then there's usually
a procession

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:25.060
around the church of the new icon.

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.360
Yes?

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:36.380
&gt;&gt; And again, thank you very much.

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:42.450
It was fascinating and [inaudible].

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:45.460
About the colors, are
they [inaudible].

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.090
&gt;&gt; Evelyn Rophael: Yes, yes.

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:49.440
&gt;&gt; Are those colors symbolic?

00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.740
&gt;&gt;Evelyn Rophael: Yes.

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:52.040
White symbolizes purity.

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:56.280
The gold, the gold
leaf, symbolizes heaven.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:02.750
The blue symbolizes
royalty, and red, of course,

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:06.400
symbolizes blood or
martyrdom usually.

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:11.210
Someone who was martyred is going
to have something red on, yes.

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:15.740
I did an icon of the slaughter
of the innocents of, you know,

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:21.170
the Romans coming in and killing
the babies and so on, like that.

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:27.620
And rather than showing
the blood on the ground,

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:32.760
it was wherever a child was being
slaughtered, there was red flowers

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:36.160
on the ground, which
it was symbolic.

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.370
And, you know, the Angels are
carrying the babies up words.

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:40.310
So you still know what happened,

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:44.260
and the red of the
martyrdom was still there.

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.040
Yes?

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.410
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] Thank you so much.

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:52.040
&gt;&gt; Evelyn Rophael: Thank you.

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:55.730
&gt;&gt; This is been a presentation
of Library of Congress.
