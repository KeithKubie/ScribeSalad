00:00:12.207 --> 00:00:15.669
- What do you remember of
the night that we filmed?

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.836
(inspirational music)

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.896
Do you remember doing a
science experiment for me?

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:22.729
- Yeah.

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:25.728
We're gonna study the
reaction of baking soda.

00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:28.014
- [Man 1] Hmm, how much
do you put in there?

00:00:28.014 --> 00:00:30.946
- [Man 2] A little dab will do ya.

00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:31.884
- [Man 1] K.

00:00:31.884 --> 00:00:34.467
- And some apple cider vinegar.

00:00:39.048 --> 00:00:40.479
You see how it fizzes?

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:41.312
- Mm-Hmm.

00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:43.782
And what's happening there?

00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:45.127
- Science.

00:00:45.127 --> 00:00:47.573
(laughing)

00:00:47.573 --> 00:00:50.344
(background chatter)

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:51.815
I'll try anything twice.

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:54.177
I'll probably take a
nice big shit after this.

00:00:54.177 --> 00:00:56.427
(laughing)

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.656
- [Man 1] Are you too tired for the fire?

00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:01.466
- No man, I got the fire, I'm ready to go.

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.788
- Do you remember what
we did with the fire?

00:01:03.788 --> 00:01:04.727
- Played with it a little bit?

00:01:04.727 --> 00:01:07.303
Oh, did we do some smores?

00:01:07.303 --> 00:01:08.440
- Let's find out.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.462
- Let's roast marshmallows--

00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:11.045
- I do have marshmallows.

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:13.401
(laughing)

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:15.598
- Why not, do you have a stick?

00:01:15.598 --> 00:01:17.677
- Marshmallows (mumbles).

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:21.186
You're gonna find when you
bite into that marshmallow,

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:23.751
it's not what you're looking for.

00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:26.727
- You know like, I love comedy
but I don't really laugh

00:01:26.727 --> 00:01:28.238
that much?

00:01:28.238 --> 00:01:32.321
I don't laugh harder than
this in the whole show.

00:01:33.705 --> 00:01:35.540
This is like my favorite--

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.643
- Oh, really?

00:01:36.643 --> 00:01:38.437
We were having a good time.

00:01:38.437 --> 00:01:39.574
- These are the biggest marshmallows--

00:01:39.574 --> 00:01:41.246
- I know, they're really big marshmallows.

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:43.496
(laughing)

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:46.659
- Do you remember this?

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.003
- Uh-Uh.

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:49.807
- [Man 1] All in the
name of science, right?

00:01:49.807 --> 00:01:52.046
- I've gone through two
marshmallows at this point,

00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:54.085
and yours is still on there.

00:01:54.085 --> 00:01:56.042
- Do you remember any of it?

00:01:56.042 --> 00:01:59.292
- I just remember you burning yourself.

00:02:01.012 --> 00:02:01.845
Oh, shit.

00:02:02.886 --> 00:02:04.760
- What, isn't that what
I'm supposed to do?

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.927
(inspirational music)
