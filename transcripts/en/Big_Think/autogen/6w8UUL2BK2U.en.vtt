that someone is given to you what better
 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.350
that someone is given to you what better
way to do that then

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360
way to do that then
 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.110
way to do that then
really give them a chance to take a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120
really give them a chance to take a
 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.190
really give them a chance to take a
break so few of us get that in our day

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200
