00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.590
Okay, well, y minus I'm looking for y1,

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.770
which in this case would be 8,
the y coordinate of our point.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.290
This is m, which is the slope,
which is 2/3,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.680
two over three and then times x- X1.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.370
Well that's the x coordinate which is 9.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.420
This is the equation of this line
written in point slope form.
