00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.780
This is the future of the Harvard Library.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.910
Meet Hannah.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.250
Hannah's study group is looking at innovations
in bicycle technology.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.349
She talks to a reference librarian to make
sure she's focusing on the best information

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:21.350
about patent law, trade flows, research and
development, and traffic patterns.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.730
Her group posts its hyperlinked notes to a
collaborative learning space, which is accessed

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.110
a day later by a globe-spanning research team
studying transmission patterns in E. coli-caused

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.530
infant mortality.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.010
The way Hannah maps traffic to underlying
data suggests a way for them to report the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.570
spread of new infections, unlocking insights
which they publish in an open-access journal

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.449
along with deep links to supporting documentation
from other scientists around the world.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.390
All of this is automatically added to the
microbiome catalog available through the library's

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.719
search service, which is cited by Justin,
an undergraduate working on a paper about

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.309
plagues in Asia Minor.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.790
He posts a shout-out to his friends on Twitter
for mash-ups of maps, annotated videos, images,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.440
and music.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.830
Amazed to hear back that the 19th-century
texts he's looking at are in the library,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.390
he records a video log to tell everyone he's
heading out to check out the real thing.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.290
Justin's video inspires one of his professors
to drill down a little deeper as she develops

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.620
an online course on nation building.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.220
A text-mining analysis opens her eyes about
early transportation systems.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.520
And when her class goes online, Hannah is
notified of a new hit on her search for the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.960
term "bicycle."

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.430
How is all of this possible?

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.830
Because our diverse and unique collections,
global networks, technology, and expertise

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.600
help merge the digital and physical world.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.500
Because we can help you assess, curate, and
make sense of the vast world of knowledge

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.880
from early history to right now.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.720
And because we can help you wherever you are
whenever you need us and whatever you're studying.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.860
Nurturing ideas that lead to more ideas: The
Harvard Library.
