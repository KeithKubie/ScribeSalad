00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.500
Twelve things introverts

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.060
might find difficult by Samantha Chavez

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.520
As introverts, we sometimes find mundane tasks

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.280
more challenging than your average extroverts

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.700
While introvert's experiences might be similar

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.440
We all differ in the way that we deal with them

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.540
Here are 12 things that an introvert might find difficult

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.960
1. Being told not to be shy

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.460
 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.800
Throughout our life, us introverts will often hear

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.680
People tell us to "stop being shy"

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.140
Thus, us associating shyness with weakness

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.820
People tend to confuse the two.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.840
Even though there's nothing wrong with shyness.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.280
Discovering introversion helps us rationalize how we feel.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.620
Making it easier for us to move around

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.820
in social situations.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.100
Still, most introverts will avoid explaining their introversion

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.900
To someone they've just met (can't blame them)

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.940
In hopes of stopping the "Don't be shy" comments, altogether.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.280
2. Writing formal emails.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.980
This can be a prime source of anxiety for introverts.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.220
There will be at least 3 sessions of

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.340
drafting, revising, and editing alone

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.020
Before they feel comfortable enough to press send.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.140
And even then, we are not safe from

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.460
Number 3.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.920
Overthinking Little Things

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.280
This translates mostly to face-to-face interactions.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.920
As we have little to no time

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.100
to prepare for what we are going to say we fear that we will

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.020
make a mistake, or spill something that we shouldn't.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.280
Furthermore, a single phrase during a conversation can

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.000
plague our minds for the rest of the day.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.420
Even if the other person didn't think much of it.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.380
Not to mention, number 4.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.720
4. Reasoning Doesn't Make It Better

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.760
This goes along with face-to-face interactions.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.240
It's a very distressing experience for introverts.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.140
Even if it seems minor.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.800
Sometimes, we're even aware how minor it is.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.120
And that the other person has probably forgotten about it already.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.720
This doesn't stop the dark cloud looming above us

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.660
telling us we did wrong, though.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.800
5. The Idea Of Social Engagements.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.300
 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.760
"There is going to be a big gathering!"

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.840
Are words that an introvert dreads to hear.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.720
We need time to prepare mentally. For this reason,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.280
it's important for us to be informed of the time and place

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.600
of the party, as well as the number of people that are attending.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.380
Make it the least vague possible,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.100
and you'll be sure to lessen an introvert's anxiety.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.860
6.Cancelled Plans

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.140
Trust us when we say that we have already accepted the fact that

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.780
we were going to attend a social gathering.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.480
We can't help the anxiety we feel the days

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.980
prior to it, though. Hearing about

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.280
cancelled plans is an introvert's joy.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.520
Since it's relieving the lead-up anxiety.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.100
7. Navigating Social Events

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.820
Sometimes, we aren't so lucky as to have plans cancelled.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.920
And upon arriving to a social event, we'll do our best

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.000
to get the greetings over with, so we can find a secluded

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.320
corner in which we can spend time observing,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.060
rather than participating.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.100
It doesn't mean we're alone, though.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.660
It means we want to stay with people we trust/won't

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.660
force us out of our comfort zone.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.580
8. Sadly, It Doesn't Always Work out

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.080
 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.340
Maybe,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.420
we don't find the people we're most comfortable with at the event

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.920
and any attempt at conversation results in us getting

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.200
pushed further aside, if we fail.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.280
This can take a toll on introverts,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.520
and exhaust them within seconds.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.180
This leads us to number 9.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.800
9. Attempting and Failing at Conversations.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.480
When we are discouraged from speaking

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.360
because we tried, and weren't heard,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.460
we'll often end up blaming ourselves for even trying.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.540
10. Bad Days

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.820
On particularly bad days, it's hard for an introvert

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.880
to find motivation to speak to ANYONE.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.920
This might be difficult to understand, and often cause friction

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.940
with an introvert and their friends.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.760
11. Restlessness and Self-Disgust

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.260
 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.680
During our bad days, we look for ways to

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.700
channel our dissatisfaction with ourselves, either by cleaning

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.080
or being creative.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.680
We don't really want to talk to anyone yet,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.380
but we still need a sign of reassurance.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.360
We simply look to distract ourselves.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.140
12. being told to act "normal"

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.880
Althought introverts

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.900
prefer to listen instead of participate

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.900
in conversations, it's common for their silence to draw attention

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.100
And more often then not,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.900
It tends to be of the negative time.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.160
This can lead to unwanted comments telling us to

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.220
"act normal". Thus, making us more exhausted.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.560
While introverts might share certain experiences,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.580
they all affect us differently.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.680
What are some things that you find difficult as an introvert?
