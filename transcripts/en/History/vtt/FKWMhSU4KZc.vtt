00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.330
NARRATOR: Jamestown.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.290
The first permanent English
settlement in the Americas

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.460
almost completely
disappeared from the map.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.170
Because colonists drank
themselves to death?

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.290
[record scratch]

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.380
Well, maybe.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.210
In May of 1607, the first
colonists landed in Jamestown.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210
[music playing]

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.040
In 1608, more colonists arrived,
just after a fire destroyed

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.830
much of the settlement.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.040
[screams]

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.880
They rebuilt. And things were
finally running smoothly.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.920
Jamestownians had plenty to eat.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.880
Deer, turtles, sturgeon, and
an abundance of shellfish

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.750
populated the land.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.420
And local Powhatans provided
the colony with corn

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.880
in exchange for goods.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.210
But between 1609 and 1610,
colonists experienced

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.170
a devastating famine.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.000
[music playing]

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.040
Historians believe the
famine, or starving time,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.330
happened for a lot of reasons.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.330
[music playing]

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.120
In 1609, new ships arrive
with more mouths to feed.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.250
With some 300 hungry colonists,
but less to go around,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.620
the Powhatans, who were also
struggling to feed themselves,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.420
cut off trade.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.210
[music playing]

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.960
So settlers started to take
food away from the Powhatans

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.420
by force, leaving the
Powhatans to retaliate,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.880
laying siege to Jamestown.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.460
[screaming]

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.120
Confined to their forts,
settlers no longer had access

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.620
to the same food they used to.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.080
[music playing]

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.460
[bird calls]

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.710
But they were able to
catch small animals,

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.960
and even resorted to
eating their dogs,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.460
horses, and each other.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.920
[music playing]

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.290
So a lack of food may not
be enough to explain why

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.330
the population plummeted,
from around 300 settlers

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.290
to a mere 60.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.830
But a lack of fresh water?
Maybe.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.830
[water gurgling]

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.330
[music playing]

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.750
Jamestown well water was
salty, due to a nearby swamp

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.420
and the James River seeping
into the colony's aquifer.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.330
Water that's too salty
causes dehydration,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.670
which can cause death.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.290
Human waste also got
into the water supply,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.170
allowing disease
to spread rapidly.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.000
And on top of the salty,
contaminated water

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.330
were high levels of arsenic.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.580
Some have theorized that
the Spanish were spiking

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.290
wells with the poison
to keep England

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.330
from colonizing the Americas.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.210
But according to
scientists, it's

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.960
more likely that the arsenic
was naturally occurring.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.040
Either way, this toxic
cocktail may be partially

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.290
to blame for the
devastating demise

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.120
of Jamestown's population.
