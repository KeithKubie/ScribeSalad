00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.695
We had the problem that simply calling display inside the display method

00:00:03.695 --> 00:00:07.280
couldn't possibly work, it would just call the method itself and itself, and

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.510
itself. The way to get the super class method involved, which displays the

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.956
question text, is simply to use the keyword super. This will work. Now the

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:24.634
program correctly shows, first the text of the question and then the list of

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:27.215
choices.
