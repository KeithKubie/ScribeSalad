00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.260
- [Instructor] In 1917
the United States entered

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.200
World War I on the side of the allies.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.440
After several years of
neutrality, Woodrow Wilson,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.670
who was serving as President
of the United States

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.010
at the time, even campaigned
for reelection on the slogan:

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.950
He kept us out of war.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.840
But, less than a month after
his second inauguration,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.500
Wilson went before Congress
to ask for a declaration

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.360
of war against Germany.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.788
It wasn't easy to achieve
an abrupt about face

00:00:27.788 --> 00:00:30.730
from a country that was
determined not to become involved

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.040
in the conflict to a country
that was wholly dedicated

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.150
to the war effort.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.330
So the US Government swept
into action to convince

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.200
everyone to support the war.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.320
The new committee on pubic
information churned out

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.120
propaganda to convince people to war bonds

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.870
and to keep soldiers well
supplied with food and weapons.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.800
Propaganda campaigns
strongly linked patriotism

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.760
with unquestioning support

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.830
of the American Government
and of Capitalism.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.660
Dissenters were not
just called Un-American,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.600
they were also in danger of
being arrested or deported

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.520
under new laws that
restricted freedom of speech.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.090
For many immigrants and African Americans

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.440
in this time period, the home
front during World War I,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.940
offered both new opportunities
and great dangers.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.830
One major opportunity
brought on by World War I

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.690
was the prospect of better
jobs for African Americans.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.850
The war slowed down
immigration to about a tenth

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.600
of what it had been previously.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.440
Since torpedo's made the Atlantic

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.400
a dangerous place for ships.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.340
The sudden drop in immigrants
and the need to produce

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.640
war material led to an explosion
in the number of factory

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.070
jobs that were available to black workers.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.360
In the decade that surround World War I,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.540
half a million African
Americans left the South

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.280
and headed for Northern
and Mid-Western cities

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.530
in a mass exodus known as
the The Great Migration.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.180
Even though black factory
workers didn't enjoy

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.770
anything, like the wages

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.880
or privileges afforded to white workers,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.700
they still could make
more money in the North

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.050
than they could as
share-croppers in the South.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.040
In the North they also had the
right to vote and were less

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.380
likely to encounter racial
violence like lynching.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.390
But, racial violence,
segregation, discrimination,

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.670
were still prominent fixtures
of black life in the North.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.000
Several of the most deadly
race riots in American History

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.290
happened during this
period in Northern cities.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.140
Another opportunity
that World War I offered

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.470
to immigrants and African
Americans was the ability

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.600
to boost their status in
society by contributing

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.720
to the war effort.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.000
Many immigrants saw displays of patriotism

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.410
as a way to show they were truly American

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.980
and had assimilated
through the melting pot.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.910
US Government appealed to
immigrants specifically

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.390
to show their patriotism by enlisting,

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.420
participating in parades,
or buying war bonds.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.510
Take a look at this propaganda poster

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.560
showing immigrants passing
by the Statue of Liberty.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.810
It's written in Yiddish,
the language commonly

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.810
spoken Eastern European Jews.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.610
And it says: You came
here seeking freedom,

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.830
now you must help preserve it.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.730
And it instructs them not to waste food.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.890
So, conspicuous to displays of patriotism

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.760
and other efforts to help the war,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.030
were a way that immigrants could show

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.630
that they were America
and therefore deserve

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.210
to be treated just the
same as other Americans.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.240
For similar reasons, African
American leaders like,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.940
W.E.B. DuBois encouraged
black men to enlist

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.920
for military service hoping
that serving honorably

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.770
in the war would help improve

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.510
the status of African Americans.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.520
Just as the service of black service

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.130
had done in the Civil War.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.530
This poster celebrated the accomplishments

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.040
of the all black 269th Infantry Regiment,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.080
known as the Harlem Hell Fighters,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.610
who were the first
allied soldiers to engage

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.900
the Germans in combat.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.880
The French Government awarded many of them

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.620
the Croix de Guerre,
its medal for heroism.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.070
But, despite the hopes
of DuBois and others,

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.170
the war time service of African Americans

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.240
didn't result in any
significant Civil Right's gains

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.790
during the war or when they returned home.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.410
Army units were segregated
and most soldiers

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.640
were confined to menial duties.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.580
The Wilson Administration
didn't even allow

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.350
black soldiers to participate
in victory parades

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.540
at the end of the war.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.540
At home, failure to fully
embrace American patriotism

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.170
was sharply punished.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.760
In 1917 and 1918 Congress
passed the Espionage Act

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.090
which made it a crime to spy,
interfere with the draft,

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.680
or make false statements
about the military.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.060
And the Sedition Act, which
criminalized statements

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.480
critical of the government.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.010
These laws were especially
dangerous for immigrants

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.930
who were more likely to
advocate for Socialism

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.030
and for labor unions, which
were by their vary nature,

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.470
a critique of the
American Economic System.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.270
Thousands of people were
arrested as a result

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.480
of these laws for doing things
like publishing newspapers

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.070
or handing out pamphlets.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.930
German immigrants faced
particular discriminations

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.410
since they were suspected
of sympathizing with,

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.830
or colluding with the enemy.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.640
The push for a unified
American public during the war

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.270
also led to new immigration restrictions.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.370
In 1917 Congress required

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.760
that immigrants pass a literacy test

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.900
and after the war Congress
would pass a series of new

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.866
laws establishing ethnic
quotas among immigrants

00:05:18.866 --> 00:05:22.460
which heavily discriminated
against the new immigrants

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.240
from Southern and Eastern Europe.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.910
These laws were partly motivated by fears

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.200
that radicals sympathetic
to the Russian Revolution

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.170
in which Communists took control

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.710
of the Russian Government were part

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.360
of a global conspiracy
to undermine capitalism.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.180
There were a series of
labor strikes in 1919

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.540
that seemed to confirm this suspicion

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.560
leading to a crackdown on
labor unions and Socialist

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.100
organizations known as the Red Scare.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.670
Red was the color of
the Russian Communists.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.240
Thousands more people were
arrested as possible radicals

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.900
and many immigrants were deported.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.643
So, World War I and the United State's

00:05:58.643 --> 00:06:03.200
response to it at home caused
huge changes in the flow

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.370
of people to and within the United States.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.730
The dangers of war slowed
what had been a tidal wave

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.670
of immigrants from Europe
down to just a trickle.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.690
And the economic opportunities it brought

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.600
in the form of war-time
factory work led hundreds

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.320
of thousands of African
Americans to leave the South

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.950
and head to Northern cities.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.090
But, restrictions on civil liberties

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.830
and fear that immigrants might
be importing radical ideas

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.470
from abroad led many to
define who was eligible

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.660
to become an American
more narrowly than before.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.240
Setting the stage for a series of cultural

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.630
and political battles in the 1920s

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.040
about what kind of society
the United States should be

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.553
in this new modern era.
