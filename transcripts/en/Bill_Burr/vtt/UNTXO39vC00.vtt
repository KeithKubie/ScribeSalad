1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.673
Okay.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.550
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on as bill burn?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.</v>

3
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:07.530
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:12.300
And I am just checking in on you.

5
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.370
Oh,
sorry.
I didn't bring my fucking microphone like an asshole.

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.410
Um,
all right.
How are you doing?
I'm out in New Jersey.

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.620
A cheat to this fucking room is nasty.

8
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.910
You know what the first fucking thing I found here was a goddamn raising on the

9
00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:34.840
floor.
Then there was some sort of stain on the God,

10
00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:39.160
the fucking New Jersey man.
I swear to God.
So whether it was just,

11
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.480
you know what though,

12
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.830
they'll never be able to vacuum and scrub the fucking hair metal out of this

13
00:00:44.831 --> 00:00:45.370
state.

14
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.370
It's just what went on out in this God damn part of the world in the 80s.

15
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.070
I swear to God,
fucking play like the A,

16
00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:58.690
I had one of these great travel days and then it sucked.
You know,

17
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.860
<v 0>I uh,</v>

18
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.940
<v 1>found a cheap ticket,
got an exit row.</v>

19
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.730
There was nobody in the middle seat,
right?

20
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.200
The person on the aisle was courteous.
We had a fucking tailwind.

21
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.100
One point I was watching this,
we're going 603 miles an hour.
I'm like,

22
00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:19.930
what are we on the fucking Concord ob?
Um,

23
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.840
it was great.
So then we land,
you know,

24
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.830
I'm no longer with budget rental car.
Fuck those guys.

25
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.720
I don't know what happened with them.

26
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.140
I've been meaning to like leave them for six years.
There was a,

27
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:38.480
there was something happened over the last five,

28
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:42.590
six years and I was meaning to walk out on a typical of me when I'm in a bad

29
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:47.570
relationship,
it takes a good half a decade for me to get out of it.
So,
um,

30
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.680
<v 0>okay.</v>

31
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.440
<v 1>Yeah,
after that,
that last fucking conversation I had</v>

32
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.833
<v 0>mmm.</v>

33
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.330
<v 1>You know,
with them where they were like,
oh,
you didn't close your account.</v>

34
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.930
And I had to get back on the phone and talk to those fucking assholes.
It's like,

35
00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:03.890
just close the fucking thing so you have to be on the phone.
I go,
dude,

36
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.600
I don't have time for this.
He's like,
sir,
the more you talk.

37
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:09.270
And I just hung up on him.
I was just,
I could lead them to fucking leave it open.

38
00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:10.200
I don't give a shit.

39
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.580
Why you acting like I still have the car.

40
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.430
<v 0>Okay,</v>

41
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.990
<v 1>sorry.
Um,
when am I gonna like react to things in a mature way?</v>

42
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.100
I just don't,
I,
every time I take the fucking bag,
I freak out.

43
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.000
I got into it with the Sklar brothers.
I did their fucking podcast.
Right.

44
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.740
And both of them,
you know,
talk in sports,
both of them agreeing with each other.

45
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.410
And one was in the,
it was like,
it was just like,

46
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.080
it was like arguing with one person in Stereo.

47
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.260
<v 0>Okay.
And one of them,</v>

48
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.300
<v 1>Randy adjacent,
they never reintroduce themselves either.</v>

49
00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:49.600
They'll like fucking identical twins.
They're always changing their facial hair.

50
00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:53.800
I literally,
I've called each one of them buddy for fucking 15 years.
Hey Buddy,

51
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.640
what's going on?
I used to know Randy because Randy had the facial hair.
So my,

52
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.610
my thing in my head was like rugged.
He's got the facial hair.

53
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.590
Then they started fucking switching off with the goatees and,
and uh,

54
00:03:04.591 --> 00:03:09.170
and the fucking,
uh,
Don Mattingly baseball,
fucking,
uh,

55
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.470
mustaches.
I don't know who's who anymore.
Right?
So,
you know,

56
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.790
we're having a nice podcast.

57
00:03:16.791 --> 00:03:19.970
Everything's going good and we'd brings up Tom Brady and he has to bring up

58
00:03:19.971 --> 00:03:22.640
fucking deflate gate and I fucking lost it.

59
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.340
I fucking lost it.

60
00:03:25.341 --> 00:03:28.400
I just hate the gym or say like he liked one,

61
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.250
he successfully ran a fucking bullshit smear campaign that will follow that guy,

62
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.620
an innocent man for the rest of his fucking career.

63
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.920
You know what he should've done?

64
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.690
He should've had performance enhancing drugs sent to his house and his wife
name.

65
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.400
Cause evidently that just fitches flies away.
That's no big deal.

66
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.640
Unreal on fucking real.
And then it was funny though,
they're,

67
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.850
they're cool though because afterwards I was so fucking annoyed by him just

68
00:04:00.141 --> 00:04:04.250
seeing it that way and like blaming Tom Brady for not getting out in front of

69
00:04:04.251 --> 00:04:07.970
this stupid witch hunt.
Right.
That actually called him up.

70
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.150
This is how much time I wasted my life being upset and caring about sports for

71
00:04:14.151 --> 00:04:17.560
whatever fucking reason.
You know,

72
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.760
I'd call him up and I started talking to him and it finds out like he didn't

73
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:25.510
even know half the facts of the story.
So I was like,
dude,

74
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:28.750
that's like reprehensible feud be going on in their trash and this guy and you

75
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:32.690
don't even know that the fucking earth say paid for that fucking dope.

76
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.630
It wasn't even all of that shit.
I know this is old,
right?

77
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:35.770
But he brought it back up again,

78
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.083
<v 0>you know,</v>

79
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.710
<v 1>and uh,
I got to give it up to him.</v>

80
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.040
He fucking manned up and went back on his podcast and actually apologize for not

81
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.180
knowing a couple of those fucking things,

82
00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:47.760
but I just all you fucking [inaudible] I'm telling you right now,

83
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.980
it's just a bunch of fucking patriots haters at this point.

84
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.130
If you're going to ignore fucking hearing aids in helmets,

85
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.860
performance enhancing drug centi white for your house,

86
00:04:57.861 --> 00:05:00.020
if all of that just goes away.

87
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.250
But this fucking deflate fucking contact with the air out of a ball,
does it.

88
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:10.620
Then I eat.
You are,
you are in my world.
You are just,
you just don't,

89
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.180
you just hating on the Patriots.
All right.
Now if you give everybody shit,
okay.

90
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:18.960
And every time they bring up these other guys' names,
you go,
oh,
wait a minute.

91
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.500
You mean the guy who his offensive line had the hearing aids?

92
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.380
You mean that guy you're going to do that day?

93
00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:27.780
They're not going to fucking do that.
You're not going to do it.

94
00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:31.820
And it happened in Indianapolis.
It doesn't matter.

95
00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:35.150
Those are simple people out there.
They put their pants on one leg at a time.

96
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.630
Hey Guy,
I get it.
You know,
she ain't fucking go shit back.
I'm sweating.

97
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.890
What's my travels going?
Great.

98
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.903
<v 0>And um,</v>

99
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.040
<v 1>so I was actually upset at myself for getting that worked up about something</v>

100
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:50.740
that I really thought I was over.
You know what I mean?

101
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.200
It was like seeing a chick,
he broke up with you.
It's like,
you know,

102
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:56.940
I'm finally ready to fucking move on.
And then,
you know,
you run into in a,

103
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.610
and she just says that one thing and you go right back to the fucking end of the

104
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:02.600
relationship,

105
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.360
fucking talking to yourself in the bathroom and she'd taken a shower,
you know,

106
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.130
just completely losing your shit.
Wow.
Kind of watching yourself going like,
dude,

107
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:15.440
she's winning.
Just shut up.
She's winning.
And you just,

108
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.090
but you got to get it out of you.
Um,
so anyways,

109
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:24.050
I was sitting on the plane,
right?
We get off the fucking plane and,
uh,

110
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.650
I drive out here to fucking Red Bank,
New Jersey,

111
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.320
and I show up and I got my bags and it's like seven,

112
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.620
I think it was seven 48 in the morning.
I took a red eye,
right?

113
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.570
And I come walking in and the second I saw the lady behind the desk looks at me.

114
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.090
I know my room's not going to be ready.
And I come walking into my,
Yay,

115
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.740
I've got a reservation.
And she's already shaking your head.
She's like,

116
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:52.960
we don't have it's seven 48 in the morning.
I go,
no,
no,
no.
Uh,

117
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.470
but I paid for the room overnight so I can come in early.
And she says like,
yeah,

118
00:06:57.471 --> 00:07:02.420
no you didn't.
Yeah,
we don't have that.
And then my blood starts going up.

119
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:05.360
So I start going like,
you mean to tell me that I have to,

120
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.620
and I almost fell asleep on the ride over here cause I couldn't really sleep on

121
00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:13.160
a plane.
Um,
not blood starts going up and I'm sitting there going like,

122
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.250
are you mean to tell me I have to drive around red bank until like two,

123
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:22.640
three o'clock in the afternoon?
She's like,
I can try to expedite,

124
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.180
but I was able to calm myself down.
I was like,
you know what?

125
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.150
I already got into it with the Sklar brothers.

126
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.720
Why do I want to get involved with this fucking person?
This nice person here.

127
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.250
You know,
she,
she,
she,
she has nothing to do with these decisions.
I fucked up.

128
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.820
Somebody fucked up,
but she didn't,
right.
So I just said,

129
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:43.250
I find because you want to drop off your bags.
I say yes.

130
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.710
I vaguely remember driving to a diner

131
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.870
and getting some eggs benedict looking at this guy.

132
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.380
You know,
who do you ever see those guys?
They just,
I dunno,

133
00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.510
they just have band aids all over him.
Like they had like 20 tests.

134
00:08:00.511 --> 00:08:02.610
Just take the second.
I saw the guys like,
this guy is not good.

135
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.340
This guy's not gonna be around for a long time.
You know what I mean?

136
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.260
I was in like one of these Tony Soprano fucking uh,
you know,

137
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.180
it looked like that one.
You know,
you don't let one where uh,
Jimmy,

138
00:08:12.181 --> 00:08:14.450
the gent comes walking out and he knocks on the,

139
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:17.780
the guy's falling them their window.
Let's go fuck hoes.

140
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.020
They keep him up all night.

141
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.330
It looked like one of those places and I just looked at this guy,
wow,

142
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.020
this guy is not going to be,
he's not gonna be around for awhile.

143
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.490
<v 0>Um,
you know,</v>

144
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.430
<v 1>man,
he was like,
fuck it.
And he was eating eggs and bacon.
It's just like,
oh,</v>

145
00:08:32.431 --> 00:08:35.190
there you go.
Go out the way you want to go out.
Right.

146
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.090
So I get back in the car and like,
I don't know what,

147
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.480
what am I going to get the fuck do you do?

148
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.720
So I just drove back to the hotel parking lot,

149
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.850
reclined the seat,
crack the windows and just slept in the car.

150
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:54.780
That was funny was every 40 minutes I wake up and I'd be sweating because the

151
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:58.830
sun was coming up more and more in the car was getting hotter and hotter.

152
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:01.680
So I'd have to turn the car on,
roll the windows down a little more,

153
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.030
and then go back to sleep.
And uh,

154
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.530
I did that for about like from,
I dunno,

155
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.180
30 in the morning to about a quarter to 12.

156
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.910
I'm 25 years into my career and this,
the road is always going to be the road.

157
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.130
This is,
he's going to happen.
And uh,
I got to tell you though,

158
00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:25.090
I feel great.

159
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.230
I got a fucking really good three hours,

160
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:35.050
came in,
checked in,
grabbed my bags,
hit the hotel gym,

161
00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.310
knocking out the podcast.
Um,

162
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.050
anyways,
yeah,
you guys got to listen to that,

163
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:45.660
that Sklar one cause it's really good.
Those guys fucking know their shit man.

164
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.710
They really know their shit when it comes to a fucking,
uh,

165
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.700
sports and everything.

166
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:54.690
And I kept teasing them that they did not look athletic at all.
You know,

167
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:57.900
when they were like trash and Michael Jordan [inaudible] yeah.
Petty.
He's petty.

168
00:09:57.901 --> 00:10:01.960
And it's just like,
you guys aren't going to be those guys.
Are you the last guy?

169
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.580
Perfect in gym class and then when there's somebody is great as Michael Jordan,

170
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.840
you,
you,
you,
you just can't accept that he's great.
You still have to,

171
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.370
who the fuck says Michael?
Jordan's petty like you hung out with them.

172
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.140
You Watch one speech,

173
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.800
he brings up the guy that he beat out in high school to introduce them.

174
00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.330
That makes him petty.
You don't know him.

175
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.470
What it really is is you see yourself in that guy giving the intro to Mike,

176
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.770
so now you've got to look at him like he's like,
he's an asshole or something.

177
00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.600
Give me a fucking break and then we'll do like story about you guys.

178
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:37.660
You gave the baby a lot.

179
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.860
Really have you hung out with them then shut up and also all of them,
they've,

180
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.300
Jordan never walked into this studio.
They would never call him petty.

181
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.940
Their voices would go up nine octaves.

182
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:52.090
They'd ask him to sign this funny at fucking forehead,

183
00:10:52.091 --> 00:10:53.740
draw the Air Jordan thing right on there.

184
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:57.490
They'd go down to a tattoo parlor and Abbott tattooed so,
Eh,
enough already.

185
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.290
Um,
so anyway,
sorry,
I'm,
I'm literally going to get worked up about that thing.

186
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:07.620
Oh,
so anyways,
it bugged and bugged him.
A one of them,

187
00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:09.330
I don't know what you propose.
Randy adjacent.

188
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:10.993
<v 2>Okay.</v>

189
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:11.430
<v 1>Alright.</v>

190
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.420
It bugged one of them that I was saying they weren't athletic so he sends me a

191
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:20.421
video of him and his culdesac shooting a basketball in slow motion from really

192
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:24.780
far away and it goes in and that was some sort of demonstration that he was

193
00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:28.520
athletic.
I still have been trashed him for it yet.
It's just like,
dude,

194
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.220
there was nobody gardening.
It wasn't a game.
You know,
he's like,

195
00:11:32.221 --> 00:11:33.510
that was the second attempt.

196
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.780
I ate those stupid fucking videos.

197
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.810
There was one the other night where a guy's in the helicopters in the Robinson

198
00:11:42.811 --> 00:11:46.870
44 and he throws a fucking basketball out and it goes through the hoop.

199
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:51.480
It's like if you,
if he could do it consistently,
if he did it on the first try.

200
00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:54.820
Yeah.
That's impressive.
That poor guy flying the helicopter,

201
00:11:54.821 --> 00:11:57.910
you probably to keep landing cause they kept collecting the basketballs and they

202
00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:01.990
fucking go back up.
Then it finally goes through.
Yeah.

203
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:06.830
You know you do it enough times.
Yeah.
It's going to go in.
Um,

204
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:12.280
anyways,
uh,
so I'm going to try to eat like an angel.

205
00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:15.220
I've been doing really good.
I bowl Billy knows booze bag.

206
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.000
You know when I went out Tuesday night cause it was Joe to rose his birthday and

207
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:23.440
I'll tell you right now at my liver is so happy.
Joe's only turn 40 once.

208
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.140
Oh Oh,
let me tell you.

209
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.190
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

210
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:33.110
<v 1>I was so hung over the next day I woke up like laughing.
It was like,
it was,</v>

211
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.840
it was so pathetic.
I felt so bad.
It wasn't,
it wasn't even like,

212
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.590
it would be redundant to actually feel bad at that point.
And,
uh,

213
00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.610
I actually got up,

214
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.300
forced down half a glass of water and I went out and I worked out,

215
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.120
hung over as shit,
you know,

216
00:12:56.121 --> 00:13:01.121
stretching out the hammies my big dumb fucking head down towards my ankles,

217
00:13:01.491 --> 00:13:05.960
you know,
stretching out my hammies and my head was just going,
guys,
guys,
guys,

218
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.200
you know,
but I gotta tell you that's where being German Irish comes in,

219
00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.020
cause you will plow fucking through anything.
You know what I mean?
Is that was,

220
00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.100
that was Versie

221
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:17.730
<v 2>yeah.</v>

222
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.020
<v 1>With this Mediterranean blood,
no one had to live life and you know,</v>

223
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.890
smell the roses.
[inaudible] he would've called in sick to work.

224
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.930
If he got up a second before 2:00 AM,
I'm telling you,
Paul Versey,

225
00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:38.270
he would've been moaning.
You know what I mean?
Like he just shattered his leg.
Um,

226
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.080
oh did,
we had a great time.
We had a great time.
We went to two.

227
00:13:42.081 --> 00:13:45.260
We went to this old school and the oldest restaurants in,
um,

228
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:52.020
in a Hollywood on Hollywood boulevard.
Got It.

229
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.720
I got a great steak,
uh,

230
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:59.400
split it with Nia and Joe got this fucking prime rib on that.
I'm telling you,

231
00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:03.330
dude was like,
I know that people always say the Flintstones.

232
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.480
It was fucking gigantic.
And I looked at it and he goes,
dude,
you got to try man.

233
00:14:06.481 --> 00:14:09.690
This is amazing.
I was like,
wow.
And I looked down and I swear to God,

234
00:14:09.691 --> 00:14:13.020
it felt like six minutes later and I looked up and he was like down to the last

235
00:14:13.021 --> 00:14:15.290
two bites.
I mean,

236
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.700
did they take the kids and animal 40 years old either?

237
00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:19.770
There's no slowing them down.

238
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.510
And then we ended up at the American Legion and um,

239
00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.160
<v 2>yeah.</v>

240
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.330
<v 1>Yeah.
And I don't remember much after that.
I remember I,
I got him a cake,</v>

241
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.660
you know,
that said a bunch of horrible things about him on it.

242
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:40.600
And next thing I was sitting in something that sort of resembled a tree Ford or

243
00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:45.130
like a band stand kind of thing outside in the parking lot with like nine other

244
00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:46.900
people that I don't even know where they came from.

245
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:50.320
And we were all smoking cigars.
And then I did the Irish goodbye.

246
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.700
Um,
somebody called me an Uber and that was it.
But you know what?

247
00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:58.240
I'm right back on it though.
You know,
every once in awhile,
you know what,

248
00:14:58.241 --> 00:15:00.740
you don't,
you gotta,
you gotta fucking slappy liberal wrap.

249
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.490
Let it know who's boss.
Okay.
Then other than that,
you know,
you take,

250
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.000
you take care of it.
You know,
I have an abusive relationship with my,

251
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:11.670
with my liver,
but,
uh,
anyways,
I'm out here,
uh,

252
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.590
doing red bank count Basie,
theater,

Uh,

253
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.270
let me know some good spots to eat out here.
If you guys know,
um,

254
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.840
I've never stayed out here,
but I'm excited to be out here,

255
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:25.610
not have to deal with the fucking traffic coming out of Manhattan and um,

256
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.960
I can't wait to do these fucking shows because once these things is a great

257
00:15:30.961 --> 00:15:35.640
theater and,
uh,
I'm really loving where my act is at.
And then on Sunday night,

258
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:40.260
all things comedy network is producing its first standup special with Paul

Again,

260
00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:48.020
at the Tarrytown theater and beautiful Tarrytown,
New York City.
I mean,
Tarrytown,

261
00:15:48.021 --> 00:15:50.570
New York,
Not New York City,
upstate New York or I don't know,

262
00:15:50.571 --> 00:15:53.300
they get all upset if you say upstate upstate to them is Poughkeepsie.

263
00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.540
Um,
the Westchester area,
whatever the fuck it is,
um,

264
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:02.330
it's right on the water.
Um,

265
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.150
if you guys had never been to that part of the country,
I mean it really is.

266
00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:09.950
It's fucking gorgeous.
Like sleepy hollow is up there.

267
00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.700
You got the Hudson River.
I mean,
it's like,
um,

268
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.380
you know what it's like,
it's,

269
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:22.020
it's like how mount most non white people think white people live valley think

270
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:26.980
all white people live.
Um,
it is really,
really,
really,

271
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.170
really quaint.
I mean,

00:16:31.171 --> 00:16:34.830
I mean there's just see like where's the pumpkin patch?
It's like,
Shit like that,

273

But those,

274
00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.970
what does those fucking creepy things that girls used to hold and they would

275
00:16:41.971 --> 00:16:45.640
skip around a little girls in the playground.
Yeah,

276
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.420
we go round the fucking thing.
The fuck they went there.

277
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:51.090
Was it called the Mayberry,
but not the Mayberry Bush.
Okay.

278
00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.040
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

279
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.820
<v 1>No,
they just,
you know,
that's back when they didn't let women do anything.</v>

280
00:16:54.821 --> 00:16:56.260
So like that was their idea of playing.

281
00:16:56.261 --> 00:17:00.860
You just grab on this string and you guys skip around,
you know?
Meanwhile,

282
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.530
we're fucking guys are playing sports trying to figure out each other's

283
00:17:03.531 --> 00:17:07.550
weaknesses.
I guess women were doing that,
but on a different level.
Right?

284
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.990
I bet she doesn't like her nose.
I'm going to say something about that.
Um,

285
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:17.240
I'm sorry.
I'm still,
uh,
I'm still fucking shit.
What do you want from me?

286
00:17:17.241 --> 00:17:18.980
I slept in a fuck.
I didn't know what I,
by the way,

287
00:17:18.981 --> 00:17:20.480
I don't even know what the fuck I slept in.

288
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.890
He's got Damn Carson and they all look the same and then I don't,

289
00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:29.710
their logos are so fucking like
jazzy.
I can,

290
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.990
you know the Honda.
You should just be a fucking age.

291
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:34.170
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

292
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:37.100
<v 1>Know,
isn't it?
So still the fucking shit that I get upset about it.</v>

293
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.510
It's just so stupid.
Really.
Billion.
Well,

294
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.350
why don't you just fucking go on the Internet and look them up?

295
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.440
What are they supposed to have the same logo for the rest of your life?

296
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.340
All right.
Fair enough.
Hey,
fair enough.
Fair enough.

297
00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.810
They go,
freckles needs fucking meditate here.
Um,

298
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.860
anyways,
how about those fiber,
those red socks?
Huh?

299
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.660
Just tearing through the bottom part of the fucking league.

300
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.010
The real test comes this weekend when they play the ag you Bible,

301
00:18:05.011 --> 00:18:08.220
we were with you should be again.
Now it isn't.

302
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:12.180
It all ended in 2004,
but it's still fun,
right?

303
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:16.290
The baby bombers first to fucking $200 million Red Sox,

304
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:18.180
all that dealer that,
you know what?

305
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:21.360
I Bet America would be rooted for the Yankees.
You know,

306
00:18:21.361 --> 00:18:23.900
they created all of this shit.
You know,

307
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.440
you know what the Yankees are?
They like these fucking,
the bad influence.

308
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:32.760
Older brother,
you know who did well and like,
you know,
uh,

309
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.430
preschool,
elementary,

310
00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:37.790
right through middle school and then somewhere in high school.
Just start,

311
00:18:37.791 --> 00:18:39.150
just went off the fucking rails

312
00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.180
and then the red socks.

313
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.650
I like the next brother who had the fucking try to outdo them.

314
00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.810
That's what we're doing.
We went right over the cliff.

315
00:18:49.811 --> 00:18:53.260
Now spending 200 fucking million dollars,
200 million goddamn dollars,

316
00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:58.420
the middle child,
the fucking middle child.
Um,

317
00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:59.031
but anyways,
we,

318
00:18:59.031 --> 00:19:02.950
we went nine and one in the last 10 games were up for games on the Yankees over

319
00:19:02.951 --> 00:19:05.230
there.
Thank you to the Tampa Bay devil rays.

320
00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:09.280
I'm still calling you the devil race instead of the race.

321
00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.740
Ray's Pizza,

322
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.060
<v 3>Ray Romano,
the ball.
Come on,
right?</v>

323
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.570
<v 1>What are you,
you're the devil race.
Um,</v>

324
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.390
that's gotta be one of the don't like,

325
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.030
that's one of another thing goes back to that Colin Kaepernick thing.

326
00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:27.080
Like it's a fucking,

327
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.280
it's just gets a corporation is everybody tries to put race on it.

328
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.550
At the end of the day,
it's a fucking corporation and that's what it is.

329
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:37.010
All you have to do is look at the Tampa Bay devil rays.

330
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.300
There was probably nine Jesus freaks that weren't going to buy a fucking devil

331
00:19:41.301 --> 00:19:46.301
rays tee shirt and God forbid they lose that fucking hundred and 60 bucks or

332
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.090
whatever,
whatever,
whatever.
180 bucks.
Say That 20 bucks a whack.
Right?

333
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.300
God forbid that that goes out the door.

334
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.810
They take the fuck they took the devil right off it.

335
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.500
We're losing our a Jesus Freak,
a fan base.

336
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:07.790
You know,
and I think that's what the NFL is doing with Colin Kaepernick.

337
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:12.920
God forbid they lose the racist dollar.
That's what it is.

338
00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:17.140
They are catering to the racist by not putting this guy on cause they don't want

339
00:20:17.141 --> 00:20:22.141
to lose cause a racist dollars are also great and that's all they give a shit

340
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:26.960
about,
right?
They don't give a fuck.
Look at the fucking Goddamn Tigers.

341
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.440
They gonna fingerprint their own fucking fat.

342
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.390
What do you think those tigers front office is going to do with that
information?

343
00:20:35.391 --> 00:20:36.950
Where do you think they're going to sell that?

344
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:45.170
Do you know what?
This is the thing,
most people,
I swear to God,

345
00:20:45.171 --> 00:20:46.370
I hate to be this cynical,

346
00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:50.500
but they just just fucking go into life and they're looking for like someone

347
00:20:50.501 --> 00:20:52.360
else to fill the role of their parents.

348
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.100
And that's why the micro chipping the fingerprints,

349
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.200
all of that will be inevitable because there's so many people who should be

350
00:20:59.201 --> 00:21:03.640
walking around wearing a fucking diaper.
I hate to say,
but they do,
you know,

351
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.860
oh,
he's crying.
Life fucked me over there.
You know what?

352
00:21:07.861 --> 00:21:10.800
I'm going to start selling.
I'm going to start selling adult size rattles

353
00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:18.000
as I sit here and whining and crying about sports.
I got a lot of fucking nerve.

354
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.250
You know,
that's one of the great things about me.
I'm just,

355
00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.760
I'm a God damn hypocrite.
Hey,
guess what?
I got to,
I got a,
uh,

356
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.130
I've got a Gopro for my birthday last year and I finally,
um,

357
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.710
head Andrew come over and show me how to fucking get the thing going.

358
00:21:31.711 --> 00:21:34.470
I just saw the wires in the small printing.
I just like,

359
00:21:34.471 --> 00:21:37.740
I'm never going to figure that out.
I can't get it out of the case.

360
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.300
I actually got this thing to film when I was flying,
uh,
you know,

361
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:46.560
the helicopter and uh,
I got all the shit that I needed and I just,

362
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.600
I don't know.
Oh,
I know.

363
00:21:48.601 --> 00:21:52.500
I fucked up my back last year so I couldn't fly because my feet were going numb

364
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:53.573
there.
Yeah.

365
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:55.023
<v 0>MMM.</v>

366
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.450
<v 1>So anyways,
I let him,
let me read a little bit of advertising.</v>

367
00:21:57.451 --> 00:21:59.740
Can we try to gracefully get out of this?
Um,

368
00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.610
I feel bad about that Sklar podcast cause I think they thought I really got

369
00:22:02.611 --> 00:22:06.030
upset.
It's just,
I don't think they know me well enough to be like,
no,

370
00:22:06.031 --> 00:22:09.330
that's just kinda how the fuck I get when I talk about sports to somebody's

371
00:22:09.331 --> 00:22:10.980
bugging me in two seconds later.

372
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:15.900
<v 0>you know,
it,
it's,
it's gone.
You know,</v>

373
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:20.230
<v 1>it will come back,
but I mean it's gone.
It's over.
All right,

392
00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:29.800

I went to one of those,
Lord of the rings.
I swear to God,

393
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.860
I thought it,
I thought the movie was over like 19 times.
It kept fading down.

394
00:23:34.861 --> 00:23:37.620
I'm like,

There must be a mega church.
Come on down to a mega church.</v>

407
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.320
I was listening to Joel Olsteen on the way over here,
you know,

408
00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.900
and he's like the Pied Piper of fucking losers.

409
00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.770
He's always talking about people losing in life.
You know what I mean?
It's like,

410
00:24:28.771 --> 00:24:33.300
don't do any winners.
Go to your church.
He's always like,
I know you fucking,

411
00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:37.680
I know.
Uh,
I know your plumbing doesn't work.
I know this does he?
You know,

412
00:24:37.681 --> 00:24:41.820
but God wants you.
God wants you to have work and water.
Blink,
blink,
blink,
blink,

413
00:24:41.821 --> 00:24:44.190
blink,
blink,
blink.
All right,
lift everybody.

414
00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:49.510
Lyft knows that their drivers are what keeps them moving.
Well,

415
00:24:49.511 --> 00:24:51.570
Jesus,
and why aren't they had a meeting to figure that out.

416
00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:55.560
So they do everything they can to make sure that drivers are happy on every
trip.

417
00:24:56.070 --> 00:25:00.170
Lyft was the first to order in APP tipping.
When you drive for lip,

418
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.950
you keep 100% of the tips.

419
00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:06.120
Drivers had been paid over $200 million in tips since the feature was
introduced.

420
00:25:06.121 --> 00:25:09.690
That's really great though.
You know,
that's like that Guy Papa John's pizza.

421
00:25:09.691 --> 00:25:14.090
I was watching that.
Jaylin Jaylin dot.
Jay's garage.
And that guy,
uh,

422
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.980
the guy who does the Papa John's pizzas,
you know,

423
00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:20.280
he had to sell his car to keep his dad's Bargo and he was making the pizza in

424
00:25:20.281 --> 00:25:25.281
the back end in 1971 like core Camaro z 28 gold with the black stripes.

425
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:30.210
And he fucked 20 years,
was looking for the car track down the exact fucking car.

426
00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.810
But he's talking about like 30% of the profits he brings.

427
00:25:32.811 --> 00:25:35.420
He puts back into the business as far as like,
you know,

428
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.260
given bonuses to all of us employees.

429
00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.450
I don't know why more corporations don't do that.

430
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.903
<v 4>You know,</v>

431
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.740
<v 1>why don't you do that then people are happy to work for you.</v>

432
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.140
And then when I walk into buy,
order a pizza,

433
00:25:48.141 --> 00:25:52.890
I don't get some grumpy ass holes getting fucked over
who?
No,
I dunno.

434
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.530
Why the same reason why they won't send Colin Kaepernick.
Uh,

435
00:25:56.531 --> 00:26:01.390
express page lets drivers get paid almost instantly instead of waiting for
weeks.

436
00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.940
Lyft has even taken the guesswork out of pickups.

437
00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:08.320
The new amp device uses color coding to help passengers find their drivers.

438
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.650
You can earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips.
What are earning more money?

439
00:26:11.651 --> 00:26:14.650
Drive more.
It's never been easier to give yourself a raise.

440
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.530
It's a simple formula.
Happy drivers mean happy passages.

441
00:26:17.531 --> 00:26:21.370
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating.

442
00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.610
So join the ride sharing company that believes in treating its people better.

I absolutely would have done that during the fucking day.
I do it now.

I do it at night.
We funny to fucking pick up drunk people and shit.
You know,

452
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.370
I mean,
until they puke in the back seat of your car.

453
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:58.833
<v 0>Uh,</v>

454
00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:04.250
<v 1>I don't know.
I would actually get into that job.
Play some good tunes,
you know.</v>

455

Nice smelling car.
Alright.

Ego next to you.

457
00:27:11.331 --> 00:27:15.350

Gets to be like a psychologist.

458

It's like a fucking bartender driving around.

<v 1>It's part of being an old right there.

like if you ever bring your toes back towards you,

514

you know,
you stretch in the morning,
you start pointing your toes,
your face,

515
00:30:50.821 --> 00:30:54.600
you've legs cramp up immediately.

Now,

523
00:31:17.781 --> 00:31:21.890
from what I've been told,
the reason why that is getting back to the,
uh,

524
00:31:21.891 --> 00:31:25.910
the cramping in your legs.
All right?
If you go the other way is,

525
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:30.670
is it's sorta like a ying and a Yang,
you know what I mean?

526
00:31:30.671 --> 00:31:33.690
The muscles on the front of your body versus the back of your body.
Like I,

527
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.160
my shoulders got fucked up cause I was doing pushups.

528
00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.050
I was doing curls out too and all that,

529
00:31:38.051 --> 00:31:41.380
but I wasn't doing enough back exercises so my shoulders started rolling
forward.

530
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.890
All right,
there's a balance.
So whatever the fuck you do,

531
00:31:44.891 --> 00:31:49.000
I don't know medically what happens,
but if you do the exact opposite motion,

532
00:31:49.001 --> 00:31:53.470
when you get that cramp,
it fucking whatever's tightening up,
then release this.

533
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.590
Now you go.
And you know what,
after I tried to explain it,

534
00:31:56.591 --> 00:32:00.280
you're no closer to understanding it.
Okay?
I'm all,
by the way,

535
00:32:00.281 --> 00:32:04.990
I did the gym Jeffrey show this week.
Uh,
I'll,
I'll tweet out a link for that.
Um,

536
00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.660
I had a great time on that.
What a great interview.
Or He is,
you know,

537
00:32:07.661 --> 00:32:11.740
I didn't know how that was going to go to fucking Comedians,
you know,

538
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.710
was shit that they want to say.
I was,
uh,

539
00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.260
I felt like I do when I'm on Conan,

540
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.690
we're Conan is like an old school Johnny Carson guy where it's like if you're

541
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:25.840
killing,
he lets you go.
He laughs at your jokes.
He makes you look great.

542
00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:29.230
If you start struggling,
he comes to the rescue,

543
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:32.640
<v 0>right.
And um,</v>

544
00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.740
<v 1>Jim Jefferies was the exact same way old school fucking guy,</v>

545
00:32:36.741 --> 00:32:40.850
so a highly recommend watching that show.
Um,

546
00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.820
so he was killing,
he was killing so hard,

547
00:32:43.821 --> 00:32:46.640
like even just doing like some stuff where he was just doing like,
hey,

548
00:32:46.641 --> 00:32:49.460
Seattle watched the show,
blah,
blah,
blah,
whatever you call those things.

549
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:54.290
He was killing so hard when he was just messing those up.

550
00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.860
Like just constantly was killing that.

551
00:32:57.861 --> 00:33:01.790
I was standing backstage like laughing,
thinking like,
this guy doesn't need me.

552
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.950
He really doesn't need me as a,
I appreciate them having me young,

553
00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:10.700
but he really could have just done this by himself.
He really is.
Um,

554
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.570
you know,
when you go see Jim Jeffries,
I mean,
I'm,
I'm not,

555
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:18.380
I don't think I'm bullshitting when I would say that guy's probably cause

556
00:33:18.381 --> 00:33:22.700
everybody's top five,
top three,
you know,
that's always arguable.
You know,

557
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:26.300
you can argue,
you,
whoever you think is the best.
He's without a doubt.

558
00:33:26.301 --> 00:33:28.160
I would say top three in the fucking world.

559
00:33:28.161 --> 00:33:30.360
He's like one of the best comedians in the fucking world.
It's,

560
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:34.730
that's the real deal.
So a check out his show,
please come out.

561
00:33:34.731 --> 00:33:39.731
There's still a few tickets left for a Paul versus a special and

562
00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.200
Jera Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh.
Above than 33 minutes.
Okay.

563
00:33:45.201 --> 00:33:48.300
Please enjoy this music here.
Um,

564
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:51.260
I'm going to try out my GoPro.

565
00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.300
I'm very excited to try this thing out to see what comes about this.

566
00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:01.220
And um,
I've been threatening to do a show of me driving around,

567
00:34:01.221 --> 00:34:01.821
freaking out.

568
00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:04.190
I don't even know if I need to put that out there any more of me fucking

569
00:34:04.191 --> 00:34:07.580
freaking out.
I do it enough on podcasts and shit,
but uh,
we'll see.

570
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:08.211
We'll see where it goes.

571
00:34:08.211 --> 00:34:13.211
So enjoy this music as we transition into a a Thursday afternoon podcast from a

572
00:34:15.831 --> 00:34:19.490
Thursday from,
I dunno,
when a joy and uh,
hey,

573
00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.020
shout out to Darren King and,

574
00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:26.060
and the unbelievable drumming that he did when he was with mute math and good

575
00:34:26.061 --> 00:34:30.710
luck to him and all of his future projects and good luck to mute math,

576
00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:35.240
um,
on their upcoming tour.
Um,

577
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.240
I forget the drum is named Dave Hutchinson or something like that.

578
00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:41.210
They got to replace Darren King.
Uh,

579
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.960
umass new album is coming out in September.
I've already preordered it,

580
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.860
very excited,

581
00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:49.840
very excited to see them on this tour and very excited to see what Darren's

582
00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:54.710
going to be doing,
um,
with whatever his next project is.
A,
that's it.

583
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.250
Okay.
Thank you guys for listening.
Have a great weekend.
You can send,
I'll uh,

584
00:34:58.410 --> 00:34:59.330
I'll talk to you on Monday.

585
00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:06.953
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

586
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.273
<v 4>I don't know</v>

587
00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:34.470
<v 1>all over the map politically.
That's why like,
you know,</v>

588
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.980
certain ways of looking at shit,
like when

589
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.080
<v 5>people talk about guns,
let's just make them all,</v>

590
00:35:40.081 --> 00:35:44.430
let's just make them illegal and then no,
we all have them.
You know,

591
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.340
like that sort of like thought process is your,

592
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:52.580
you're acting as though the world is a utopia and that there's not morons and

593
00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:57.510
that there's not,
uh,
people who say,
I don't give a fuck what the rules are.

594
00:35:57.511 --> 00:36:02.511
You're totally not even taking into consideration sociopath's which is why that

595
00:36:02.791 --> 00:36:04.800
new fucking thing that Obama signed,

596
00:36:04.801 --> 00:36:09.510
that whole defense package where now they can just arrest people without a trial

597
00:36:09.511 --> 00:36:12.060
j and put you in jail forever with,

598
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:14.970
without a trial because they just think you're a fucking terrorist.

599
00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:18.000
Dki can't give people that level of power.

600
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.380
I'm a fucking moron and I know you can't do that.
Historically,

601
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.350
no one has ever handled that level of power.
Well,

602
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.600
anybody here want to go live in China?
Now we,

603
00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.920
you're out there practicing your nunchucks wearing your wooden slippers and all

604
00:36:31.921 --> 00:36:34.950
of a sudden the van pulls up and you disappear and that set forever.

605
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:36.660
You want to live there.
Of course you don't.

606
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.330
You want to live here where they can't fucking do it while they can do it now

607
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.220
you know?
They just put in a fucking order for a bunch of black fans.

608
00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:48.420
That's what I heard.
Gordon,
the Holy shit.com that's what's going down.

609
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:53.810
I don't understand why stuff at that level that affects citizens to that level.

610
00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:57.630
Why we don't get to vote on it.

611
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:03.300
Do you think it's because we'd say,
Hey,
you know what?
Fuck that.

612
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.900
Do you want to stand like that is just a jump off point.

613
00:37:06.901 --> 00:37:08.760
Do you think like that's just how it's going to stall as well.

614
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.370
You're not a terrorist in there.
You're gonna fucking problem.

615
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.590
You think it's just going to stop with that.

616
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.140
That's not how you take away freedom.

617
00:37:16.141 --> 00:37:19.380
You don't just fucking do it all in one fail swoop.
It's incremental.

618
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:22.130
It's just like when you're dating some fucking woman eating,

619
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.120
not paying attention and she just gradually,

620
00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:25.860
every day it takes another foot of real estate.

621
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.930
Next thing you know you're in goal line d going,

622
00:37:27.931 --> 00:37:32.610
how the fuck did I end up in this situation?
We started at the 50 little push,

623
00:37:32.611 --> 00:37:34.190
a little poll,
right?
Everything was fine.

624
00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.830
[inaudible] you're up against the goals that you think that they're just going

625
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.480
to keep it with the terrorist thing,
you know?

626
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.440
You know they'll wait for a whole nother generation of babies to be born and

627
00:37:43.441 --> 00:37:46.770
they always grew up with government having that level of power and then they add

628
00:37:46.771 --> 00:37:49.890
something else to it than they had something else.
Then that's it.

629
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.070
You can't have it.
Okay.

630
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:58.140
If Tiger Woods can't handle the level of free pussy on a golf tour,

631
00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:03.590
how the fuck is our government going to handle a new defense package?

632
00:38:05.131 --> 00:38:09.630
Which basically gave them a mute button.
When you love the,

633
00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:13.350
ha ha ha.
How would you handle that if you had that power,
do you,

634
00:38:13.351 --> 00:38:16.380
how long before you just started abusing that?

635
00:38:16.381 --> 00:38:21.060
If you could just hit mute on anybody who ever disagreed with you and then just

636
00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:22.920
you could have them whisked away.

637
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:32.400
I mean that is a sociopath's wet dream.
That's what that is.

638
00:38:32.401 --> 00:38:35.680
That is a fucking mute button,
ms Ms.
Dot.

639
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:40.480
And don't you think that's it?
He hit mute.
You're done.
You're gone.
See Ya.

640
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:42.450
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

641
00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:46.800
<v 5>I think,
I think it's fucking insane.
And I'm,</v>

642
00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:52.170
the only thing that I get out of it is that I feel like I was proven correct

643
00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.080
that I don't think it matters at that level.

644
00:38:55.081 --> 00:38:59.610
Whether you vote Democrat or Republican Obama,
the first black president ever,

645
00:38:59.611 --> 00:39:04.611
you would think this would be the most liberal a politician in the history of

646
00:39:05.461 --> 00:39:08.670
this country
because of his background.

647
00:39:08.671 --> 00:39:10.890
You would think that he signed off on that shit.

648
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.333
<v 4>Okay.</v>

649
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.520
<v 5>All right.
I'm telling you,
I don't know what happens when you become president,</v>

650
00:39:16.521 --> 00:39:20.930
but I think they let you peek just enough behind the curtain and you there,

651
00:39:20.931 --> 00:39:24.830
there was a fucking agenda that we are moving towards because it does,

652
00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:27.440
I don't think of fucking matters.
I really don't,

653
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:32.800
which is why I always vote for the Ralph Nater,

654
00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:37.550
the fucking Ron Paul,
all those guys that all those fucking idiots go to.

655
00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:42.860
Cause you did that.
You've ruined the election.
Really?
Did I,

656
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.000
I feel like those guys wouldn't have signed shit like that.

657
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:51.390
I feel like their track record shows that they would not sign shit like that.

658
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:54.040
<v 4>Um,
I,
I don't know.</v>

659
00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.980
<v 5>I have no,
I imagine I'm going to get a ton of fucking emails I'm on with.</v>

660
00:39:57.981 --> 00:40:01.430
Somebody was yelling at me one time saying that because I voted for Ralph Nader

661
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:04.520
in 2000.
That's why George W.
Bush one.

662
00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.820
And they were just going on and on and on about it.
And I was like,
dude,

663
00:40:08.821 --> 00:40:13.650
I live in New York.
Al Gore won my state.
Okay.

664
00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:15.270
Do you have a stand that,

665
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:18.240
so your whole fucking theory right now is out the window.

666
00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:22.710
I voted for Ralph Nader in New York and Al Gore still won the state.

667
00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:27.420
So go fuck yourself.
What I'm trying to do,
uh,
um,

668
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:29.970
Mister fucking red and blue tie here.

669
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:34.050
I'm trying to fucking encourage more people like that to vote.

670
00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.590
So mission accomplished.
That's what I'm trying to fuck and have to vote to run,

671
00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:39.873
<v 4>you know,</v>

672
00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:46.470
<v 5>uncorruptible how far can you get if you're uncorruptible I would say that you</v>

673
00:40:46.471 --> 00:40:47.580
can get to the,

674
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:49.063
<v 4>uh,</v>

675
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:54.800
<v 5>whatever level politics is when you decide whether or not they should put a</v>

676
00:40:54.801 --> 00:40:59.780
gazebo in the center of town.
I think beat once you get beyond that,
you got it.

677
00:40:59.781 --> 00:41:01.080
You gotta be a little dirty.
Right.

678
00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:07.190
I love talking about this shit cause it just stirs people up,
you know?
Um,

679
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:07.561
you know,

680
00:41:07.561 --> 00:41:11.580
maybe you should all read a little more before the next time you fucking own.

681
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:17.220
Really.
What are you reading?
What are you reading?
What they give you?

682
00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.810
Is that what you're reading?
Fuck head.

683
00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.630
Why you acting like you have clearance to the bottom of the floors of the

684
00:41:21.631 --> 00:41:26.490
fucking Pentagon,
you're guessing?
Just like I am.
All right,
Mr.
Informed.

685
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:31.170
I read the pamphlet.
I don't buy a fucking word of it.

686
00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.293
<v 4>You know,</v>

687
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:38.870
<v 6>you can use coca cola to take rust off of metal.
You can use it for that.</v>

688
00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:39.733
You know,

689
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:45.110
you understand that yet they're still able to sell it to us.

690
00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:46.040
Like it's refreshing.

691
00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.140
I Dunno what that point meant either.

692
00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:54.063
<v 2>Wow.</v>

693
00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:51.653
[inaudible] [inaudible]

694
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:04.940
<v 6>hey,
what's going on?</v>

695
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:08.360
It's built bar and this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

696
00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.980
August the 10th 2009 that I'm actually doing on Tuesday,

697
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:18.550
August the 11th because a DHS wasn't enough hours in the day.

698
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:23.760
Oh my God,
I got fell swamps.
No,
I did.
I don't know what happened.
Um,

699
00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:27.980
I know what happened.
I had a big audition for something and uh,

700
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.250
I had to just keep doing the audition over and over again.

701
00:43:31.251 --> 00:43:34.270
And when I wasn't doing that,
I was curled up in the fetal position.
Go on,

702
00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:38.040
please bill,
don't fuck this up.
This is a big opportunity.
Unfortunately,

703
00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:38.953
I did not,

704
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:44.240
whether they pick me a knot is out of my hands,
but,
um,

705
00:43:44.241 --> 00:43:45.770
and then I just said a bunch of other shit.

706
00:43:45.771 --> 00:43:49.970
Why does it sound like it's echoing in here?
I Dunno.

707
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:53.840
I'm trying a new recording level,
uh,
this week,
by the way,
people,

708
00:43:53.841 --> 00:43:56.270
I don't know if the quality's going to suffer,
but,
um,

709
00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:02.120
I had a number of people and by a number,
I mean like six,
um,

710
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:05.690
which I think is about one third of my listeners.
So it was big to me.
Uh,

711
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:10.580
we're saying that a,
I needed to get more bandwidth or I needed to do something.

712
00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:14.750
Basically,
they couldn't download my,
uh,

713
00:44:14.751 --> 00:44:17.300
my podcast off of iTunes or whatever,

714
00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:22.220
and somebody finally called it to my attention that I was recording at music

715
00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:25.070
level quality.
So my files were huge.

716
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:29.450
And considering that I wasn't recording musical instruments,

717
00:44:29.451 --> 00:44:33.570
that I could actually recorded a lower and they would be smaller files,

718
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.680
thus easier to download.
So I said,
I know what I'm gonna do.

719
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.890
I'm going to fucking go find the owner's manual and I'm going to figure out how

720
00:44:42.891 --> 00:44:46.800
to do that.
And,
uh,
even though I have a little file,

721
00:44:46.801 --> 00:44:49.940
a little little fucking,
a big piece of Tupperware,

722
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.200
whatever the fuck you call a big plastic bin that's going to be here 9,000 years

723
00:44:54.201 --> 00:44:56.030
from now,
um,

724
00:44:56.031 --> 00:45:00.890
I have all my owner's manuals for everything I ever bought except for my Olympus

725
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:02.330
Ellis 10.
I don't know where the fuck it is.

726
00:45:02.331 --> 00:45:07.331
So I just went into menu and I put it on MP3 and I'm recording at 128 Gaf

727
00:45:09.371 --> 00:45:12.080
fucking killer.
What's a,
what's a white's?
Whatever the fuck you call them.

728
00:45:12.081 --> 00:45:14.540
I don't know what the,
I don't know what it is.
So I'm going to try it this week.

729
00:45:14.541 --> 00:45:17.770
So you guys give me a feedback,
let me know how the quality sounds.

730
00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:22.210
Was it easier to download?
Was it harder to download?

731
00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:27.160
Was it the same?
Was it just a feudal fucking attempt?

732
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:31.040
Um,
anyways,
I almost did a bad bit.
Right?
They're like,

733
00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:34.910
why is it that you can find everything?
[inaudible] you look good.

734
00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:40.220
Um,
all right,
I got a lot of stories for you.
Why this week?
Let's start off with,

735
00:45:40.221 --> 00:45:41.570
I had a,
uh,
you know,

736
00:45:41.571 --> 00:45:46.230
I had a nice disagreement this morning was somebody in particular and um,

737
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:51.250
I realized in that fight that the secret to success is,

738
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.720
uh,
basically,
I mean,
I'm sure somebody's already written a book about this,

739
00:45:54.721 --> 00:45:59.310
but I don't read.
So I'm feeling like I'm breaking new ground here.

740
00:45:59.311 --> 00:46:04.311
The secret to success in life is the word yes and the word no.

741
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:10.380
That is it.
If you want to be a happy person,
if somebody says,

742
00:46:10.381 --> 00:46:15.090
do you want to do this shit and you want to do it?
Say Yes,

743
00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:20.700
yes,
I do.
And then if they're like,
but do you want to do this shit?

744
00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:25.000
And you don't say no.
I don't know.

745
00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:28.680
I know that sounds simple,
but it's afterwards.

746
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:33.750
That is the hard part and I feel as the reason why so many people say yes when

747
00:46:33.751 --> 00:46:38.751
they mean no and vice versa is because basically the fucking reaction of the

748
00:46:40.051 --> 00:46:40.884
other person,

749
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:45.330
you have to just completely block out their reaction.

750
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:48.810
You know?
Do you want to do this?
No,
I don't.

751
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:54.180
Usually when you say no negative,
don't want to do it,

752
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:58.140
the other person is just like,
like,
why?
Why don't you want to do it?

753
00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:02.220
I thought it'd be fun.
I thought we could do it together.

754
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.280
I thought it would be a choice.
Trouble.
Why don't you want to do it?

755
00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:10.460
Because you asked me and the first fucking thing in me,

756
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:16.350
wherever that voices him,
he said,
no,
I don't want to do it.

757
00:47:16.351 --> 00:47:18.960
So then I said no,
right.

758
00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:23.130
I heard what you said and I am going to fucking speak it out loud.

759
00:47:23.131 --> 00:47:27.480
So this other person,
because they can't hear my inner voice.
No.
The answer is no.

760
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:31.960
And then they always go,
you're ridiculous.
You just,
you just being a jerk.

761
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:36.460
You're being crazy.
Really?
Is that what my inner voice is a jerk?

762
00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.570
You know,
how many French I want to ask you guys,

763
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:43.250
how many friendships in your life do you have right now where,
uh,

764
00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:45.610
you can actually say,
no,
I don't want to do that shit.

765
00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:47.890
And the other person's cool with it.
You know,

766
00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:49.210
people will give you a little bit of grief,

767
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:52.630
but you've got gotta be careful because a lot of times there's a lot of cops out

768
00:47:52.631 --> 00:47:55.690
there and uh,
how they deem somebody,

769
00:47:55.691 --> 00:48:00.430
a friend is basically that they do everything that they want them to do,

770
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:03.850
you know?
And then the second you start going,
hey,
you know,

771
00:48:03.851 --> 00:48:06.070
I really don't feel like doing that stuff,
dude,

772
00:48:06.071 --> 00:48:09.670
you changed what the fucks with you.
God,
go fuck yourself.
You're a cunt.

773
00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:11.550
All right.
What do you,

774
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.350
what do you think you're perfect and you always have the best idea.

775
00:48:14.351 --> 00:48:17.560
Go Fuck Yourself.
I don't want to do what you want to do right now.
You know,

776
00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:22.120
I just got a big God damn argument because uh,

777
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:26.530
I want the foot to find out what the fuck was about as far as I was trying to

778
00:48:26.531 --> 00:48:30.100
tell me.
I never want to fucking do anything.
Let me not want to do anything.

779
00:48:30.101 --> 00:48:34.600
I want to do my Monday morning podcast.
You saying that's nothing.
Okay.

780
00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.470
Cause if you are,
I'll tell you I got 18 listeners.
You have to,

781
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:42.010
you have to fucking talk to buddy.
What else?
That's all I'm saying.

782
00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:45.430
All right.
Somebody asked you if you want to do something,
if you want to do it,

783
00:48:45.431 --> 00:48:47.410
say yes.
If you don't want to do is say no.

784
00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.860
Okay and fuck their reaction unless they can kick the shit out of you.

785
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:53.890
At which point you say,
yeah,
I'd love to.

786
00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:56.710
And then you sort of mutter to yourself the rest of the evening,

787
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:04.780
and then what you do is on the side,
you start taking some martial art classes,

788
00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:09.610
either that or you call a moving company that can pack up all your shit and move

789
00:49:09.611 --> 00:49:14.260
it to another state while other person who can kick the shit out of you as it

790
00:49:14.261 --> 00:49:16.960
work.
That's how you do it.
Okay?

791
00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:23.200
There's nothing wrong.
I think the word coward is overused.
Um,

792
00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:24.810
you know,

793
00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:27.670
and I think it's used by the person who wanted to kick the shit out of you,

794
00:49:27.671 --> 00:49:31.600
but you were smart enough not to be in the vicinity of them to let them,

795
00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:33.300
you're not,
you know,
how are you?
Work hard.

796
00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:38.050
You don't let me fucking smash your face into your fucking ear.
You Coward.

797
00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:40.960
Well,
you know,
Dude,
uh,
I listened to my inner voice,
man.

798
00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:44.560
Her voice did not want my nose over by my ears,
so I decided to avoid it.

799
00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:49.870
Yes.
You know,
you are stronger than me.
You can kick the shit out of me.
Okay?

800
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:55.420
But you know,
that doesn't mean I'm,
I'm not better at checkers.
You know,

801
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.820
this is something that is a subject.
You can pick that I'm better at the Eh,

802
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:04.360
at it than you,
but it may maybe fighting's not one of them.
What does it,
oh,

803
00:50:04.361 --> 00:50:06.790
that's what it always comes down to with guys.
You know,

804
00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:11.800
in the end I can beat the fuck out of you.
So therefore I'm right.

805
00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:16.200
You know.
Oh Jesus,
I'm getting deep here.
Isn't that how the world works?
Huh?

806
00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:19.440
Might is right.
Isn't that what,
Oh,

807
00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:21.640
isn't that how everybody's foreign policy works?

808
00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.270
You fucking seeing other country and they have some shit that you want.

809
00:50:25.271 --> 00:50:28.160
So what do you do?
Do you say,
hey,
how's it going?

810
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:31.490
How are you maybe do that beginning just so that you can get within fucking

811
00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:34.670
striking distance and then you grab them by the front of their button down,

812
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.770
you know,
and you sort of lift them up off the ground.

813
00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:38.840
So part of their shirt is obscuring their view.

814
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:43.310
So they don't see the overhand right coming.
Isn't that what we do?
Isn't it?

815
00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.110
I don't fucking know.
You know,

816
00:50:45.111 --> 00:50:47.440
I was watching how the Bill Maher show the other day and he was,
uh,

817
00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:49.980
yesterday actually.
And,
um,

818
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.720
at the end of the show he was giving out these statistics and he was saying

819
00:50:56.001 --> 00:51:00.920
stuff like,
uh,
he's basically talking about how fucking stupid Americans are,

820
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.980
which I'm really getting tired of that,
you know,

821
00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:07.700
I'm not saying we're not fucking stupid,
I'm just like,
as compared to who,

822
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:12.020
you know,
I've,
you know,
I haven't traveled to a lot of places,

823
00:51:12.021 --> 00:51:16.520
but I've been to some places that were not flying the American flag and there's

824
00:51:16.521 --> 00:51:21.230
just as many fucking morons,
you know,
if everybody is smart,

825
00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:26.240
then there's no smart guys.
You're just regular,
you know what I mean?
Jesus.

826
00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:30.590
Wow.
Bill,
that was fucking deep.
Fuck you.
Fuck you want for me?

827
00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:33.680
I'm just saying,
you know what I mean?
So anyway,
so he's doing this poll,
actually,

828
00:51:33.681 --> 00:51:37.370
I actually really like your show.
One of the things I love about Bill Maher is,

829
00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:42.230
uh,
he's not really likable and he doesn't seem to give a fuck.
And,
you know,

830
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:44.840
I mean,
yeah,
I mean,

831
00:51:44.841 --> 00:51:48.320
does that the kind of person you want to have over for dinner?
Probably not,
but,

832
00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:51.800
uh,
that's a good recipe for getting a lot of pussy in life.
Um,

833
00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:56.000
well we'll discuss that later.
Um,
plowing ahead here.

834
00:51:56.001 --> 00:52:00.620
So he starts doing all these polls and he's sitting there going,
you know,

835
00:52:00.621 --> 00:52:05.621
18% only 18% of Americans could name a new,

836
00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:11.860
Oh knew that there was two senators for every state and a only 11% could name

837
00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.590
who there,
you know,

838
00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:19.520
so immediately that's supposed to make it seem like everybody's dumb.

839
00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.150
And my first thought was,
okay,
18%

840
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:28.160
can know that you get two senators per state,
but I bet you know,

841
00:52:28.161 --> 00:52:32.630
a good 28% could explain the cover two defense.
You know,

842
00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.670
it just depends on what the fuck you're into.

843
00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:38.420
I like when people are really into something and you're not into it and then

844
00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:40.400
they consider you stupid.
I mean,
granted,

845
00:52:40.401 --> 00:52:45.020
we are talking about the people who determine how,
uh,
we live our lives.

846
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:50.030
Actually they don't.
That's the illusion.
You know,
it's the fucking bankers.

847
00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.040
Okay.
They run everything,
man.
I'm telling you,

848
00:52:52.041 --> 00:52:53.340
I'm not gonna do that again this weekend.

849
00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:56.570
Embarrass myself with my incredible lack of knowledge,
but,
you know,

850
00:52:58.070 --> 00:52:58.903
whatever.

851
00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:04.810
I just don't think people are as fucking dumb as they're lazy,

852
00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:09.590
you know?
But the way they,
they really just depict people out there,

853
00:53:09.591 --> 00:53:13.220
like people are just walking around with their fucking mouth is hanging open,

854
00:53:13.221 --> 00:53:16.490
not realizing that they're drooling.
All of the,

855
00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:20.900
all over the front of that Kenny Chesney shirt.
And I,
you know,
Kenny Chesney is,

856
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:22.310
I mean,
I know he's a country singer.

857
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:26.700
Was that the one who was married to that chick who's face squints up whenever

858
00:53:26.701 --> 00:53:29.110
she smiles.
Yeah.

859
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:33.480
And they were married for like three days ball.
Dude.
Is that a little fuck?
It is.

860
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:38.280
Huh?
I don't know.
I can't stand country music.
It's just depressing.

861
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.920
It's depressing and it's Geeky

862
00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:46.230
and everybody sings like they,
they're in puberty.
There you go.

863
00:53:46.231 --> 00:53:47.550
That was nice generalizations,
Huh?

864
00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:56.090
Oh Woo.
That shit.
I can't fuck it.
Stay on that.
And,
um,

865
00:53:56.150 --> 00:54:00.620
I don't like rednecks blind pride in being an American,

866
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.863
you know,

867
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:06.440
cause it always involves sticking a boot up somebody's ass or whatever the fuck.

868
00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:10.940
It's just like,
why can't you be here and just be happy,
you know,

869
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:14.690
and watch to a fucking farming equipments.

870
00:54:14.691 --> 00:54:19.691
Try to pull in opposite directions as you fucking rear your head back and

871
00:54:19.821 --> 00:54:24.200
fucking scream at the moon.
There's nothing wrong with that.

872
00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:26.480
There's fucking nothing wrong with that.

873
00:54:26.481 --> 00:54:30.530
Why do you gotta be so Goddamn and why you gotta be like me and be angry?
Huh?

874
00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:35.360
You Straw.
I had cut.
All right.
Uh,
moving on.
Um,

875
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:38.060
so my dog,
uh,
is,

876
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:43.070
she's in heat right now cause she hasn't been fixed.
And uh,
yeah,

877
00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:46.970
it looks like a fucking crime scene around here because she's a female and I'm

878
00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:49.450
going to leave it at that.
And uh,

879
00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:53.180
she scheduled to be mutilated later on this month.

880
00:54:57.230 --> 00:55:01.640
That's really what it is.
Mutilated.
I'm gonna have my dog mutilated.

881
00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:02.570
I'm against it,

882
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:07.160
but I got tired of arguing about it and uh,

883
00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.280
you know,
I don't,

884
00:55:10.281 --> 00:55:13.880
I don't understand why you have to have your dog.

885
00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:18.350
I just don't fucking get it.
You know,
I get it.
But you know,

886
00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.810
if everybody did what Bob Barker said,

887
00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:24.680
there'd be no more dogs and cats within 15 years because they'd all be spayed or

888
00:55:24.681 --> 00:55:27.080
neutered,
you know?
And since,

889
00:55:27.081 --> 00:55:32.081
when does a leathery 90 year old know anything about fucking animals when his

890
00:55:32.811 --> 00:55:37.580
main Gig is the host of fucking game show,
you know,

891
00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:41.570
I love how that fat fuck with the itchy beard.
You know,

892
00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:42.890
he gets all shit for his,
oh,

893
00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:46.430
this document I can never met Michael Moore can never remember people's fucking

894
00:55:46.431 --> 00:55:49.790
names.
Is that the same guy who,
who

895
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:56.410
doesn't Michael Moore look like the son of that other fat dude with the itchy

896
00:55:56.511 --> 00:55:59.850
beard,
but it's all white.
You know,

897
00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:03.930
he sort of looks like in a feminine Santa Claus and he wears those red glasses

898
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.520
and he writes like Oscar jokes for,
uh,
uh,

899
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:11.700
Billy crystal.
God,
I suck at names.
Billy Crystal.

900
00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:12.810
You know the guy I'm talking about,

901
00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:15.990
doesn't Michael Moore look like the son of that fucking guy?

902
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:17.520
Hey doesn't this guy who,

903
00:56:17.521 --> 00:56:20.190
I can't remember his fucking name look like the other guy who,

904
00:56:20.191 --> 00:56:22.830
I can't remember his name.
That was really brutal.
I apologize for that.

905
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:26.110
Let's get back to Cleo.
So cleo was doing fucking great,
but the only,

906
00:56:26.111 --> 00:56:29.150
I only have one problem with her.
Um,

907
00:56:29.151 --> 00:56:32.470
the main problem with her is she does not like men.

908
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:36.760
She doesn't like guys.
Um,
unless they come over,

909
00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:39.070
they come over to the house,
you know,

910
00:56:39.071 --> 00:56:41.680
we bring them in and they sit down and she can kind of sniff them out.

911
00:56:41.681 --> 00:56:45.460
Then shit is cool.
But when she walks down the street,

912
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:51.560
um,
you know,
when guy second year is based in somebody's voice,
she's like,
oh,

913
00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:54.880
I don't know.
I'm just such freaking out and a,

914
00:56:54.881 --> 00:56:58.430
I don't know how to stop her from doing it.
I keep disciplining her,
but she,

915
00:56:58.431 --> 00:57:02.440
she really blows me off.
She blows me off with that.
And squirrels,

916
00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:05.620
you know,
she starts dragging me down the fucking street.

917
00:57:05.621 --> 00:57:10.300
I could literally water ski behind this Goddamn Dog.
It's so strong and uh,

918
00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:14.170
I don't know.
Went out to this breakfast place the other day and you know,

919
00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:19.530
this fucking old lady shows up with their husband who has osteoporosis.

920
00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.730
You know,
if you don't know what that is,

921
00:57:21.731 --> 00:57:24.550
you ever see all people who look like they're fascinated with their feet,

922
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:29.590
you know,
that's fucking osteoporosis.
So anyways,
he's fucking comes walking in.

923
00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:35.040
So he looks at my dog who's totally chill and he just keeps staring at her in

924
00:57:35.261 --> 00:57:37.360
the eyes and then she rah Rah Rah Rah Rah Rah.

925
00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:41.470
And then she fucking jumped up at him.
Fucking 90 year old man.
Cleo,

926
00:57:41.471 --> 00:57:42.430
what's wrong with you

927
00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:45.710
<v 5>cleo?
Come over here for a second.</v>

928
00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:49.460
You could make your debut here on Monday morning pocket.
Come here.
Come on,

929
00:57:49.461 --> 00:57:53.420
get over here.
Is there a fucking reason?
Come on,
get up here.

930
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:56.090
Come on.
Is there a reason?

931
00:57:57.140 --> 00:58:02.140
Is there a reason why you fucking try to kill a 90 year old man the other day?

932
00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:08.750
Huh?
That's all you got to say.
Fucking jackass.

933
00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:12.020
She'd seen me jump rope.
I don't know when after the Goddamn Dude,

934
00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:16.630
just sorta lunched
just sort of launched.

935
00:58:16.631 --> 00:58:20.100
This goes probably a veteran of world war two.
Right.
And uh,

936
00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:23.890
then I brought it down and then the old Eddie,
he goes,
is that a Pitbull Bay?

937
00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:28.550
They shouldn't be allowed around paper,
you know,
and I fucking let it go.

938
00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:32.810
Believe it or not.
I did let it go.
I didn't really say really yield fucking bat.

939
00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:35.780
How did you get here?
How'd you drive down the street?

940
00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:38.840
When did you get your fucking driver's license?
Huh?

941
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:41.690
Do they even have driver's license when you fucking cranked your first

942
00:58:41.691 --> 00:58:46.130
automobile?
Huh?
You're wrinkled up.
Pruny little fucking Twat.

943
00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:50.210
I didn't say that.
I just sat there.
I had respired respectful people.
I mean,

944
00:58:50.211 --> 00:58:52.700
I think that shit,
I just don't say it.
I just sat there.

945
00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:53.810
You know when you do that shit,

946
00:58:53.811 --> 00:58:55.760
when someone's yelling at you and you can't yell back at him,

947
00:58:55.761 --> 00:58:59.960
you don't look at them and you do that shit where your lips disappear and make

948
00:58:59.961 --> 00:59:02.510
that thing,
you'll your lips.
Your mouth is a straight line.

949
00:59:02.511 --> 00:59:04.370
You just sit there nodding,
hey,

950
00:59:04.371 --> 00:59:08.240
she got bail out of our paper by at night way or I could get around a goddamn

951
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:09.303
right parking the car.

952
00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:12.080
And I just sat there nodding as everyone else is looking at her.

953
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:16.610
And then it was funny as hell because my dog was totally chill until that evil

954
00:59:16.611 --> 00:59:19.880
old couple showed up.
Like I'm blaming them now,
right?

955
00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:24.170
So after she tells me basically my dog should not be allowed around people,

956
00:59:24.171 --> 00:59:25.850
which is fucking true in a lot of ways.

957
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:29.060
She walks around the corner and then there's just some cute little,

958
00:59:29.061 --> 00:59:32.390
I want to play Frisbee dog.
And the second they came around the corner,

959
00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:36.830
that dog started freaking out.
So you know,

960
00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:42.050
maybe it wasn't my dog.
Cleo,
can you do me a favor?

961
00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:45.500
Can you just not,
if you're going to bite somebody,

962
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:48.830
I'm going to have to go to court.
Okay.

963
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:53.780
And they're probably going to use this podcast is evidence.
You know,
God help me.

964
00:59:53.781 --> 00:59:55.040
If they have used his podcast,

965
00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:58.280
he knew what was going to happen and he called her an old code.

966
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:02.690
Now if you could do me a favor.
Hey,
look at me Cleo.

967
01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:09.040
No,
fuck you two.
Just don't make it.
Somebody old.
Give me a chance.

968
01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:13.060
Just give me a chance to maybe win the court case.

969
01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:15.953
<v 2>Okay.</v>

970
01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.810
<v 5>You liked that.
That's what she does.
When I give her a good scratch,</v>

971
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.100
she starts fucking mountain.

972
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:24.283
<v 2>Ah,</v>

973
01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.810
<v 5>what the fuck am I going to deal with you?</v>

974
01:00:26.811 --> 01:00:29.330
How the hell did you show up in my life?
You know what I like about you though?

975
01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:31.640
You don't ask me to do shit that I don't want to fucking do.

976
01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:34.520
And then when I say I don't want to do it,
you don't act all fucking weird.

977
01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:40.190
Like I got a problem.
So anyways,
that was my week.
That was my weekend.

978
01:00:40.191 --> 01:00:42.920
You know what?
I went 20 days without drinking.
And then I,

979
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:44.750
last night I finally just said,
you know,

980
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:50.600
I actually got scared that eventually I was going to have a drink and,

981
01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.770
but I,
I would have gone like 80 days and then I,

982
01:00:53.771 --> 01:00:57.380
I could never go on a run again of trying to be sober because I know I would

983
01:00:57.381 --> 01:01:00.080
never break if I ever went 80 days being sober,

984
01:01:00.081 --> 01:01:01.640
there's no fuck that would be like,
you know,

985
01:01:01.641 --> 01:01:04.430
trying to beat Joe Dimaggio's hitting streak.
There's no fucking,
it's like,

986
01:01:04.431 --> 01:01:07.870
why even try,
you know?
So I,

987
01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:12.740
I called it quits at 20 and I am ashamed at what I called it quits with.

988
01:01:12.741 --> 01:01:14.390
I went to this fucking bar and I ordered,

989
01:01:14.391 --> 01:01:18.860
went to order a blue moon because I'm a,
I'm a,
I'm a snobby cont,
you know,

990
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:21.410
give me a blue moon with a little slice of orange in it and I'll sit here with

991
01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:24.950
my legs crossed,
like I'm selling art.
Right?
That's what I wanted to do.

992
01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:30.960
And,
uh,
they were like,
oh,
wait on how I have any,
we're all out how it all out.

993
01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:36.360
And I was like a corona.
Yeah,
we,
uh,
now,
now you don't,

994
01:01:36.361 --> 01:01:39.860
we don't,
we don't have corona.
Chronic.
Yeah.
All right,

995
01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:40.860
let me get you a list of bears.

996
01:01:40.861 --> 01:01:44.270
And they had their list of beers and then I ordered a Miller lite.
She's like,

997
01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.500
I don't,
okay.
Yeah,
you're going to kill me.

998
01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.430
We just ran out of Miller high and I was like,
bitch,

999
01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:53.040
what the fuck do you have here?
I didn't say bitch.

1000
01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:58.100
I looked down at the bar and I did sort of a fucking stupid smile.

1001
01:01:58.711 --> 01:01:59.544
And I was like,

1002
01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:05.050
what beers do you have with your fucking count was underneath it,
you know?

1003
01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:07.920
Which is ridiculous because I don't think she was in charge of ordering it.

1004
01:02:07.921 --> 01:02:12.780
She's just in charge of,
you know,
selling it or whatever,

1005
01:02:12.781 --> 01:02:15.300
serving it.
That's the worst about having a public job.

1006
01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:18.870
Will you get a job where you deal with the public is most of the,

1007
01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:22.140
it's not your fault.
So not only do you have your job,

1008
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:25.620
the other part of your job is to get yelled at for shit that people above you

1009
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:29.400
did,
you know?
So anyway,

1010
01:02:29.401 --> 01:02:34.401
so I ordered a Fuckin Amstel light and it tasted like ass in out.

1011
01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:40.770
It tasted like somebody rubbed their armpit on somebody's ass.
That's what a team

1012
01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:45.660
that didn't even fuck it makes sense.
It just,
it didn't taste good.

1013
01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:48.540
And I had one of those and then I went right back to fucking,

1014
01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:52.740
I went back to coax.
I don't know,
I like it.
I like being,

1015
01:02:52.741 --> 01:02:55.420
I like going to bars and not fucking drinking.
I kind of,

1016
01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.040
I'm starting to enjoy it and then watching everybody else get hammered and say

1017
01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:01.290
dumb shit that they're going to have to apologize for.

1018
01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:04.670
I think I've done that enough in life.
I've apologized enough times.
Have an eye.

1019
01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:08.820
All right.
And with that I'm going to get onto some hyping.

1020
01:03:08.821 --> 01:03:13.290
Some shit has been a damn good podcast so far.
I feel good.
I'm well rested,
Huh?

1021
01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:17.100
Isn't that right Cleo?
You like that?
Don't just

1022
01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:23.010
yeah,
she fucking loves it,
Huh?
Right on the rib cage.

1023
01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:28.470
Um,
put my dog in a headlock.
You know,
I do that shit come in.

1024
01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:31.920
It's almost like the rear naked choke,
just like doing it.
Look at it.

1025
01:03:31.921 --> 01:03:34.830
Jesus Christ.
Fucking size of your nipples.

1026
01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:37.560
What kind of message are you trying to send out there?
Hi,

1027
01:03:37.561 --> 01:03:41.090
you little whore walking around trying to get some doggy Dick.

1028
01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:44.730
I've seen you sniffing every fucking blade of grass.

1029
01:03:44.731 --> 01:03:48.390
You to be ashamed of yourself.
That's not how we raised you.
Then again,

1030
01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:52.650
you were down by the river for Awhile,
Huh?
And Yeah,
you are definitely hungry.

1031
01:03:52.651 --> 01:03:57.150
But you were eating,
Huh?
How did you get all those meals?
Cleo?

1032
01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:02.580
How many Douggie Dick's did you have in your mind?
Right?
That's fucking weird.

1033
01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.473
All right.
Ah,

1034
01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.630
you don't really notice about dogs is um,
their,

1035
01:04:09.631 --> 01:04:11.820
their front legs.
Um,

1036
01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:16.590
which are my world are the arms and the back legs.
Uh,

1037
01:04:16.591 --> 01:04:19.830
they bend the exact opposite as a humans.
I've never noticed that before.

1038
01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:24.300
You know?
Well,
I guess down towards the bottom they do now wait a minute.

1039
01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:27.330
The front ones do.
I'm an idiot.
They been the same way.
The front ones.

1040
01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.360
Dubin the same way.
All right,
you got me on that one.

1041
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:33.360
So that's sort of like its wrist and it's elbow,
but the back legs,

1042
01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:37.410
that's what it is.
They're fucking dare a their knee.

1043
01:04:37.411 --> 01:04:42.180
Their knee joint goes the opposite way.
In fact,
your fucking look at that,
yo,

1044
01:04:42.181 --> 01:04:46.680
your Patella is behind your leg.
You see it as,

1045
01:04:46.681 --> 01:04:49.080
this is why you can't get a job in the real world.
Cleo,

1046
01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:54.150
your fucking knees are on the wrong side of your legs.
You know that.

1047
01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.400
Other than that,
you don't have a shirt on.

1048
01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:00.600
You're fucking nipples showing to the world.
You get a job at the circus.

1049
01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:02.940
You know I'm not trying to be a dick here,

1050
01:05:02.941 --> 01:05:05.550
but why don't you fucking kick him for some rent every once in awhile I got to

1051
01:05:05.551 --> 01:05:09.060
buy another big bag of fucking dog food.
Look at,

1052
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:11.730
you're just laying there like he can't hear me.
You know what I'm talking about?

1053
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:16.110
Leave your fancy new collar.
Huh?
Gee.
Last owners do that.

1054
01:05:16.111 --> 01:05:20.050
I don't think so.
This is an abusive relationship here.
All right,

1055
01:05:20.051 --> 01:05:20.980
let's move on here.
Let's,

1056
01:05:20.981 --> 01:05:24.340
let's talk about some shit that I have that I have going on.

1057
01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.280
I don't know why I had to say that twice that I handled that I have.

1058
01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:30.460
Oh look at that.
I'm learning how to play.
Shoot.
That's row.
Shoot the thrill,

1059
01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:33.880
the video tutorial.
Anybody out there play a guitar?

1060
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:38.440
You want to a good youtube [inaudible] this is Guy Solo Dallas.

1061
01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:43.750
He's got all these fucking uh,
ACDC songs.

1062
01:05:43.751 --> 01:05:46.030
He shows you how to play a man.
It's a,
I don't know.

1063
01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:50.590
And then you can be the head at your next party.
Such a fucking loser.
All right,

1064
01:05:50.591 --> 01:05:52.630
let's get back to what the hell I was talking about here.

1065
01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:54.310
This is what I got coming up.

1066
01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:58.510
You notice how it was a great podcast until I said it was a great podcast and

1067
01:05:58.511 --> 01:06:02.590
now I'm not living up to it.
Um,
anyways,
this is what I got coming up this week,

1068
01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.180
Friday,
Saturday and Sunday.

1069
01:06:04.181 --> 01:06:09.181
I'm going to be at the punchline in Atlanta and I'm coming up in September.

1070
01:06:09.611 --> 01:06:14.350
I'm going to be at the helium comedy club in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania.
Uh,

1071
01:06:14.351 --> 01:06:19.300
September 10th through the 12th and I added a date.

1072
01:06:19.301 --> 01:06:24.130
I added two dates.
One is for all you California people.

1073
01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:25.751
All right.

1074
01:06:25.751 --> 01:06:30.751
And I really need you to show up for this one because the costs are basically

1075
01:06:30.881 --> 01:06:35.881
paying me like fucking $5 in a new pair of shoe laces because they don't feel

1076
01:06:36.311 --> 01:06:40.780
that I can draw out here in California because,

1077
01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:45.010
uh,
because I'm a white guy,
I think,
you know,
not a lot of white guys out here.

1078
01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:48.970
You know,
that was my big mistake.
I should've gone out,
laid in the sun.

1079
01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.390
I just would have been all red.
He would have thought I was a native American.

1080
01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:54.910
They would've booked me in a fucking casino.
Anyways,
I'm going to be at the,
uh,

1081
01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:59.800
the Improv in Ontario,
California for four fucking days.

1082
01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.800
September 17th,
18th,
19th,

1083
01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:08.010
and 20th for the love of God could you and 48 of your closest fucking white,

1084
01:07:12.431 --> 01:07:16.000
black,
Mexican,
Asian,
whatever you can grab,

1085
01:07:16.001 --> 01:07:20.110
please bring them out to those shows because it sucks,
man.

1086
01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:24.610
I live out here in la.
There's three clubs that I could be playing,
you know,

1087
01:07:24.611 --> 01:07:27.370
where I could actually not have to fucking jump in an airplane.

1088
01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.610
I want to play Los Angeles area.
I really would like to,

1089
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:35.650
but I really need you mother fuckers to show up because if you don't show up,

1090
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:40.720
I can't play out here anymore because they offer me $5 in a new pair of shoe

1091
01:07:40.721 --> 01:07:45.550
laces.
Okay.
And uh,
I said fuck it.

1092
01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:48.490
I'll do it for that Gig and I'm going to show that I can draw out here so that

1093
01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:53.260
can come out here,
you know,
and not have to get on a plane every fucking week.

1094
01:07:53.261 --> 01:07:54.670
All right.
So I added that date.

1095
01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:57.970
And then the other date that I added was I added a date and Seattle,

1096
01:07:57.971 --> 01:08:02.710
Washington at one of my favorite clubs,
uh,
giggles comedy club,
uh,

1097
01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:05.650
for December 10th,
11th,
and the 12th.

1098
01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:10.720
And I scheduled that around a Seattle Seahawks home game mother fuckers.

1099
01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:11.950
And when I go to that,

1100
01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:16.010
that is going to be my 100 franchise that I've seen.

1101
01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.370
Actually,
no,
it won't be because I'm doing the Tempe pm problems,

1102
01:08:19.371 --> 01:08:24.080
see the Phoenix Suns and I'm going to come in a day early for Seattle so I can

1103
01:08:24.081 --> 01:08:27.440
go to a Portland trails trailblazer's game.
Cause I have OCD,

1104
01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.910
I have to go to all of them.
Why do I have to go to all of them?
I don't know why.

1105
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:34.520
I don't know why.
That's what I do on the plane.

1106
01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:38.960
I sat there and I check them off like the fucking rain,
man.
I'm a Weirdo.

1107
01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.270
So anyways,
when I go to all of those,

1108
01:08:41.271 --> 01:08:45.680
I'll basically have bend to everything out here,
west of Denver,
everything,

1109
01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:48.800
all the way up Edmonton,
all of that shit.
I've been to all of them.

1110
01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:53.330
And you know what?
It hasn't filled me up a bit.
I'm still fucking empty.

1111
01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:57.920
All right,
that was sad.
That was just sad.
Let's get back to,
uh,
you know what?

1112
01:08:57.921 --> 01:09:00.970
I gave you guys some homework last week.
Uh,

1113
01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:02.990
I told you to go out and go see the movie,
the orphan,

1114
01:09:02.991 --> 01:09:06.200
because I wanted to make fun of that movie,
but I didn't want to ruin it for you.

1115
01:09:06.201 --> 01:09:09.620
So if he didn't go and see it,
that's your own God damn fault.

1116
01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:12.350
And you probably want to fast forward through the next four minutes of this

1117
01:09:12.351 --> 01:09:14.240
podcast because I want to talk about this movie.

1118
01:09:14.241 --> 01:09:19.190
It's a horror movie that I,
uh,
I actually loved.

1119
01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:24.440
I loved it even though it kind of stunk.
It was,

1120
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:29.390
it reminded me of a horror movies from the 1980s.

1121
01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.790
And,
uh,
one of the things that,

1122
01:09:31.791 --> 01:09:34.550
there was always the requirement of is that you had to have,

1123
01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:38.050
<v 4>oh,
do you hear that alarm?</v>

1124
01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.610
<v 5>If I told you what kind of car that was,</v>

1125
01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:45.180
it's like a fucking 1988.
No,

1126
01:09:45.181 --> 01:09:49.110
it's not that nice public in 1991 Honda accord a site,
you know,
it's the classic,

1127
01:09:49.111 --> 01:09:50.400
nobody's going to steal that car.

1128
01:09:50.730 --> 01:09:55.320
And every time a truck drives by or somebody says I don't want to do it,

1129
01:09:55.321 --> 01:09:57.090
and they punched the top of their bureau,

1130
01:09:57.430 --> 01:10:01.880
it sets the fucking alarm off in that God damn car.
And uh,
I dunno.

1131
01:10:01.890 --> 01:10:05.010
I think it's funny because it's far enough away where it's not annoying to me,

1132
01:10:05.011 --> 01:10:09.450
but I know it's fucking driving somebody up the wall.
Isn't that right Cleo?

1133
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:14.970
Huh?
As you go to look at me
and she puts her head back down,

1134
01:10:14.971 --> 01:10:18.180
she doesn't give a fuck.
All right,
so that movie,
the orphan,

1135
01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:21.810
if you haven't seen it,
have you driven by any sort of bus stop or anything?

1136
01:10:21.811 --> 01:10:23.930
It's that one that has that really psycho look,

1137
01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.850
an eight year old on it and it says,
uh,

1138
01:10:27.810 --> 01:10:31.320
there's something wrong with the,
what the fuck is her name?
It's not ama.

1139
01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:35.490
It's one of those old person named Emma,
not Elvira.

1140
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:40.060
Ah,
Shit.
See this how my brain works now I'm fucked.

1141
01:10:40.150 --> 01:10:44.260
What the fuck is that little twats name?
There is something wrong.

1142
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:49.480
Ah,
Christ,
whatever it says.
There's something wrong with this fucking chick.

1143
01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:53.170
Eight year old girl with an old person's name.
All right,

1144
01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:56.500
so you go to watch the fucking movie.
Basically she's an orphan.

1145
01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:59.980
This couple comes down.
They want to,
you know,

1146
01:10:59.981 --> 01:11:03.350
they want to adopt a kid for some fucking reason.
So they,

1147
01:11:03.351 --> 01:11:08.351
they pick this girl who is dressed like she's from the 18 hundreds and she has

1148
01:11:09.401 --> 01:11:13.830
like a piece of thread around her throat that she won't take off and her wrist a

1149
01:11:13.831 --> 01:11:14.311
few times.

1150
01:11:14.311 --> 01:11:18.240
People try to remove it at the orphanage and she completely freaks out,

1151
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.030
sell the whole time.
She's being a fucking psycho.

1152
01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:25.170
She's trying to kill their natural kids and um,

1153
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:26.340
you know,

1154
01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:29.370
their life was basically fine and then they get this kid and everything are the

1155
01:11:29.371 --> 01:11:31.890
fucking house catches on fire,
all this fucked up stuff.

1156
01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:36.430
But one of the requirements of old school horror movies is,

1157
01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:40.890
is you have to have unbelievably stupid people in it.
And um,

1158
01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.210
I actually,
the,
the white people in this movie were so fucking dumb.

1159
01:11:45.211 --> 01:11:47.790
I almost got offended.
I almost like wrote a letter.

1160
01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:52.230
It's like they got this giant tree fort and the dude looks,

1161
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:57.850
he looks out the window and the fucking thing is engulfed in flames as his

1162
01:11:58.291 --> 01:12:02.400
natural son is hanging from the tree trying not to fall,

1163
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:06.450
which he does and ends up in intensive fucking care.

1164
01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.760
And the fucking wife is sitting there going like,

1165
01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:13.200
I think there's something wrong with this fucking chick with the old person

1166
01:12:13.201 --> 01:12:16.530
named that dresses like she's in the 18 hundreds and the kicker,

1167
01:12:16.531 --> 01:12:18.630
she has a Transylvanian accent

1168
01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.060
Ivonne to play the piano.
What?
I can't even fucking do it.
She's just,

1169
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:27.630
it's like you're a psycho.
Get the fuck out of my life.
Right?

1170
01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:29.580
Then she starts killing people.

1171
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:33.390
People start disappearing right and fucking left and they're sitting there,

1172
01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:37.770
the Cabrillo,
what's going on?
She's being so weird.

1173
01:12:38.290 --> 01:12:43.080
All right,
so basically in the end,
what you find out,

1174
01:12:43.081 --> 01:12:48.081
what's wrong with the girl is that she's not eight years old.

1175
01:12:48.541 --> 01:12:52.530
She's actually 33 she has,

1176
01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.830
she has some sort of disease that makes her look like she's eight and she used

1177
01:12:58.831 --> 01:13:03.831
to be in an insane asylum because she murdered her family and she escaped

1178
01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:09.120
somehow from Germany.
She somehow escaped the Issei and asylum,

1179
01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:14.880
got herself in an orphanage with no fucking passport,
no paperwork whatsoever,

1180
01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:17.970
got herself into an orphanage in America,

1181
01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:23.840
and the kicker is she somehow went to a dentist who agreed to make her a full

1182
01:13:24.451 --> 01:13:27.690
upper and a full lower denture of children's teeth,

1183
01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.460
which she pulls out in the end as you're discovering that she's 33 years old and

1184
01:13:35.461 --> 01:13:37.350
then this little fucking dwarf,

1185
01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:43.460
middle-aged psycho cunt comes in and somehow is able to stab to death an adult

1186
01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:49.410
I,
it was just the stupidest fucking thing I was.
It was great.

1187
01:13:49.710 --> 01:13:50.970
It's just a fucking,

1188
01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:53.670
and even though I told you everything basically that happens,

1189
01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:56.720
it's still a fucking hilarious movie.
It was weird.

1190
01:13:56.770 --> 01:13:58.680
Somebody wrote this great email to me.

1191
01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:02.370
They were so pissed that I told him to go see the movie.
They said,

1192
01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:07.371
I've never been absolutely terrified while laughing my ass off for 90 minutes in

1193
01:14:08.041 --> 01:14:11.920
my entire life.
And that is the experience of the orphan.

1194
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:17.220
It's just a fucking great stupid movie.
I don't know,
it just remind.

1195
01:14:17.221 --> 01:14:21.490
Anyhow,
I had all the cheesy lines.
She's crawling out of the pond,

1196
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:24.670
Mami Save,
you save me.
And then she's like,

1197
01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:29.170
for the last time I'm not your fucking mother.

1198
01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:32.140
And then she kicks her right in her fucking 33 year old,

1199
01:14:32.141 --> 01:14:36.580
eight 58 year old face and she goes back down to the bottom of the pond.

1200
01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:39.220
And I guess that was supposed to be the applause break,

1201
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:43.960
which it would have got if it was still 1984 but whatever,

1202
01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:48.460
it's,
I don't know.
As much as I just trashed it,
it's still a good movie.

1203
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:53.230
I felt bad for the actor playing the dad in the movie because I just pictured

1204
01:14:53.231 --> 01:14:57.580
him in between takes trying to figure out how he could be that guy and just

1205
01:14:57.581 --> 01:15:01.780
looking at the director going sell basically my characters a fucking moron.

1206
01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:02.770
Right.

1207
01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:07.770
So in this seed I'm still a moron who can't put one and one together and get,

1208
01:15:09.610 --> 01:15:14.350
um,
maybe,
you know,
cause nothing caught on fire.

1209
01:15:14.351 --> 01:15:18.550
And then woman was murdered in my house before we got the fucking chick who

1210
01:15:18.551 --> 01:15:20.830
sounds like she's doing a Dracula impression.

1211
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:25.690
Maybe I could put those two fucking numbers together and guess that it's,

1212
01:15:25.691 --> 01:15:29.410
it's Emma or Ezra or whatever the fuck her fucking name.

1213
01:15:29.411 --> 01:15:33.760
Is this something wrong with her?
The fuck is,
I have to look it up.

1214
01:15:33.761 --> 01:15:38.710
I got to get this orphan.
Let me type this in.
Cleo.
What the fuck was that?

1215
01:15:38.711 --> 01:15:43.270
Psycho chick's name.
Huh?
Orphan show times.

1216
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:48.040
Ah,
you motherfucker.
Plot words.
Keys.

1217
01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.770
<v 6>Full cast and crew.
Here we go.
Here we go.</v>

1218
01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:59.260
<v 5>Anyway,
reason there's something wrong with Esther.</v>

1219
01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:03.840
Had a fuck that I forget that Esther to cause a little white girl,
Esther.

1220
01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:06.480
That's it.
That's an old black woman name,
isn't it?
Esther?

1221
01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:08.463
Was that the name of it?

1222
01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:11.530
Was that the name of Florida Evan's character or was that the name of the,

1223
01:16:11.531 --> 01:16:16.480
of the ugly girl on a San Fran Sung?
It was aunt Esther.
That was,

1224
01:16:16.481 --> 01:16:17.314
yeah.

1225
01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:21.820
And therefore because I saw one person who was black who had that name,

1226
01:16:21.821 --> 01:16:23.860
therefore everybody see how I do that?

1227
01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:27.430
I like to generalize everybody cause I'm a moron.
All right,

1228
01:16:27.431 --> 01:16:30.200
let's get back to the fucking podcast here.
Um,

1229
01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.960
<v 6>okay.
Here we go.
Here's some youtube videos.</v>

1230
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:37.370
Did you guys can watch this weekend your cubicles instead of working?
All right.

1231
01:16:38.210 --> 01:16:39.043
Um,

1232
01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.053
<v 5>let me see here.</v>

1233
01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:41.850
<v 6>What do we got here?
All right,</v>

1234
01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:45.960
so I noticed a lot of them because the first one that I nominated was really

1235
01:16:45.961 --> 01:16:46.770
violent.

1236
01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:51.770
Most of these youtube videos that people are nominating involve somebody getting

1237
01:16:53.431 --> 01:16:58.170
punched in the face.
Like here's one British directors slammed into a table.

1238
01:16:58.740 --> 01:16:59.790
This is,
um,

1239
01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:04.820
Twat on Twat crime just to let you know it's female versus female and um,

1240
01:17:06.450 --> 01:17:10.550
it has a WWF quality to it.
When the lady gets slammed,

1241
01:17:10.551 --> 01:17:14.750
she puts her arms out like the way they do when wrestlers pretend to slam their

1242
01:17:14.751 --> 01:17:18.980
heads off a table.
Um,
but for all of you who don't like violence,

1243
01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:23.060
I have a couple of Nice ones.
Here's one for you.
Cute puppy whistle.

1244
01:17:23.690 --> 01:17:28.490
Look up that one and tell me that won't melt your fucking Cheerio's if they're

1245
01:17:28.491 --> 01:17:31.670
meltable.
Um,
in,
there's another great one.
This one,

1246
01:17:31.671 --> 01:17:36.260
Jerry needs no help playing with his ball.
And I know that sounds like a porno,

1247
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:39.380
but I swear to God it's an adorable video.

1248
01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:42.110
Jerry needs no help playing with his ball.

1249
01:17:42.111 --> 01:17:45.590
Just write this down on a little post it and act like you're taking notes and

1250
01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:49.160
looking at a spreadsheet.
Um,
here's one for the guys,

1251
01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:52.880
a fat kid on a bicycle.
Um,

1252
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:56.690
I challenge you to watch this and not fucking laugh your balls off.

1253
01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:00.860
And it's great if you just,
you know what's great is after the kid falls off,

1254
01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:05.030
if you look really closely at what happens is,

1255
01:18:05.031 --> 01:18:09.470
is when he goes flying over the handlebars in his fucking meatball body lands.

1256
01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:11.930
You have anybody who's played sports has done this,

1257
01:18:11.931 --> 01:18:14.810
she ever get tackled in football,
in your arms,
underneath you,

1258
01:18:14.811 --> 01:18:18.710
in your fucking elbow basically goes into your spleen,

1259
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:23.900
up under your liver and then fucking,
you know,
smashes into your heart.

1260
01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:28.660
That's basically what happens to this kid and he makes it,

1261
01:18:29.150 --> 01:18:34.090
he makes the greatest impact.
You want to hear the noise?
Tell you what I'll play.

1262
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:38.750
I'll play the audio and I'm going to test your willpower that if you're going to

1263
01:18:38.751 --> 01:18:43.340
actually hear the fucking audio to this and not watch it,

1264
01:18:43.341 --> 01:18:47.690
you're definitely,
you have.
You have some serious fucking willpower.

1265
01:18:47.691 --> 01:18:52.010
Let me type this in real quick.
Fat,
there's a lot of audio on this one.

1266
01:18:52.011 --> 01:18:56.840
I had my dog fat kid.
Wait a minute.
What the fuck?
I just messed that up.

1267
01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.200
Fat Kid on a bicycle.
I'm sorry I can't type with one hand.

1268
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:03.530
Just bear with me children.
Just bear with me.

1269
01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:05.960
Just talk amongst yourselves.

1270
01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:10.040
Do you have ever have that when your teacher was going through a divorce and

1271
01:19:10.041 --> 01:19:13.910
she'd start breaking down?
Just talk amongst yourselves.

1272
01:19:14.210 --> 01:19:19.200
That kid on a bike.
See

1273
01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:25.580
Co Bam.
Come on.
Where the fuck is it?

1274
01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:27.620
Oh,
that's great.
Bill,
you gave me the wrong.

1275
01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:34.700
Maybe it's fat kid falls.
Ah,
you fucking asshole.

1276
01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:39.980
Bill Fed.
I wrote fat on a bicycle.
That'd be disgusting.

1277
01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:42.800
It was just a bag of fat.
All right.

1278
01:19:42.801 --> 01:19:46.940
Fat Kid on a bicycle and I get the same videos.

1279
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:51.830
Fat Kid fall on a jumping on a bike.

1280
01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:57.340
Where is his mother
fucker?

1281
01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:05.210
I'm the worst.
I swear to God.
It's funny.
You're not gonna be able to find.

1282
01:20:05.211 --> 01:20:09.870
Now I have to fight.
Oh,
there it is.
Fat Kid on a bicycle.
I got it.
Here we go.

1283
01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:12.660
Listen to this audio.
All right,

1284
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:18.600
here he comes.
Here he comes.
Here he comes.

1285
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:20.833
<v 2>Cool.</v>

1286
01:20:33.650 --> 01:20:38.170
<v 6>Oh awesome.
Funniest fucking thing ever.
And he's got big fat thighs.</v>

1287
01:20:38.171 --> 01:20:39.850
He's got these little booty shorts on.

1288
01:20:43.150 --> 01:20:45.700
Ah,
God,
that's a fucking great one.

1289
01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:50.710
There's nothing better that way is,
it's so funny to watch somebody get hurt.

1290
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:54.640
I don't know why.
Anyways,
here's another one,
and I know this,

1291
01:20:54.641 --> 01:20:56.740
this one has a couple of your kid's ears here,

1292
01:20:56.741 --> 01:21:01.210
but this one is called [inaudible],
Smasher,
c u and T.
Smasher.

1293
01:21:01.810 --> 01:21:03.430
And I know that sounds like,
you know,

1294
01:21:03.431 --> 01:21:06.040
somebody just give somebody an uppercut to the baby maker.

1295
01:21:06.041 --> 01:21:09.610
That's not what happens.
Believe it or not,
this is actually,

1296
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:14.560
it's a male stripper.
And I swear to God,
I think it's Bobby blots,

1297
01:21:14.890 --> 01:21:19.150
sir from rat.
That's what it looks like.
Um,
it's,

1298
01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:22.270
you might want to fast forward through some of it,
but it's just fucking,

1299
01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.770
it's hilarious.
Um,

1300
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:29.790
it's gotta be from like 1988 just judging by the guy's fucking hair metal hair

1301
01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:36.420
and he's spinning these knives around and it's just a classic why guys are not

1302
01:21:36.491 --> 01:21:37.090
sexy.

1303
01:21:37.090 --> 01:21:41.590
And women guys I think turn women on if they're like doing shit,

1304
01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:45.500
you know,
you come over,
you know,
you're fucking the,

1305
01:21:45.610 --> 01:21:48.460
the cable guy and you're installing cable,
you know,

1306
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:53.410
and you bend over and you'd Dickies.
I don't fucking know.

1307
01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:56.380
You know what I mean?
That's how women get turned on.

1308
01:21:56.381 --> 01:22:00.010
They see some guy with a little yellow hard hat and he's up a telephone pole.

1309
01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:03.430
Oh wait,
God,
he can fix it up.
I want to blow him.
Right.

1310
01:22:03.850 --> 01:22:05.380
I don't know how they find a sexy,

1311
01:22:05.381 --> 01:22:09.970
but I know it's not wearing a fucking leather jumpsuit spinning around kitchen

1312
01:22:09.971 --> 01:22:12.580
knives.
That really,
I don't know.
But you got to watch it.
That's,

1313
01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:16.870
that's a great one.
Um,
and these are all recommended by people,
by the way,

1314
01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:20.320
other than fat.
Get on a bike.
That's one of my favorite ones.
I'm gay.

1315
01:22:20.321 --> 01:22:24.850
Weatherman is a grace.
Great one.
Uh,
there's another one,

1316
01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:29.640
worst blooper ever.
And uh,

1317
01:22:29.710 --> 01:22:32.230
then there's another good one,
a British punch.

1318
01:22:33.010 --> 01:22:36.220
Just look that up at some British dude who gets punched in the face.

1319
01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:41.280
And his reaction is a stereotypical British where it's just really polite.

1320
01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:46.570
Where'd you go and do something like that?
I came up the fuck he did.

1321
01:22:46.571 --> 01:22:49.390
The guy gets punched in the face and he doesn't attack the other kid.

1322
01:22:49.391 --> 01:22:53.930
He doesn't laugh.
He why?
Why'd you go?
I can't even with the F,

1323
01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:57.520
I can't do fucking accents.
I don't even know why I checked those out.

1324
01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.730
Instead of working.
That's what you can do this week.
All right.
Um,

1325
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:04.660
or if he gets sick of working,
what are we up to here?
40 minutes already.

1326
01:23:04.670 --> 01:23:08.890
I gotta wrap this up.
I have some,
I have a computer question for you people.

1327
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:13.090
All right.
I have a,
I have the Mac book now.
All the nerds are listening up.

1328
01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:17.950
Alright.
Perk in their ears up.
I have a brand new MAC book brand by brand new,

1329
01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:20.590
I mean on the less like fucking four months or whatever.

1330
01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:24.310
And I got that thing where,
you know,

1331
01:23:24.311 --> 01:23:27.370
if I put my hand on the little square thing down there that I don't know what

1332
01:23:27.371 --> 01:23:30.940
it's called.
You know the mousy area.
I know if I,

1333
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:35.080
if I flick the cursor to the upper right hand,
all the windows disappear.

1334
01:23:35.650 --> 01:23:39.460
If I go down to the lower right,
they separate,
upper left makes it go black.

1335
01:23:39.970 --> 01:23:42.640
Lower left,
uh,

1336
01:23:42.641 --> 01:23:47.230
makes the four windows and you know,
we can have something in all four windows.

1337
01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:50.320
Um,
but my question is,
is I don't know how I do this,

1338
01:23:50.321 --> 01:23:55.321
but every once in a while I do something on the mouse area accidentally.

1339
01:23:55.481 --> 01:23:56.620
And what happens is,

1340
01:23:56.830 --> 01:24:00.640
is I'll have two windows open and when I click on one of the windows,

1341
01:24:00.641 --> 01:24:04.180
the other window goes exit stage right off of my thing.

1342
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:07.300
And then if I click the other one,
then,

1343
01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:10.750
then it comes back while the other one goes exit stage left.

1344
01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.630
And sometimes I want to look at both fucking windows.

1345
01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.520
How do I make it stop doing that?

1346
01:24:16.450 --> 01:24:18.460
So I guess I want to know how do I make it do that?

1347
01:24:18.461 --> 01:24:20.050
And then how do I make it stop doing that?

1348
01:24:20.051 --> 01:24:23.920
Because I want to stop yelling at my computer like it's a person.

1349
01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:27.640
I hope I explained that correctly.
And with that,

1350
01:24:27.641 --> 01:24:31.480
let's move on to a revenge story.
Remember that topic?
All those great stories.

1351
01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:34.960
Remember how everybody had his story,
uh,
how they,
you know,

1352
01:24:34.961 --> 01:24:37.930
how you got revenge was basically you didn't confront the person.

1353
01:24:37.931 --> 01:24:40.510
You basically fucked up some of their personal property.

1354
01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:44.950
And a lot of people sort of came to the conclusion that that really wasn't

1355
01:24:44.951 --> 01:24:49.000
revenge as much as it was sort of a bitchy little move where here's a great

1356
01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:52.840
revenge story done by a guy.
This is a fucking great story.

1357
01:24:52.841 --> 01:24:56.410
I wish I lived this story.
All right,
here we go.
I grew up in Brooklyn,
New York.

1358
01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:59.890
Uh,
many years ago when I was in the sixth grade,
I was 11 years old.

1359
01:25:00.130 --> 01:25:05.050
There was a guy named PJ used to torment me all the time.
He'd bully me,
bully me,

1360
01:25:05.051 --> 01:25:07.480
and rob me of my money every time he saw me.

1361
01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:12.190
This lasted for about four years.
As I became a teenager,

1362
01:25:12.191 --> 01:25:14.020
he stopped trying to rob me,
but he was,

1363
01:25:14.050 --> 01:25:16.630
he still tried to intimidate me every chance he got.

1364
01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:21.430
So one day in the summer we were playing five on five basketball and there was

1365
01:25:21.431 --> 01:25:24.520
about 40 guys standing all around the court watching the game.

1366
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.720
I got the ball on the steel and the only guy back on defense was PJ.

1367
01:25:28.930 --> 01:25:30.220
As I drove to the hoop,

1368
01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:34.060
he jumped to block my shot and I dunked right in his face.

1369
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:35.920
The whole park exploded.

1370
01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:40.150
Guys were running to the court yelling and laughing at PJ's.
Pj,

1371
01:25:40.151 --> 01:25:41.860
the screams were so loud.

1372
01:25:42.010 --> 01:25:46.390
My friends who lived a block away heard the noise and came running to the park

1373
01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:49.960
to see what happened.
The look on PJ's face was priceless.

1374
01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:55.030
He was humiliated in front of just about everybody we mutually knew at that
time.

1375
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.810
Um,
I went on to play Division One college ball and had success,

1376
01:25:58.811 --> 01:26:00.850
but nothing ever compared to that day.

1377
01:26:01.090 --> 01:26:04.370
I remember it like it was yesterday at an happened over 20 years ago.

1378
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:09.000
He never spoke or bothered me ever again after that day either though.

1379
01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:12.380
That story is the Shit,
you know?

1380
01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:15.080
Can you imagine Duncan on some asshole is treating you like shit?

1381
01:26:15.081 --> 01:26:19.010
You know what I thought it was,
and I'm going to go out on a limb here and get,

1382
01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.050
you know,
at the risk of being called a racist again.

1383
01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:22.790
I'm going to guess that that was a black guy.

1384
01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:29.390
Not too many white guys have a story of how they got revenge was they fucking

1385
01:26:29.391 --> 01:26:30.320
stole a ball.

1386
01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:34.370
Somebody jumped up to block their shot and they basically jumped over him and

1387
01:26:34.371 --> 01:26:39.020
dunked on him.
You know,
I dunno.
Maybe,
I dunno.
I'm just saying right.

1388
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:41.540
I mean I,
I was at my,
in my white brain,

1389
01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:45.410
what I was thinking was everyone was there at the basketball game and you're

1390
01:26:45.411 --> 01:26:48.620
going to do the meatballs thing and pulled down his shorts.
See

1391
01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:54.350
that's what you have to do when you can't jump when you don't have that fucking

1392
01:26:54.351 --> 01:26:57.320
option.
Cause I don't care how many fucking,
how many,

1393
01:26:57.321 --> 01:27:00.380
whatever jump shots you throw in somebody's face.
It's not the same.

1394
01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:04.160
It's not the same.
That's like you,
you just fucking attacked.

1395
01:27:05.850 --> 01:27:08.280
I mean,
I dunno.
Getting dunked on,
I mean that's,

1396
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:09.540
that's right up there with just sleep.

1397
01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:11.790
She minds are just slapped his mother right in his face.
I think.

1398
01:27:11.791 --> 01:27:14.490
That's fantastic.
That's what I want to nominate.
That is,

1399
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:18.780
that's the one of the best revenge stories ever because it wasn't sneaky.

1400
01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:20.820
It wasn't bitchy.

1401
01:27:20.821 --> 01:27:25.740
It was right in the dude's face and a and it had the desired effect.

1402
01:27:25.741 --> 01:27:27.150
The guy never fucked with them again.

1403
01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:30.540
And I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this dude had the last laugh.

1404
01:27:30.541 --> 01:27:33.000
So congratulations Jesus Christ.

1405
01:27:33.001 --> 01:27:35.460
That should be like what are those afterschool special movies?

1406
01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:39.810
It really had a feel good ending to it and nobody really got hurt so he just got

1407
01:27:39.811 --> 01:27:40.710
put in their place.

1408
01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:45.450
They should fucking film that story and play it around the holidays just to make

1409
01:27:45.451 --> 01:27:49.200
people feel better.
All right,
let's get with questions here.
Um,

1410
01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:54.990
hey bill,
I am a big fan of your comedy.
We [inaudible] thank you very much.

1411
01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:56.640
Uh,
I was looking for a,

1412
01:27:58.230 --> 01:27:58.300
<v 8>okay,</v>

1413
01:27:58.300 --> 01:27:59.200
<v 6>what the fuck?</v>

1414
01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:02.510
I was looking to get some tickets to the DC improv show in October.

1415
01:28:02.511 --> 01:28:04.810
I was curious about your thoughts.
Oh,

1416
01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.080
I was curious about your thoughts on the difference between the early and the

1417
01:28:08.081 --> 01:28:11.980
late shows.
I know when you're a pro you can kill whether it's the first,

1418
01:28:11.981 --> 01:28:14.320
second or second show on any given night,

1419
01:28:14.321 --> 01:28:17.320
but I was just wondering which performance do you prefer and why?

1420
01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.650
And is the law the single show on Sunday,

1421
01:28:20.651 --> 01:28:24.900
the most depressing Gig of the rung of the run.
All right.
You know,

1422
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.660
you believe it or not,
I get asked this question a lot of times when people go,

1423
01:28:28.661 --> 01:28:31.690
hey man,
I'm buying tickets to your show.
I'm coming Friday.

1424
01:28:31.691 --> 01:28:34.360
Which one do you think I should go to?
The early one of the late one.

1425
01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:40.130
And the reality is,
um,
you never know.

1426
01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:41.781
You never know.

1427
01:28:41.781 --> 01:28:44.780
Like this past weekend I was working in the comedy connection in Providence and

1428
01:28:44.781 --> 01:28:45.800
I had great shows,

1429
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:51.380
but that one went the standard way where the early crowd was more sober and more

1430
01:28:51.381 --> 01:28:56.000
receptive and the late crowd was,
uh,

1431
01:28:56.180 --> 01:29:00.860
sort of drunk and not paying attention.
Well,
one of the nights,

1432
01:29:00.861 --> 01:29:03.820
it was on the Friday night,
it was like,
uh,
the,

1433
01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:07.110
the red sox and Yankees were playing and I guess they went 13 innings or

1434
01:29:07.111 --> 01:29:08.880
something like that.
It was into extra innings.

1435
01:29:08.881 --> 01:29:13.590
So half of the crowd they're face is glowing by half the crowd.

1436
01:29:13.591 --> 01:29:15.960
I mean five fucking people.
But that feels like half the crowd,

1437
01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:19.950
their face is glowing because they're watching the pitch by pitch.

1438
01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:24.990
Um,
I mean,
who the fuck is into sports to that level?
You know what I mean?

1439
01:29:26.850 --> 01:29:30.450
Breaking ball outside too and blood,
you know,
you're gonna fucking,
they don't,

1440
01:29:30.451 --> 01:29:33.170
you don't even have that guy saying that,
but would,

1441
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:36.900
and they all watched that shit,
but then you know what the fuck,
but whatever.

1442
01:29:36.901 --> 01:29:41.070
So they weren't paying attention.
So the second show kind of sucked on that one.

1443
01:29:41.071 --> 01:29:45.600
But,
um,
when I was in Denver,
I had a show where the early show,

1444
01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:50.280
they were drunk,
maniacs yelling out shit.
It was still fun.
Um,

1445
01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:53.130
so yeah,
dude,
it's a crap shoot just like you,

1446
01:29:53.131 --> 01:29:58.131
I have no idea either and I just sort of play off however people are doing it.

1447
01:29:58.291 --> 01:30:01.020
But I gotta admit I ever,
I have a really good crowd of people that comes out.

1448
01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:04.350
And even when people yell shit out at me,
like I'm,

1449
01:30:04.351 --> 01:30:07.140
I don't like it if someone's just trying to be a dick.
But if I say something,

1450
01:30:07.141 --> 01:30:09.970
someone has an opinion on it,
they yell it out.
You know,

1451
01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:13.230
as long as it isn't every five seconds,
like that really doesn't bother me.

1452
01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:17.640
I actually think it's one of the things that makes stand up a cool art that,

1453
01:30:18.450 --> 01:30:22.900
uh,
you know,
it's one of the few like public speaking things where like you,

1454
01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:28.020
it's kind of a accepted in a way that you can just yell at you fucking Suck,

1455
01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:32.490
you know?
I mean,
it happens to bands and that type of shit,

1456
01:30:32.491 --> 01:30:37.410
but you can drown them out with your instruments.
I don't know.
I had a fucking,

1457
01:30:37.450 --> 01:30:40.020
I mean,
you know,
I'm basically,
this is the only thing I've done in public,

1458
01:30:40.021 --> 01:30:43.260
so I really don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Um,

1459
01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:45.870
let's move off to fuck else did I want to say there was something about

1460
01:30:45.871 --> 01:30:49.770
provenance.
I wanted to say.
Well,
it's out on my head now.
Um,
okay.

1461
01:30:49.771 --> 01:30:54.180
This is how we've been ending a lot of these podcasts lately where all of a

1462
01:30:54.181 --> 01:30:57.180
sudden people are sending me these really,
uh,

1463
01:30:57.930 --> 01:31:01.200
heavier questions.
This is sort of the,
uh,

1464
01:31:01.201 --> 01:31:05.100
the doctor bill section I think is what I'm going to call it because I'm not

1465
01:31:05.101 --> 01:31:09.840
qualified no,
that I'm not qualified to answer any of this shit.

1466
01:31:09.841 --> 01:31:14.490
But,
uh,
this is another one of these death of a relative things.
So,

1467
01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:17.410
uh,
after we had the feel good story,
God dammit,

1468
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:19.920
I should've read the revenge one after this one.
But,
uh,

1469
01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:23.040
this one is a sort of depressive,
but not,
not,

1470
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:26.400
I'm just going to shut up and read it.
Okay.
Bill,
my bill,

1471
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:30.420
my mom's oldest sister died from cancer three weeks ago,
eh?
Oh Wow.

1472
01:31:30.450 --> 01:31:34.980
What an opening sentence and has one surviving sister,
um,

1473
01:31:34.981 --> 01:31:38.910
during the process of going through her things.
All right,

1474
01:31:38.911 --> 01:31:40.860
so let's slow down here because this gets confusing.

1475
01:31:40.861 --> 01:31:45.861
So you have a mom and she had a sister die and she has one other surviving

1476
01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:46.881
sisters.

1477
01:31:46.881 --> 01:31:51.000
So it's your mom and your aunt who's alive at this point and your other aunt

1478
01:31:51.001 --> 01:31:53.880
died or aunt,
whatever the fuck you're from.
Um,

1479
01:31:53.881 --> 01:31:57.810
during the process of going through her things and settling her affairs.

1480
01:31:57.811 --> 01:32:01.510
Quite a few interesting secrets have popped up.
For one,

1481
01:32:01.511 --> 01:32:03.580
we thought my aunt never owned a car,

1482
01:32:03.581 --> 01:32:07.450
but have since found out that she owned several over the last 20 years.

1483
01:32:08.230 --> 01:32:10.870
Sounds like the beginning of one of those a and e murder things.

1484
01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:15.670
They thought she was quiet,
didn't have any cores.
Um,
for second.

1485
01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:20.500
Um,
we always thought after two divorces that she had sworn off men.

1486
01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:22.390
Turns out,
um,

1487
01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:25.930
this gave her license to sample both sides of the fence.

1488
01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:30.820
Every race we're fucking above were about chest deep in this one.

1489
01:32:30.821 --> 01:32:32.260
I already four sentences in,

1490
01:32:32.770 --> 01:32:35.980
have I forgotten to mention that she was an avid collector of books.

1491
01:32:36.010 --> 01:32:39.610
Some might call it a obsessive compulsive.
Needless to say,

1492
01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:44.980
I have sided with OCD because she has five over 5,000 books in a one bedroom

1493
01:32:45.010 --> 01:32:48.070
condo on the lake front here in Chicago.

1494
01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:53.930
We have found college era of photos of her half naked with a cigarette in one

1495
01:32:54.581 --> 01:32:59.581
hand in various background items that would suggest early seventies era.

1496
01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:01.210
Uh,

1497
01:33:01.210 --> 01:33:06.210
mostly because the gigantic stereos with turntables and eight tracks slots.

1498
01:33:06.710 --> 01:33:10.930
I'm okay.
Um,
through this process,
my mom's middle sister,

1499
01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:15.370
I guess this is the surviving one or two kids and families have distanced

1500
01:33:15.371 --> 01:33:18.550
themselves from the [inaudible] estate settling process.

1501
01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:23.200
While my mom and I have spent 80 plus man hours going through the Condo,

1502
01:33:23.410 --> 01:33:27.610
my middle aunt and her family have consistently talked about how busy they are,

1503
01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:30.403
<v 0>uh,</v>

1504
01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:34.940
<v 6>them and that they have all but said,
we don't care how much you've done.
And I,</v>

1505
01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:38.840
dude,
you're a little vague here.
Are they getting stuff from the will?

1506
01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:43.220
I was a little confused with that.
Um,
but anyways,
I realize I'm,

1507
01:33:44.890 --> 01:33:47.590
there was a very complex set of emotions going on here.

1508
01:33:47.591 --> 01:33:51.250
Perhaps their show of indifference is because they feel guilty about not seeing

1509
01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:52.930
my dead aunt when she was alive.

1510
01:33:53.410 --> 01:33:57.100
Perhaps they live in a nearly perfect world and don't want to be bothered.

1511
01:33:57.370 --> 01:34:00.820
Perhaps they are unfeeling jackasses and don't care.
It's hard to judge.

1512
01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:03.640
I really want to tell them to go fuck themselves and several,

1513
01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:07.990
several contact with them once and for all,
once the will is paid out.
Okay.

1514
01:34:07.991 --> 01:34:09.220
So evidently I get it.

1515
01:34:09.221 --> 01:34:13.000
So they're entitled to some Shit and they're not helping out.
Uh,

1516
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:17.110
but they are family and I was brought to respect family while they apparently

1517
01:34:17.111 --> 01:34:17.944
were not,

1518
01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:21.820
it pains me to know that they are blood relatives and that their mindset is

1519
01:34:21.821 --> 01:34:25.150
indicative of my middle ants upbringing of them.

1520
01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:27.550
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1521
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:29.200
<v 6>I guess that's surviving aunt.
Um,</v>

1522
01:34:29.201 --> 01:34:32.620
I feel lost in sorrow for losing my aunt to cat cancer,

1523
01:34:32.621 --> 01:34:36.850
but I also feel lost in sorrow about losing my other aunt and her kids and

1524
01:34:36.851 --> 01:34:39.910
families because they are not who I thought they were.

1525
01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:43.750
Any advice you could give would be great at dude,
I don't know what to tell you.

1526
01:34:45.670 --> 01:34:45.780
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1527
01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:45.991
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1528
01:34:45.991 --> 01:34:48.660
It's fucked up that they're going to get some money out of this shit and they're

1529
01:34:48.661 --> 01:34:50.580
not helping you go through her stuff.

1530
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:53.343
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1531
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:56.900
<v 6>But,
uh,
I dunno dude.
How often do you see these?</v>

1532
01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:01.100
You know,
I dunno,

1533
01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:04.640
I kind of draw the line at your immediate family.

1534
01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.090
If you're talking about aunts and cousins and that type of shit,

1535
01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:11.330
if they're assholes,
they're really,
you know,

1536
01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:17.450
like you ever think of how barely your cousins are part of your family tree.

1537
01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:22.190
I mean,
you basically have to go up the tree and then back down the tree,

1538
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:26.330
two limbs to get to him.
So fuck them.
They're out.
Right.

1539
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:28.250
I really hope my cousins don't listen to this podcast.

1540
01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:34.970
And then your aunt,
I mean,
I dunno.
I Dunno.
It's,
it's your aunt.

1541
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:38.240
Fuck them.
Fuck them.

1542
01:35:38.241 --> 01:35:41.840
Go with you got fucked them clear out the mortgage and then uh,
yeah,
fuck them.

1543
01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:44.480
I mean they sound,
I mean,

1544
01:35:44.481 --> 01:35:47.120
the way you've talked about on the kind of sound like assholes,
I mean,

1545
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:50.450
what do you want to dub it?
Their house smells to the way you've described them.

1546
01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:54.740
You want to go over into this smelly house,
you know,

1547
01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:58.490
to watch the Billy vests that they bought with your dead ants.
Money.
Fuck them.

1548
01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:03.530
Go with your gut.
Fuck them.
You know,
at some point you,
you could,

1549
01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:07.850
I don't know.
Do you want to have that confrontation?
Yeah,

1550
01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.250
I think the only weird thing,
the cousins is not a weird thing.

1551
01:36:10.730 --> 01:36:12.680
I don't think the fact that they're not involved is,

1552
01:36:12.681 --> 01:36:16.760
is a weird thing because a lot of times,
you know,
people can be really separated.

1553
01:36:16.761 --> 01:36:21.761
But like the weird thing is your aunt not giving a shit that your other aunt

1554
01:36:22.371 --> 01:36:27.050
died because their sisters,
that's just fucking bizarre to me.
But,
uh,

1555
01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:29.450
who knows,
maybe a dead and did something to her.

1556
01:36:29.630 --> 01:36:31.850
He didn't know that she had 20 fucking cars.

1557
01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:35.120
Maybe you should keep sifting through the pictures and uh,

1558
01:36:35.210 --> 01:36:38.320
maybe you'll discover something.
I don't know what,
I don't know what,
but the,

1559
01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:42.200
I don't know what do that advice sucked.
Okay.

1560
01:36:42.201 --> 01:36:46.190
I'm not qualified for,
uh,
you know,

1561
01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:48.320
I don't know that level of stuff,

1562
01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:52.580
but feel free to keep sending me stuff like that cause it must be fun to listen

1563
01:36:52.581 --> 01:36:56.570
to me a squirm.
Speaking of that,
um,

1564
01:36:56.630 --> 01:36:59.960
here's some shit about,
uh,
you know,
something,

1565
01:36:59.961 --> 01:37:04.460
somebody sent me something great about banks trying to help me explain what the

1566
01:37:04.461 --> 01:37:06.110
fuck I was trying to say last week,

1567
01:37:06.111 --> 01:37:10.160
but really couldn't explain it in an intelligent way.

1568
01:37:10.190 --> 01:37:12.710
And I lost the email because I,

1569
01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:16.790
I didn't have any internet over the weekend and I had it on my blackberry and I

1570
01:37:16.791 --> 01:37:17.481
got rid of it.

1571
01:37:17.481 --> 01:37:21.320
But basically this guy was touching on some shit that I had heard before that

1572
01:37:21.321 --> 01:37:22.670
basically when you,

1573
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:26.270
if you take a thousand of your own dollars and you put it in a bank,

1574
01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:28.250
believe it or not,

1575
01:37:28.251 --> 01:37:32.570
the bank can legally loan that thousand dollars out to like nine different

1576
01:37:32.571 --> 01:37:33.404
people.

1577
01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:38.870
And I don't mean nine people get a portion that totals up to a thousand.

1578
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:44.590
I mean nine people can get $1,000 loan off of the thousand dollars that you put

1579
01:37:46.701 --> 01:37:50.180
in.
So
if you're sitting there going,

1580
01:37:50.181 --> 01:37:55.040
well then didn't they just invent,
um,
$8,000?

1581
01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:59.860
Yes,
they just created out of thin air and,

1582
01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:03.880
um,
I don't know if that's why our money really has no value.

1583
01:38:03.881 --> 01:38:08.320
They just created out of thin air on this guy was basically explaining that one

1584
01:38:08.321 --> 01:38:13.321
of the reasons our money has value is basically the person who takes the loan,

1585
01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:21.580
them promising to pay it back,
gives it value.
But,
uh,

1586
01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.250
I dunno,
I have no idea.

1587
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:27.270
I wish that there was some sort of,
uh,

1588
01:38:29.410 --> 01:38:33.340
like home kit where you could make your own bank.
You know what I mean?

1589
01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:37.690
The same way people make their own fucking beer in the bathtub or they make

1590
01:38:37.691 --> 01:38:41.680
lemonade this,
you know,
that'd be a great fight.
Billy Mays was still alive.

1591
01:38:41.681 --> 01:38:44.860
He could sell that shit.
You know,
I'm Billy Mays.
I use soak,

1592
01:38:44.861 --> 01:38:48.520
I put in your money in the bags and having a blown out to a budget cut.

1593
01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:49.810
We don't even pay it back.

1594
01:38:49.811 --> 01:38:53.550
So then you fucking lose [inaudible] you're out personal bag.

1595
01:38:53.551 --> 01:38:56.440
He basically showed you how to convert your garage into a brick fucking,

1596
01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:00.440
I dunno what have some homeless guy that will be your security.

1597
01:39:00.490 --> 01:39:04.030
You just have some homeless guy that smells so fucking bad.
You know,

1598
01:39:04.031 --> 01:39:06.700
granted all your money would smell,
but like no one would go near.

1599
01:39:06.701 --> 01:39:08.110
I don't know what the,
I don't know what to tell you,

1600
01:39:09.530 --> 01:39:09.841
<v 5>but I,</v>

1601
01:39:09.841 --> 01:39:14.841
I feel like an idiot every week taking my money and then putting it into a bank.

1602
01:39:15.231 --> 01:39:17.090
But there's no other fucking options,

1603
01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:19.133
<v 6>you know,</v>

1604
01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:22.020
<v 5>short of sticking it in my mattress,</v>

1605
01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:28.110
<v 6>you know?
And then you make yourself a target,
you know,
hey,</v>

1606
01:39:28.111 --> 01:39:30.840
you see that skinny red over there?
It doesn't have to fight a,

1607
01:39:30.841 --> 01:39:34.470
he's got a fucking thousand dollars in his pillowcase.
Hey guys,
here,

1608
01:39:34.471 --> 01:39:37.230
you want to play Frisbee?
Let's get blasted in the face.

1609
01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:39.270
And not only am I out of thousand bucks,

1610
01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:43.530
I have to buy a new pillow because I noticed that's one thing about when people

1611
01:39:43.531 --> 01:39:47.370
steal,
they have to ruin your place too.
They have to ransack it.

1612
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:52.230
They can't just reach into your pillow.
It's wide open.
Just reach in and take it.

1613
01:39:52.450 --> 01:39:56.510
Nah,
Nah,
I got to rip it off and fucking stab it up.
You know

1614
01:39:57.100 --> 01:40:00.130
<v 5>something about putting on a cat suit that makes people extra destructive.</v>

1615
01:40:00.490 --> 01:40:03.280
All right.
Anyways,
that's the podcast for this week.

1616
01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:06.790
I hope to see you guys out at my show.
I am getting geared up for my special,

1617
01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:10.270
I'm not drinking,
I'm not boozing,
so please don't tempt me when I'm out there.

1618
01:40:10.271 --> 01:40:13.390
But if you want to show me your tits,
that is fine and I will happily sign them.

1619
01:40:13.810 --> 01:40:17.050
See,
there's a balance to my life also.
Um,

1620
01:40:17.230 --> 01:40:19.960
please try to see if you're anywhere near Ontario,
California.

1621
01:40:19.961 --> 01:40:21.610
Please come out to my show out there.

1622
01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:24.880
I would really love to sell a bunch of tickets out there because,
um,

1623
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:29.350
I don't have much of a presence here in the lower California area.

1624
01:40:29.710 --> 01:40:31.390
I don't have anything in San Diego.

1625
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:35.710
I got nothing going on in the greater la area and I usually don't plead with

1626
01:40:35.711 --> 01:40:39.850
people to this level to come to my shows,
but I am right now.
All right.

1627
01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:45.550
I'm like fucking a,
what's his fates and that,
that fucking Miller's crossing.

1628
01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:47.470
Look into your heart.

1629
01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:53.920
Look into you John.
Turturro.
What a great movie that is.

1630
01:40:53.921 --> 01:40:54.010
I

1631
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:56.530
<v 6>finally saw that one the other day.
Wasn't that a great,</v>

1632
01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:00.730
you guys want to hear cleo getting scratched one more time to hear what fucking

1633
01:41:00.731 --> 01:41:03.280
a ecstasy sounds like.
No Watch.
She won't do it.
Here we go.

1634
01:41:03.890 --> 01:41:04.723
<v 2>Cleo.</v>

1635
01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:16.270
<v 6>There you go.
That wasn't as good as yelling once.
Whatever,
go fuck yourself.</v>

1636
01:41:16.271 --> 01:41:19.420
This is life.
That's how it goes.
All right,
and let me know how this works out.

1637
01:41:19.421 --> 01:41:23.440
Is it a smaller file and all that type of shit?
You guys have a good week and a,

1638
01:41:23.470 --> 01:41:25.810
I will talk to you next Monday,

1639
01:41:25.811 --> 01:41:28.210
although we'll be a little bit later cause I am flying back from,

1640
01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:33.400
from Atlanta on,
uh,
on Monday.
So there you go.

1641
01:41:33.570 --> 01:41:36.160
All right.
So then I'll be like,
dude,
where the fuck is it?
It's common.

1642
01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:40.540
It's always coming.
All right.
It might be a little fucking late,
but it is coming.

1643
01:41:40.830 --> 01:41:42.170
All right,
you guys have a good week.

1644
01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:10.143
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1645
01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:41.420
[inaudible].
