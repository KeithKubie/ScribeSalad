00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.640
The solution for this is that as a result of writing this result,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.700
nothing changes in the RAT. Remember that write result doesn't update the RAT,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.750
commit does. So we only update the RAT when we issue an instruction to but

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.840
the new renaming in here. And when we commit the instruction,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.980
to possibly remove that remaining if it, if it's still pointing to us.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.000
So the correct answer is really nothing.
