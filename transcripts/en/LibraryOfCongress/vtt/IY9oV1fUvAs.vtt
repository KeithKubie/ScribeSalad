Chris Germain,

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.390
director of the Oberlin

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.910
Good evening, everybody,
and welcome.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.480
Really happy to be here.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.500
And before we get into
the program tonight,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.820
I'd like to just give a word
of thanks to everyone here

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.910
at the library of [tape
skips] absolutely wonderful

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.780
to work with, and so supportive.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.990
And there is no way we could
have accomplished this --

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.820
our goal of the story that
we're going to tell you tonight

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.550
without their total help.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.140
And that's what we're
going to do tonight.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.440
We want to tell you
what I think is going

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.470
to be a really interesting story
that's going to span 300 years

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.270
about violins, starting
with Antonio Stradivari,

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.890
and leading up the modern day.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.980
But before we begin
to tell you the story,

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.140
I would like to have the musical
performance of the two violins,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.940
the original Betts Stradivari,
which is in the collection here

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.050
at the Library of Congress, and a
copy that we made at our workshop

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.300
at the BSA Overland Workshop.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.970
And to do that, I would like to
introduce two very fine violinists,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.220
some friends, Claudia Chudacoff

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.510

your selections.

[ Silence ]

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.180
&gt;&gt; First we'll play
the second movement

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.170 position:56%
of a Leclair sonata for two violins.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.510
It's a gavotte movement,
Dante Egratsia [phonetic], so.

&gt;&gt; Oops, sorry, one second.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.620
I've got to take that
one [inaudible].

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.070
Next we'll play a duet for two
flutes by Telemann in G major.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.370
It's sort of a fugue.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.510
It's the second moment
of the first sonata.

&gt;&gt; So this was a chance to hear the
two instruments in a performance.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.460
We thought you'd like to hear just
the clear sounds of a simple scale

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.760
on each of the instruments.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.510
So Chris has agreed just
to play a simple scale.

&gt;&gt; Well, Chris, thank you very much.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.550 position:56%
We are purposely not revealing which
instrument is which at this moment.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.760
We thought we'd let
you keep these sounds

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.260
in your heads while
we reveal the story

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.560 position:56%
of how these instruments came about.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.860
Chris.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.020
&gt;&gt; Okay. So we were kind
of sneaky with you tonight.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.030
Usually, you start a
story out at the beginning

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.400
and work your way all
the to the end.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.810
What we decided to do was end the
story with the most important part,

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.410
the music that's played
on the violin.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.770
Now, I want you to keep all

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.240
of what you just heard
stored in your memory.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.120
Think about what you just heard
because we want to get back to you

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.800
at the end, and would like to get
your feedback about what you heard,

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.450
what you think you heard,

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:27.550
and we want your story
about the music tonight.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.340
But we have to start back at the
beginning and this is a project

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.180
which has taken years
to get through.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.040
It's been a labor of
love and hard work.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.280
It began some years ago
when John Montgomery,

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.570
curator here of musical
instruments at the Smithsonian,

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:49.690
had suggested for our workshop at
Oberlin College during the summer

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:53.150
to study a great instrument.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.970
And we thought about
what might be available.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.730
Back up a little bit and tell
you, sometimes I'll meet people

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.910
on the street, you'll
start a conversation up,

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.670
and the conversation
will lead to, you know,

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:03.970
"What do you do for a living?"

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.120
And then I'll say, "Well,
you know, I'm a violinmaker."

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.450
And it's always interesting to see
the response that you get back.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.470
And usually, people
do one of two things.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.340
Usually, they'll first
start to say, "You know,

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.100
I didn't know did that anymore."

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.310
[Laughs] and I assure them
it's still a viable profession,

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.290
even though we do things
pretty much the way

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.100
that things were done
300 years ago back

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.300
when Stradivari was
living and working.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.080
But then the next thing that
usually bring up is Stradivari.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.250
It seems like anybody anywhere
knows the name Stradivari.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.380
And they always ask,
"What's the secret?

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.680
Tell me the secret.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.850
It's got to be, like, you know,
one sentence that you can tell me

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.880
so I -- then I can make a
violin like Stradivari."

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.950 position:56%
And this is something we makers have
dealt with for a very long time.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.490
You know, it's my opinion, and
I think also the opinion of many

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.090
of my colleagues that there
is no secret to Stradivari,

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.390
that the secret was
his genius alone.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.770
Here's a man with an incredible
80-year working period,

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.210
who was totally dedicated
to his craft in a time

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.850
that fostered the arts
like no other.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:13.270
And through his devotion and hard
work, he became the greatest.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:17.420
So if that's the truth, then how do
we discover what his secrets are?

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.490
Well his secrets, I believe,
lie right in front of us

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.650
within the instruments themselves.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.900
And only through a
systematic study of them,

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.380
can we really understand Stradivari
and how we worked and hoped

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:37.000
to conceive an instrument in the
same sentences as good as he did.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.940
So what we decided to do is like
a "Mission Impossible" theme,

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.650
put together the great dream team
here that you see in front of you,

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.110
many experts, mostly violinmakers.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:47.820
But we have a radiologist here.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.630
We have people with
great tactical skill.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.630
And this was the theme
of our Oberlin Workshop,

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:58.020
to get the Betts Stradivari,
to systematically analyze it,

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.770
to gather information using
the highest technology,

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.790
and then also to incorporate
the technology

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:08.910
of today during the construction
of an instrument through --

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.950
well, they'll tell
you how they did it.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.720
But let's go ahead and begin.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.190
And I would like to introduce our
technical experts, Dr. Steve Sirr,

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.790
radiologist from Indianapolis,
Minnesota; and he'll be joined

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.510
with by Steve Rossow and
John Waddle to his left.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.600
[ Silence ]

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.900
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Chris.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.590
Thank you very much.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.940
I'm a diagnostic radiologist.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:45.010 position:56%
I went to college for 14 years, and
I taught medical residents radiology

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.240
at the University of the
Minnesota for seven years.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.630
And back in 1989 at Hennepin
County Medical Center

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.780
when I was responsible for
teaching residents radiology,

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.470
I had three really high-quality
residents that could take care

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.080
of the entire hospital for me.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.150 position:56%
And I became very bored on weekends,
and so I brought my violin in.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.920
And I'm not a very good player,
but I brought it in to practice.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.400
And one on Saturday afternoon,
there was a gunshot victim

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.930
who needed some rapid attention.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.700
And so he came into the CT scanner,
and we knew that he was going

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.550
to surgery after the CT scanner.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:26.200
And one of the young residents
was banging on my door

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:32.360
as I was practicing and said, "Dr.
Sirr, please come and help us look

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.400
at this scan so this guy can
go right away to surgery."

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:40.660
So I ran out of my office
carrying my violin down the hallway

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.050
and put the violin
next to the CT scanner.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:47.620
And then we read the CT scan,
the patient went to surgery.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.650
And then as I turned
around, I realized this --

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.960
my violin was next
to the CT scanner.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.190
So I thought, "Well,
why not just scan this?"

00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:01.770
And that was in [laughter] 1989.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:07.690
And then I realized that there's
a lot of anatomy inside the violin

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.720
that I had no idea
what I was looking at.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.150
And I had purchased my violin

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.470
from John Waddle, this
wonderful man here.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:21.840
And so I took the CT scan
to John Waddle's shop,

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.230
and handed it to John
on one Saturday morning.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.820
And John said, "What are these?"

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.790
And I said, "I'm not
going to tell you.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.090
You have to tell me."

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.590
So I went back into his room
and started looking at some

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.960
of his old books that he had.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.190
And all of the sudden John --
this is my version of the story.

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:41.020
All of the sudden,
John started yelling,

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.930
you know, "This is really great."

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.610
And, you know, I walked
out to where he was

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.170 position:56%
and he said -- I said, "What is it?"

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.420
And he said, "This is
a CT scan of a violin."

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.670
And he said that there
were things in that scan

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.770
that he had never seen before,

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.830
which was just what I was
hoping that he would say.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:02.240
So, since that time we've
scanned hundreds of instruments.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:09.330
And we have scanned about 60
instruments that were made prior

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:14.090
to 1734, along with hundreds
of other instruments.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.830
The study of the human
body is a lot --

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:22.640
is very similar to the study of
violins and stringed instruments.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.010
The first thing I always
taught the residents was

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.970
that there's a very wide
range of normal anatomy.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.530 position:56%
And once you understand the normal
anatomy, then you can understand the

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:37.620 position:56%
"diseases" in quotes, of the violin,
which are mostly due to trauma

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:42.910
or infestation by worms, or
a combination of the two.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:47.360 position:56%
And then just like the surgeons go
out and take the patients to surgery

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.910
to try to fix them, the restorers,

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.860
violin restorers go do the
same thing with the violin.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.040 position:56%
So in these old instruments, there's
always very interesting features

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.950
of the violin that we always see.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:05.080 position:56%
So what I thought I would do is show
today what a CT scan looks like.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.810
And this is -- these
are two CT scans.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:13.900
And I've them going
in synchrony here.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.670
So you can see right here is
the lower block of the CT scan.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.260
And this is this --
the bass bar just came

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.760
into view there in
both of these scans.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.870
This is the widest part of
the lower bout right there.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.630
And there's the F-hole, beginning
of the lower portion of the F-hole.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.610 position:56%
And you can see how they match up
perfectly as they go back and forth.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:38.630
Also notice how the shapes of
the violins are exactly the same

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.590
and the thicknesses are the same.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.010
This is the sound post area.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:47.000
And you can see that right
here is a little black line,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.060
and that's the sound post patch,

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.150
which we always see
on older instruments.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.920
So this instrument is the
instrument that Strad made.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.830
And this is the one that
was made with the CT

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:02.090
and the CNC process that we have.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:06.200
And we scanned it -- after we made
it, we scanned instrument just

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.370
to show how good quality it is,
and how accurately it reproduces.

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:12.670
So then I'll continue up here.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.470
And these are the upper corners.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:18.080
I'll kind of go back and forth,
and you can see the upper corners.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.470
This is the widest part of
the upper bout right here.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:25.690
And then the sound post disappear
-- or the bass part disappears,

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.080
and both instruments are at
exactly at the same spot.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.310
And then this is the upper
bout -- upper block here.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.540
And this is the neck.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.140
The neck has been refitted
here in the original.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.040
And there's our neck.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:46.430
And then going through the
ebony, of course, is darker.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.780
It has higher density.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.520
And then we'll come into the box.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.480
Here's the box in both instruments.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.510
And then, this is something that
I found very interesting, too.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:01.160
[ Silence ]

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:07.610
This image right here,
this is the Betts scroll,

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.660
a cross-section of the scroll.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.500
And this is the cross-section
of the scroll for the instrument

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.660
that was made with the CT
scan from this instrument,

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.250
the Betts instrument, and carved

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.570
with the CNC scanner
from the CT data.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:24.610
And you can see that this
looks like it's crossed.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:31.160
So I always thought that being
extremely devout Roman Catholics

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.990
that lived at the time in
Italy, they always tended to --

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.630 position:56%
well they always thought about Jesus

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.180
and how important it
was to be a good person.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:46.050
And so the violinmakers hid
the cross in the scroll here.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.020 position:56%
It seems to me to be pretty obvious.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.510
And then I'll go back again.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:56.540
[ Silence ]

00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:01.480
So this violin, the new violin, was
made with wood that is very similar

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.770
in quality to the original Betts.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.320
With CT scanners, we can
measure densities of woods

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.060
without taking the
violin apart, of course.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.590
So we try to find wood
that is the same density,

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.860
has the same grain pattern,
the same qualities of wood.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:20.450
And then use that to carve
with a CNC scanner directed

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:27.620
by the CT scan an instrument
like this, or that.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.760
So that's my part.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:41.220
[ Silence ]

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.510
And this is Steve Rossow,
a good friend of mine.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:48.700
[ Silence ]

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.500
And Steve was an apprentice
for John Waddle.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:59.450
And we meet at John's shop every
Friday after work for a session

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.510
that kind of turns
into a men's group.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.060
[ Laughter ]

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.360
And one day --

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.660
&gt;&gt; But we still tell our wives

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.510
that it's strictly
professional and there's no --

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.410

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.800
[ Inaudible Comments ]

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:20.710
&gt;&gt; Okay. So before I get
to that night where we kind

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:24.020
of figured something
out this was from --

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.510
by the way, yes, Steve Rossow,
violinmaker, St. Paul, Minnesota.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:31.040
[ Silence ]

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.440 position:56%
I had just -- actually, it was
about six years ago, maybe six going

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:40.600
on almost seven years ago, I --
a friend of mine, and I had taken

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.180 position:56%
on a project to build a CNC machine.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:50.190
And a CNC machine -- "CNC" is
"computer numerical control".

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:54.690
And it's basically a machine that's
a three-axis carving machine that's

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:55.990
driven by a computer.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.260
That's a real basic
way of putting it.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.960
If you have a three-dimensional
image, or a two-dimensional image

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.320
of an object, you can
plug it into the machine;

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.540
it'll carve out that part.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.830
And you can get -- you know,
you can create drawings

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:20.630 position:56%
in a CAD computerized design program
or other ways, like CT scans.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:24.740
And so I had come into John's
shop on a Friday night about --

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:29.410
might have been about five, six
years ago, and had told these guys,

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:31.150
"Hey, I've got the --
the machine's done.

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:33.080
I don't really know
what to do with it yet."

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:37.130
But I had brought in
some parts that I made,

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.620
I think some inlays or
something like that.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.570
And John and Steve, you know,
they had been CT scanning violins

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:48.580
for years, were already dabbling
in a little bit of this --

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.350
using these files to
create these plastic models

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.720
of the Betts Stradivarius.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.980
And I think there was an example
floating around here of a scroll.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:04.200
But that night, Steve had asked me
what file format my machine takes

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.500
to carve out a part.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.260
And I told him, I go, "Well, if
it's a three-dimensional part,

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.540
an STL file, it's what I need."

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.550
And he said, "Well, I
think I can save this image

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:15.820
of the Betts Stradivarius
as an STL file.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.120
Let's see what happens here."

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.330 position:56%
And so he goes through that process.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.430
He gives me this disk.

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:23.850
And I'm like, "Yes, well okay.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.150
Whatever."

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.210
You know. [Laughter] And
I go back to my shop.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.690 position:56%
I think it sat on my bench for, you
know, a couple of weeks or something

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.330
like that before I even
thought about picking it --

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.570
you know, I thought, "Oh
that's, you know, a cute idea."

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.400
[Laughs] And so I finally
open it up.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.100
It was this enormous file.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.720
And what I -- what you see on the
screen right there is actually --

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.360
it's a program called "Rhinoceros",

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.790
which is a 3D drafting
program which I use.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.490
And what you see is
a real fine mesh,

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.810
little triangles called "polygons".

00:22:54.810 --> 00:23:00.420
And that's the file format that
the machine at the time it can --

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.170
you can take -- use
other file formats.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:07.130 position:56%
But that's, at the time, what we
were -- we figured out we could use,

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:10.920
and enormously dense,
about a million

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.450
of these little polygons
making up this --

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.390
the image of the whole violin.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:18.750
And so the computer I had
at the time was old and slow

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.030
and it was just hard to
even manipulate this thing.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.820
I got to the point where I was
able to trim the top off the sides

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.800
of the violin and trim the back
off of the sides of the violin.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:35.120
And I just, for the heck of it,
took the file of I think the back.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.810
It was the back, put a
piece of scrap wood, poplar,

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:43.000
something like that, fixed
it down to my machine,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.450
set the parameters I needed to.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:46.850
I hit "Go".

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:51.760
And it started carving out
the shape of a violin back.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.410
I'm like, "Oh that's kind of neat."

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.920
And I got done with it and like,
"Wow, this is kind of neat.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.330
I've got to show the
guys on Friday."

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:00.820
[Laughter] And pretty unrefined,
yet there still had a lot

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.490
of work to do with these files.

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:06.380
Brought it in, and they
were like, "Well, wow,

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.790
I think we might have
something here."

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:11.610
And, you know, "Go
work on it some more."

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:14.440
[Laughter] So I got
back, and I further --

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.750
you know, I had to rescale
things a little bit,

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.030
because of the translating
from Steve's computer

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.770
to mine was a little
different, and, you know,

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:26.580
the axes that they were placed on
was different than what I needed.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:31.400
Refined it a little more, brought
in another one, looked pretty good.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.480
Then I started adding
the purfling channel,

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.550
which is that decorative
strip that's in --

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:37.560
from the outline of the violin.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.270
Working on the outline, eventually
got to the point of, you know,

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:45.490
cutting the F-holes, creating
the scrolls from these files,

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.870
which I have -- you know, I
have this huge cabinet full

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:50.670
of scrap things that
didn't work out.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:53.170
So it was a lot of test
wood going into this.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.120
And it got to the point
where finally, "Alright;

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.370
let's put some good wood in
here and see what we can do."

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:02.680
And finally carved out some
parts that were successful

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.050
and that were going to work.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.750
And I have some pictures here.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:13.210
[Laughter] There's the
machine, and there we are.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:16.370
Here's a blank piece of wood,
really nice piece of maple

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:20.040
for a back being ready to carve.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.410
And it's sitting on a cradle
that's vex, so it vacuums down,

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:26.850
holds it in place and locates it.

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:34.140
Here it is getting close to carving
out the outside of the plate.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:38.930
And now the carving is done,
and now the outline is going

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.140
to get cut to clean up the outline.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.080
And from there -- I don't
think we have pictures

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.960
of the purfling channel
and all that.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.260
But so --

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.560
&gt;&gt; Are you using [inaudible]?

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:57.500
&gt;&gt; Yes; they're end mills; usually,
use our round nose, half inch

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.800
and mill for the carving.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.890
And this is a quarter inch
end mill to cut the outline.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:04.030
And then, I'll use a little,
you know, one point --

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:07.430
whatever the purfling channel width
is one point two, one point five,

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:10.130
to carve the purfling in this net.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:14.030
So finally, we got to the point
where we had this really --

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.050
these neat parts that were cut out.

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:20.610
And then as far as the
connection to Oberlin,

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.830
I guess if somebody else
wants to talk about that,

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:27.370
we were invited to be part of that.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.640
The mold is a whole different
thing, and I won't really --

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.070 position:56%
we don't have time to get into that.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.440
But here are some other pictures.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.740
John.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:40.030
&gt;&gt; This is John Waddle, the
third of the three of us here.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.040
[ Silence ]

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.510
&gt;&gt; So I don't want to spend
too much time because I want

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:48.640
to give Jeff and Antoine
enough time.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.460
But I first became aware of
the Betts Stradivarius in 1989

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.650
when the Strad Magazine published
a really nice article about it

00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:00.510
by Roger Hargreaves [assumed
spelling], with a nice poster.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:05.790 position:56%
And I thought at the time, "Wow,
what an amazingly beautiful violin."

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.140
And so I kind of had it
in the back of my mind.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.650
And years went by, and Steve Sirr

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.720
and I started CT scanning
instruments together.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:18.160
And around the same time, Gary
Stern, who's sitting right here

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:24.110
in the front row, and his
cohort, Bruno Frohlich,

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:29.960
over at the Smithsonian, were
also CT scanning instruments.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:37.210
And Steve Sirr and I were trying
to get scans of better instruments.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:40.280
And so I started bugging
Gary Stern because I knew

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.750
that they had CT scanned the Betts.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.460
And after a while,

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.930
he very generously sent
me the scans of the Betts.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:53.230
And that allowed Steve Sirr and I
to study the Betts very closely.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:56.350
And I ended up writing an article
for the Strad Magazine myself

00:27:56.350 --> 00:28:01.110
on the Betts, which was
published in May of 2010.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.440
And as a result of that
article, and as a result of Chris

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.360
and Raymond Schrier [assumed
spelling], and John Montgomery,

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.000
and other people deciding
to make the Betts the focus

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.990
of the Oberlin Project, I
was invited to go to Oberlin,

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.130
along with Steve Sirr
and Steve Rossow to talk

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.450
about what we had been doing.

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:24.970
And so that was a great honor for
me to be included in that group,

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:31.010
and to be able to study
these instruments is amazing.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:36.050 position:56%
I remember when I was in the
violinmaking school, if a Strad came

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.810
to visit the school, it was
always a really big deal,

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:40.520
and everybody would
just drop everything.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.780
And just to be in a room with a
Strad was a tremendously big deal.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:50.570
But to have the detail and
the ability to study something

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:56.010
so closely is way better
and more interesting.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:29:01.060
So it's been a long project
and it's been really fun.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.490
And like I said, I'm going
to be short and give it

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:08.010
over to these two amazing guys
over here, who did the varnish work

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:09.660
on one of those instruments there.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.510
[ Laughter ]

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:20.630
[ Silence ]

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:23.510
&gt;&gt; While they're getting
-- can you hear me?

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:24.890
I can just shout.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:26.580
While they're getting set up,

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:30.250
this is Jeff Phillips,
this is Antoine Nedelec.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:32.770
They are not always
joined at the hip.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:37.760
They work independently in Salt
Lake City and in Dallas, Texas.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.750
They're old buddies and they're
great friends of ours at Oberlin.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:46.190 position:56%
And their role was to come on out
and do their genius with varnishing.

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:49.470
And the work that they do
is absolutely fantastic.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:52.850
When you're a violinmaker,
the thing that brings --

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.920
draws fear into your heart
the most is when you have

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.470
to start painting it;
putting on the varnish.

00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:01.270
And then to do that in front of
50 other colleagues breathing

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.080
down their neck was
an incredible feat.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.510
So in advance, I'd like to thank
you guys for what you've done.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:10.510
[ Applause ]

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:18.200
[ Background Sounds ]

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.150
&gt;&gt; Hello. Jeff Phillips
out of Salt Lake City.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.840
&gt;&gt; And I'm Antoine
Nedelec from Dallas.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:31.320
So we have a few pictures but
fortunately, we do have a video

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.510
of the CNC machine,
if you don't mind.

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:37.260
[ Silence ]

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.510
I believe it went something
like that.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:52.080
[ Laughter ]

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.490
Highly high-tech.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:56.510
[Laughter] And you went 14
years to school for this.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:02.700
[ Laughter ]

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.940
&gt;&gt; On a more serious note --

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.240
&gt;&gt; That looks very serious.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.540
[Laughter]

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.760
&gt;&gt; After the instrument
had been put together

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:16.120
in the 2011 Oberlin
Workshop, it's then --

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.220
takes a year to get ready
for the following year.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:23.380
In 2012, we came into the workshop
and varnished the instruments.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.680
So one of the first things we have

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.930
to do is get the actually wood
part ready for the varnish.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.320
And so one of the first
things we do is put it

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.310
in a light box to get a suntan.

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:37.980
&gt;&gt; Lots of the really nice dark
colors you see on Stradivarius

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:43.010
and older violins come from
oxidation from simple exposure

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:46.280
to UV lights and things like that.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.370
So there's the light box.

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:49.670
Oops.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.040
[ Laughter ]

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.840 position:56%
So you see those are just UV lights.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:57.230
[ Silence ]

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:00.720
&gt;&gt; Follow-up with that, we put a --

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.120
&gt;&gt; Here it's -- yes.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.590
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes; we put just
a mild solution of --

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.890
an oxidizing solution
on top of that.

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:12.420
That sort of helps with the color,

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:15.750
gives it that nice golden
brown oxidized look.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.860
So you can see in the picture
there, so the white sort

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.610 position:56%
of still unfinished instrument along

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:22.270
with the Oberlin Betts
before varnish is put on.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.520
[ Silence ]

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.140
&gt;&gt; And varnish cooking.

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:32.700
It's actually -- everybody's
always looking for the secret

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.480
of Stradivarius with the varnish.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.810
I believe that was very simple.

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:42.980 position:56%
I -- and you can obtain a good color
just by cooking the resin longer.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.750
The darker you want your
color, just cook it longer.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:50.000
&gt;&gt; Yes; we use fairly simple,
sort of tree resins that come

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.800
from different places, just cooked

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.750
at different temperatures,
different rates.

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:57.280
And the process of
cooking, you just had to --

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.510
produces a lot of color that ends
up being in the varnish itself.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:03.860
[ Silence ]

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.660
&gt;&gt; So Oberlin varnishing begins.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.600
This is actually the
application of the ground.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.610
And this one, we don't
apply it with a brush.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:19.850 position:56%
I'll let the video speak for itself.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.880
&gt;&gt; And again, sort of
the purpose of this is

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.710
to also continue the
coloration of the wood.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:29.220
So this is sort of put into
the wood, sort of rubbed in.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:34.680
Just again, another cooked
resin applied with a rag

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.970
and then wiped off with spirits.

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:39.640
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:44.570
&gt;&gt; If you wanted [inaudible]
to the acoustics of the box

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:46.780
as you were applying each layer?

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.080
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.080
&gt;&gt; You know, as makers,
we tend to sort of prepare

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.080
for what the varnish is going
to do to the instrument.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.420
It's not a huge change,
depending on what you use

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:55.720
and how much of it you use.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.520
But it's something you definitely
have to take into consideration.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.450
[ Silence ]

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.510
It can add weight, it
can stiffen the wood.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:07.530
[ Silence ]

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.050
&gt;&gt; Going to --

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:11.260
[ Silence ]

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.090
&gt;&gt; So after the ground is
put on, if you take a look

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.420
at most Stradivari instruments
and a lot of Cremonese instruments

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:22.480
at the time, they put black
on a lot of the chamfers,

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.190
especially on the scroll.

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:26.230
A lot of it is worn off.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.960
If you look on the Betts here,

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.030
you will still see
some ruminants left on.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:34.410
So that's put on, just some black
ink painted onto the chamfers.

00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:36.800
[ Silence ]

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.820
&gt;&gt; Next, we put a separator.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:46.420
That step is to protect the ground
of the violin from being removed

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:49.880
when we start removing the varnish.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.790
I'm not sure that that
[inaudible] varnish,

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:56.640
but it definitely works
for our purpose.

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.180
I -- sometimes I compare
[inaudible] a little bit

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:01.910
as sound editing in movie theaters.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:04.210
You'll hear the noise of the horse,

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:07.070
and it's actually somebody
banging rocks.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.940
So I'd say it's a little
bit like that,

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.680
meaning they did it 300 years ago,

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:15.510
and go and we just don't really
know exactly how it was done.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:19.000
[ Silence ]

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.430
That's -- we apply the
superior with a brush.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:23.840
[ Silence ]

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And then we begin actual varnish.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:30.970
So here's the Oberlin violin with
its first coat of oil varnish,

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:35.160
again, just resins cooked
in with linseed oils.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.660
And in this case, we call this
the clear coat, the first coat put

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:40.410
on that does not have
any color pigment in it.

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.420
So all the color just comes
from the cooked varnish itself

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.140
and the wood underneath.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.550
[ Silence ]

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:48.850
&gt;&gt; The color coat.

[ Silence ]

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:55.350 position:56%
It's pretty self-explanatory really.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:58.970
&gt;&gt; Variety of different things
you can use, earth pigments,

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:01.020
lake pigments, dyes, so forth.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.340
In this case, we chose
an Elysian resonate.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:07.860
It's sort of similar to a lake
pigment, but attached to rosin,

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.630
just something we were comfortable
with using, we knew its results

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:13.510
and something we were
used to working with.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:17.340
[ Silence ]

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.640
&gt;&gt; So -- , yes.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.470
&gt;&gt; Antoine putting a coat
on the Oberlin Betts.

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:22.610
&gt;&gt; You know, Sam, I don't know

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:25.070
if they applied the
varnish thin or thick.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:31.130
It's very -- you've got some --
Filipe probably will know better

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:33.660
than me, but there's
couple of techs saying

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.960
that Strad applied really
thick varnish and he took force

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.550
to put it on the instrument.

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:42.300
And we just do it thin.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.730
For me anyway, it works better.

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:45.970
I know plenty of people
would do it differently

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:49.740
and they get a very,
very good result.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.810
And in violinmaker never say,
"My way is the only way."

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:57.030
There's plenty of ways of doing
good work; and bad work too.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:59.040
[ Silence ]

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.950
&gt;&gt; And if you put it on thin,
you can put several coats on

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.510
and you can control sort of the
evenness of the coat as well,

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:06.090
color adjustments as well.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.170
[ Silence ]

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:11.650
&gt;&gt; Time for lunch while the
coats are drying; very important.

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:13.450
[Laughter]

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:16.440
[ Background Sounds ]

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.130
Sorry, we don't have
a better picture.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:23.900
That's actually the Oberlin
Betts before it was antiqued.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:28.580
So it was actually varnished
to look like a new violin.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:32.410
So some people sometimes will
start making the violin look old

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:33.860
right away.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.290
Our process is to make
it look just like it did,

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:43.480
and then try to do 300 years' worth
of antiquing in about five days.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.510
[Laughter] So antiquing begins.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:49.470
[ Silence ]

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:53.620
&gt;&gt; So one of the first things we
do is crackling of the varnish.

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:56.520
And that's something that
I think most or a lot

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.170
of Cremonese instruments have
gone through over the times.

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:02.050
Although you tend not to see
it so much, because it's --

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:04.040
a lot of it's been worn away.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.790
So what we see here is
a picture on the left

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.550
of a freshly-varnished instrument

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:11.830
that has had a crackling
process done to it,

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:15.060
just fine little fissures and
crackles into the varnish.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.360
And if you take a look
at the picture

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.600
on the right is actually a
corner of the Stradivari Betts.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.220
And if you look closely, you'll --

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.880
we'll just see some fine little
black lines, sort of through

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.780
in here is what -- where dirt and
patina [phonetic] would have gotten

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.840
down into the original
crackle before a lot

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.260
of it has been worn away.

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.940
&gt;&gt; So that's how the
crackle was done,

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:41.870
it's basically putting the
solution that's applied.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:45.570
And what it does is it -- we hit up
the varnish with soft [inaudible]

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.280
and we apply that solution,

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.920
and it kind of shrinks
everything and creates a crackle.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.720
So that's how it's done.

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:57.720
[ Silence ]

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.020
And yes, it can bubble.

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.320
[Laughter]

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.060
[ Silence ]

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.360
&gt;&gt; You can use a variety
of protein solutions.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.790
In this case, we used
a gum arabic and water.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:11.010
&gt;&gt; And the gum spreads
really nice to get a very,

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:13.160
very controlled thin layer.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.050
And if you do it with a brush,

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:19.780
you could actually see the brush
marks on your crackle, so --

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.230
&gt;&gt; And then it's wiped
off afterwards.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.550
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:25.850
Fascinating, huh?

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:27.650
[Laughter] No, no;
really, really fascinating.

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:31.040
[ Laughter ]

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.840
Oh, boy.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:37.440
[ Laughter ]

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.600
It cannot get any worse, can it?

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.400
Oh, boy.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.420
[ Laughter ]

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:46.720
Chipping the varnish.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.420
[ Silence ]

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:52.340
&gt;&gt; So the initial wearing of the
varnish here after the crackling;

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:55.610
so this was a lot of Cremonese
instruments you see that's sort

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:59.290
of fissuring and chipping of
varnish as things get scratched

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:03.570
and it gets released
off of the ground.

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:05.960
So one of the things we
have to do is make sure

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.720
that our varnish actually
works in this fashion.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.120
So it does actually have
to be chippy varnish.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.670 position:56%
Using the right types of resins and
oil concentrations allow the varnish

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:17.940
to actually work in a
similar fashion to some

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.500
of the Cremonese varnish.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.460
&gt;&gt; And you're very lucky to have
those violins at the Library

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.070
of Congress, because you don't see

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:28.880
that chipping on all
the old violins.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.840
Sometimes they've been French
polished, and worn, and used.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.090
That's -- those are really pristine
and you see that it's actually rare

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:38.630
to have it so good like that.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.890
And here's a little video

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:43.960
of Jeff doing the chipping
on the Oberlin Betts.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.990
The rocks he used actually
help in releasing the varnish,

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:49.510 position:56%
creating little bumps and releasing.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:54.450
[ Silence ]

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:59.140
We decided to turn the volume down
because I am not good at jokes

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.880
and I talk all the
time on those videos.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.610
[Laughter]

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:06.040
[ Silence ]

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.410
And that's how it's done.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:09.480
[ Silence ]

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.280
He makes it look easy.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.580
&gt;&gt; And what is that [inaudible]?

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.620
&gt;&gt; It's tape.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:17.630
So the rock kind of just initiates
the release of the varnish

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:20.510
and then the tape will
then pull it off.

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:26.050
[ Silence ]

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.510
It's a long process that goes over
pretty much the whole instrument.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:34.620
[ Silence ]

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.920
&gt;&gt; Shading.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.700
&gt;&gt; So then through the next
form of varnish wear is shading,

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.650
and it kind of refers to
the smoothing and braiding

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.880 position:56%
of the whole varnish surface itself.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.800
And we do this in a couple of ways.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:56.980
One way is with alcohol; so alcohol
rags gently to remove the varnish,

00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.230
hopefully in sort of
these thin layers.

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:03.820
It creates this nice
gradient of varnish.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:07.250
&gt;&gt; Yes. If you look at
old instruments, you know,

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:10.420
they didn't have the
cases we had back then.

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.440
And, you know the chipping
maybe happened

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:16.550
where they were being banged during
travels or maybe, I don't know,

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:21.630
with the [inaudible] doing stuff on
the violin or as a kid, you know.

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:24.400
Or the shading may be more

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.380
of the actual player
rubbing against the violin.

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.740
[ Silence ]

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.350
So I'll call shedding.

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:34.650
And again, that's Jeff.

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:41.060
&gt;&gt; Yes. You can also do this sort
of abrasion, sort of sandpaper

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:44.490
and so forth, but find that it
tends to make just too smooth

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:48.350
of a glasslike finish, whereas
taking it off with alcohol

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:51.040
like this gives a much
more realistic look.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.020
&gt;&gt; And again, he's
making it look very easy.

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.870
It's actually one of the
very difficult parts.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:03.450
You could wipe off everything,
if you're not careful.

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:09.260
It's very good to have a varnish
that reacts well to alcohol.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.970
I know I don't react
to with alcohol.

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:12.420

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.560
[ Silence ]

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.730
&gt;&gt; And so once varnish has been
worn down, then we start putting

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:20.510
on patina, years and years of dirt.

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.990
[ Silence ]

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:25.290
&gt;&gt; Yes. You --

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:26.770
&gt;&gt; So yes, we start off

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:29.950
with basically pigments
in kind of an oil wash.

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:31.250
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible]?

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:32.550
Should I go back?

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:35.550
&gt;&gt; So that's a picture there
of the Stradivari Betts.

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:39.310
And this sort of gray hue that
you see in the wood and intermixed

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:43.510
in here in the chips and so forth
is patina that's been rubbed down.

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:49.480
[ Silence ]

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:55.910
And along with that patina, we
also do painting and touch-up.

00:43:55.910 --> 00:44:00.760
So you can see on the left
Stradivari Betts F-hole,

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.820
and then sort of a work in progress
in the middle there painting

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.510
on some patina and sort of the
general effect there on the right.

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:32.710
French Polish is kind of
frowned upon now on old violins

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:36.950
because it's simply adding
something that wasn't there before.

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:40.740
It's there, and we're making a copy
and we're adding it to our violin.

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.420
So I think it's okay.

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:46.490
It's got a tendency to
blend things together.

00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:51.070
And honestly, something is
needed to protect the bare wood.

group of 2012, right?

about, is what we started
the event with.

00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:46.190
And let me first ask a question
-- and you can raise your hand,

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:50.330
how many people during the pieces
where both violins were played,

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:54.510
found that they -- both
instruments were equally enjoyable?

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.700
Okay. And then we'll
go to the scales.

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.230
How many people heard
differences in the scales?

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:06.460
So that's a very interesting
thing to say there.

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:10.010
Together, they were extremely
enjoyable instruments.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:11.310
The scales were different.

00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:14.820
Of course, scales are harder things
to ask do we like or don't we like,

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:17.950
because it's just the sweat
that the musician puts

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:20.140
in to be able to create the music.

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:23.840
But I think the interesting thing
about this whole process is,

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:27.500
of course, it's so many
steps and so many years.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.690
If we just talk about the scanning,

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:33.330
I think Gary started doing
it 12 or 13 years ago maybe?

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:37.620
And when he started doing it -- and
this is true of so many inventions

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.950
and progress, he actually didn't
know why he was really doing it.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:44.620
And now you know why
he started doing it.

00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:46.680
So all of these complicated
things come together

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:50.730
and create two incredibly
great-sounding instruments.

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:53.150
So we can cut to the quick.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:58.250
In the first piece, Claudio
was playing the copy.

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:00.430
And this one is the copy.

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:02.280
And then they switched.

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:05.370
And in the scales, the
copy was played first

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:07.590
and then the Betts
was played second.

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:10.140
So, you know, this is all
information you can digest

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:11.520
and you can think about.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.420
I think one of the
things I like to think

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.780
about is how the audience
has permission

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.950
to like everything
the way they want.

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:21.750
And I say that because
there's been a little bit

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:23.680
of a framework that we think about.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.740
When I hand someone
or talk to someone

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.970
about a Stradivarius
before they even play it,

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:30.120
they already think it's amazing.

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.800
And so here was an opportunity
for you to truly hear them

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.490
without any preconceived notions.

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:40.090
The other person I wanted to thank
is a fellow named Bill Sloane

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:43.540
who was the donor to the Library
of Congress of this -- the Betts.

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:48.310 position:56%
He's a member of the Oberlin
Workshop and when this was finished,

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:50.270
acquired the instrument
and then donated it here,

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:52.730
so we're very grateful to
Bill Sloane for having done

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:54.200
that because now we have the chance

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.100
to really compare the two
and see them together.

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:58.040
And the Library has
a great opportunity

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.650
to actually use both of them.

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:03.760
And the exciting thing coming
up Saturday night is the chance

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:07.390
to hear the debut of a new piece
of music here at the Library

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:09.020
on the new Betts Stradivari.

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.640 position:56%
So we hope you'll all come for that.

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.850
So we have a few minutes to
open the floor for questions.

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.150
And I see one back there already.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:17.490
And I'll bring you
the mic because --

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:18.790
&gt;&gt; Oh, we have one.

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:20.090
&gt;&gt; Oh, we have one.

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:21.390
Okay; maybe you can wait
for the mic to come to you.

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:22.840
[ Silence ]

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.810
&gt;&gt; Hi. What wood was
used for the copy,

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:28.490
and how does it compare
with the original?

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:34.100
And secondly, is the heat and
humidity of the workshop important,

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:37.330
especially in the varnishing phase?

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:38.920
&gt;&gt; So the first question
maybe, Steve,

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.850
did you check the densities
of the different woods?

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:44.430
So maybe Steve Sirr can answer
the first question, and Antoine

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:46.120
and Jeff can answer the second.

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.420
&gt;&gt; With CT scanning,

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:50.430
we can determine densities
quite accurately.

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:55.730
So what we're doing now is
trying to find matching wood

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:59.910
that has the same type of
grain pattern and as close

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:02.510
to the original densities
as we could get as possible.

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:08.410
[ Silence ]

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:11.580
&gt;&gt; And as far as varnish
and humidity,

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:15.370
I think it has bigger
effect on wood than varnish.

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:18.650
I have no problem with it;
Salt Lake's so dry, you know.

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:19.950
[Laughs]

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:21.830
&gt;&gt; Plus it's pretty humid.

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:23.130
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:26.540
&gt;&gt; So the varnish -- and oil
varnish doesn't dry with --

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:29.290
well, there is a little
bit of evaporation,

00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:32.200
but basically you're going to help
me with a word that's complicated

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.730
for a French man, "polymerization"?

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:36.490
Am I saying it right?

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:37.790
&gt;&gt; Good enough.

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:39.090
&gt;&gt; Good enough?

00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:40.800 position:56%
So all you need really is UV lights,

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:44.510
and a UV box will do
even in humid climate.

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:48.180
[ Silence ]

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:49.480
&gt;&gt; Any other questions?

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.610
&gt;&gt; Yes; let me just stand
up real quick [inaudible].

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:56.350 position:56%
One of the things that we found out,
which really ran counter to some

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:59.850
of the instincts we have as
violinmakers, generally, we --

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:02.610
in instruments we like
to see a top --

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:04.770
the wood on the top being

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:07.800
of relatively low density,
but high strength.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.070
And the back can be
in higher density.

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:12.530
Also, we want it to be strong.

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:15.210
One thing that we could only find
through the scan of the Betts was

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:17.030
that the top was actually very,

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:18.940
very dense in the original
Betts Stradivari.

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:23.160
I think it was about point four --
four point four five, that region.

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.930
Most violinmakers today if we
had a piece of wood that was

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:28.240 position:56%
of that density, we wouldn't use it.

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:31.680
And so just having the
technology at our disposal,

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:35.440
enabling us to know exactly what
the original materials were like,

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.390
helped us a lot in that.

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:41.410
&gt;&gt; And another interesting thing
about that is through the study

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:44.550
of dendrochronology, we've
actually found out that Stradivari,

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:47.390
and Guarneri, and many of other
great makers used wood that was

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:49.490
between four, five
and six years old.

00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:51.330
So that kind of dispels
that thought that it has

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:54.140
to be some ancient timbers
from some Swiss chalet.

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.820
[Laughter] The wood
selection's important,

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.780
but it's still here today.

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:01.080
Erin.

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.800
&gt;&gt; Yes. Thanks.

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:05.430
What do the parts look like when
they come off the CNC machine?

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:08.250
And what I saw was like of
the arching and the outline,

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:11.640
but does it also do the
under -- the inside?

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.940
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.240
&gt;&gt; Yes, okay.

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.550
&gt;&gt; We can also carve the
insides out, you know,

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:16.980
as well on the CNC machine.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:22.770 position:56%
But I think for the Oberlin Betts,
we had actually carved the outsides,

00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:24.090
cut the purfling channel.

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:27.130
It looked pretty close; it
needed scraper work to be scraped

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:30.270
down to the final finish.

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:33.000
I believe the insides
we carved out --

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.300
&gt;&gt; By hand?

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.850
&gt;&gt; Yes; you know, each
piece of wood's going

00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:38.220
to have a little different
stiffness to it.

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:40.140
So, you know, you can
kind of dial it in --

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:41.440
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.180
&gt;&gt; That way by hand, so.

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:44.480
&gt;&gt; Can I add a little
to some of that?

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.780
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:49.160
&gt;&gt; I just want to add to that
that because we have the CT scans

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.460
of the original instrument,

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:53.090
we can measure the
thicknesses of the wood, too.

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:56.710
So when we're making the
copy, we know what those are.

00:51:56.710 --> 00:52:00.480
And we can choose to copy
them if we wanted to or not.

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.950
[ Silence ]

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:04.670
&gt;&gt; And one thing I
would like to say, too,

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:09.410
is that even though my part of
the project is very high-tech,

00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:12.800
there's quite a bit
of art in what I do.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:18.000
And it takes probably five
to six years of just looking

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.650
at normal variations
and normal things

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:24.470
to realize what the art
of radiology really is.

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:30.290
So this is not just some
machine-made project.

00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:35.510
There's a lot of art involved,
obviously, at every stage of this.

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:38.230
[ Silence ]

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:41.030
&gt;&gt; So I thought we'd take a second
and get another perspective.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:44.160
We're so grateful that Claudia
was willing to play for us.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.310
And, you know, when it all comes
down to it, it's the relationship

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:48.750
between the instrument
and the musician.

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:50.640
So Claudia, perhaps you
can give us a few thoughts

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.150
about what you thought
of when you played?

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.700
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, we --
Chris and I arrived here

00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:58.790
about a half an hour before you did

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:00.810
to play these instruments
for the first time ever.

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.690
And so that was interesting.

00:53:03.690 --> 00:53:06.310
I think the thing I
was stuck by first

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:10.990 position:56%
for sure was really more the
similarities between the instruments

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:13.150
than the differences
because, you know,

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:15.670
any two instruments can be
quite different in terms

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:17.820
of how you approach at
it, how you play it,

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:19.950
and what it sounds
like under your ear.

00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:22.180
Now, I didn't know -- I
don't know as much as you do

00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:25.730
about what it sounds like
at the back of the room,

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:29.490
but there is a real similarity
in character of the sound

00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:32.020
that was very striking to me.

00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:34.750
I would say there was
something about the Strad,

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:37.140
I have to just say it --

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:41.960
that is like it has sort of
an extra tubular bow kind

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:44.870
of gear or something like that.

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:47.100
[Laughs] But both instruments
are really beautiful

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.280
and very enjoyable to play.

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.540
[ Silence ]

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:53.510
&gt;&gt; I don't want to use that
word "turbo" with the Chrysler.

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:57.390
[ Laughter ]

00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:58.770
Any other questions?

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:00.070
Yes.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.880
[ Silence ]

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:05.730
&gt;&gt; One of the things that is
of interest to me is, you know,

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:08.300
in trying to recreate the sound

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:11.010
of a 300-year-old instrument
is this thought

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:13.410 position:56%
of an instrument that's been played,

00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:19.130
and the sound that has been
projected out of the instrument

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:22.240
for -- if it's been played
continuously for 300 years.

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:25.130
How do you try to recreate
that aspect?

00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:27.210
And to me that's, you know,

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:30.530
the vibration from the
sound and the playing on it.

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:33.840
So has there been any
thought about that?

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.660
&gt;&gt; Well, let me also start
by saying that those of us

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.530
who build instruments find that
when the instruments are finished,

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:42.260
they actually sound quite
stunning, quite amazing.

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:45.130
So there is this thought that they
have to be played a lot and yes,

00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:48.740 position:56%
there is certain changes that happen
with instruments as they're played.

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:53.020
But we wouldn't be violinmakers
if they didn't sound really great

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:54.480
because nobody would want them.

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.780
So it isn't that we have to wait

00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:58.350
until we're all dead before anyone
wants to have these violins;

00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:00.280
[laughter] very important thing.

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.290 position:56%
Also there was an interesting -- and
there's been many, many comparisons

00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:06.520
over the years of new -- brand new
instruments and two, and three,

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.310
and four hundred years
old instruments.

00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:11.070
And many, many times, and
most recently in New York City

00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:12.960
at an event called "Mondomusica",

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.020
the new instruments
actually were preferred too.

00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:18.830
So there is an interesting
thought about what happens to wood,

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:22.710 position:56%
both as it's vibrated and maybe more
importantly as the wood changes,

00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:26.160
because in a tree, it's
growing, it's alive,

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:29.720
the cell structure's full of
moisture and there's sugars

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.990
that later will crystallize
and the thing does dry.

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:34.810
So it's a very different piece
of material when it's old.

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:36.760
So we'll never argue with
that and maybe that's

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:39.740
that final subtle difference
that Claudia was referring to.

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:41.040
We'll see.

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.020
But I think to leave
you with the idea

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.810 position:56%
that a great instrument sounds
great whether you vibrate it or not.

00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:47.690
Well, you have to vibrate
it to hear it.

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:50.250
Isaac Stern used to always say when
they thought his violin sounded

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.510 position:56%
so good, he would put it up to his
ear and go, "I don't hear anything."

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:55.050
[ Laughter ]

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:56.350
Any other questions?

00:55:56.350 --> 00:55:57.650
Yes.

00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:58.950
[ Silence ]

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:02.450
&gt;&gt; Have you, or do you have
plans to do any spectral analysis

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:08.380
of the sound from the instrument
or of the vibrational modes

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:13.250 position:56%
of the instrument itself, you know,
not played with the strings but just

00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:15.140
from an acoustic point of view?

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:17.260
[ Silence ]

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:20.560
&gt;&gt; Yes; that was one component
that we left out this evening is

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.760
that both instruments, the original
Betts as well as the copy went

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:27.840
through a series of
acoustical tests at Oberlin.

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.800
And we'll go ahead and continue.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.870
The results have not been
let out to the public.

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:36.010 position:56%
Yes; but we did analyze both
instruments and we found more things

00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:39.460
in common than different
between the two instruments.

00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:42.010
Yes, that's it.

00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:43.310
&gt;&gt; John, did you [inaudible]?

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:44.610
&gt;&gt; No, I [inaudible].

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:46.510
&gt;&gt; Yes; it's being done.

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:49.340
[ Silence ]

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.510
Maybe one more question?

00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:54.460
[ Silence ]

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:58.280
&gt;&gt; So I'm just curious, of
the various violins that are

00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:01.520
in the Library of Congress or
other ones you have access to,

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:07.620
the comparison between these
two, and between this Strad

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:12.780 position:56%
and other Strads, how -- I mean,
what's the magnitude of differences;

00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:17.170 position:56%
because you said that, you know,
there's obviously a range of normal.

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:20.920
Is there a range of,
you know, Strad?

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.940
Well, there's certainly
a range of Strad.

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:29.240
And are the differences here
within the range of the Strads

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:33.870 position:56%
from the acoustical analysis and
any other analyses that you've done?

00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:36.010
&gt;&gt; Well, the acoustical analysis

00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:38.810
that are graphing the sounds are
certainly showing differences

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:42.230
on all the Strads and even on all
the other -- I mean, instrument --

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:44.930
sound is so complex
now that you can --

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:47.660
but I think you want to always
get back to that question

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.930
of what do we the listeners
like to hear?

00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:53.440
And what do players like to play?

00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:56.910
And if you do talk to many
players, they'll talk about Strads

00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:59.490
that sound great and some that
they're not so happy with;

00:57:59.490 --> 00:58:01.530
some that are easy to play and
some that are hard to play.

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:03.380
So that's going to be always there.

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:06.960
The question is you can analyze
it and you can look at it

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:10.130
and see differences, but then how
does that relate to what you like,

00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:12.950
I think is a big question there.

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:18.150
&gt;&gt; But so are these two closer to
each other than this Strad is to --

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:19.450
&gt;&gt; To another Strad?

00:58:19.450 --> 00:58:21.270
&gt;&gt; To another Strad; yes.

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:22.880
&gt;&gt; To be continued.

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.180
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:25.660
[ Laughter ]

00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:27.610
&gt;&gt; Okay; well thank you all very
much for coming this evening.

00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:29.410
Thank you all.
