00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.250
&gt;&gt; Mark Sweeney: Good morning,
and welcome to the second day

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.770
of the Library of Congress'
conference Facts or Fictions,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.580
Debating the Mysteries of Early
Modern Science and Cartography,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.980
a celebration of the
500th anniversary

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.430
of Waldseemuller's
1516 Carta marina.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.700
I'm Mark Sweeney, the Associate
Librarian for Library Services.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.170
I hope a lot of you were
able to join us yesterday.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.320
Needless to say, our distinguished
speakers enlightened us

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.250
about many crucial, intriguing
aspects of Renaissance cartography,

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.840
and then illustrated their
remarks with images of maps

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.940
of enormous significance for our
greater appreciation of the quest

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.010
to explore and understand
the physical world.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.850
Last night we also had the pleasure
of learning about the Mapping

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.500 position:56%
of the Elusive Southern Sky, which
was the subject of the annual Jay I.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.400
Kislak lecture, brilliantly
presented by Dava Sobel.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.500
Today the examination of
Renaissance cartography continues

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.290
with more exciting
presentations and discussions,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.400
as well as an open house at
the Geography and Map Division.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.470 position:56%
I hope you can stay with us
throughout the remainder of the day.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.670
At this time it's my privilege
to introduce the 14th Librarian

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.220
of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.150
As you may know, Dr.
Hayden was sworn

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.370
in as Librarian on
September the 14th.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.940
So unless I'm mistaken, I believe
this is her first appearance today

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.840 position:56%
in participation in an international
conference as Librarian of Congress.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.560
So please join me in welcoming
one of the brightest stars

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.000
in the firmament of the world's
libraries, Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:03.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.650
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well,
good morning, and welcome.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.840
It is truly a pleasure to be
joining all of you this morning

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.320
to celebrate really one of
the most amazing treasures

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.660
of the Library of Congress.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.880
The 1507 World Map by
Martin Waldseemuller,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.590
known as the birth
certificate of America,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.410
is truly one of the
great masterpieces

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.820
of the art of mapmaking.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.610
The only surviving copy of
the map, which names America

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.530
for the first time,
is part of the largest

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.210
and most comprehensive collection
of maps and atlases in the world,

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.870
here at the Library of Congress.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.290
The library has more than 5.9
million cartographic items

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.270
from the 14th century
to the present time.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.770
It covers every country and
subject in formats ranging

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.640
from medieval manuscripts
to digital data.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.860
This morning it is my honor
to launch a great website

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.410
that was a successful collaboration
of the Library of Congress

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.620 position:56%
with the Galileo Museum in Florence.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.500 position:56%
This comprehensive, interactive site
contains more than 11 hours of video

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.980
which charts every aspect of
the life of this important map

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.740
and highlights the
science and the culture

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.270
of the times in which
it was created.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.890
Digitally interactive
projects like these,

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.430
which bring to the web important
treasures from our collection

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.590
and our collective past, are
changing the way scholars,

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.940
educators, students,
and the public interact

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.620 position:56%
with the library's vast collections.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.450
Waldseemuller's maps were created
at a time of great revolutions,

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.570
both scientific and cultural.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.060
I believe it is these revolutions
and how humanist geographers

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.570
and scientists reacted to them
make story told by this website,

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.770
which is relevant for us today.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.030
The world has changed from
one of medieval isolation

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.210
to the more progressive
ideas of the Renaissance

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.230
and our modern world
came into being.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.620
In order to bring this masterpiece
of the early scientific revolution

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.650
to viewers around the world,
the Library of Congress

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.150
and the Galileo Museum have joined
together to create a website

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.840
which fosters not only an
understanding of the past,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.520
but also hopefully helps all of us

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.760
to navigate our technological
and scientific future.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.430
I would like to give
special appreciation

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:50.800
to Professor Umberto Tombari
along with Dr. Paolo --

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.120
and I practiced, I have
to tell you [laughter] --

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:05.830
along with Dr. Paolo Galluzzi and
Dr. Filippo Camerota, Director

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.010
and Vice Director of
the Galileo Museum,

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.770
for their support of this project.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.070
And I would also like to
congratulate everyone else involved

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.650
in its creation, both here at the
Library of Congress' Geographic

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.270
and Map Division and
also the Galileo Museum.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.710
And now it is my honor to welcome
His Excellency Armando Varricchio,

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.510
Ambassador of Italy
to the United States.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:49.310
[ Applause ]

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.940
&gt;&gt; Ambassador Armando Varricchio:
Good morning, everybody.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.350 position:56%
Dear friends, ladies, and gentlemen,
it's always good for me to be back

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.450
at this great, great Library of
Congress, renowned for the worth,

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.580
depth, and breadth
of its collection.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.270
A very warm thank you to the
newly-appointed Librarian

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.410
of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden,
a warm welcome to her new role.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.650
To Dr. Hayden -- who, by the
way, managed to pronounce my name

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.470
in its preferred way; I'm really
puzzled by this [laughter] --

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.890
was responsible for protecting
and disseminating the knowledge

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.190 position:56%
of the largest library in the world.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.480
We offer our full collaboration
on the many inspiring

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.590
and mutually-enriching
projects yet to come.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.260
A warm welcome to Professor
Umberto Tombari,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.410
President of Ente Cassa
di Risparmio di Firenze,

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.430 position:56%
which financially supported the
project; to Professor Paolo Galluzzi

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.260
and Professor Filippo Camerota,
Director and Vice Director

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.100
of the Museo Galileo; to Laura
Campbell, and to Ralph Ehrenberg,

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.450
and John Hessler of the
Library of Congress.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.990 position:56%
A Land Beyond the Stars, what name
could be better for this conference,

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.420
bringing together the
knowledge and excitement

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.090
of the unknown yet to explore?

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.480
This reminds me, by the way,

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.710
back in July I attended
an extraordinary event

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.140
in the JPL NASA Center
in Pasadena, California.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:28.820 position:56%
On that very night, human made
possible to send to Jupiter's orbit,

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:34.040
by the way, an artifact called
Juno with the sentimental also link

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.770
of Juno finally uniting to
Jupiter where Italian scientists

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.940
and physicists were a great part.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:47.070
So this to show that the
great journey goes on.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:51.360
But as you are probably aware,
the Library of Congress together

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.040
with the Museo Galileo di Firenze
has organized this wonderful

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.300
exhibition of the "Universales
Cosmographia" map

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:04.530 position:56%
by Martin Waldseemuller for the
first time in Washington at age 500.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.740
This blended map is
widely recognized

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.970
as being the first [inaudible]
inscription of the name America,

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.950
of the newly-discovered
land just 15 years prior,

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.140
the Land Beyond the Stars,

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.290
discovered on the other
side of the ocean.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:28.600
In Vespucci's own words, "Those new
regions which we found and explored

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.060
with the fleet we may
rightly call a New World,

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:37.040
a continent more densely
peopled and abounding in animals

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:43.190
that either Europe, or Asia,
or Africa, and in addition,

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.580
a climate milder than any
other region known to us."

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.340
Well, at that time climate
had not changed yet.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:57.030
But Italy didn't only have a
role in naming of the New World,

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:02.500
this Carta marina is also referred
to as the new Vespucci map,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.450
as it credits the discovery
of the new continent goes

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.900
to the great Florentine explorer
and cartographer who believed

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:16.380
that the new lands were not part of
Asia, but rather of a fourth part

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.400
of the globe, as he used to say,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.410
and different from previously
identified continents.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:27.400
It is, therefore, only fitting
that the city which he hailed from,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:32.030
Florence, has deciphered
the map in its entirety.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:37.640 position:56%
In fact, Museo Galileo, renowned for
holding one of the best collections

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.800
of scientific instruments
in the world,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.990
has created an impressive digital
tool which makes the map available

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:49.060
to everybody, thus
providing a fascinating look

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.100
into what truly constitutes
an immense encyclopedia

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.030
of knowledge of the time.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:01.180
Not only does it tell us about
Waldseemuller's cartography,

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.450
it also tells us about his life.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:08.710
So our long-lasting and very
productive collaboration

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.480
with the Library has yielded
another winning project

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.250
which not only benefits those
of us who are here today

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:21.270
and who can admire first-hand
these beautiful works,

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.140
but the many who are not able to
join us today and who will be able

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.910
to enjoy this splendid
work online in the future.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.510
Dr. Hayden, thank you very much.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:41.460
[ Applause ]

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.760
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Well,
thank you, Ambassador,

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.410
and thank you Dr. Hayden.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:50.440
A website like this
doesn't come without cost.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.160
It doesn't come without
the need for support.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.090
And also, the purchase of the
map itself, its encasement,

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.020
doesn't come without support.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.670
So we have to thank all
of those external donors

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:07.590
who helped us both develop the
website and purchase the map

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.750
and its preservation here
at the Library of Congress.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.060
And with that, it is
my great pleasure

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.940
to introduce Professor
Umberto Tombari who --

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.960
from Florence, who is
primarily responsible

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.350
for the actually funding
of the website itself.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.510
Professor Tombari.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:39.050
[ Applause ]

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.350
&gt;&gt; Umberto Tombari: So thank you.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.320
Thank you to everyone.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.950
Professor Hayden, Your
Excellency, my dear colleagues,

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:51.820
I am deeply honored to be here with
you today in this hallowed setting,

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.920
the Library of Congress,
that is widely recognized

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.620
to be the largest library in
the world, with many more books,

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:03.990 position:56%
recordings, photographs, newspapers,
and maps gathered in its collection.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.950
[Inaudible] form of [inaudible]
that preserves and provides access

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:12.610 position:56%
to a rich, diverse, and enduring
source of knowledge ready to inform,

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.280
inspire, and engage [inaudible]

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.680
in our intellectual
and curative endeavors.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.670
I cannot help but feel that
there is an especially close bond

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:29.090
between this institution and our
foundation, Florence Foundation,

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.880
which has been supporting and
promoting culture in Florence

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.030 position:56%
and in Tuscany for almost 200 years,

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:42.260
while constantly tailoring the way
it does [inaudible] changing times.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.540
A perfect example of how it
does, that is the presentation

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.720
of this website with
its huge impact.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.710
A website we have funded and
produced with the magnificent team

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:59.600
from the Museo Galileo in
Florence, and in close cooperation

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.650
with the Library of Congress,
which I ought once again to thank

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.250
for its amenability
and its hospitality.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.240
The Waldseemuller map
is a compendium

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.550
of a [inaudible] knowledge
which, then as now,

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:22.500 position:56%
underscores the close tie binding
Florence and America under the aegis

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.740
of a traveler as extraordinary
as Amerigo Vespucci.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:33.130 position:56%
If you're here today to maximize the
potential and deepen our knowledge

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:37.650
of this monument of global
cartography, sharing in the project

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:43.370 position:56%
for the website Professor Galluzzi
will be illustrating to you shortly,

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:47.000
we owe it to the ethos
of conservation

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.540
of which Florence is one of the
world's unquestioned capitals.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.740
That is why we are
intervening in support

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.110
of the Opificio delle pietre dure
di Firenze, Florence's illustrious,

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:07.640
historic, and indeed world-famous
school of restoration that is

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.650 position:56%
in danger of losing valuable skills.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.950
But we need to look ahead.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:19.290
And I firmly believe that it
is our duty to develop new ways

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:25.000
of devising different takes on
the past in a contemporary way.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.850
These are the goals to which
my foundation [inaudible] my

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:33.320
foundation, of course, is
strongly committed today,

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.790
and to this end we have
embarked on a strategic project

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:43.230 position:56%
to launch a service model formulated
to foster a new renaissance capable

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.770
of [inaudible] Florence's splendid
humanistic tradition in a new,

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.450
more modern and more dynamic light.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.160
A new renaissance, I said.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.460
A new renaissance that
should matter to everyone.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:15:00.510 position:56%
In this connection, we are currently
busy identifying a selection

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:05.780
of programs that use the
ecosystem of beauty as their source

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.590
of inspiration for
projects, and schemes designed

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:15.000
to promote cultural innovation and
social development, and boldly open

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.390
to partnership and
to the [inaudible]

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:21.300
of systematic interaction with
those like you and like us,

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.380
while sensitive to such issues.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.530
So what I'm talking about
here is new direction.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:32.820
A concrete example of this is
the cooperation set in motion

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.930
between our Museo Galileo
and the Library of Congress,

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.340
a project that has been given a
generally enthusiastic reception

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.430
by Ambassador Armando
Varricchio, to whom I would

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.850
like to express my
heartfelt gratitude.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.650
Thank you.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:54.250
[ Applause ]

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.050
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: And now it's time
to actually look at the website.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:01.250
The website was, in fact,
launched officially this morning,

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.370
so it is available online.

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.980
But for a preview before
we actually show it live,

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.360
I am going to give you Professor
and Director of the Galileo Museum,

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:17.510
a great Galileo scholar in his
own right, Dr. Paolo Galluzzi.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:23.290
[ Applause ]

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:27.570
&gt;&gt; Paolo Galluzzi: Thank you,
John thank you to the institution

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.940
that is hosting this event and
has offered such a cooperation

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.040
in making possible this dream.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:42.110
There were many reasons why
the Museo Galileo has devoted

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:47.060
so much energy designing and
producing an exhaustive website

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.030
on Waldseemuller "Cosmographia
Universalis."

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:56.520
The first reason is that this
document pays tribute to the city

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.540
in which is home to
the Museo Galileo.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:05.610
I obviously refer to the Florentine
Amerigo Vespucci whom Waldseemuller

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:09.560
credited as being the
first to realize

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.670
that the lands beyond the Atlantic

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:15.830
that he had reached were not
the western coast of India,

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:18.120 position:56%
but a new continent, the fourth part

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:23.270
of the world named
America in Amerigo's honor.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:28.440
The Florence in which Amerigo was
born and raised had no seafront,

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:34.630
nor did it have fleets capable of
crossing the vast ocean expanses,

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:39.270
yet in the 14th and 15th centuries
Florence was a highly-advanced

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:43.210
center for geographic
studies and research.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:47.850
Francesco Petrarca, Giovanni
Boccaccio, Angelo Poliziano,

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:51.960
Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli, who
was not only a great astrologer,

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.270
but also a reference
for Brunelleschi

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.270 position:56%
and inspired Chirstophorus Columbus,

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:01.490 position:56%
all these eminent Tuscans took an
interest in the region of the earth,

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:07.920
their cartographic representation
as well as their inhabitants.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.830
These pursuits were a distinctive
feature of the humanist movement

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.910
of which Florence was
the dynamic hub.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:21.180
The very last years of the 14th
century witnessed the arrival

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.800 position:56%
in Florence of the Greek
manuscript of Ptolemy's "Geography,"

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.950
a text unknown in Medieval Europe.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.910
The event triggered
the revival of interest

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.330
in geography throughout Europe.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:39.030
Ptolemy's text, enhanced
by maps of the known world,

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:43.620 position:56%
was copied in countless manuscripts,
often richly illuminated.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.860
It was translated into
Latin and the vernacular,

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:52.000
and ultimately disseminated
through printed versions.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.570
Is return to the West of this
text has set in motion a process

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.320
that lasted throughout the
entire humanist period,

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.820
a process characterized not only

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.560
by sophisticated philological
interpretations

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.130
and intense curiosity about
distant lands and their peoples,

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.890
but also by the quest for the
most effective solutions to --

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:22.250
for faithfully representing the
known world on vellum or paper.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.650
The second reason that
led us to take

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:29.080
up this challenge concerns
information technology.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:32.660
Waldseemuller's chart offered
a fantastic opportunity

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.120
to demonstrate the
exceptional contribution

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.910
that the intelligent
use of IT can make

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.600
in showcasing the historical
heritage

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.860 position:56%
and defining new publication formats

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:49.720
that fully exploit the
web's unheard potential.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.690
During the last three decades, the
Museo Galileo in Florence has been

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:58.140
in the forefront of this area
of experimentation and research,

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.450
taken advantage of three
fundamental assets,

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:07.320
the world of documentary resources,
including a large research library

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.870
and iconographic archive,

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.340
the presence of highly-qualified
scholars in the history of science

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:17.190 position:56%
and technology, and the availability

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:22.660 position:56%
of an in-house multimedia department
endowed with the human resources,

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.660
skills, and technical
instruments necessary

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:30.040
for digital production
of the highest quality.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:36.420
We have over the years developed
other projects aimed at conceiving

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.840
and testing [inaudible]
digital library models.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:44.820
Let me just mention one among the
many examples which you can explore

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.710
on the Museum Galileo website.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.150
I refer to the recently-published
Galileo Teca,

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:56.140
which perfectly mirrors our quest
for the best solution to organize,

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.730
publish, and share on the
web historical documents.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.790
The Galileo Teca is a corpus
of closely-integrated archives.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:06.350
You see our nine archives --

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.780
Each one of the [inaudible]
is one archive --

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:13.960
offering fast and easy access to
the text, manuscripts, biographical

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.510
and bibliographical
records, chronology, images,

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.960
and all the information needed

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.130
to conduct in-depth research
on Galileo and his work.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.560
Just make browsing
of the nine archives,

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:32.770
a huge amount of information, all
linked transversely and vertically.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.960
And there's a fantastic research
volume available for scholars,

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.310
wherever they're from
via the web connection.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:46.400
The same programmatic vision
inspired the website devoted

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:51.410
to Waldseemuller's map.

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:56.310
We have designed it as a repository
incorporating visual documents,

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:59.970
printed and manuscript sources,
videos illustrating the functioning

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:01.920
of nautical instruments,
and the method

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.630
for producing cartographic
projections,

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:09.740
three-dimensional simulations,
diagrams, interactive timelines,

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:14.170
slideshows providing context,
and all the resources necessary

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.320
for an easier understanding
of the massive amount

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.500
of information contained in this
exceptional cartographic monument,

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.690
information that would
be impossible to decode

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:29.240 position:56%
with traditional publishing methods.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:34.480
The complex IT architecture that we
have built is not an end in itself.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.300 position:56%
It can be reused for other projects.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.690 position:56%
We are planning to apply it to
showcase with similar browsing tools

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:45.200
and facilities another
great cartographic monument

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.970
of the early modern age,
Fra Mauro's world map,

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:54.210
just over half a century
before Waldseemuller's map.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:58.370
Similarly, the Galileo Teca
structure forms the skeleton

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:02.050
on which we are modeling a new
and even more challenging project,

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:05.110
the Leonardo Teca, a
digital environment

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:11.110 position:56%
to facilitate easy online access
and study of Leonardo's manuscripts,

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:15.640
truly a labyrinth if
ever there was one.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.650
Today's event [inaudible] for great
satisfaction for many reasons.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:25.640 position:56%
As the head of an institution that
endeavors to keep up with the times,

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.230
to explore innovative research
paths, and test new methods

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:33.830
for organizing and disseminating
knowledge in the global universe

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:38.880
of the web, I am particularly happy
about the fruitful cooperation

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.260
that we have established with
so prestigious an institution

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.490
as the Library of Congress.

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:48.850
I trust that new opportunities will
soon arise for us to join forces

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:54.450
on other ambitious projects It
is no less a satisfaction for me

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:59.050
to witness the completion of a
project that started with an idea

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:03.860
that flashed through my mind a few
years ago when I was first able

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:09.380
to admire Waldseemuller original
map at the Library of Congress.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:14.400
How could one best explain the
infinite messages contained

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:19.490
in this cartographic monument,
illustrate the theoretical

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:24.500
and practical knowledge that
made its production possible,

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.670
and reconstruct the context
in which the map was made?

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:34.500
It immediately came
up -- occurred --

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:38.390
it immediately occurred to me that
the most effective method would be

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:43.450
to transform the map into a vast
digital repository accessible

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.730
on the web, accompanied
by the technical

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:49.900
and intellectual instruments
that needed to explore the map

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:54.080
and help the public to understand
its historical importance

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.760
and uniqueness.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.190
The proposal to produce an advanced
web-based system for exploring

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:04.270
and contextualizing the map
was greeted with enthusiasm

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:09.100
by our colleagues at the Library,
especially Laura Campbell,

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.480
then Associate Librarian
for Strategic Initiatives

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.470
and the Librarian of
Congress James Billington.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:20.320
The expert and heartfelt
participation of Ralph Ehrenberg,

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.020
and John Hessler, and the entire
Geography and Map Division

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.640
of the Library of Congress
proved essential

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.470
to the preparation of the website.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.630
I thank His Excellency,
the Ambassador of Italy

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:37.120
to the United States, who offered
his generous and decisive support

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.520
for this project and to its
presentation in Washington, DC,

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.480
as well as his expert
staff, among whom I would

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.150
like to mention Professor
Renato Miracco.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:53.940 position:56%
This ambitious enterprise would have
been impossible without the support,

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.900
collaboration, and
unstinting encouragement

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.800
of a time-honored Florentine
institution,

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.140
Ente Cassa di Risparmio di
Firenze, foundation committed

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:08.710
to sponsoring initiatives such
as this which convey the image

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.740
of Florence and Tuscany
across the world.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:16.120
The Florentine foundation has
also promoted the publication

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.600
of an elegant volume
accompanied by a flash drive

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.360
which illustrates the
scope of this project.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.100
I express my appreciation
and gratitude

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:30.730
to the foundation's chairman,
Professor Umberto Tombari.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:34.630
Let me conclude, emphasizing that
the largest share of the merit

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:39.200
of the project goes to its de
facto author, Filippo Camerota,

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.780
Deputy Director of
the Museo Galileo.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.390
Filippo drafted most
of the materials

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:48.910
and coordinated the preparation
of the website, entirely produced

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:54.130
by our multimedia -- museum's
Multimedia Department.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:57.910
He will illustrate for you
the structure and content

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:01.730
of this resource, available as
[inaudible] today in Italian

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:04.720
and English on the website
of the Museo Galileo.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.520
Thank you.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:13.970
[ Applause ]

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:17.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Well, now we will
actually dig into the website a bit,

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:22.150
and it is my great pleasure to
introduce the primary drafter

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:26.280
of a lot of the content as you
will see it, the Associate Director

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.510
of the Galileo Museum,
Dr. Filippo Camerota.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:37.430
[ Applause ]

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:38.730
&gt;&gt; Filippo Camerota: Good morning.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:44.410
I would like to introduce myself
as the filmmaker of this project,

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:46.850
just because this was
the way in which I worked

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:50.650
with the graphic designers.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:53.010 position:56%
As you heard, the website is online.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.680
It's already online since
early in the morning,

00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.480 position:56%
so if you have a tablet here you can
follow me in this brief navigation

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.710
through the new lines
of digital library.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.660
The website, in fact, is a --

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:13.460
we conceive that as a model for a
new concept of the digital library.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:22.360
And it's a tool -- an educational
tools and a research tool addressed

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:28.830
to a large public, possibly to
any kind of user from scholar --

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.540
from students to scholars.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.580
Unfortunately, we cannot
see all the movies

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.780
because it would take too much
time, and we don't have that time.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.910
So but we will see
some very interesting

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:45.620
and representative samples.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:53.400 position:56%
So we -- I think it's the case to --
to directly to the introduction here

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.240
on the upper part of the homepage.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.760
&gt;&gt; The world map designed

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.060
by the German cartographer
Martin Waldseemuller grew

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.480
out of an ambitious project

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.980
to present the latest
geographic knowledge compiled

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:12.480
from recent Spanish and
Portuguese ocean voyages.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:27.090
The map was drawn in
1507, using data gathered

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:31.770
by Amerigo Vespucci
during his expeditions

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:37.870
to the New World from 1497 to 1504.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:42.160
Waldseemuller christened the
new lands America in honor

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.950
of the Florentine navigator
who was the first to recognize

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:51.050
that the coasts he had explored
belonged to a new continent.

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:53.300
By portraying the new world
as a separate continent,

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:58.230
Waldseemuller's map
constituted a huge leap forward

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:03.780
in geographic knowledge, marking
the end of the traditional division

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.370
of the Earth into three parts.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:14.170
The map in the Library of Congress
is the only known surviving copy

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:21.450
of a printing that, according to
the author, totaled 1000 copies.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:26.030
Long thought lost, the map
was rediscovered in 1901

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.500
by the Jesuit historian and
cartographer Joseph Fischer

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.910
in the library of the castle
belonging to the family

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.650
of Prince Johannes Waldburg-Wolfegg
in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:31.950
The map, made up of 12 sheets,

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.010
measures 138 by 238 centimeters,
or 4 1/2 feet by 8 feet.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.170 position:56%
Purchased by the Library of Congress
in 2003, it is now on display

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:37.470
in the Great Hall of the
Thomas Jefferson Building.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:38.770
This website was designed
to allow a wider public

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.250
to appreciate the wealth of
information contained in the map

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.600
and to decipher its
structure and graphic symbols.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.010
The website aims to serve
as an experimental model

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.310
for a new digital library concept.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Filippo Camerota: As you can see,

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:55.890
the 12 plates composing the map
are displayed on the homepage

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:59.750 position:56%
as gateways to 12 exploration teams,

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:03.200
and the general index is
available here from the --

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:09.550 position:56%
through the sitemap where we can see
the 12 chapters which are subdivided

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:15.940
into approximately 200
sections with 41 --

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:20.830
comprising 41 videos
and 25 3-D animations.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:26.360
And the topics are arranged
according to an ideal sequence,

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:30.520
but of course, users can
move freely in the website --

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:35.770
through the website, just choosing
the theme of personal interest.

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:39.520
Let's see, for example, from
here the humanist interest

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.170
in cartography.

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:45.360
&gt;&gt; The mapmakers engaged
in universal cartography

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.920
in the 15th century were
often learned humanists

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.000
who provided subtle interpretations
of highly-diverse sources,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.570 position:56%
ranging from classic Greek and Latin
authors to written and oral accounts

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:01.620
by merchants, travelers,
diplomats, and ship pilots

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.480
as well as graphic source --

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:08.970
&gt;&gt; Filippo Camerota: This is
just a short sample of the kind

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:12.770
of movies you will
find in the website.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:16.140
And from here -- oh, excuse me.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:21.910
From here you can read
the text of the movie,

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.460
which is useful sometimes just

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.480
to learn better some
names or information.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.200
Here, this is the historical
context.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:36.140
So the first chapter is
devoted to the humanist interest

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.260
in cartography and geography.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:43.070
And there are lots -- several
slideshows with introduction

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:47.270
of the two protagonists
of this history,

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.770
Martin Waldseemuller
and Matthias Ringmann.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:53.210
Matthias Ringmann is always
a little bit in the shadow,

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.090
but in fact he was the humanist
behind the cartographer,

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:58.550 position:56%
and he played a very important role.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:03.550
Possibly he was the one who
invented the name America.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:08.120
Here we have a timeline where the
fundamental steps in the production

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:13.080
of the maps of Waldseemuller
are shown since the foundation

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:19.210
of the Gymnasium Vosagense
in 1490, up to the printing

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:23.100
of the Carta Marina in 1516.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:28.600
Let's go to the second chapter,
which is an interactive exploration

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.760
of the map with a terrific
enlargement of the details.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.910
We can see, for example, here
a very interesting detail --

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:39.020
one of the most curious
details of the map.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:43.840
This is the wasp, which is an
important element of the coat

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.430
of arms of the Vespucci family.

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:49.350
In fact, it's depicted next
to the portrait of Vespucci --

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:55.180
Vespucci as a cosmographer of
the New World in front of Ptolemy

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:59.100
as the cosmography of the
old -- the Ancient World.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:07.330 position:56%
From here we can see separately the
12 sheets where we find some details

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:12.380
which are not visible in the
mounted map, like these notes --

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:15.010
handwritten notes by
Johannes Schoner

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:17.320
who was the owner of the map.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.430
Now it's still out
of focus, I think,

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:21.980
but it takes a little bit of time.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:27.520
And there is the possibility from
here to rotate the map in order

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:33.700 position:56%
to read the names, which are written
in a vertical or diagonal line.

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.790
And the, of course, presentation

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:39.700
of the two protagonists
here, the two cosmographers.

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:45.020
And we can see the
coordinates traced on the map.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:52.010
And that's traced by Schoner in
order to design these old maps

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:54.890
from this map of Martin
Waldseemuller.

00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:59.000 position:56%
One of the most interesting elements

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.660
of this exploration
is the visualization

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:08.890
of the 26 original maps by
Ptolemy, which here we can see

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:13.600
through the maps depicted by
Henricus Martellus Germanus

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:19.160
for an edition of the
cosmography, which was probably one

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.920
of the most important
sources for Waldseemuller.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.690
For example, here we can find
a name -- oh, excuse me --

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:30.860
W here with the same
corrupted Latin word --

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.360
I don't know if you can read,
columpnae [assumed spelling]

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.950
with a P instead of
columnae [assumed spelling].

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:40.210
And this is the word used and
written by Waldseemuller, too.

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:44.110
So possibly this was one -- you
know, the main source for him.

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:47.720
And of course, all the
maps are visible here.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:53.410
And we can read all the
cartouches of the map.

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:58.290
There are 159 cartouches.

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:03.390
And we give for them the Latin
transcription and the Italian,

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:06.190
and in this case English,
translation.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:10.200
These islands were discovered by
Columbus, Genoese Admiral acting

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.250
on the orders of the
King of Castile.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:13.780
So it's full of information.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.290
It's actually an encyclopedia
of geographical discovery.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:22.650
And we have a lot of also
[inaudible] kingdoms and provinces,

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:35.910 position:56%
185 names, or 100 names, toponyms,
for the new world which are compared

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:40.580
with the same names
found in the maps --

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.650
[inaudible] maps, which
is useful just

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:51.150
to learn how a name was developed,
and invented, and transcribed

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:52.700
by the several cartographers here.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.950
You can see the mountains with
their name, rivers, and so on.

00:36:55.950 --> 00:37:01.820
So this is a way to read what is
normally unreadable in the map.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:05.230
Chapter three is a
visual translation

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:09.970
of the book printed
joined to the map in 1507,

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:12.030
the "Cosmographiae Introductio."

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:17.050
Here we have the chapters of
the book and the geometric

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:20.620
and cosmographic definitions
given by Waldseemuller,

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:25.250
but they are translated in
images just to allow everybody

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:27.370
to understand what is going there.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:30.870
This is the definition of the
sphere, which is made not just

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:34.150
as a simple surface, but
as a surface made of many,

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:37.090
many points equidistant
from the center.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:40.750 position:56%
But here -- down here you can see --

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.690
you can read the definition
given by Waldseemuller.

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:48.700
Or from here you can
go to the Latin text,

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:52.100
which is in the digital library,
which open exactly on the page

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:56.830
where the definition
of the sphere is given.

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.450
You can read, of course, the
entire book just this way,

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:03.860
which is always very useful
because you have an idea of the --

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.870
you see, there are no images in
these books, just a written text.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:15.190
So I think in this case
the translation of text

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:20.720
in images is quite useful and
also very direct in the --

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:25.230
in translating and giving the
information about cosmography.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:28.480
Not always is it easy to
understand what is equators,

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.760
all the [inaudible], and so on.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:40.870
And the images are given
in three dimensions,

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:44.760
but sometimes you can compare
an autographic projection

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.570
with a prospective projection just

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:50.130
to understand what is a
local horizon, for example.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:54.380
An autographic projection is
just a line tangent to the Earth,

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.360
but you can understand
that actually is a disc,

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:05.090
is a circle which can be visualized
in the middle of -- in -- of the --

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:06.390
of an [inaudible] sphere,
[inaudible] sphere

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:10.410
for us is the most common
instrument which gives information

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:14.130
about the structure of the sky.

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:17.580
Cosmography, of course,
was important,

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.800
cosmography as the
science of sky also

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.070
to understand what is on the Earth.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:29.350
Going from the sky to the
Earth, this is the path

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:32.710
that Waldseemuller is
following in this book.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:36.390
And here you can finally
have the information

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:41.480
about the several places
in the world.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.940
The appendix gives still a visual
representation of the quadrant,

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:52.970
which is drawn in the book,
but it's not actually clear

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:54.270
in the [inaudible].

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:57.380
And here we have the end of the
book, which is the description

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:01.240
of the four voyages
by Amerigo Vespucci,

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.790
which here are visualized
with four images.

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:13.440
These images can be seen as a movie
in section eight, for example,

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:18.180
devoted to the New World where
we have, just to have an example,

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:22.010
the third voyage of Vespucci.

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:24.390
&gt;&gt; Vespucci's third
voyage remains a subject

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:27.510
of historical controversy
to this day.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:31.340
Scholars have voiced serious
doubts that it ever occurred.

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.400
For Ringmann and Waldseemuller,
however,

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.830
who published Vespucci's
letter to Piero Soderini

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:37.970
on his four navigations
in the appendix to the

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:40.970 position:56%
"Cosmographiae Introductio" of 1507.

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:45.860
The voyage did take place, and
it was one of the most important.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:50.380
In his letter, Vespucci writes that
he outfitted a fleet of three ships

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:56.170
and sailed from Lisbon on
May 10th or 13th, 1501.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.560
His third voyage was conducted
at the request of King Manuel

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:04.480 position:56%
of Portugal who was surely motivated
by the news of Amerigo's discovery

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.740
of lands east of the
Tordesillas meridian.

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:13.880
The expedition reportedly
lasted 16 months.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:18.720
&gt;&gt; Filippo Camerota: So go back to
section four which is a collection

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:23.120 position:56%
of maps produce before Waldseemuller
and after Waldseemuller.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:28.850
This is useful just to learn which
kind of sources Waldseemuller had

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:31.910 position:56%
at his disposal in order to build --

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:35.510
design his map and which kind
of [inaudible] we can see.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:38.880
For example here, a map of
Martellus, and of course,

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.940
even here we have a very
interesting enlargement of the map,

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:48.450
and we can still rotate the
map, which is useful when names,

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:52.260
as I said, are written in
-- not in a horizontal line.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.620
And after Waldseemuller
we have a lot of maps

00:41:55.620 --> 00:42:05.360
which reproduce the shape of the
map, but also the name America.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.910
This is Petrus Apianus.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:11.370 position:56%
This was the first map before the
discovering of that of Waldseemuller

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:15.630
who was known as the
one naming America.

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:18.990
But there are many
of them like this,

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:26.780
which is one of the most curious
maps of the Renaissance with a map

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:30.160
of Waldseemuller put
in the face of a fool.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.560
But here, interestingly,
the name America is written

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.080
in the north part of the continent.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.870 position:56%
So it's shifted a little bit upward.

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:43.470
And just because in
this age they understood

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:48.560
that this also was a separate
continent and not a part

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.180
of Asia, as Columbus believed.

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:59.110
Other contemporary maps makes
different kind of projections.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.430
The interesting things
with Waldseemuller is

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:05.390
that he was trying --
and actually he did --

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:11.280
to represent the entire surface
of the world, that is 360 degrees,

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.070
using a projection method that
was not described by Ptolemy,

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:20.570
because Ptolemy represented
only 180 degrees,

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:23.360
so 1/2 of the surface of the Earth.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:28.480
And so several cartographers
in the same age were looking

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.740
for projection methods capable

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:37.320
to representing a flat
surface the entire Earth.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:43.280
This is the case when, for example,
is useful to have these two here

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:50.400
because we had a lot of names
written in different lines.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:55.750
And the globes, of course,
because after the one famous

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.790
of Martin Behaim, we find the --

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:05.100
which was painted on a globe
because the printing was not

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:10.610
yet the technique for
transmitting knowledge.

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:14.510
And with Waldseemuller we found
for the first time the way

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:17.910
to represent a sphere
through the gores this way.

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:21.690
And we have all the
different solutions,

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:28.470
or at least different images
developed by Waldseemuller

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:34.960 position:56%
in the representation of this globe,
coming up to the Hunt-Lenux globe,

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:39.990
which is the first
representing, perhaps --

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:45.220
built in Florence in 1510,
representing America,

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:52.790
or at least the Mundus Novus in the
way Waldseemuller represented it.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:55.300
From section five to section eight,

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.410
we enter a brief history
of cartography.

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:03.140
So the -- we have the Ancient
World with the story of Ptolemy,

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:06.880
before Ptolemy, and the
transmission of geography

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.070
with the "Cosmographiae."

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:13.720
We have the world discovered
and described by Marco Polo,

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:18.460
Niccolo de Conti, and other
travelers in the Middle Ages.

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:24.900
We have the routes to Indes, so the
Turkish blockade of Mediterranean,

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.290
and the project of the Portuguese.

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:30.430
These are all slideshow.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:35.030
The Portuguese to circumnavigate
Africa, and then the New World

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:39.170
where we found an introduction
to Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli.

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:44.080
His letter was fundamental for
the project developed by Columbus.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:47.620
We have the four voyages
by Christophorus Columbus,

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:54.730
the four voyages as I showed them
before of Vespucci, and a slideshow

00:45:54.730 --> 00:46:00.450
on the political division of the
world with the Line of Tordesillas.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:03.520
But I want to stop a
little bit on section nine,

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:08.630
because I think this is the most
interesting, the most innovative

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:15.550
in terms of educational
research activities.

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:20.220
We have here the problem of how
to represent the spherical surface

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.550
of the Earth on the flat surface.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:26.490
So this is cartographic projection.

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:29.720
Ptolemy's projections and the
Waldseemuller projections,

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.700
and other cartographers'
projections are represented here

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:40.080
through 3-D animations, which
gives always the concept related

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:43.770
to the idea of that
principle's projections,

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:47.470
and the drawing method
-- how to draw it.

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:50.880
Ptolemy describes how to draw his
projection in the "Geographia,"

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.310
but reading that text is
quite difficult to follow him.

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:58.310
And these animations, I
think, give a good idea.

00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:03.570
Let's see in this case only the
second projection of Ptolemy,

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:07.810
because this is the base
for Waldseemuller's map.

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:09.860
&gt;&gt; Ptolemy's second
cartographic method attempts

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:13.730
to reproduce an image
of the oikumene that is,

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:15.850
the inhabited world,
more closely resembling

00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:17.690
that of the terrestrial globe,

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:20.000
giving the representation
a spherical appearance

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.360
that is almost totally
lacking in the first method.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.810
While visually pleasing,
this concession adds nothing

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:30.580
as regards the measurability
of geographic coordinates,

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.020
a requirement already
fully satisfied

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:36.010
by the first cartographic method.

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:39.730
To obtain the desired effect,
Ptolemy imagines that he is looking

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:42.650
at the globe from a point
located exactly at the center

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:45.420
of the oikumene, not
only with respect

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:48.740
to the longitudinal amplitude
as in the first method,

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:54.310
but also with respect to
the latitudinal amplitude.

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:58.170
The viewpoint thus shifts from
the zenith of the Rhodes parallel

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:02.340
to that of the parallel passing
through Syene, modern Aswan,

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:05.260
situated precisely on
the Tropic of Cancer

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:09.560
at latitude 23 degrees
and 30 minutes north.

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:16.750
Next Ptolemy imagines a
representational plane tangent

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:20.410
to the point of intersection
between the central meridian

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:22.740
and the Syene parallel,
and he proceeds

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:26.240
to transfer the geographic
coordinates onto it.

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:29.480
As a result, the largest
circle tangent

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.100
to the representational
plane, and the orthogonal

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.010
to the central meridian -- in
other words, the ecliptic circle --

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:39.290
appears as a horizontal
straight line.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:44.350
Such a circle does indeed
lie on a plane passing

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:47.450
through the observer's eye.

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:51.330
For the same optical reasons,
the central meridian will be seen

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:54.830
as a vertical straight line.

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:58.580
Because he needs to ensure
that distances are measurable,

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:02.860 position:56%
Ptolemy marks the equal intervals of
five degrees on the horizontal line

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:05.970
that define the map's
longitudinal amplitude to the right

00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:09.580
and the left of the
central meridian.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:14.870
With the same intervals,
he then marks the latitudes

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:18.550
of the main parallel
circles on the central axis.

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:22.720
These are the equator, the
so-called anti-Meroe parallel,

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.710
and the Thule parallel.

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:29.870
As the equator intersects the
ecliptic circle at 90 degrees

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:33.110
from the central axis, it
will be shown on the plane

00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:39.960
as an arc intersecting the
horizontal line at either end.

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:44.900
The other circles will appear
as arcs concentric to the first.

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.760
Their widths are defined
by the measurement

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:51.020
of the five-degree intervals,
which varies with latitude.

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:54.110
The center of the curvature
of the parallel arcs appears

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:59.070 position:56%
on the central axis after tracing
the chord of the equatorial semi-arc

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:03.710
and the straight line orthogonal
to the center of the chord.

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:05.710
By joining the ends
of the parallel arc

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:08.660
with two curved lines
representing the zero-degree

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.300
and 180-degree meridians,

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:15.790
Ptolemy obtains the space
containing the map of the oikumene.

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:19.570
As in Ptolemy's first method,
the map is designed as a peel,

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:25.660
transferred from the
globe to the flat surface.

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:29.220
Ptolemy's second cartographic
method attempts to --

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:32.780
&gt;&gt; Filippo Camerota: And
now we see how to draw it.

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:39.430
&gt;&gt; To draw the map of the oikumene,
that is the inhabited world,

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:42.360
with the second cartographic
method, Ptolemy begins

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.730
by setting the boundaries
of the area to be drawn.

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:50.190
Tracing a rectangle whose width
is equal to twice its height,

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:54.090
the shorter side is divided into 90
parts corresponding to the degrees

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:57.080
of 1/4 of the Earth's meridian.

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:04.760
Starting from the bottom,

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:08.260
he then plots on the central
axis the points corresponding

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:10.430
to the parallels passing
through anti-Meroe,

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:14.700
the equator/Syene, and Thule.

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:18.560
Next he traces a horizontal
line passing

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.380
through the point corresponding
to Syene.

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.660
The line obtained represents
an image of the oblique circle

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:27.740
of the ecliptic as it
appears to the viewer.

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.500
The ecliptic looks like a straight
line because it lies on a plane

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.900
that is level with
the observer's eye.

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:36.760
The segment connecting the
equatorial point and the end

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:41.600
of the horizontal line is the chord
of the arc that, in this rendering,

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.650
denotes the circle of the equator.

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:49.790 position:56%
The perpendicular drawn from the
center of the chord marks the center

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:55.970
of curvature of the equatorial
arc on the central axis.

00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:58.360 position:56%
Having found the center of this arc,

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.980
Ptolemy then draws the concentric
arcs representing the parallels,

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:09.340
passing through Thule,
Syene, and anti-Meroe.

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:12.860
Taking five units as a measurement
of the interval between meridians

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:18.570
on the equator, Ptolemy divides the
equatorial arc into 36 equal parts.

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:22.070
In other words, 180 units.

00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:24.170
By means of a mathematical
calculation,

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:27.640
or using the more practical
solution of a terrestrial globe,

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.740
he then measures the value of the
same intervals on the Thule, Syene,

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:34.040
and anti-Meroe parallels.

00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:46.110
To draw the meridians, he
constructs a series of arcs passing

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:48.780
through three points
chosen on the Thule, Syene,

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.650
and anti-Meroe parallels.

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:58.100
The outermost meridians
have a radius

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:01.230
of curvature easily
measured with a compass.

00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:11.080 position:56%
By contrast, the innermost meridians
approaching the straight line have a

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:14.560
very large radius, which
the cartographer was obliged

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.860
to measure with a string.

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:30.920
Unlike the parallels,
which are concentric arcs,

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.650
the meridians are arcs
whose curvature increases

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:36.270
from the center outward.

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:38.550
The central meridian, which
lies on the plane level

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:42.420
with the observer's eye,
appears to be a straight line.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:47.620
Ptolemy interrupts his explanation
of the cartographic method

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:51.410
at this point, but the tables
illustrating the 15th-century

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:54.340
manuscripts of the
"Geography" clearly show

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:55.670
that the next step consisted

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:59.430
in drawing the parallels
every five degrees of latitude

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:02.140
or at variable latitudes.

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:06.900 position:56%
This was the method used to fill out
the cartographic grid that served

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:09.460
as a guide for drawing
coastlines, cities,

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:13.970
mountain ranges, rivers, and lakes.

00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:17.330
Colors, inscriptions,
depictions of winds,

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:20.350
and ornamental motifs
completed the pictorial

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:24.960
and cartographic representation
of the map of the oikumene.

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:36.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Filippo Camerota: And now we come
to our map -- Waldseemuller's map.

00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:40.370
&gt;&gt; Ptolemy's map represented only
a portion of the terrestrial glob,

00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:44.420
the oikumene, that is, the
known, inhabited world.

00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:47.760
In contrast, Waldseemuller's
map shows the entire surface

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:53.930
of the Earth except the southern
cap below the 44th parallel.

00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:56.720
The Ptolemaic oikumene
is depicted at the center

00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:00.140
of the map using Ptolemy's
second cartographic method,

00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:02.810
which supplies the
geometric elements needed

00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:05.110
to expand the drawing.

00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:08.720
From a geometric standpoint,

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:11.210
Waldseemuller's map
is indeed an extension

00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:15.050
of Ptolemy's second
cartographic method.

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:18.850 position:56%
Beyond the boundaries of the ancient
world lie the remotest regions

00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:21.210
of Asia described by Marco Polo

00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:26.560
and the new World described
by Amerigo Vespucci.

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:30.080
Ptolemy's world and Vespucci's
world are illustrated separately

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:33.490
in the two small hemispheres
drawn at the top of the sheet,

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:35.950
next to the portraits of
the two cosmographers.

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:45.900
The Ptolemaic hemisphere coincides
with the central part of the map,

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:49.790
whereas Vespucci's hemisphere
is depicted in two halves,

00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:53.060
one on the left, the
other on the right.

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:58.550 position:56%
The top piece illustrates the lands
to the north of the parallel passing

00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:02.500
through Thule, up to
the Arctic pole.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:06.380
The map's overall aspect closely
resembles a solution developed

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:10.900
in the same period
by Leonardo da Vinci.

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:20.580
Unlike Ptolemy's --

00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:23.510
&gt;&gt; Filippo Camerota:
Differently from Ptolemy's method

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:29.350
of drawing a map, which is
described in the geography,

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:32.150
for [inaudible] Waldseemuller
we don't have any information

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:36.250
about the procedure he used.

00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:40.790
So this is just an
interpretation based on the map.

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:43.940
&gt;&gt; -- maps, Waldseemuller's
map showed the entire surface

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.640
of the globe.

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:50.070
To draw it, Waldseemuller
developed a geometric extension

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:53.060
of Ptolemy's second
cartographic method.

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:56.990 position:56%
In doing so, he adopted the approach
proposed a few years earlier

00:56:56.990 --> 00:57:01.090
by Henricus Matellus.

00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:06.740
The geometric expansion was
suggested by Ptolemy's map itself,

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.040
on which the extension

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:11.610
of the meridian arcs indicated
a potential configuration

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:15.310
for the cartographic representation
north and south of the boundaries

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:19.130
of the oikumene, that
is, the inhabited world.

00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:22.570
Having presumably followed this
indication, Waldseemuller marked,

00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:27.190
on the central axis, the latitudes
of the Equator, the North Pole,

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:30.570
the Arctic Polar Circle,
and the last parallel chose

00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:33.770
as the southern boundary, 40
degrees below the equator.

00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:41.780
He then set a center of curvature
90 units from the North Pole,

00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:44.620
slightly beyond the
center chose by Ptolemy,

00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:47.350
and drew the main parallel arcs.

00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:52.650
To plot the variable 10-degree
intervals on the parallels,

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:57.360
he chose the gore shapes used to
build the globe in solid form.

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:04.590
The German cartographer then took
a reduction compass and set it

00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:08.410
to a ratio of one to eight,
which is the size ratio

00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:11.180
of the gores to the map.

00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:14.400
He measured the intervals on the
equator, on the Polar Circle,

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.900
and on the last southern parallel,

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:20.210
plotting them on the
corresponding arcs on the map.

00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.110
Next he drew two intermediate
parallels,

00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:29.400
one passing through the city of
Syene, 23 degrees and 30 minutes

00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:34.470
above the equator, and one situated
at 20 degrees below the equator.

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:36.760
He subdivided these
parallels, like the others,

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:39.470
into 10-degree intervals.

00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:45.890
He could now trace the meridian
arcs above and below the equator,

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:50.960
constructing them as curves
intersecting three points.

00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:01.710
As in Ptolemy's first
cartographic method,

00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:04.600
each arc was split at the equator.

00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:25.690
To build the meridian arcs north
of the Arctic Polar Circle,

00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:31.230
Waldseemuller seems to have chosen
a laborious geometric construction.

00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:34.740
He began by tracing the chord
of the outermost meridian arc,

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:37.920
making it end a short
distance above the North Pole,

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:42.090
so as to obtain a horizontal line.

00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:46.510
On this line he drew an equilateral
triangle positioned in such a way

00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:52.640 position:56%
that its vertex serves as the center
of curvature of the meridian arc.

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.470
He then traced the chord
of the meridian arc closest

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:59.530
to the central axis, and placed
the center of the curvature

00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:03.470
at the intersection between the
line perpendicular to the chord

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.390
and the horizontal line passing

01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:08.210
through the first center
of curvature.

01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:12.540 position:56%
The horizontal line thus became the
location of the centers of curvature

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:16.000
of all the other meridian arcs.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.380
He then drew the chords of all the
meridian arcs, marked the center

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:21.940
of each chord on an arc
passing through the center

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:26.630
of the first two chords, traced
the respective perpendicular lines,

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:28.230
and marked the centers of curvature

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:32.320
of the meridian arcs
on the horizontal line.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.420
The final step in the
geometric construction

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:38.160
of the world map consisted in
drawing the meridian arcs north

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.570
of the Arctic Polar Circle.

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:48.300
On this cartographic grid,
Waldseemuller drew the profiles

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:54.070
of lands, perhaps starting
with Ptolemy's oikumene,

01:00:54.070 --> 01:01:00.990
which the German cartographer
reproduced

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.290
with no geographic updates.

01:01:02.290 --> 01:01:13.250
He then drew the lands of the Far
East, up to the modern-day Japan,

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:20.670
and the southern reaches of Africa,
circumnavigated by the Portuguese.

01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:27.340
Lastly, he drew the coasts of
the New World using information

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:31.900
from Spanish and Portuguese
mapmakers.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:37.970
He completed the drawing by
marking cities, rivers, mountains,

01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:42.440
and winds, and by inserting a
wealth of text information --

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.360
all enclosed in an
exquisite ornamental frame.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.190
The printing process was no less
complex, given the size of the map.

01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:48.490
Waldseemuller divided
the sheet into 12 parts,

01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:50.130
adopting a simple geometric
construction using diagonals

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:51.660
or dividing the two sides of
the image in three and in four.

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:52.960
He cut the entire sheet
into 12 smaller sheets

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.260
and engraved a separate
woodblock for each.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.240
To transfer the image to the block,

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.730
he presumably used
the dusting method,

01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:06.910
perforating the entire
drawing with a punch.

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:10.120
He then placed the sheet on
the woodblock facing down

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:14.150 position:56%
and transferred the drawing by means
of a pad coated with colored powder,

01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:18.850
so as to leave the trace of the
image in reverse on the wood.

01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:22.250 position:56%
Now an engraver set to work,
removing the wood from all the parts

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:26.050
of the drawing that were to
remain white in the final print.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.040
When the carving was complete, the
woodblock was inked and pressed

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.650
against a sheet of printing paper.

01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:43.360
And so the 12 prints were
assembled to form the world map

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:47.460
that gave its name to America.

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:51.200
&gt;&gt; Filippo Camerota: It was
an immense work, no doubt.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.860
And we can see also the globe

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:58.890
because this is the first time
we find a globe drawn this way

01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:00.190
with the gores.

01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:01.550
&gt;&gt; The meridians and parallels

01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:08.110
that by convention define the
geographic coordinates of places

01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:10.880
on the surfaces of the Earth
can be grouped together

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:17.150
into 12 shapes called gores, each
covering 30 degrees in longitude.

01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:22.330
If we imagine that we could peel
the Earth as we would an orange,

01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:25.300
we can lay the gores
flat on a plane surface,

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:29.830 position:56%
forming a map that is discontinuous,
but free of distortions.

01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:33.810
This method made it
possible to draw, print,

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:37.880
and construct a terrestrial
globe by pasting the 12 gores

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.090
onto the solid surface of a sphere.

01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:58.980
To draw the gores that
compose the terrestrial globe,

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:02.180
the mapmaker starts by drawing
the line of the equator,

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:03.480
on which all the degrees

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.300
of longitude are marked
at equal intervals.

01:04:07.330 --> 01:04:12.870
Thirty-six intervals of 10 degrees
each form the entire circumference

01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:15.560
of the Earth.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.270
By convention, each gore is
30 degrees wide and is bounded

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:24.570
by to arcs of a circle with a
radius equal to 270 degrees.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.680
Inside each gore, the mapmaker
draws two other arcs passing

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.760
through the poles of the
intermediate meridians.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.390
By dividing each arc into equal
parts representing intervals

01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:44.610
of 10 degrees, the mapmaker
obtains a series of points that,

01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:51.240 position:56%
once connected horizontally, make it
possible to draw all the parallels.

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.690
By transferring the
geographic coordinates of places

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:55.690
onto this cartographic grid,

01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:59.520
the mapmaker can draw the
Earth's entire surface on a plane,

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.430
which will assume a spherical shape
only after attaching the gores

01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:05.840
to the surface of a globe.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:15.200
&gt;&gt; Filippo Camerota: Here there is
a section which answers, I think,

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.200
to one of the questions
made yesterday

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.780
about the extension of the world.

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:23.000
We have a comparison
between the world of Ptolemy

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.280
and the actual world, actually.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.960
The world of Ptolemy was
smaller than the real one.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:35.840 position:56%
We can see that the world of Ptolemy
actually covered only 120 degrees

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.760
on the surface of the Earth.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:42.250
And we can see the Fra Mauro's
world, which is still based

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:46.870
on the dimensions of the Ptolemy's
world, but it's a little bit bigger

01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:51.880
because there is the -- part of
Asia described by Marco Polo.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:57.350
And Columbus' world, still same
size with the missing part,

01:05:57.350 --> 01:06:02.340
which was that -- the one which
would have made a difference

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:06.130
if he would have known that
there was such a long distance

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:10.790
between Portugal or the
[inaudible] islands and Japan.

01:06:10.790 --> 01:06:17.180 position:56%
Actually this was the distance
estimated by Toscanelli and Colombo,

01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:19.040
and this is the real distance.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.060
And then Vespucci's world,
which is a little bit bigger,

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:28.060
just because includes the new
lands discovered on the ocean --

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:33.660
Atlantic ocean, but you can
see here Japan is very close

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:40.170
to the North American, actually is
on the same place of California.

01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:46.330
And the section 10 is
devoted to the ocean.

01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:50.520
And then here we find the Carta
marina, which we can explore more

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:55.680
or less in the same way we did

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:59.960
with the world map,
enlarging it as we wish.

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:07.140
And the resolution is very big
thanks to the files produced

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:10.040
by the Library of Congress.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:14.010
And even here we have the
concept and the drawing --

01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:17.190 position:56%
the drawing map of the Carta marina.

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:20.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; The sea chart is a transformation
of the spherical surface

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:24.210
of the terrestrial globe onto a
plane surface that we can imagine

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:26.700
as being tangent to the
point of intersection

01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:29.750
between the meridian
and the equator.

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:32.410
The transformation is performed
by transferring the meridians

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:36.660
and parallels onto a cylinder that
surrounds the terrestrial globe

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:39.910
and is then developed
onto a plane surface.

01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:42.560
After the transformation,
the meridians

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.090
and parallels form an
orthogonal grid divided

01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:49.880
into regular intervals
of equal size.

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:57.300
However, while the length of
the meridians remains unchanged

01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.860
with respect to their length
measured on the globe,

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:02.670
the length of the parallels
increases as one moves

01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:05.330
from the equator to the poles.

01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:10.180 position:56%
The advantage of this
cartographic transformation is that,

01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:12.720
while altering the
measurement of longitude,

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:15.790
it preserves the orthogonal
intersections between meridians

01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:19.350
and parallels, as on
the terrestrial globe.

01:08:19.350 --> 01:08:23.020
In consequence, any given
oblique line showing a direction

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:26.670
of the wind rose will always
meet the meridians and parallels

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:31.340
at the same angle, exactly as it
does on the terrestrial globe.

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:35.250
This is clearly an advantage
for plotting navigation routes.

01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:43.830
To prepare the sea chart,
the cartographer begins

01:08:43.830 --> 01:08:48.010
by drawing a rectangle
twice as wide as high.

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:53.220
He then plots the two
central axes and divides them

01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:56.900
into equal intervals,
18 on the vertical axis

01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:59.510
and 36 on the horizontal.

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:04.550
Next, he draws the entire grid
of meridians and parallels.

01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:07.230
Waldseemuller confined his
attention to the section

01:09:07.230 --> 01:09:11.340
of the grid extending
240 degrees in longitude

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:16.670
between latitude 70 degrees
north latitude 50 degrees south.

01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:19.180
The grid is only a
construction diagram

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:22.460
and so does not appear
on the actual map.

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:24.390
Waldseemuller then traced a circle

01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:27.030
with a radius equal
to the vertical --

01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:29.400
&gt;&gt; Filippo Camerota: I stop it
here because the time is gone.

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:33.730
And just to give you some more
information, we have a section

01:09:33.730 --> 01:09:38.620
on the sky, too, so astronomical
instruments for navigations.

01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:41.040
And there are a lot
of slideshows here

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.530
and animations giving
the instructions of how

01:09:44.530 --> 01:09:50.540
to use instruments for navigating.

01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:53.720 position:56%
And then the last chapter is devoted
to the digital library with a list

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.180
of books, books related to
the production of the maps

01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:00.390
of Waldseemuller, of course,
and the maps which are more

01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:05.520
or less the same maps we
have seen in section four.

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:09.730
And I think this is all,
and the website is online,

01:10:09.730 --> 01:10:11.820
so you can continue by yourself.

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:14.510
Thank you for your attention.

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:22.700
[ Applause ]

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:26.120
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: So you can see
there is a lot of content here.

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:29.940
It would take about, I don't
know, 14 hours to actually go

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:34.390
through the entire website if
you were to watch everything.

01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:39.530
Obviously there was a lot of time
and a lot of argument about how

01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:43.740
to look at these things as
the website was developed,

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:47.360
but you can see that it is
now out there for the world.

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:49.790
I would invite Filippo
and Paolo to come up.

01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:56.920
If people have any
questions we can answer them.

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:18.840
&gt;&gt; That is --

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.650
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Thanks.

01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:29.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; When you began the project did
you envision as vast as it ended up?

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:30.550
&gt;&gt; Filippo Camerota: No, no.

01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:31.850
Not at all.

01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:33.150
Not at all.

01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:35.630
It was something that
was developed in time.

01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:41.050
This is why I said before that I
consider myself as a filmmaker.

01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:47.650
This is not my profession, but
in this case this was the change

01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:50.700
in my way to work that it happened.

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:54.960
I started as a scholar just giving
text to the graphic designers,

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.710
and then I realized that in order
to make these kind of things I had

01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:01.810
to be there with the
graphic designers

01:12:01.810 --> 01:12:05.940
and work with them every day.

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:08.490
And fortunately we have
a multimedia laboratory

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.450
in our museum, in our institution.

01:12:10.450 --> 01:12:15.940
And it's easier to work with
people who are accustomed

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:19.120 position:56%
to understand these kinds of topics.

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:25.300
But of course, it was
not visible before.

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.530
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: It hasn't
stopped growing, either.

01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:31.700
There's going to be additions
to it as the page turner

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.270
for the actual [inaudible].

01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:35.760
And now we're talking
about the Carta marina.

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:42.540
And so it's not -- it's an
obsession that will not end.

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:47.220
&gt;&gt; Paolo Galluzzi: And it is
very important also to consider

01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:51.200
that after this first huge
step you should imagine

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.680
that this becomes a
research environment --

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.260
collective research environment
where we would make space

01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:59.670
for interaction from users.

01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:02.320
And eventually also having a site

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.550
where they can publish
their comments,

01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:07.380
being registered before, of course.

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:12.100
And so they can grow this archive
and keeping it updated thanks

01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:13.950
to the users' contribution.

01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:15.540
That will not be all kids.

01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:18.580 position:56%
Will be scholars who will use these,
and will have something to say,

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:24.250
and would be nice to have that
embedded into the website.

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:27.030
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: One additional
thing I think I want to show,

01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:29.180
just since the website
is back up here.

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:31.480
And I think --

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:43.780
-- one of the most
interesting things about --

01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:46.580
oops, that's not the one.

01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:55.360
One of the things that
people always want to know

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.930
about is astronomical instruments,

01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:01.370
and navigation instruments
and how they work.

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:04.810
So for instance, there
are videos in here

01:14:04.810 --> 01:14:07.980
which basically show how all
the different navigational

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:10.280
instruments work.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:16.810
All 3-D animations, and basically a
nocturnal astro lab, the quadrant,

01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:20.850
the nautical astro lab, all
of this stuff is animated.

01:14:20.850 --> 01:14:24.950
And I think it's one of the
most important parts of the --

01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:27.680
outside of the construction of the
Waldseemuller map, I think it's one

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:30.360
of the most important
additions because these --

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.010
this is always a question
many, many people ask.

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:43.100
So I just wanted to show that
because we didn't get to it, so.

01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:47.490
&gt;&gt; How long was this project --

01:14:47.490 --> 01:14:48.790
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: How long?

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:50.090
&gt;&gt; So when did this project start?

01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:51.390
&gt;&gt; Paolo Galluzzi:
[Inaudible] Sorry.

01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:52.690
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Just leave it on.

01:14:52.690 --> 01:14:53.990
&gt;&gt; Paolo Galluzzi: Slightly less
than three years, I would say.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.290
Huh? Do you think so?

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:56.590
Filippo has --

01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:58.890
&gt;&gt; Filippo Camerota: More or less.

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:06.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Actually from this is -- for this
methodology [inaudible] resource

01:15:06.230 --> 01:15:08.200
used [inaudible] the Library
[inaudible] it must be [inaudible]

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:12.000 position:56%
resource could apply any other topic
in the Museum or in the Library.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.300
&gt;&gt; Paolo Galluzzi: Absolutely.

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:15.660
&gt;&gt; Is any intention to do that
otherwise, or the resource?

01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:17.530
&gt;&gt; Paolo Galluzzi: Yeah,
I think this is a way --

01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:18.850
the right way of concept

01:15:18.850 --> 01:15:22.430
that we call general just the
Library is two old friends

01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:25.780
in a very passive and limited way.

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:29.940
And digital library means creating
environment where not only books,

01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:31.500
manuscripts, but images,

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:36.870
stories told by contemporary
graphic computers, documents,

01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:40.400
objects are all linked
together, as have been linked

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:44.150
through the development of
history, but have been separated

01:15:44.150 --> 01:15:48.150
in different institutions for
preservation reasons basically.

01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:52.320 position:56%
Now you have this chance to
forgetting the preservation concerns

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:56.090
and linking again data that are
linked intrinsically like that.

01:15:56.090 --> 01:16:00.100
So this is, as you
suggested, is a model.

01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:04.580
You can add these two as many
chart -- maps as you want.

01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:05.880
But not only maps.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:10.080
I showed before the
Galileo Teca, which is a way

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.330
of creating a research
environment with all the material

01:16:13.330 --> 01:16:16.230
that scholars use when
they study on Galileo.

01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:18.400
We're doing the same
with the Leonardo Teca.

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.820
And I think it is the way
in which the revolution --

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:25.540
huge revolution which just happened
with the digital technology,

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:27.020
and there's nothing --

01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:31.850 position:56%
I mean, Gutenberg Galaxy was nothing
compared what has happened now.

01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:37.070
Has to be exploited, and so this
is the reason why you need models.

01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:43.060
You need to try to find
ways of organizing documents

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:44.780
and knowledge in a different way.

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:47.650
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Yeah,
the last square

01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:52.070
on this is called the digital
library, and in that are all

01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:54.510
of the books and all of
the maps that were used

01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:57.500
in a more traditional forum, so
you can click on one of the books

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.050
and a page turner comes up.

01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:01.810
So all the sort of
traditional sources are

01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:03.200
in that last section, too.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:06.930
So for scholars who want to
actually look through every one

01:17:06.930 --> 01:17:09.750
of these books, every one of the
books that went into this website,

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:12.490
and every one of the
maps is fully digitized

01:17:12.490 --> 01:17:16.060
in high resolution in that backend.

01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:19.660
But it really is a model.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.140
&gt;&gt; John, I see that the -- by the
icon, I believe, on the top right,

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:29.690
that the site is also
available in Italian language.

01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:31.640
Are there any plans to
add any other languages

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:33.960
like Spanish, French, etcetera?

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.910
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Do you
feel like translating?

01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:39.920
&gt;&gt; No. I'm just looking
at the wider population

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.710
that could have a great
interest in this.

01:17:42.710 --> 01:17:44.220
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Yeah.

01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:48.010
&gt;&gt; Paolo Galluzzi: Yeah, it is
certainly important would be

01:17:48.010 --> 01:17:50.120
at least Spanish language.

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:53.800
At the moment our energy
is exhausted for --

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:57.430
and I also the financial
resources are exhausted.

01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:59.480
And we have to find partners.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.850
We are absolutely open.

01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:03.900
In the book that has been published

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:08.040
and that you will have
soon copies available,

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.560
we have provided also
Portuguese and Spanish translation

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:15.320
because we are perfectly aware that
these are two worlds in which --

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.050
through which we have to talk to.

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.460
Laura.

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:27.970
&gt;&gt; I'm sort of interested in
the fact you have used a map

01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:32.000
to have a multidisciplinary
explanation of an awful lot

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.890
of things that have to do with
maps, but it becomes [inaudible].

01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:44.710 position:56%
The technology you have could be
used to achieve a dream that I have,

01:18:44.710 --> 01:18:49.140
which is to see whether we can't
take the Mediterranean Basin,

01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:54.950
take maps, and draw
25-year histograms,

01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:57.710
building up from what happened
from [inaudible] right on up

01:18:57.710 --> 01:19:03.210 position:56%
to what happened in the Second World
War, using the map as the focus

01:19:03.210 --> 01:19:09.610 position:56%
to let people probe more deeply into
any subject of historical interest

01:19:09.610 --> 01:19:10.910
in any part of that Basin.

01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:14.980
It's -- it is our cradle
for most of civilization.

01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:18.980
But the technology that you have,
if it's not continued to be used,

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:20.280
I hope you don't lose it.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:23.810 position:56%
I hope somebody picks it up and sort
of takes it beyond where you have

01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:26.000 position:56%
to do things along the idea of that.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.760
Of course, it takes money, but it's
a wonderful way to just sort of lay

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.940
out a broad range of disciplines.

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:36.600
&gt;&gt; Filippo Camerota: As you know,
technology changes very quickly,

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:43.350
so we have to follow the -- this
path, and then, yeah, all right.

01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:44.650
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: The thing

01:19:44.650 --> 01:19:47.750
about this is what you see
here is what can be achieved

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:54.620
when you place scholars next
to an in-house multimedia,

01:19:54.620 --> 01:20:00.210
really talented, but very small
development team, and you lock the

01:20:00.210 --> 01:20:04.440
in a room, and you
basically bang ideas around,

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.600
and around, and around, and around.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.260
And that's the model here.

01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:09.810
And the Galileo Museum is

01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:14.230
so perfectly suited
to this kind of work.

01:20:14.230 --> 01:20:18.960
It is really a model for how
to do the digital humanities.

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:22.490
There is no question about it.

01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:24.220
When you take a thing like this,

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:27.190
you're not just throwing this
masterpiece of cartography up there

01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:29.900
and saying, "Well, here's a
masterpiece of cartography."

01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:33.540
We're doing very much what
say Joaquim Gaspar called

01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:37.400
for in his talk yesterday, that
you can't just look at this

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.100
as just a map, as some
geographical thing.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:44.470
There is so much culture and
science embedded in this document.

01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:47.940
And it is a way to teach the
history of science through images.

01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:53.260
And it is the modern digital
humanities at its absolute best.

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:57.850
And so that's really what -- well,
at least that's what I think it is.

01:20:57.850 --> 01:20:59.550
I'm, of course, biased, but --

01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:00.850
&gt;&gt; Paolo Galluzzi: Well,

01:21:00.850 --> 01:21:02.650
I think that you touched
upon a very important point

01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:09.560
which is the cohabitation of
developers of informatics programs

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.570
and software, and scholars,

01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:15.000
and people who have idea
what should be communicated.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.160
This is very rare still
in our world.

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:23.700 position:56%
And as I stressed in my -- initially
the remarks is one of the privileges

01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:26.990
of this institution, we are
right at the point in which 1/3

01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:29.280
of our budget goes in IT.

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:32.780
And 1/3 of our personnel
is IT person.

01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:38.390
And this is a challenge that
we -- I mean, taking risk,

01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:40.280
but I think is going to pay.

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.990
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: And those
animations that you saw,

01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:46.020
like the Waldseemuller
drawing animations, that --

01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:48.870
those speculative tools
that you can use

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:53.580
to show people how this map might
have been drawn, we could stand

01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:57.890
up here and give papers
all day about, you know,

01:21:57.890 --> 01:22:02.050 position:56%
with little PowerPoint presentations
about how that was drawn,

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:05.420
but it doesn't show you it
the way it shows you here.

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:09.810
I mean, you get a real sense
of the complexity and the tools

01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:11.910
that were necessary
to make this map.

01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:17.370
I mean, you really walk away -- and
like I said, there is 14 hours --

01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:18.980
I don't know how long it
would take you to look

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:20.280
through this entire thing.

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.280
I haven't -- you know, it's weeks.

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:25.560
There's so much imbedded
information in here.

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:29.670
But any other questions or?

01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:30.970
Laura.

01:22:30.970 --> 01:22:32.270
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:33.570
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: By the way,
Laura Campbell, who is sitting

01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:37.140
in the front row -- or
second row here was really --

01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:38.810
when she was the head of OSI,

01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:41.410
which is the Officers
Strategic Initiatives,

01:22:41.410 --> 01:22:45.310
she was really responsible for
putting the Galileo Museum in touch

01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:46.910 position:56%
with the Geography and Map Division.

01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:50.930
And really she deserves
credit, as she says, for --

01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:52.360
she doesn't want to
take much credit,

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:56.070
but for opening the door, so.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.910
&gt;&gt; [Applause] Thank you very much.

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:03.250
Congratulations.

01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:06.460
You have achieved that
vision from --

01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:09.180
geez, it was every bit
of three years ago.

01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:11.700
If you -- in looking back --

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:16.820
I know once you got into this
development it was a small

01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:21.930
and exceptionally bright
group that you worked with.

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:26.100
Do you have any kind of lessons
about undertaking something

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:29.540
like this for the people here?

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:34.470
&gt;&gt; Paolo Galluzzi: I do not here,
of course, but I'm always stressing

01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:39.050
that the digital humanities
is quite serious stuff,

01:23:39.050 --> 01:23:40.660
and quite challenging.

01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:42.230
It's a place of competition,

01:23:42.230 --> 01:23:45.080
of new competition among
cultural institutions.

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:49.880
And maybe the assets have been
established in number of volumes,

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:54.140
or number of items, or might
be totally overturned once

01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:56.330
that you enter the web where
you may have no [inaudible]

01:23:56.330 --> 01:24:01.640
but might be much more in
impact than huge institution.

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:05.390 position:56%
The passage, as has been said before
by John -- I totally subscribe --

01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:10.650
is that you need to have inside
the institution a group of people

01:24:10.650 --> 01:24:16.950
that dialogue every day with that
producer of content, and adapt,

01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:19.690
try it, make first trial, correct,

01:24:19.690 --> 01:24:22.450
and arrive at the final
good solution.

01:24:22.450 --> 01:24:25.920
This is very uncommon yet, I guess
I don't know the situation here,

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:31.020
of course, but in Europe and in my
country especially, I can think say

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:33.200
that we are the only
cultural institution

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.170
in which we have this situation.

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:36.920 position:56%
I don't think there is a second one.

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:41.360
And I believe that this is
a key passage if you want

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:45.730
to find digital humanities
becoming an engine

01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:49.680
that is producing --
attract interest.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:54.590
We give life to a declining
interest in the humanities

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:57.160
and also a powerful teaching tool.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.680
Powerful.

01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:00.880
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Yeah,
we tested the --

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:03.140
this with the Teachers'
Institute here, and --

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:09.640
this summer in its
not-quite-finished form.

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:12.140
And they do a section
on Waldseemuller

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:14.460
as a primary source teaching tool.

01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:19.000
And they were just -- you know,
this was just an amazing --

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.860
even some of the teachers took it
back, and there's several teachers

01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:26.190
in Missouri and Nebraska
who at the beginning

01:25:26.190 --> 01:25:29.640
of the semester had them
using it on high primary

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.140
and early high school students.

01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:33.930
And it is just working
out phenomenally.

01:25:33.930 --> 01:25:39.070
And so now that it's been
launched it can be used anywhere.

01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:43.300
But I think it's -- that's
where its primary thing will be.

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:47.550
But also, not everyone --
there's a lot of historians

01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:49.910
of cartography in this
room right here.

01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:53.220
I bet you I could take maybe
two or three who would be able

01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:55.360
to tell me how Ptolemy
drew his projection.

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:59.330
You know, maybe Joaquim would
be able to actually do it

01:25:59.330 --> 01:26:03.940
with a compass, but otherwise
it's pretty much not well-known.

01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:07.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Filippo Camerota: I have to say
that this happened actually when one

01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:12.410 position:56%
of the historians of cartography
came to us and saw these animations.

01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:17.670
I don't [inaudible]
he commented, "Yeah,

01:26:17.670 --> 01:26:23.000
finally I understand what
Ptolemy had in mind."

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.200
Not because it's --
yeah, this is the truth,

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:28.670
when you read the text
you imagine something,

01:26:28.670 --> 01:26:31.350
but it's not exactly
what is written there.

01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:37.660
If you see something translated
in images you have a better idea,

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:40.810
of course, if the translation
is made by people

01:26:40.810 --> 01:26:43.870
who are accustomed
to work with images.

01:26:43.870 --> 01:26:45.520
I was trained as an architect.

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:49.330
This is why I could
do this kind of job.

01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:52.630
I think it's not common to do this

01:26:52.630 --> 01:26:57.000
if you don't know geometrical
projections because, of course,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.240
you need that kind of
preparation in order

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:03.870
to explain graphically
something which is only written,

01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:06.510
like in the book of Waldseemuller.

01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:09.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Yeah, in my rare
book school class I have my students

01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:12.050
sit and actually draw
the second projection

01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:13.750
with a string and a compass.

01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:18.030
And you know, it's
just forcing people

01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:20.300
to do geometry and
that sort of thing.

01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:23.710
And this is just -- I think
it's an amazing resource, so.

01:27:23.710 --> 01:27:28.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paolo Galluzzi: As a question
that has been raised about the model

01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:30.660
that we mentioned before,
I think that those

01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:34.750
who yesterday heard Dava
Sobel giving the lecture,

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:38.690
of course one field in which you
might immediately translate the

01:27:38.690 --> 01:27:42.440
structure is celestial
cartography, obviously.

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:47.600
You take the solarios or you
take the famous maps of crowded

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.720
with information with a cipher

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:52.660
for common people, and
you can decode that.

01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:54.870
And usually it's actually
the same structure

01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:57.010
because there are observational
instruments,

01:27:57.010 --> 01:27:59.090
measurement instruments behind.

01:27:59.090 --> 01:28:03.230
So it's very much -- I
insist on that -- a model.

01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:05.290
May be a wrong model.

01:28:05.290 --> 01:28:10.430
May be certainly an improved --
improvable model, but is a model

01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:13.440
that I hope will be used
for many other things.

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:15.170
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: And I guess we
could take one more question.

01:28:15.170 --> 01:28:17.190
Or if Laura, you have
another comment or --

01:28:17.190 --> 01:28:18.490
&gt;&gt; Oh.

01:28:18.490 --> 01:28:19.790
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: --
Stephanie, go ahead.

01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:21.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah, oh, thank you.

01:28:21.090 --> 01:28:24.510
I just want to start by saying I've
been involved in digital humanities

01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:28.380
from when it was called
humanities computing in the 1990s,

01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.840
and so I've seen a lot of projects.

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:33.200
I direct a center -- a digital
humanities center, and I just want

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:38.000
to say how astonishingly excellent
this is, and also to thank you

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.550
for the gift that this is,
being open access to the world

01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:45.090
of learners and scholars.

01:28:45.090 --> 01:28:49.810
And then just to jump to one
little question, I -- in our --

01:28:49.810 --> 01:28:52.470
some of our projects now
we're trying to explore how

01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:57.050
to make transparent the
scholarly process of debate

01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:59.390
and controversy, interpretation.

01:28:59.390 --> 01:29:03.430
I'm wondering if your site does
that, or if you hope to do that,

01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:07.850
to have different scholars weighing
in and debating, or publishing some

01:29:07.850 --> 01:29:11.080
of their interpretations?

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.530
&gt;&gt; Paolo Galluzzi: Well, that's --

01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:18.120 position:56%
next time we will give a look to the
-- better look to the Galileo Teca,

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.530
which I gave you few slides before,

01:29:20.530 --> 01:29:23.700
which is online already,
so you can use it.

01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:29.930
And in that application we have
tried to answer your problem.

01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:34.460
Any user can store in the
system its own comments,

01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:36.960
can even publish a paper inside.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.970
And this means that
around a [inaudible]

01:29:38.970 --> 01:29:43.890
of the application you have
people who have come in and said,

01:29:43.890 --> 01:29:45.190
"I don't think it's right.

01:29:45.190 --> 01:29:49.270
I think that your interpretation
has to -- should be changed."

01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:52.790
And this is growing with the
archive and will be available

01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:57.340
for all the users who come after
you have stored your remarks.

01:29:57.340 --> 01:30:01.650
And this is making a living engine,
these things, because the risk

01:30:01.650 --> 01:30:02.970
of this kind of application,

01:30:02.970 --> 01:30:05.960
this technology becomes
so quickly obsolete.

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.640
Information is growing.

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:09.520
And all the weight of keeping it --

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:13.060
that updated is to make a
community tool of this tool.

01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:16.970
And so we will certainly work
on that aspect in the future,

01:30:16.970 --> 01:30:21.120
even or this Waldseemuller website.

01:30:22.290 --> 01:30:23.590
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Well,
thank you both.

01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:30.510
And move on to our last
talk of the conference.

01:30:30.510 --> 01:30:40.600
[ Applause ]

01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:45.580
Well, I hope you all go home
and perhaps get some sort

01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:50.070
of large takeout and some sort of
large supply of alcoholic beverages

01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:55.280
and play with the website for the
rest of the [laughter] weekend.

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:58.340
Our last talk of the
conference, there's a --

01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:07.270 position:56%
one of the most unappreciated or
unseen divisions here at the Library

01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:10.140
of Congress is the
Conservation Division.

01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:14.370 position:56%
They work pretty much behind the
scenes, but they are really critical

01:31:14.370 --> 01:31:16.980
to every single thing
that we do here.

01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:20.380
It is a small team of
extremely talented,

01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:27.420
extremely dedicated
scientists/artist/curators all

01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:29.630
molded into one place.

01:31:29.630 --> 01:31:31.510
And this afternoon
we're going to hear --

01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:33.800
or this morning we're
going to hear a short talk

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:38.030
by the Chief Conservator at the
Library of Congress, Elmer Eusman,

01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:42.230
about what it really took to encase

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:49.130
and preserve the Waldseemuller
1507 map as it is displayed

01:31:49.130 --> 01:31:51.740
in the galleries upstairs.

01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:56.790 position:56%
When you walk up to that case,
there is a huge amount of technology

01:31:56.790 --> 01:32:00.370
that is sitting behind
that case, that keeps it --

01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:06.130
that map as it is and allows us to
keep it on permanent exhibition.

01:32:06.130 --> 01:32:10.760
Elmer has done conservation
on paper.

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:13.480
He's a paper conservator
by training.

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:17.270
He's worked at museums all over
the world, from the Rijksmuseum,

01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:20.560
to the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, to the National Gallery.

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:24.560 position:56%
He's worked on prints from the
Renaissance, which is his specialty.

01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:28.510
So without further ado,
I give you Elmer Eusman.

01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:41.130
[ Applause ]

01:32:41.130 --> 01:32:43.490
&gt;&gt; Elmer Eusman: Thank you, John,
for that very kind introduction.

01:32:43.490 --> 01:32:47.360
And gosh, thank you for setting me
up, because I'm going to be the guy

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:51.430
with the simple PowerPoint, so
I'm sorry for that [laughter].

01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:53.980
We are Conservation, after all.

01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:57.250
So making the case,
sealing the deal.

01:32:57.250 --> 01:33:00.710 position:56%
Making the case, not only literally
making the case in which we're going

01:33:00.710 --> 01:33:04.150 position:56%
to be displaying and storing the
map, we're also arguing for the fact

01:33:04.150 --> 01:33:06.070
that this is what we need to do.

01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:09.000
Sealing the deal, as in
we're going to seal the map

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.900
in an hermetically-sealed case,
but also as the last station

01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:16.270
in what was sometimes an arduous
process in the Library's ability

01:33:16.270 --> 01:33:18.070
to finally acquire the map.

01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:21.130
So I thought that was
pretty clever [laughter].

01:33:21.130 --> 01:33:25.050
Okay, all right, moving on.

01:33:25.050 --> 01:33:29.470
So as John said, when you visit the
Library's northwest pavilion and go

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:32.140
through the Exploring the
Early Americas exhibit,

01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:34.890
you will find at the very
back end the Carta marina

01:33:34.890 --> 01:33:38.700 position:56%
and the Waldseemuller map
displayed right next to one another.

01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:43.640
And for all intents and purposes,
that is exactly the same setup

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:48.130
for both, same display
case, same low light level.

01:33:48.130 --> 01:33:51.440
The big difference is that
one of them has a big amount

01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.750 position:56%
of technology behind it, and that is

01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:55.550
because in this case the
Waldseemuller map is the real one.

01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:58.320
The Carta marina is a facsimile.

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:01.180
And so as John also said, this
gives me great opportunity

01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:05.870
to talk a little bit about
what transpired and the work

01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:10.570
that went into it to get us there.

01:34:10.570 --> 01:34:12.060
It was three years' work of work.

01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:16.340
So let me first quickly share
with you why we did what we did.

01:34:20.050 --> 01:34:23.180
So I don't have to tell you
the importance of the map.

01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:27.220
I don't think -- or that was
well covered yesterday and today.

01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:31.190
But there were some additional
directions, if you will.

01:34:31.190 --> 01:34:35.470 position:56%
The U.S. Congress provided about 1/2
of the purchase price of the map,

01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:37.050
so they were a big stakeholder.

01:34:37.050 --> 01:34:39.860
The German government was also a
big stakeholder because they needed

01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:43.130
to be willing to provide
export license for the map

01:34:43.130 --> 01:34:45.380
to actually come to
the United States.

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:50.660
And both these institutions
expressed a desire to make the map

01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:52.610
as widely accessible as possible.

01:34:52.610 --> 01:34:57.640
So that's an important concept,
all right, want to share the map.

01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:01.360
That does not make
Conservation always very happy.

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:05.970
So now we're in the classic dilemma
between access and preservation.

01:35:05.970 --> 01:35:11.820
So the main problem with display is
the accumulated damage from light.

01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:16.120 position:56%
So light transfers energy to matter.

01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:20.660
And the higher frequency,
the smaller the wavelength,

01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:24.580
the higher the energy,
more damage is being done.

01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:28.320
Ultraviolet light does more damage
to artifacts than regular light.

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:30.590 position:56%
Think of your newspaper in sunlight.

01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:32.230
That's the idea.

01:35:32.230 --> 01:35:33.530
That's what we want to avoid.

01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:34.830
And that's easy to do.

01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:37.640
We can filter UV light
out fairly comfortably.

01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:39.860
But even regular light
will still do damage.

01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:41.360 position:56%
So we want to take that out as well,

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.750
but then we can't see
anything, so that doesn't work.

01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:47.900
Lucky for us oxygen plays a
critical role in this process.

01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:50.330
It's a photolythic
oxidation process.

01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:54.410
So it stands to reason that if we
take oxygen out of the equation,

01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:57.440
then we have a little bit
more liberty in trying to see

01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:01.000
if we can do something
for a long-term display.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.980
A long-term display
is really anything

01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:05.350 position:56%
that is something beyond six months.

01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:08.220
Most things, traveling
exhibits, we usually try

01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:09.590
to aim for about three months.

01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:11.340
So we are here in our 10th year,

01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:13.990
so we're really talking
long-term display here.

01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:19.020
We do have two strategies
here at the Library,

01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:21.160
and that is we have cooled cases.

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:23.350
For those of you who have already
walked through the Great Hall,

01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:26.160
you will see there are two
Bibles, the Gutenberg Bible

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:27.890
and the Giant Bible of Mainz.

01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:29.190
Those are slightly different cases.

01:36:29.190 --> 01:36:31.110
Those are cooled to about
50 degrees Fahrenheit.

01:36:31.110 --> 01:36:35.210
And the concept there is we
slow down degradation mechanisms

01:36:35.210 --> 01:36:37.750
in general by cooler temperature.

01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:41.330
But we have the ability to do that
because we have multivolume Bibles

01:36:41.330 --> 01:36:44.770
that can be interchanged,
and we can also change pages.

01:36:44.770 --> 01:36:48.810 position:56%
That was not going to be an option
for the map, and so we really wanted

01:36:48.810 --> 01:36:54.590
to pursue this oxygen-free,
hermetically-sealed case.

01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:01.550
So that's great, except we
don't have that technology here.

01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:04.230
Actually, we didn't
have that 10 years ago.

01:37:04.230 --> 01:37:06.990
Lucky for us there was a government
institution not too far away,

01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:13.170
Gettysburg just outside the
District, called National Institute

01:37:13.170 --> 01:37:15.580
for Standards and Technology.

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:18.550
And they had just done the very
thing for the Charters of Freedom

01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:21.570
at the National Archives
and Record Administration.

01:37:21.570 --> 01:37:23.780
Charters of Freedom include
the U.S. Constitution,

01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:25.900
Declaration of Independence.

01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:29.730
And they had just wrapped up
this project to replace the --

01:37:29.730 --> 01:37:32.550
I think they were originally built
in the '50s, these encasements,

01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:34.780
and they made brand-new cases.

01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:37.940
Unfortunately for us, a lot
of these members that worked

01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:40.860
on that project had retired by now,
but we could still snag one or two

01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:44.910
of them, and they were instrumental
in helping us build these cases.

01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:46.790
So we have the map.

01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:49.020
We have stakeholders who
really want this to happen.

01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:53.850
We have Conservation willing to
work on this, and the one thing

01:37:53.850 --> 01:37:56.340
that we're missing is
funding to do this project.

01:37:56.340 --> 01:38:01.590
And that happened in the generous
donation by Ms. Virginia Grey

01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:05.250
and the Grey Family who established
the Waldseemuller Support Fund

01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:08.730
in honor and memory of Martin Grey.

01:38:08.730 --> 01:38:11.440
There were additional sponsors
and additional donations,

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:14.310
but it's safe to say that
without the Grey Family,

01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:19.870 position:56%
this case would not have been built.

01:38:19.870 --> 01:38:26.830 position:56%
All right, so an hermetically-sealed
case has several challenges.

01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:29.230
I'm going to try to
explain this a little bit.

01:38:29.230 --> 01:38:32.060
Hermetically-sealed really
means no air goes in and out.

01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:34.610
And as most of you
know, air will expand

01:38:34.610 --> 01:38:37.470
or gasses will expand
when temperature rises.

01:38:37.470 --> 01:38:40.030
And gases inside the
hermetically-sealed case will be

01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:41.880
affected by barometric pressures.

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:47.850
A low pressure system will allow an
hermetically-sealed case to expand,

01:38:47.850 --> 01:38:51.330
and a high pressure system
will do the exact opposite.

01:38:51.330 --> 01:38:55.530
So both temperature and barometric
pressure are a critical player

01:38:55.530 --> 01:38:56.830
in this.

01:38:56.830 --> 01:39:00.340
If the pressure or the
pressures combined get too much,

01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:01.650
the seal will break.

01:39:01.650 --> 01:39:03.540
And the whole notion
is that the seal needs

01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:05.130
to stay intact to keep
the oxygen out.

01:39:05.130 --> 01:39:08.410
So the case has to be able
to withstand these pressures

01:39:08.410 --> 01:39:12.990
and has enough flexibility
to do that.

01:39:12.990 --> 01:39:14.890
SO that was the first thing.

01:39:14.890 --> 01:39:17.790
It was great that NARA -- or that
NIST and NARA could work together

01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:20.730
on the Charters of Freedom, but
they were nowhere near the size

01:39:20.730 --> 01:39:22.030
of map we're talking about here.

01:39:22.030 --> 01:39:23.810
We're talking about
about 50 square feet.

01:39:23.810 --> 01:39:27.210
We're talking about an
encasement of more than 400 liters.

01:39:27.210 --> 01:39:33.750
And this completely dwarfs anything
they had worked with with NARA.

01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:35.110
Another challenge was the fact

01:39:35.110 --> 01:39:38.320
that we could not use the same
seals that were used in NARA.

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.760
In NARA they used metal
seals -- metal O-ring seals.

01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:44.540
And for those seals to
work, an inordinate amount

01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:45.910
of pressure needs to be applied.

01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:49.660
That pressure will also be put upon
the glass that is right in front

01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:52.280
of the case, and makes
the glass crack.

01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:54.640
That already happened
with the smaller cases.

01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:57.450
With a larger case like this one,
this was simply not an option.

01:39:57.450 --> 01:40:00.230
So this needed to be
thought through.

01:40:00.230 --> 01:40:06.100
Let me see, yeah, I cannot
stress enough that the size

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:08.460
of this case is -- was
going to be enormous.

01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:12.250
So great, we have a metal
box with a piece of glass

01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:13.550
in front of it, and it's sealed.

01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:14.850
So how are we actually going

01:40:14.850 --> 01:40:16.740
to mount a map inside
of that and secure it?

01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:18.480
That was another question.

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:22.900
And then the last item is
how are we actually going

01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:25.000
to monitor the conditions
inside the case?

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.870
So we need to look
at the oxygen levels.

01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:28.170
We need to look at the temperature.

01:40:28.170 --> 01:40:29.570
We need to look at
the relative humidity.

01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:32.580
And again, we need to look at what
we call the differential pressure,

01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:34.890
that is the amount of
pressure inside the case.

01:40:34.890 --> 01:40:39.200
This is going to be a key component
because we don't want the pressures

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:43.530
to go over a certain
threshold, and we lose the seal.

01:40:43.530 --> 01:40:49.380
How do you add all these
components and not add more factors

01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:51.060
that could make for a leaky case?

01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:52.360
Any time you put a sensor

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:55.910
in this case you create
another potential opening

01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:58.950
or a seal that can break.

01:40:58.950 --> 01:41:01.580
So complicated matter.

01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:04.110
A lot to do, but at
the end of the day

01:41:04.110 --> 01:41:07.400
as a project manager we only
have one goal, how do we design,

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:13.210
fabricate, test, and install this
exhibit case with the map inside?

01:41:13.210 --> 01:41:14.920
That's the goal.

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.740
There were additional objectives.

01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:19.250
There were a number of
scientific, conservation,

01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:22.780
but also really purely project
management considerations.

01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:26.610
And I just mentioned the last
one I think is always important

01:41:26.610 --> 01:41:28.600
when you do this sort of
stuff, how do you make sure

01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:30.550
that every team member
not only feels involved,

01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:33.360
but by the time the project is
done not everybody is so stressed

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:35.240
out that they're tearing
their hair out and just want

01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:37.230
to run away as quickly as possible?

01:41:37.230 --> 01:41:40.650
You know, make -- manage your
project carefully basically.

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:45.060
So one of the first steps is

01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:47.500
to determine what are the
requirements for this case?

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:49.580
So we already talked about
a number of these things.

01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:52.540
It needs to be, of
course, structurally sound,

01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:55.690
not for obvious reasons like we
need to be able to transport it.

01:41:55.690 --> 01:41:56.990
Cannot build it here.

01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:58.290
It has to be built elsewhere.

01:41:58.290 --> 01:41:59.610
So it needs to be structurally
sound.

01:41:59.610 --> 01:42:01.630
But it also needs to be
structurally sound that it, again,

01:42:01.630 --> 01:42:03.380
can withstand these pressures.

01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:06.370
If we can -- tiny cracks or
hairline fractures, again,

01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:10.760
we're going to lose the seal, and
that would not be the right thing.

01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:12.840
We need to, at least
as a requirement,

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:18.210
we said keep the oxygen level below
0.1%, and we need to have that --

01:42:18.210 --> 01:42:20.310
we need to keep that
environment for at least 10 years.

01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:21.970 position:56%
This is going to be a big operation,

01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:23.360
and we want to make
sure we don't have

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:26.580
to do it more than every 10 years.

01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:29.310
Needs to withstand
atmospheric pressure changes.

01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:30.900 position:56%
It needs to be as light as possible.

01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:34.100
At the time when we started the
project in the fall of 2004,

01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:37.430
we did not know where this
encasement was going to be located.

01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:40.960
So it could be in any of the
three Capital campus buildings.

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:45.490
Could be in the Jefferson
building, as it turns out.

01:42:45.490 --> 01:42:47.170
And then we are highly constrained

01:42:47.170 --> 01:42:49.570
with how much weight we
can put on the floors.

01:42:49.570 --> 01:42:54.240
So light, we need to be able to
fit it through wherever it's going

01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:59.910 position:56%
to come through, and then we need to
put the map in an upright position.

01:42:59.910 --> 01:43:02.840
And just think about the
size map that we have.

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:05.160
We're going to make a
metal case around this map,

01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:06.530
and we do that in a flat position.

01:43:06.530 --> 01:43:09.040
So how are we going to get it
upright, and keep it that way,

01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:12.060
and have it -- and do
that in a secure way?

01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:22.040
So couple of starting
points, the case we're going

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:24.370
to make is not going
to contain any welding.

01:43:24.370 --> 01:43:27.310
This is not going to make for
a structurally sound case.

01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:30.020
This -- with the pressures
involved that was not the avenue

01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:32.180
that NIST wanted to pursue.

01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:33.480
No bellows.

01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:39.060
So bellows are a method to
account for the pressures

01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:42.980
that this case is going
to be withstanding.

01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:46.330 position:56%
So it's basically a balloon or a
series of balloons that are attached

01:43:46.330 --> 01:43:49.400
to the encasement, and
any time the gas expands,

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:54.520
some of that excess air goes in
the balloon versus the encasement.

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.640
There's some problems
with the bellows systems.

01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:58.810
They're finicky, they're
hard to maintain,

01:43:58.810 --> 01:44:01.660
and they might not always perform
as well as we would like to do.

01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:04.060
So NIST really wanted to
step away from that and say,

01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:06.760
"We're not going to do that.

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:09.790 position:56%
We're going to actually build a
case that's going to have the bottom

01:44:09.790 --> 01:44:12.580
so thin that it will
actually be flexible enough."

01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:16.220
So consider a metal bottom that's
going to be flexible enough.

01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:18.590
And will show you in a
second how that works.

01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:21.880
And then, as I said, the metal
O-rings are not going to work,

01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:26.750
so we're going to use two
O-ring -- Viton O-ring seals.

01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:28.870
And I'll show you how that works.

01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:33.360
Viton is a synthesized rubber used
in the aeronautic industry as well.

01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:36.780
And for our purpose really perfect.

01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:42.860 position:56%
So I'm going to show you a series
of drawings that will give you a bit

01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:48.290
of an indication of, you know,
what the makeup of the case is.

01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:50.890
So at the top -- and I have my
handy-dandy laser pointer here,

01:44:50.890 --> 01:44:52.190
sorry.

01:44:52.190 --> 01:44:55.040
Here we go.

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:58.300
So at the top here you see
the encasement from the side.

01:44:58.300 --> 01:45:01.500
So we have over here
the encasement bottom.

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:04.360
And this is the frame that will
hold the glass that goes on top.

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:06.800
So you see the whole
package from the side.

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:09.130
Here at the bottom I've sort
of blown it up a little --

01:45:09.130 --> 01:45:10.980 position:56%
you know, opened it up a little bit.

01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:15.210
You can see a crosscut of what
I -- the encasement bottom.

01:45:15.210 --> 01:45:17.730
Then right on top of
that is the platform.

01:45:17.730 --> 01:45:20.110
The platform will eventually
hold the map.

01:45:20.110 --> 01:45:24.330
On top of that the glass,
and on top of that the frame.

01:45:24.330 --> 01:45:27.390
Okay, so this is highly schematic.

01:45:27.390 --> 01:45:31.540
I'm going to focus on this
portion of the encasement.

01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:34.440
So keep this shape in mind.

01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:40.410
So as I said, we were
not going to do welding.

01:45:40.410 --> 01:45:44.160
Instead we're going to take a
monolithic block of aluminum alloy,

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:47.660
and we're going to mill it down to
the shape in which we want to --

01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:49.160
the shape that we want to create.

01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:53.130
So this monolithic block of
aluminum alloy was actually donated

01:45:53.130 --> 01:45:54.760
to us by Alcoa.

01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:58.420
And well, you see the size there.

01:45:58.420 --> 01:46:00.400
This -- I'm going to
make a comparison here.

01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:04.310
This is about 256 gallons
of milk, or a mid-size car.

01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:10.000
That is the size of aluminum block
we're talking about here, okay.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.340
And so what we're going to
do, we're going to mill this

01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:17.500
into the shape that we desire.

01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:22.460
And on the right side you can
actually see how the platform was

01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:23.840
milled at NIST.

01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:28.110
So the milling of the bottom
that I showed you earlier --

01:46:28.110 --> 01:46:31.410
and that is the big block --
was actually done a t Bechdon,

01:46:31.410 --> 01:46:35.130
which is -- Bechdon is just
outside Washington, DC as well.

01:46:35.130 --> 01:46:37.170
And they shaped that.

01:46:37.170 --> 01:46:40.870 position:56%
But at least you get a little bit
of a feel of the size of the project

01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:43.310
or the size of the case,
because that is the platform.

01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:45.950
What they're milling in this
platform -- which is a relatively,

01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:47.490
you know, thin sheet
of aluminum alloy --

01:46:47.490 --> 01:46:50.750
and what they're milling there
is little weight-saving pockets.

01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:53.980
So the structure of the
platform stays intact,

01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:58.360
but you scrape away excess weight.

01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:02.810
So some serious excess
weight was scraped away

01:47:02.810 --> 01:47:04.110
by the end of the process.

01:47:04.110 --> 01:47:06.970 position:56%
So I hope you can see that we're
getting to that shape that I pointed

01:47:06.970 --> 01:47:12.240
out earlier -- of the main block
that we talked about earlier.

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:13.540
So that was about, you know,

01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:16.050
more than 90% of the block
has been scraped away.

01:47:16.050 --> 01:47:17.350
I was thinking about
that last night.

01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:19.640 position:56%
I thought, "Gosh, they must really
have a good recycling program there,

01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:22.720
because that's a lot of aluminum."

01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:28.470
And what you see from the side
here are two of the grooves

01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:31.130
where the O-ring seals
will be positioned.

01:47:31.130 --> 01:47:32.800
And I'll talk about that
center channel in a second.

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:37.440
And you can see the channels
here from the top, okay.

01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:39.670
And you can also see how the --

01:47:39.670 --> 01:47:43.370
how a lot of the aluminum was
scraped away here, and you get sort

01:47:43.370 --> 01:47:45.470
of that rib structure on the side.

01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:48.010
So this makes for a
really rigid structure

01:47:48.010 --> 01:47:52.770
without having the
weight needed to do that.

01:47:52.770 --> 01:47:54.710
So then we have to have
a little bit of bulk here

01:47:54.710 --> 01:47:58.510
to keep the structure intact.

01:47:58.510 --> 01:48:01.270
And then here we have
that flexible bottom.

01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:04.600
So if that four-inch aluminum
block has been scraped

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:07.090
down all the way to 1/4 inch.

01:48:07.090 --> 01:48:10.420
And that 1/4 inch -- and
because the encasement is

01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:14.460
so big will actually flex up
to about an inch in the center.

01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:17.970
So that's how much
aluminum can flex.

01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:24.570
So then in this picture what
we're showing is the next step,

01:48:24.570 --> 01:48:27.160
and that is the platform.

01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:32.560
And on the platform we will
have two carefully-selected

01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:38.310
and tested cellulose boards, and on
top of that we will place the map.

01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:42.010
So you can see here the Japanese
paper hinges that we're using

01:48:42.010 --> 01:48:44.110
with wheat starch paste
to mount the map.

01:48:44.110 --> 01:48:48.360
The map is then so hinged to
the board, and the board --

01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.180
see, here's the platform.

01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:53.900
The board is actually
two layers of board.

01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:56.240
The screw goes through the
first one at the bottom one,

01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:58.950
and the top one we
make careful incisions,

01:48:58.950 --> 01:49:03.180
and we lift a little flap off
the board, screw both layers in,

01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:04.710
and then put the flap back.

01:49:04.710 --> 01:49:07.170
So this way none of
the screws will --

01:49:07.170 --> 01:49:10.620
or any metal, for that
matter, will touch the map.

01:49:14.170 --> 01:49:17.600
So then the next step
is to put the seals in.

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:22.610
So these are long, you know, almost
O-ring rubber bands if you will.

01:49:22.610 --> 01:49:28.210
You can see here Richard
DeGore [assumed spelling]

01:49:28.210 --> 01:49:30.480
and AnnLinn Kruger, one
of Conservation staff,

01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:33.960
and DeGore was one of the
main engineers from NIST,

01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:41.150
carefully threading these seals
into the top of the bottom.

01:49:41.150 --> 01:49:42.800
And here they're sort of placed.

01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:47.160
And then the next step is
to actually put the glass

01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:49.660
on top of the whole thing.

01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:51.830
So the glass was held by the frame.

01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:56.360
And then the way NIST figured this
out was to put little Teflon clips

01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:58.740
to -- dozens of them
-- around the perimeter

01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:00.130
of the frame that holds the glass.

01:50:00.130 --> 01:50:02.940
And when the glass goes down
it will rest on the seals.

01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:05.140
And this is why this
hole is right there,

01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:07.070
because that will hold
the Teflon clips.

01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:10.690
This center channel will be used
to actually do leak testing,

01:50:10.690 --> 01:50:11.990
because what we're going to do,

01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:14.230
we're going to push helium
gas into this channel.

01:50:14.230 --> 01:50:17.050
And we have a leak detector,
and whenever helium is detected,

01:50:17.050 --> 01:50:20.770
it will tell us whether the
seal is actually working or not.

01:50:20.770 --> 01:50:23.990
All right, sorry, let
me just quickly go back.

01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:27.090
So I cannot really see this very
well, but I think this is NIST

01:50:27.090 --> 01:50:32.210
and their workshop in which
they did most of the testing.

01:50:32.210 --> 01:50:34.650
And I now also see this picture
-- this is sort of interesting,

01:50:34.650 --> 01:50:39.230
you know, the problems you run
into during this type of project.

01:50:39.230 --> 01:50:41.240
So the glass broke
in two ways on us.

01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:45.210
First of all, it was very kind
of Solutia to donate the glass,

01:50:45.210 --> 01:50:48.600
but it arrived in a nailed-together
A-frame, and by the time it arrived

01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:51.750
at NIST, seven of the nine
sheets had completely fallen

01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:54.450
over in the truck and
were completely useless.

01:50:54.450 --> 01:50:57.400
And the two that were left
had already little nicks

01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:00.170
and so were also useless,
because you cannot have any --

01:51:00.170 --> 01:51:02.100
like the smallest nick
in this glass.

01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:03.990
So we had to ask, "Well,
that's great,

01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:06.390
but could you send us
another couple of these?"

01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:08.870
And they very kindly did.

01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:12.230
And then at NIST we actually also
broke another sheet of glass,

01:51:12.230 --> 01:51:14.160
again because the bolts
that I will talk

01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:15.700
about in a second had
been too tight,

01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:18.990
and so it was a little finicky.

01:51:18.990 --> 01:51:21.800
The glass, by the way, is what
we call hurricane-proof glass.

01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:23.100
It is a laminated sheet.

01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:26.970
So there's two layers of glass
with a laminated layer in between.

01:51:26.970 --> 01:51:30.540
So also able to withstand
quite some pressure.

01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:33.520
So this is then what
the profile looks like.

01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:35.640
So we have the encasement bottom.

01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:38.520
We have the platform with the map.

01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.810
The platform is secured with
what we call a trim bar.

01:51:40.810 --> 01:51:43.850
So that's -- that secures
the platform.

01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:46.040
The glass goes on top
with the frame.

01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:50.700
And you can see that the gas inside
would have to pass these two seals

01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:53.160
in order to, you know,
have any air exchange

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:54.460
with the ambient air outside.

01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:55.760
So these are the two seals

01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:58.020
that really make the
case hermetically sealed.

01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:00.540
So then what do we need to do?

01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:01.840
Well, we need to bolt
it all together.

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:05.520
So there's 92 bolts that go
around the perimeter of the map.

01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:09.620
And then we have to
have two ports for gases

01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:13.080
to be introduced into the system.

01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:15.000
So one for the helium
channel I explained earlier,

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.300
and this is for the main chamber.

01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:18.080
And these main chambers --
I should have drawn this,

01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:21.210
but the main chamber, they are
communicated to one another,

01:52:21.210 --> 01:52:23.510
so there's not two chambers here.

01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:26.130
There's really one.

01:52:27.330 --> 01:52:30.580
So that is not -- in principle
that's sort of the same way

01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:32.590
that we -- that NIST
did this at NARA.

01:52:32.590 --> 01:52:35.180
Our challenge, again, was of
course the pure size of the thing.

01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:37.420
So we knew we needed to
think -- the glass --

01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:41.250
I'm sorry, I should have said
that -- is about 165 pounds.

01:52:41.250 --> 01:52:44.380
So we just simply can't lift that.

01:52:44.380 --> 01:52:46.920
And the frame would have
added another 85 pounds.

01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:52.780
So we needed to find a way to --
how we're going to put the map in,

01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:54.260
how we're going to
put the glass on top,

01:52:54.260 --> 01:52:56.690
and how we're then going
to display the map.

01:52:56.690 --> 01:53:00.070
So this is the part where
the map can be introduced

01:53:00.070 --> 01:53:01.410
to the encasement bottom.

01:53:01.410 --> 01:53:05.330
And then this whole cart, if you
will, can get wheeled underneath,

01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:07.740
and the frame is actually
temporarily held

01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:10.480
on what can be best
described as some table legs.

01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:14.000 position:56%
Okay, so they will be removed later.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.370
The frame also holds the glass.

01:53:16.370 --> 01:53:20.170
So the encasement will be wheeled
underneath with some scissor jacks.

01:53:20.170 --> 01:53:24.090
The encasement will be lifted until
it will actually lift the frame

01:53:24.090 --> 01:53:26.180
with the glass and the table legs.

01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:30.300
Now it can be secured, and
the table legs can be removed.

01:53:33.610 --> 01:53:37.950
And once that is done, then
we can add more scissor jacks

01:53:37.950 --> 01:53:39.600
and get it in the upright position.

01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:41.050
This is highly simplified.

01:53:41.050 --> 01:53:44.150
This actually includes several
scissor jacks and several stages.

01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:46.100
But this is about the way --

01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:49.790
it's a slightly steeper angle
as I could draw it here,

01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:53.320
but we could not go any further
because then we have to really put,

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.630
you know, secure it with the front.

01:53:55.630 --> 01:54:00.550
And that just wasn't what we
wanted to do, so hence the angle,

01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:01.850
which is not great for display,

01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:05.300
but there was really
no other way to do it.

01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:06.600
So there you go.

01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:07.900
So that was the total package.

01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:09.200
That is the total weight.

01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:10.950
This is the best we could do,

01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:17.200
and it's a small compact car
is what it comes down to.

01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:21.070
So that meant we had to get in
the big guns because we, you know,

01:54:21.070 --> 01:54:23.100
clearly don't have an
ability to do that.

01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:25.370
So we had a rigger company come in.

01:54:25.370 --> 01:54:28.860
You can see the two packages
on the flatbed truck.

01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:35.060
One will hold the base that the
display can be turned upright on,

01:54:35.060 --> 01:54:37.860
and the other one will
hold the actual encasement.

01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:40.770
Flatbed truck, big crane, had to go

01:54:40.770 --> 01:54:42.630
in through the Great
Hall, second floor.

01:54:42.630 --> 01:54:46.100
There was no way that we
could get it up steps.

01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:50.210
And so here you see some of the
folks trying to carefully --

01:54:50.210 --> 01:54:53.500
once this crate goes in, very
carefully move it inside.

01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:56.890
And then, of course, we had to
deal with the mosaic floors.

01:54:56.890 --> 01:54:59.630
So we had to create an entire
path to make sure that none

01:54:59.630 --> 01:55:01.160
of the floors were damaged.

01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:04.500
And then once it came into
the northwest pavilion we had

01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:07.460
to actually get a crane,
or create a crane,

01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:10.600
to get the items out
of their crates.

01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:12.730
But everything went beautifully.

01:55:12.730 --> 01:55:14.370
And no hiccups there.

01:55:14.370 --> 01:55:16.320
So that was fantastic.

01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:18.940
So the next step was

01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:21.510
to have Conservation crew
-- and I had a lot of fun.

01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:26.160 position:56%
This took about a day, but it was
really great -- to clean everything.

01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:28.700
Now NIST had done some cleaning,
but we just wanted to really go

01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:31.100
over everything with
a fine-toothed comb.

01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:32.400
We did need a clean room.

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:33.840
That was sort of the
assumption on both sides,

01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:35.140
"Well, we need a clean room."

01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:37.360
We thought we needed a clean
room because of the seals,

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:39.790
and NIST thought we needed
a clean room because, "Well,

01:55:39.790 --> 01:55:41.090
you wanted to do this
in a clean room.

01:55:41.090 --> 01:55:42.390
This is conservation.

01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:43.690
This is your thing."

01:55:43.690 --> 01:55:44.990
And we said, "No, no, no, no.

01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:46.290
We don't need that.

01:55:46.290 --> 01:55:47.590
That's fine."

01:55:47.590 --> 01:55:48.890
And they said, "Well,
we don't need it.

01:55:48.890 --> 01:55:50.190
It's not a metal seal.

01:55:50.190 --> 01:55:51.490
It's a Viton O-ring seal
that's much more forgiving.

01:55:51.490 --> 01:55:52.790
We don't need that."

01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:54.970
So we just -- we could just do it
in the exhibit hall, which is --

01:55:54.970 --> 01:55:57.580 position:56%
which saved us a little bit of work.

01:55:57.580 --> 01:55:59.740
So here you have sort
of a good first image

01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:01.560
of what the encasement looks like.

01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:02.860
This is the base.

01:56:02.860 --> 01:56:04.650
You have the encasement bottom.

01:56:04.650 --> 01:56:10.760
And you have the frame on table
legs with -- that holds the glass.

01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:19.610 position:56%
So while that was done, the
platform had already arrived earlier

01:56:19.610 --> 01:56:22.150
at the library because we
wanted to get the map ready.

01:56:22.150 --> 01:56:25.190
So what I showed you in the earlier
image where we hinged the map

01:56:25.190 --> 01:56:27.200
to the board, to the platform.

01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:30.650
We were well done by the
time the encasement came in.

01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:36.370
So here it's wrapped up, and
Conservation staff is walking it

01:56:36.370 --> 01:56:38.990
through the various tunnels to
come from the Madison building

01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:40.980
where the Conservation
Division is located

01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:43.420
to the Jefferson building
exhibit hall.

01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:44.950
We had done this path several times

01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:47.960
because we really wanted
to make sure it fit.

01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:51.280
And so we, again, did not
run into any surprises

01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:53.560
by the time D-day came around.

01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:56.690
So then on D-day, the map is ready.

01:56:56.690 --> 01:56:59.730
It's on a temporary stand here.

01:56:59.730 --> 01:57:03.700
Here is the encasement, so
the map is going to be placed

01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:05.950
on a platform that's going to
be placed inside the encasement,

01:57:05.950 --> 01:57:10.200
and that's going to be
wheeled underneath the glass.

01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:14.230
So here's the map installed.

01:57:14.230 --> 01:57:16.550
The seals have -- can we see the --

01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:18.770
no, the seals are still
about to be added.

01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:21.100
But here we're screwing
in the trim bars

01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:25.590
to secure the platform
to the casement bottom.

01:57:25.590 --> 01:57:28.270
Okay, so now seals have been
added, and now we're going

01:57:28.270 --> 01:57:31.260
to very carefully wheel the entire
package underneath the glass.

01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:33.470
So we had to do this
a couple of times.

01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:35.680
Clearly this is very heavy.

01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:38.790
You're sort of in a rut
when you start moving it,

01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:40.760
and you have very little
time to adjust it.

01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:43.780
So it took us a couple of times.

01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:45.200
But then it finally worked.

01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:48.530
So then it's a matter
of bolting the 92 bolts.

01:57:48.530 --> 01:57:52.510
And here you see a final picture.

01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:54.910
Think this is A.P. It was
a bit of a media circus.

01:57:54.910 --> 01:57:56.210
There was a lot of press there,

01:57:56.210 --> 01:57:57.510
so that made the whole thing
a little bit challenging.

01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:59.210
But the good thing was
everybody knew what to do.

01:57:59.210 --> 01:58:01.020
So it went actually -- the
whole thing was done with --

01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:04.140 position:56%
in the morning, and in the afternoon
we could already start the purging

01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:06.290
process and getting the
oxygen out of the case,

01:58:06.290 --> 01:58:09.400
and started introducing argon.

01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:11.850
Just one thing about the
bolts, the bolts are tricky

01:58:11.850 --> 01:58:16.110 position:56%
because along the long sides we need
more pressure than on the corners.

01:58:16.110 --> 01:58:19.350
This is what they figured out
when they broke the glass at NIST.

01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:23.030 position:56%
And in order for that not to happen,
they have these little gauges

01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:25.130
that are very precise
distance gauges.

01:58:25.130 --> 01:58:28.280
And so they know exactly
how much pressure to put on.

01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:35.480 position:56%
And that way the seal is perfect and
has not cracked a glass as of yet.

01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:38.030
So as per schematic
drawing, I showed you how

01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:39.500
that is being turned upright.

01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:42.090
And now we can start
the process of purging.

01:58:42.090 --> 01:58:44.840
So we're going to introduce
humidified argon gas.

01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:47.480
We cannot just pure -- we cannot
just put pure argon gas in there.

01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:49.020
That would be too dry.

01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:52.940
So we have a little system
that takes the argon gas

01:58:52.940 --> 01:58:55.570
through two flow meters,
and will bubble --

01:58:55.570 --> 01:58:57.230
one of them will bubble
through water,

01:58:57.230 --> 01:58:59.850
and then we have a
measurement device

01:58:59.850 --> 01:59:04.620
that will get the relative
humidity to about 40%.

01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:10.130 position:56%
And so that 40% humidified argon gas
will be flushed through the system.

01:59:10.130 --> 01:59:14.340
And it will come out at
this end of the manifold.

01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:15.970
So this is called the manifold.

01:59:15.970 --> 01:59:20.710
This was first thought of by
the former Preservation Research

01:59:20.710 --> 01:59:24.040
and Science Division
Chief here at the Library.

01:59:25.090 --> 01:59:29.720
And what this enables us
to do is to have all kinds

01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:32.180
of measurement devices and
monitoring devices connected

01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:36.360
to the manifold and not to the case
itself, because anytime we want

01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:39.320
to put a measuring device
through the encasement itself,

01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:41.140
it will create another hole,

01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:44.160
and another possibility
for losing the seal.

01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:49.790
So what are the measuring devices
that we then put on the manifold?

01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:54.910
So we have two oxygen
measurements -- monitors.

01:59:54.910 --> 01:59:56.380
We have humidity.

01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:57.770
We also have a barometric pressure.

01:59:57.770 --> 01:59:59.470
It's not connected to
the case, but we do want

01:59:59.470 --> 02:00:01.860
to know what the barometric
pressure is going to be.

02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:06.880
And then we have the
differential pressure monitors.

02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:08.670
So we -- these are
backups of one another,

02:00:08.670 --> 02:00:11.140
but these actually have two
distinctive different functions.

02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:14.160
So we have a measuring
device that takes --

02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:16.570 position:56%
that measures the oxygen level going
from ambient, which is a little

02:00:16.570 --> 02:00:18.560
over 20%, to about three.

02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:21.490
And then the next one will
take it a step further

02:00:21.490 --> 02:00:26.260
and takes it all the
way from 3% to 0.1%.

02:00:26.260 --> 02:00:30.510
And the pressure sensors
are finicky.

02:00:30.510 --> 02:00:34.630 position:56%
It's very easy to get pressure
sensors when you have a flow of air.

02:00:34.630 --> 02:00:36.590
It's much harder when
it's stationary.

02:00:36.590 --> 02:00:39.020
And that is something that
subsequent generations

02:00:39.020 --> 02:00:42.720
of these encasements have
been struggling with.

02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:46.240
And that is something
that the current Chief

02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:50.980
in Preservation Research and
Testing is very busy with.

02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:54.540
So why is it important
that we do these things?

02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:59.850
Okay, so relative humidity
won't change.

02:00:59.850 --> 02:01:02.740
Temperature won't change too
much because we're very --

02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:05.480
we're pretty well able
to keep the exhibit area

02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:07.160
at a very steady temperature.

02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:09.030
So that part is good.

02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:10.630
But we can't do anything
about the weather.

02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:12.060
We wish we could.

02:01:12.060 --> 02:01:15.050
So barometric pressure will change.

02:01:15.050 --> 02:01:17.680
And so that is in this graph --
sorry, there's a couple of graphs,

02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:20.130
and then that's all
and I'll be done.

02:01:20.130 --> 02:01:22.640
So there is barometric
pressure lined up here,

02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:24.400
and temperature is lined up here.

02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:29.490
So the -- okay, that's not
really vacuum engineer.

02:01:29.490 --> 02:01:31.220
The engineer that really helped us,

02:01:31.220 --> 02:01:33.130
Dr. Charles Tilford [assumed
spelling] with establishing

02:01:33.130 --> 02:01:36.870
and monitoring this
environment, made this graph.

02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:40.270
And it shows you the
safe zone, if you will.

02:01:40.270 --> 02:01:43.170
Now if the temperature is pretty
much going to be constant,

02:01:43.170 --> 02:01:46.590
then we really want to have --
you want to follow this line,

02:01:46.590 --> 02:01:51.130
if you will, to make sure that the
encasement interior stays safe.

02:01:51.130 --> 02:01:54.910
As soon as temperature rises
we're going to get this area.

02:01:54.910 --> 02:01:57.480
And as soon as it drops
we're going to get there.

02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:02.930 position:56%
Or conversely, if barometric
changes will get us into a red area,

02:02:02.930 --> 02:02:07.560
either too low or too
high, the same will happen.

02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:10.410
So we're keeping close eye
on barometric pressure.

02:02:10.410 --> 02:02:15.070 position:56%
So this is March 2008, the
installation of the map was complete

02:02:15.070 --> 02:02:17.370
in 2007, December of 2007.

02:02:17.370 --> 02:02:18.670 position:56%
So this is a couple of months later.

02:02:18.670 --> 02:02:21.520
And it gives you an idea of the
range of barometric pressures

02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:24.080
that this case experiences
on a daily basis.

02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:29.520
But since then, like I said,
the temperature is constant,

02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:31.550
it's really only the
barometric pressure that's going

02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:32.850
to have an influence

02:02:32.850 --> 02:02:34.770
on the differential
pressure inside the case.

02:02:34.770 --> 02:02:36.420
And in fact, directly so.

02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:39.100
So when one goes up,
the other one goes down.

02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:42.950
So if I have a low barometric
pressure system coming through,

02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:44.820
my case will balloon.

02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:49.300
And conversely with a high
pressure system, it will contract.

02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:52.620
So that looks really
bad, but the nice thing

02:02:52.620 --> 02:02:54.580
about graphs is it's
all about scale, right.

02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:56.660
So now it doesn't look so bad.

02:02:56.660 --> 02:03:00.350
And we are well within the
threshold that NIST established

02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:05.700
of 25 millibars that is considered
to be the safe zone for --

02:03:05.700 --> 02:03:08.910
to make sure that we keep the seal.

02:03:08.910 --> 02:03:13.980
So there are, however, some
doomsday scenarios where we could,

02:03:13.980 --> 02:03:16.290
you know, go beyond that.

02:03:16.290 --> 02:03:17.590
So that would not be good.

02:03:17.590 --> 02:03:20.260
So one of them would be
if a beautiful winter day,

02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:23.000 position:56%
high pressure system coming through,

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.670
and for some odd reason
our heating drops out.

02:03:25.670 --> 02:03:29.820 position:56%
So temperature drops, gas contracts,

02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:33.270
high pressure from
atmospheric pressure coming in.

02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:37.360
That could, you know,
crack the glass.

02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:38.890
This is not so likely to happen.

02:03:38.890 --> 02:03:41.580
This could possibly happen,
we have -- I won't say --

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:45.210
we haven't gotten close,
but we've kept an eye on it.

02:03:45.210 --> 02:03:49.620
A low pressure system like
Hurricane Sandy lands in Maryland

02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:52.520
versus New York, coming through.

02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:55.490 position:56%
All the terrible things that happen
during those occasions might happen.

02:03:55.490 --> 02:03:57.980
We might lose power, so
our cooling drops out.

02:03:57.980 --> 02:03:59.890
So our case temperature might rise.

02:03:59.890 --> 02:04:02.900
We have a low pressure
system coming through.

02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:04.200
You know, we might lose the seal.

02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:05.990
So it happens, so don't imagine

02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:07.770
that the glass will
shatter, anything like that.

02:04:07.770 --> 02:04:11.710
But what could happen is that we
get a little crack in the glass.

02:04:11.710 --> 02:04:15.750
It is the pressure that will
cause that, and we lose the seal.

02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:18.310
So that's not the end of the
world, but it's a bit of pain

02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:22.840
to start the whole process over
again to replace the glass.

02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:25.830
So we have a system where
we get emails when we are --

02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:32.310
when circumstances are threatening
to get us close to that happening.

02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:36.140
And once we do that, or once
we see that it's a little --

02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:37.810
it's getting a little
too close for comfort,

02:04:37.810 --> 02:04:42.290
we just open up the main valve,
and we'll introduce ambient air

02:04:42.290 --> 02:04:47.500
into the system, let the
case sort of settle down.

02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:50.090
Unfortunately we no longer
have an argon environment,

02:04:50.090 --> 02:04:53.300
but we can reflush the case and
start the process over again,

02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:55.810
and it will save us from
having to replace the glass.

02:04:55.810 --> 02:04:58.710
Now just in case, we do have
a piece of spare glass sitting

02:04:58.710 --> 02:05:01.020
in our warehouse, so
we could do that.

02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:04.980
But we'd really like to avoid that.

02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:07.330
So here we are, it's all set.

02:05:07.330 --> 02:05:09.120
All the monitoring devices
are sitting on the back.

02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:11.400
You can't see them, but
trust me, they are there.

02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:15.570
And here is John overseeing
everything.

02:05:15.570 --> 02:05:18.930
And so this is where
we are right now.

02:05:18.930 --> 02:05:23.930
So like I said, successfully
completed in December 2007.

02:05:23.930 --> 02:05:25.550
The seal performs much better

02:05:25.550 --> 02:05:29.120
than we had possibly
imagined, which is great news.

02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:31.300
And we [inaudible] it's
going to be 10 years sealed,

02:05:31.300 --> 02:05:34.590
and definitely going to be 20 years
sealed -- or yeah, 20 years sealed.

02:05:34.590 --> 02:05:36.090
And maybe by that time
we actually have

02:05:36.090 --> 02:05:38.240
to replace the O-ring --
the Viton O-ring seals.

02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:43.560
Not -- it's not anything to do
with its inability to keep it.

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:47.900
And another objective that I'm
very happy about is the fact

02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:53.590
that we have now obtained in-house
ability to monitor conditions

02:05:53.590 --> 02:05:59.370 position:56%
and various situations if necessary,
and reflush the case if necessary.

02:05:59.370 --> 02:06:02.380
I don't -- I'm not saying that
we could build a case like this,

02:06:02.380 --> 02:06:06.270
but we can certainly maintain
this one, which is great.

02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:09.570
Big project, lots of
people involved.

02:06:09.570 --> 02:06:10.870
I'm just one of them.

02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:15.110
And these are all the
folks that had a --

02:06:15.110 --> 02:06:19.730
all of them a critical part
in this and made this happen.

02:06:19.730 --> 02:06:21.530
That's really it.

02:06:21.530 --> 02:06:32.350
[ Applause ]

02:06:32.350 --> 02:06:36.010
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: So Elmer will
take a seat, and pick up a mic,

02:06:36.010 --> 02:06:37.640
and do any questions if you'd like.

02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:39.130
If there are any questions.

02:06:39.130 --> 02:06:40.430
&gt;&gt; Elmer Eusman: Can
I stand up here?

02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:41.730
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Yeah, yeah.

02:06:41.730 --> 02:06:43.030
Tom?

02:06:43.030 --> 02:06:46.820
&gt;&gt; Question for you, going
back to your very first slide,

02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:54.000
there was a question there about
access to the original document.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.190
I'm thinking back to -- I have been
around here for a number of years,

02:06:58.190 --> 02:07:00.560
and the Washington Map
Society, and I had a chance

02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:03.030
to see the map before
it was encased.

02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:06.610
I know that John Hessler and Chet
Van Duzer have done a tremendous

02:07:06.610 --> 02:07:10.540
amount of research on that
map, the original map.

02:07:10.540 --> 02:07:13.540
Books have been published,
and all of this has happened.

02:07:13.540 --> 02:07:16.130
In the years since this
map has been encased,

02:07:16.130 --> 02:07:20.030
Chet has gone on further using
multispectral imagery and all kinds

02:07:20.030 --> 02:07:23.790
of other things with the
Martellus map and other documents.

02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:28.930
What provision is there as the
technologies get better and better

02:07:28.930 --> 02:07:32.410
to understand maps and research
maps, what provision is there

02:07:32.410 --> 02:07:37.360
to take the map out of the
case at a certain point in time

02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:43.250
to do additional research, and then
perhaps remounting it in the case?

02:07:43.250 --> 02:07:49.210
&gt;&gt; Elmer Eusman: Well, I'm glad
I'm not making that decision,

02:07:49.210 --> 02:07:52.920
but I would say that
we could do that.

02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:54.220
Well, first, couple of things.

02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:57.230
Hyperspectral imaging has been
done of the map before it went in.

02:07:57.230 --> 02:07:59.180
And that's all thanks
to Dr. Fenella France

02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:00.980 position:56%
who made sure that that was in play.

02:08:00.980 --> 02:08:06.670
So we have high-resolution images
in -- at different bandwidths.

02:08:06.670 --> 02:08:07.970
Could we take the map out?

02:08:07.970 --> 02:08:09.640
Yes, absolutely we can.

02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:12.680
And in fact, NIST made sure
that we had a way to do that.

02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:13.980
It will be wheeled out.

02:08:13.980 --> 02:08:15.580
It will be flattened.

02:08:15.580 --> 02:08:19.030 position:56%
We'll get the table legs out that
are still there, and we can do that.

02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:21.640
But it's a big production.

02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:27.520
And it will probably take
some direction from people

02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:30.330
that are not me to say, "You
know, it's really time for us

02:08:30.330 --> 02:08:34.550 position:56%
to have another look at it, and it's
important for us to pursue this."

02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:36.560
We can certainly facilitate that.

02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:38.070
But it is a bit of a production.

02:08:38.070 --> 02:08:42.750
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Yeah, and
Tom, I think when we put it

02:08:42.750 --> 02:08:47.570
in we can't really
foresee any research reason

02:08:47.570 --> 02:08:49.620
that we'd ever have
to look at it again.

02:08:49.620 --> 02:08:51.970
If we do look at it again,
when it comes out it's going

02:08:51.970 --> 02:08:55.970
to certainly be another round
of hyperspectral imaging

02:08:55.970 --> 02:08:57.470
from a conservation perspective

02:08:57.470 --> 02:09:00.020
to see whether there's any
changes or anything like that.

02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:02.640
But I think when we
put it in, we really,

02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:06.380 position:56%
after doing hyperspectral imaging on
it, couldn't foresee any real reason

02:09:06.380 --> 02:09:09.100
that we'd ever have to take it out.

02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:13.290
We even have things like
fiber samples that were saved,

02:09:13.290 --> 02:09:17.100
ink samples that were saved in
case there was future testing

02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:20.260
that might need to be done
on it, from that perspective.

02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:23.320
But I think it's in there
for another decade, so.

02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:25.930
&gt;&gt; Elmer Eusman: Yeah, I also
want to say on a personal level,

02:09:25.930 --> 02:09:28.760
as fun as this project
was, I am not --

02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:31.030
you know, I am not a big
proponent of this at all.

02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:34.240
I think if it was up to me, I would
take the map out, put it away,

02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:36.280
and put another facsimile up.

02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:40.030 position:56%
So this is not a conservation-driven
project,

02:09:40.030 --> 02:09:42.620
but it is certainly a
conservation-guided project.

02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:48.060
And the driver here was the desire
to have this on long-term display

02:09:48.060 --> 02:09:51.670 position:56%
to increase access not just for
scholars, but really for the public.

02:09:51.670 --> 02:09:54.470
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:55.770
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Ben?

02:09:55.770 --> 02:10:01.860
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] get the valves
in place damage anything.

02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:07.130
So [inaudible] there are ways
of dealing with that in terms

02:10:07.130 --> 02:10:09.730
of controlling the
wavelength, etcetera.

02:10:09.730 --> 02:10:12.540
But looking sort of
to the distant future,

02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:16.680
what's another hypothetical model
where you could eliminate the map

02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:18.490
with really minimal damage?

02:10:18.490 --> 02:10:21.390 position:56%
I mean, light wavelengths are always
going to be light wavelengths,

02:10:21.390 --> 02:10:23.620
but is there any sort
of hypothesis about --

02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:27.590
or conjectural model about a
different way of illuminating?

02:10:27.590 --> 02:10:29.490
&gt;&gt; Elmer Eusman: No, it's
a fundamental principle

02:10:29.490 --> 02:10:31.640 position:56%
that light carries energy, you know.

02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:33.980
And it doesn't matter whether
you illuminate something

02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.660
under light level, or there's
a low light levels or high.

02:10:36.660 --> 02:10:38.330
It's accumulated effect.

02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:43.210 position:56%
It just builds up, and keeps going,
and the process will just take a lot

02:10:43.210 --> 02:10:46.250
of -- it will proceed a lot
faster under certain circumstances

02:10:46.250 --> 02:10:48.020
and higher-energy wavelengths.

02:10:48.020 --> 02:10:51.110
But the principle remains
the same, yeah.

02:10:51.110 --> 02:10:52.610
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: When you
think about the reason

02:10:52.610 --> 02:10:55.430
that the map survived, in fact,
it was because it was bound

02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:57.210
into a book, and closed,
and put away,

02:10:57.210 --> 02:10:58.920
and never saw the light
of day again.

02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:02.430
So we have it that way.

02:11:02.430 --> 02:11:05.370
You know, a curator when they
hear the word permanent display,

02:11:05.370 --> 02:11:08.170
you just -- or a conservator,
you nearly want to,

02:11:08.170 --> 02:11:10.030
you know like, "No possible way.

02:11:10.030 --> 02:11:12.660
We don't ever want to do that."

02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:15.180
And we also don't want to
have the fact that, you know,

02:11:15.180 --> 02:11:19.750
it's lasted for 350 years, and us
in 50 years, you know, destroy it.

02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:23.490
So this was one of those
very bizarre projects.

02:11:23.490 --> 02:11:28.310
And it really was driven by
the agreement of purchase,

02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:32.620
which in fact required
permanent display.

02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:35.800
So it was a big issue.

02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:39.290
&gt;&gt; Elmer Eusman: Yeah, John is
absolutely right, putting something

02:11:39.290 --> 02:11:42.570
in an album and having direct
contact with the pages,

02:11:42.570 --> 02:11:45.680 position:56%
and putting something in is
fantastic for conservation purposes.

02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:48.650
It's just, you know, it's
not accessible that way.

02:11:48.650 --> 02:11:50.290
As John said, it wasn't
actually Renaissance prints,

02:11:50.290 --> 02:11:54.410 position:56%
but Renaissance drawings in a
collection at Rotterdam I worked on.

02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:57.730
There were 200 of Fra Bartolomeo
drawings, and they were exquisite.

02:11:57.730 --> 02:11:59.550
And they had never been touched.

02:11:59.550 --> 02:12:02.870
And the main reason is oxygen
cannot really get to it.

02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:05.410
Air pollution cannot
really get to it.

02:12:05.410 --> 02:12:07.180
And they were in fantastic shape.

02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:08.570 position:56%
But because they weren't accessible,

02:12:08.570 --> 02:12:10.090
and because they were
chalk drawings,

02:12:10.090 --> 02:12:14.290
and every time somebody does
go through them, pages flex,

02:12:14.290 --> 02:12:17.740
and chalk will fall off, we
decided -- well, not we --

02:12:17.740 --> 02:12:20.520
it was decided that
put them in mats.

02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:22.530
But ultimately I think if
they would have been kept

02:12:22.530 --> 02:12:28.830
in the album pages they would have
done great for hundreds of years.

02:12:28.830 --> 02:12:31.130
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Dava?

02:12:34.090 --> 02:12:39.850
&gt;&gt; So you talked about a
10-year limit, maybe 20 years.

02:12:39.850 --> 02:12:41.690
As a -- it's a two-part question.

02:12:41.690 --> 02:12:43.410
As a conservator, would you

02:12:43.410 --> 02:12:47.900
like to see the map put
away somewhere for safety?

02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:53.720
And might the new website
allow that?

02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:58.590
Might that be considered
access to the map

02:12:58.590 --> 02:13:01.360
that would satisfy the
purchase agreement?

02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:06.110
&gt;&gt; Elmer Eusman: So the answer
to the first question is yes.

02:13:06.110 --> 02:13:07.980
But I need to be that
advocate, right?

02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:09.280
And it's not my decision.

02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:11.330
It is just for me to
say all things --

02:13:11.330 --> 02:13:14.820
where I'm coming from is I'm
not concerned with access.

02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:20.000
I'm concerned with preserving
this for generations to come.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.620
But ultimately it's not my
decision, and then well,

02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:25.370
the only thing I can do is to say,
"Well, okay, if that's what we want

02:13:25.370 --> 02:13:29.190
to do, if the need to make this
accessible trumps my desire

02:13:29.190 --> 02:13:31.310
to conserve this map
for future generations,

02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:33.160
then let me at least guide
this project and do this

02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:35.760
in the most responsible
way possible."

02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:37.490
Whether this website
will answer some

02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:40.390
of this need, I really don't know.

02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:43.680
It's a big -- there's a
continuing discussion about, "Well,

02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:45.450
why don't we just put
out facsimiles of things,

02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:50.220
because the light levels can go up,
people don't know the difference.

02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:51.980
Why just don't you do that?"

02:13:51.980 --> 02:13:57.090
That's ethically probably
uncomfortable.

02:13:57.090 --> 02:14:00.540
And so we still do what we do.

02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:04.250
I don't know if that
answers your question.

02:14:04.250 --> 02:14:06.160
It's a process.

02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:08.140
It's multiple people who
are in the mix discussing

02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:09.640
and then weighing various options

02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:11.650
to see what will be
the best thing to do.

02:14:11.650 --> 02:14:14.400
Now that it's in the case
I'm very comfortable with it,

02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:17.760
very comfortable with it for there
-- it to be another 10 years.

02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:20.010
And then I don't know
whether we will renew it,

02:14:20.010 --> 02:14:23.280
or whether we by that time
have decided, you know, it's --

02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:27.480
"We've done what we set out to do,
and I think it can go back now."

02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:28.950
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: One of
the unfortunate things

02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:31.060
that this case has
done, and the documents

02:14:31.060 --> 02:14:35.750 position:56%
at NARA have done is they've created
a monster -- at least I think so --

02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:39.020
because everyone who donates
an expensive map says, "Oh,

02:14:39.020 --> 02:14:40.910
I want to put it on
permanent display."

02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:46.230 position:56%
And so you're -- you know, you --
"We know you can build these cases."

02:14:46.230 --> 02:14:50.910 position:56%
And so again, as Elmer said, this --

02:14:50.910 --> 02:14:55.990
these decisions are made way
above our -- we can advocate.

02:14:55.990 --> 02:15:00.100
We can say we don't want to, we're
not comfortable, we don't think,

02:15:00.100 --> 02:15:02.910
but in the end if the money
is raised and they say,

02:15:02.910 --> 02:15:06.820
"We're going to do
it," we have to do it

02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:09.470 position:56%
in the best and safest way possible.

02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:13.870
So I am also -- I would
take it out tomorrow.

02:15:13.870 --> 02:15:18.020 position:56%
If it was up to me, the map would be
removed from display and placed back

02:15:18.020 --> 02:15:22.400 position:56%
in the book, and the book would then
be displayed every now and again.

02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:25.220
So -- and we could have the
website and a facsimile.

02:15:25.220 --> 02:15:29.120
But again, above our paygrade.

02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:37.640
&gt;&gt; Could you just tell us a
little bit about the material

02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:40.170
on which the map was printed?

02:15:40.170 --> 02:15:41.550
The paper?

02:15:41.550 --> 02:15:43.380
What has your analysis shown?

02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:45.540
&gt;&gt; Elmer Eusman: I cannot really.

02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:48.320
I mean, it is -- it's very
stable 15th-century paper.

02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:51.910
We have certainly looked
at the watermarks.

02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:53.530
I am not the expert on this.

02:15:53.530 --> 02:15:55.630
I don't know whether
Sylvia or Heather is here,

02:15:55.630 --> 02:15:57.160
or whether they're willing
to say anything about that.

02:15:57.160 --> 02:15:58.530
Or I could put you in touch,

02:15:58.530 --> 02:16:00.530
but that's not knowledge
I have on top of my head.

02:16:00.530 --> 02:16:02.360
&gt;&gt; Why don't you just
come up, since you're --

02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:03.660
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: No, no, no.

02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:04.960
You're standing there.

02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:06.570
Come on, may as well.

02:16:06.570 --> 02:16:08.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Elmer Eusman: Or maybe afterward.

02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:09.830
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Or maybe you
just want to talk afterward?

02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:14.400
&gt;&gt; Elmer Eusman: Yeah,
that sounds good.

02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:17.010
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Any
other questions?

02:16:17.010 --> 02:16:20.340
&gt;&gt; I'll just --

02:16:20.340 --> 02:16:21.640
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Oh.

02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:22.940
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

02:16:22.940 --> 02:16:24.240
Thank you very much.

02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:25.540
I'm Sylvia Albro.

02:16:25.540 --> 02:16:27.880
I'm a paper conservator
working under Elmer.

02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:32.440
And when the Waldseemuller map came
in, I know that Heather Wanser,

02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:34.610
another senior paper conservator,

02:16:34.610 --> 02:16:38.370
did do beta radiographs
of all of the pages.

02:16:38.370 --> 02:16:40.380
So we have a record
of the watermark,

02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:46.150
and we know other maps printed

02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:48.340
by Waldseemuller are
on that same paper.

02:16:48.340 --> 02:16:54.190
It's a very, very high-quality
paper, high calcium content.

02:16:54.190 --> 02:16:59.380
There's a bit of an uncertainty of
whether it comes from the region

02:16:59.380 --> 02:17:01.570
of Alsace or Northern Italy.

02:17:01.570 --> 02:17:04.000
It's a crowned watermark
that's been used

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.220
in other Strasberg-based
publications,

02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:10.110
so information is out there.

02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:13.220
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Yeah, the
watermarks are rather strange.

02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:15.590
It's a pair of crowned watermarks.

02:17:15.590 --> 02:17:19.130
The mark -- watermarks that
are found on the 1507 map --

02:17:19.130 --> 02:17:21.220
not all the sheets have watermarks,

02:17:21.220 --> 02:17:24.980
but the ones that are watermarked
are these pairs of crowns --

02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:28.080
that watermark also
appears on the Carta marina.

02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:32.610
That watermark also appears in
the 1513 Ptolemy by Waldseemuller.

02:17:32.610 --> 02:17:38.100
So the three major Waldseemuller
extent publications have

02:17:38.100 --> 02:17:39.810
that watermark.

02:17:39.810 --> 02:17:45.810
Sylvia and her team, who had
a Ptolemaic atlas study team

02:17:45.810 --> 02:17:48.450
in the conservation collection --

02:17:48.450 --> 02:17:52.500
Conservation Division recently
discovered a rather strange thing

02:17:52.500 --> 02:17:56.440
that scholars are going to be
puzzling over for a long time,

02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:00.140
that that watermark also appears
in the "Nuremburg Chronicles."

02:18:00.140 --> 02:18:07.610
The connection between those
two is unknown and peculiar.

02:18:07.610 --> 02:18:10.610
So that's kind of where
we are on the watermarks.

02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:14.620
And anyone else?

02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:19.390
One more? Well, I want to
thank you all for coming,

02:18:19.390 --> 02:18:22.510
and I want to thank Elmer for --

02:18:22.510 --> 02:18:25.130
[ Applause ]

02:18:25.130 --> 02:18:33.230 position:56%
And I also want to invite you all at
between 1:00 and 3:00 this afternoon

02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:34.880
in the Geography and Map Division,

02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:37.630
which is in the basement
of the Madison building.

02:18:37.630 --> 02:18:39.930
We will be having an open house.

02:18:39.930 --> 02:18:44.870
At that open house, the original
Sammelband will be on display,

02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:49.140
so if you want to see the
original book the 1507 map was in,

02:18:49.140 --> 02:18:51.110
which still contains
the Carta marina,

02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:54.860
which still contains the
[inaudible], you can see it there.

02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:58.850
We will also have many
Ptolemaic atlases out,

02:18:58.850 --> 02:19:01.720
and also there's a little
bit of a strange thing

02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:04.500
on the Carta marina
which -- sheet six.

02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:08.610
There are actually two sheet
sixes of the Carta marina.

02:19:08.610 --> 02:19:11.900
One is printed, one is a manuscript
drawn in the hand of Schoner.

02:19:11.900 --> 02:19:14.050
That will also be on display.

02:19:14.050 --> 02:19:16.920 position:56%
So we invite you down to the
Geography and Map Division from 1:00

02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:20.800
to 3:00, and I want to
thank you all for coming.

02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:23.380
I hope to see you there [applause].

02:19:24.770 --> 02:19:28.420
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
