so you can observe bacteria exchanging

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940
so you can observe bacteria exchanging
 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.840
so you can observe bacteria exchanging
DNA through these little these little

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
DNA through these little these little
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.280

pipes these pili and they exchange DNA

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
pipes these pili and they exchange DNA
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.459
pipes these pili and they exchange DNA
and they carry on and you can imagine

and they carry on and you can imagine
 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.740
and they carry on and you can imagine
one of them exchanging big pieces of DNA

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
one of them exchanging big pieces of DNA

slowly and another one exchanging small
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.709

organisms are able to come up with a new

readily are not able to hijack as easily
 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.309
readily are not able to hijack as easily
so this is such an important thing and

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319
so this is such an important thing and
 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.890
so this is such an important thing and
such a valuable innovation

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
such a valuable innovation
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.319
such a valuable innovation
that well you just think of all the love

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329
that well you just think of all the love

minutes but just look at dandelions and
 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.380
minutes but just look at dandelions and
the lilies of the field I might add I

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390
the lilies of the field I might add I
 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.910
the lilies of the field I might add I
mentioned this in the book I think the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920
mentioned this in the book I think the
 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.589
mentioned this in the book I think the
guys who wrote the Bible just kind of

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599
guys who wrote the Bible just kind of
 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.710
guys who wrote the Bible just kind of
missed that lilies in the field go to a

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720
missed that lilies in the field go to a
 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.190
missed that lilies in the field go to a
lot of trouble to make flowers it's a

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200
lot of trouble to make flowers it's a
 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.670
lot of trouble to make flowers it's a
lot of work and they don't spend it on

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680
lot of work and they don't spend it on
 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.020
lot of work and they don't spend it on
toil actually they're working pretty

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030
toil actually they're working pretty
 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.839
toil actually they're working pretty
hard and they do that to get a new mix

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849
hard and they do that to get a new mix
 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.699
hard and they do that to get a new mix
of genes because plants have viruses and

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709

parasites as much as the next organism

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659
parasites as much as the next organism
 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.020
parasites as much as the next organism
so it's really quite an insight and the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
so it's really quite an insight and the
 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.539
so it's really quite an insight and the
guy who coined this theory is is

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549
guy who coined this theory is is
 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.670
guy who coined this theory is is
fabulous the theory of the red queen and

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680
fabulous the theory of the red queen and
 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.580
fabulous the theory of the red queen and
so Alice Alice in Wonderland is now in

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590
so Alice Alice in Wonderland is now in
 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.470
so Alice Alice in Wonderland is now in

Queen is some sort of chess piece person

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299
Queen is some sort of chess piece person
 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.289
Queen is some sort of chess piece person
and she's able to slide or she does

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299
and she's able to slide or she does
 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.449
and she's able to slide or she does
slide around on the chess board of life

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459
slide around on the chess board of life
 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.789
slide around on the chess board of life
somehow and when you're talking with it

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799
somehow and when you're talking with it
 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.339
somehow and when you're talking with it
you have to run so Alice says to the Red

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349
you have to run so Alice says to the Red
 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.009
you have to run so Alice says to the Red
Queen if you know where I come from if

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019
Queen if you know where I come from if
 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.470
Queen if you know where I come from if
you run all day you end up somewhere

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480
you run all day you end up somewhere
 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.830
you run all day you end up somewhere
else and the Red Queen says what seems

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840
else and the Red Queen says what seems
 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.240
else and the Red Queen says what seems
like a very slow but with a British

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250
like a very slow but with a British
 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.699
like a very slow but with a British
accent I presume seems like a very slow

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709
accent I presume seems like a very slow
 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.670
accent I presume seems like a very slow
sort of country and that's what

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680
sort of country and that's what
 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.229
sort of country and that's what
evolution is like if you're not running

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239
evolution is like if you're not running
 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.050
evolution is like if you're not running
all the time you fall off the treadmill

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060
all the time you fall off the treadmill
 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.879
all the time you fall off the treadmill
of life and your genes disappear so it's

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889
of life and your genes disappear so it's
 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.189
of life and your genes disappear so it's
quite an it's just a cool expression the

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199
quite an it's just a cool expression the
 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.140
quite an it's just a cool expression the
theory of the Red Queen and it's an

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150
theory of the Red Queen and it's an
 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.439
theory of the Red Queen and it's an
aspect of evolution that Darwin

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449
aspect of evolution that Darwin
 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.259
aspect of evolution that Darwin
speculated about but it wasn't really

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269
speculated about but it wasn't really
 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.640
speculated about but it wasn't really
figured out until a century later it's

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650
figured out until a century later it's
 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.010
figured out until a century later it's
really something

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020
really something
 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.080
really something
