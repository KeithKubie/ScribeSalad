00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.380
With the ability to sequence ancient DNA,
we now know that some modern humans got busy

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.700
with each other, Neanderthals, and at least
two other ancient human groups.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.130
Which begs the question: who wouldn’t our
ancestors get freaky with?

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.769
Hey guys!

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.849
Anatomically Modern Human Natalia here for
DNews!

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.529
When our ancestors left Africa and trekked
into Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, they

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.149
crossed paths with other ancient human groups
like Neanderthals, Denisovans and at least

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.619
one other group.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.460
Apparently, humans weren’t so picky about
their sexual partners, so they admixed - “science”

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.910
for got down with - these other archaic humans.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.910
How do we know?

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.270
It’s all in the genes!

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.530
Scientists have been able to find the DNA
of these other archaic humans in living populations

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.530
today.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.350
This love story has four characters.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.090
First -- Neandertals.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.460
These hearty hominins lived in Europe, the
Middle East and Western Asia roughly 400,000

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.530
to 40,000 years ago.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.250
Because they had lived in the harsh cold of
Eurasia far before modern humans left Africa

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.780
their biology was adapted to that climate.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.090
They had thicker and lighter skin, which helped
with vitamin D absorption, a bigger nose designed

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.479
to warm cold air, and a stockier build to
retain heat.

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.049
Tres sexy, no?

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.449
Second character in this love story?

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:23.380
-- well in 2008, a new archaic human lineage
was discovered in the Denisova Cave in Siberia.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.389
Scientists found a finger bone with viable
DNA and were able sequence the genome.

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:32.240
It turns out it belonged to a young adult
female who lived roughly 40,000 years ago

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.289
and these new archaic humans were dubbed the
Denisovans!

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.079
Researchers have been able to find traces
of Denisovan DNA in populations as far as

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.810
Southeast Asia stretching to Australia.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.740
This indicates that Denisovans and their descendents
may have had a greater geographic area than

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.409
previously thought.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.630
Now, I know there's a third "mystery" guest,
but we'll come back to them.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.270
So, in 2003 we sequenced the human genome,
in 2010 we sequenced the Neanderthal and the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.209
Denisovan genome about the same time.

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:07.509
Now that we've done all that, we can compare
all this DNA.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.360
And the results were shockingly sexy.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.720
Scientists found Neanderthal DNA, Denisovan
DNA, and that mystery group’s DNA in current

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.080
living populations!

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.080
This is how we know that many people of Eurasian
descent have a small percentage of Neanderthal

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.010
DNA in their genome like our very own Trace.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.400
Natalia, do these “genes” make me look
Neanderthal?

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.620
Hm, give or take Trace percent.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.190
Alriiiight

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.590
But what were the potential benefits of admixing
with Neanderthals and Denisovans -- besides

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.340
producing Trace, of course?

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.590
When humans mated with these other ancient
groups scientists argue that they picked up

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.550
genes that improved their immune system and
helped them adapt to a new environment.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.000
Researchers found that those of European and
Asian ancestry had a higher abundance of human

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.730
leukocyte antigen genes, or HLAs.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.830
HLA is a protein that helps regulate our immune
system.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.540
This is an example of hybrid vigor, or the
tendency of a crossbred individual to show

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.140
qualities superior to those of both parents.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.950
And remember that fourth mystery group we've
danced around?

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.730
Well, scientists have found a 3rd population
of archaic humans that we got *ahem* friendly

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.650
with as we migrated into Asia and down into
Australasia.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.680
This 'Unknown DNA' has been found in populations
of South Asians, Southeast Asians, and Australasians

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.000
- including the population of the Andaman
Islands.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.930
Roughly 2-3% of of this unknown DNA has been
found in individuals in the region.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.810
Researchers think that this new possible ancestor
could help explain the shorter stature of

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.210
people in those areas!

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.410
These new data also support that there was
only one main wave of migration out of Africa

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.940
into Asia rather than two waves as is also
hypothesized!

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.510
DNA is truly fascinating-- not only is it
the building blocks of an organism, it can

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.040
tell the story of a species’ journey through
time and space.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.540
And who they boned.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.190
Admixing with Neanderthals may have been good
for our health, but research shows they were

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.100
far smarter and artistic than previously given
credit for.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.100
Check it out!

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.100
What about you?

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.520
Would you get down with a Neanderthal?

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.520
A Denisovan?

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.110
An unknown human ancestor?

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.110
C’mon...be honest.
