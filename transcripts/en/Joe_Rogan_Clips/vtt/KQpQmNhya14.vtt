WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.240
But you've, have you been mobbed before? You have no. Yeah.

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.070
What's been the worst? Oh, one of the big ones was a about a trans fighter.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.430
I remember that. Yeah. That was a hilarious one. Cause I'm like,

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.060
you guys can kiss my fucking ass. You're out of your mind.

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.530
You guys are out of your mind.

6
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:21.270
If you think that a man who has been a man for 30 years and has taken female

7
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:25.260
hormones for two is the same. You put Brock Lesnar,

8
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.300
chop his Dick off and put him in a dress,

9
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:30.150
that guy's gonna Maul through the women's heavyweight division.

10
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:31.860
Like nothing you've ever seen in your life.

11
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.500
Cause we're built different and it's just a fact.

12
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.950
And then they want to tries to argue that is crazy. And there are,

13
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.230
there's certainly standouts in terms of women who are, uh,

14
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.930
like much more muscular, higher bone density,

15
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:49.260
particularly African American women have very high bone density. Um,

16
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.110
but there's a different shape to their hips. There's a,

17
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:56.010
there's the size of the hands, the size of the shoulders.

18
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.420
Th things are different.

19
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.760
Also the imprinting of years and years of testosterone. It's just,

20
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.360
there was a great article by this, uh,

21
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.890
board certified endocrinologist who went over all of the,

22
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.890
all the things that separate men from women,

23
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.130
which shouldn't exclude them from competing in combat sports against women.

24
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.660
And this woman was called a trans phobe and she's a fucking endocrinologist.

25
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.990
And she's talking about the science and she's also talking about the science of,

26
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.610
one of the things they talk about is how women, you know, or a trans woman,

27
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:33.990
once they transitioned to being a woman,

28
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.650
they're basically biologically almost exactly the same as woman. She was like,

29
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:39.540
no, not only that,

30
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:43.950
but the bone density is retained by taking estrogen,

31
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.990
which is what the problem with women, when they have osteoporosis, they lose,

32
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.930
they're losing estrogen, they lose bone mass. Well,

33
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.510
the estrogen actually helps you retain bone mass.

34
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:58.560
So when a man transitions to a woman and then starts taking estrogen,

35
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.830
it's actually helping retain the bone mass that you would have lost by not

36
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:05.040
having testosterone. And then on top of that reaction times,

37
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.570
the Rita reaction times are several tenths of a second faster in general for

38
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:12.420
women than they are for eat or for men rather than they are for even

39
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:14.640
professional athlete women. So all of these,

40
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.720
all these variables that need to be taken into consideration when you're

41
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.250
allowing someone to do a sport. And we're not just talking about bike racing,

42
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.810
we're not talking about, you know, something where someone non-contact,

43
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.740
we're talking about the most contact, we're talking about fucking fighting.

44
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.020
There's, there's benefits that certain people have. There's,

45
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.580
there's physical attributes that P there's variables inside the genders, right?

46
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.650
There's some men that have gigantic physical advantages over other men and all

47
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.660
of those are taking into [inaudible].

48
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.980
There's no like even playing field when it comes to even enter gender

49
00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:59.040
competition or, or you know, male versus male competition.

50
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.680
No real level playing field. So the best we can do is say, okay,

51
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.830
well you guys gotta be the same weight, let's just make that,

52
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.830
make it the same weight. And that's as close as you can get. But,

53
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.340
but even in that, there's people that are just physically, they're just,

54
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.830
they're just going to be better. There's no, there's no getting around it.

55
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.820
There's going to be better athletes. There's, they're,

56
00:03:17.821 --> 00:03:20.440
they're going to have better genetics. You know,

57
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:21.430
there's nothing you do about that.

58
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.530
But one thing we can do is we can keep women from getting beaten up by men and,

59
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.830
and men who transition to being women. And if you think that's fair,

60
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.160
you're fucking crazy. And it's just not, it doesn't make,

61
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:36.640
it doesn't make any sense. And the arguments for it are so shitty.

62
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:41.641
And so they're so riddled with progressive speak that they're trying to pretend

63
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:46.300
that this is a woman. Now this is not a woman, this is a trans woman.

64
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.880
This is a male. She has a Y chromosome.

65
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.530
She transitioned to being a female. Now she's a trans woman,

66
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.420
and if you choose to fight her and you're a woman and you know that she's a

67
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:00.280
trans woman, I'm totally fine with that.

68
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.200
But that was not what was going on here.

69
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.640
What was going on here was this woman who used to be a man for 32 years,

70
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.800
transitioned to being a woman and it didn't tell anybody and thought two

71
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:15.430
different women who thought they were fighting a woman and got fucking smashed.

72
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.330
I was watching it. It was like watching a man fight a woman.

73
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.090
That's what I was watching. I was like, this isn't like particularly,

74
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:23.530
she wasn't particularly skillful.

75
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.090
It wasn't like she had like some unbelievable background and judo,

76
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:29.800
like Ronda Rousey or something like that.

77
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.980
It wasn't that you were just literally watching a former man beat up women who

78
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:40.960
never had the benefit of 30 years plus of testosterone in their body.

79
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.990
What do you think the solution should be then? I don't know,

80
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:48.130
but I was fascinated by watching the, the mob come after me for that one. Yeah.

81
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.840
I was like, this is, this is adorable, but what was fascinating about it was,

82
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.410
well, here's something that I, I mean I'm not a physio,

83
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.440
I'm not a real expert in physiology or endocrinology,

84
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.470
but I'm a martial arts expert and I've been doing it my whole life.

85
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.900
Like I know the difference. I've,

86
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:12.901
I've trained with women world champions and watched them get mauled by men who

87
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:19.090
are not very good. It's just a fact, especially when it comes to striking,

88
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.130
you know, there's more of a gap in jujitsu or, or the,

89
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:28.131
the gap rather closes in jujitsu because skill and technique take precedent over

90
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:31.840
physical strength. But God damn it when it comes to striking.

91
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.020
You could get a man who's been doing it for six months,

92
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:39.880
but just happens to have a lot of fast Twitch muscle fiber and it just knows how

93
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:43.870
to hit things hard and he, he'll fuck a woman up. It's not good.

94
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.800
Especially when it comes to kickboxing and kicking and punching. There's so,

95
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.720
there's so many advantages and to to say that those advantages are immediately

96
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.980
cut out of the picture.

97
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.770
As soon as you transitioned to being a woman and within two years he should be

98
00:05:57.771 --> 00:06:01.430
able to fight women in a cage and not tell them, you're a woman. I was like,

99
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.010
this is insanity. Yeah. So that was the,

100
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:05.870
that was the big mob that came after me. Hmm.

101
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.920
<v 1>I think it's interesting that in this,</v>

102
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.220
because it is pitting people who would call themselves feminist against

103
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.420
transgender activists and it's basically women are being lost in the mix,

104
00:06:15.421 --> 00:06:19.470
so you can't say certain things like what planet would it be okay for someone

105
00:06:19.471 --> 00:06:23.700
who is born male to fight a woman, but in this case,

106
00:06:23.701 --> 00:06:26.790
because this person who's born male identifies as female.

107
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.410
You can't call that into question,

108
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.310
<v 0>but also there was a real problem in Texas the other way where they're there,</v>

109
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.510
what they were doing is being prejudice against trans people to the point where

110
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.130
they wouldn't let a girl transitioning to being a boy wrestle with boys.

111
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.670
They made her wrestle with girls while she was taking testosterone.

112
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.680
It's like you guys are out of your fucking mind like you.

113
00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:54.390
You're not even recognizing that she wants to compete with boys,

114
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.690
which is a disadvantage for her or him now let him compete with boys because

115
00:07:01.591 --> 00:07:05.520
this is a different thing. But then even then a lot of boys were saying,

116
00:07:05.521 --> 00:07:07.350
well look, I'm not taking testosterone.

117
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.790
I just have testosterone would have her testosterone is higher than my

118
00:07:11.791 --> 00:07:16.380
testosterone because she's taking exogenous testosterone. This is kinda crazy.

119
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.510
Like yeah, it's, there's a lot of new ground that's going on here.

120
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.700
My concern as a,

121
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.910
a martial arts expert is when you are using ideology to push this,

122
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.800
this progressive notion that, you know,

123
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.930
a trans woman is exactly the same as a woman and you're getting women beat the

124
00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:43.530
fuck up because of it. And this is what I felt and this is what I saw.

125
00:07:43.531 --> 00:07:45.990
And they wouldn't have to be hard for like a year or two.

126
00:07:45.991 --> 00:07:48.600
But then it all went away. What's the worst thing they said about you?

127
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.910
I didn't mean it. I didn't read it.

128
00:07:50.911 --> 00:07:52.470
I read a little bit of it and then I was like,

129
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.160
Oh I really didn't even hurt my feelings cause I was like, this is so stupid.

130
00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.480
It's like, do you know a woman who's got a hand that looks like that?

131
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:05.040
Find one, find one. Because if I took estrogen, I'd still have these.

132
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.100
And that's not fair. It's just not, I don't care.

133
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.760
I don't care what anybody says. It's just not mean. Even a woman with big hands,

134
00:08:11.761 --> 00:08:14.370
they're not that big. They're not like Brock Lesnar's hands.

135
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.130
There's a difference. There's a fucking difference.

136
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.190
There's a difference in the shape of the jaw. There's a difference in,

137
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.880
so there's so many differences and men to women and there's so many women that

138
00:08:27.331 --> 00:08:30.540
used to be men that transition to being women that are now dominating these

139
00:08:30.541 --> 00:08:34.350
sports. Or these women feel like they're being fucked over, like weight lifting.

140
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.460
There was this Australian weightlifter who's a trans woman who's competing as a

141
00:08:38.461 --> 00:08:42.540
woman and is fucking breaking records and left and right. And everybody's like,

142
00:08:42.541 --> 00:08:46.050
this is crazy. She's an inspiration. Yeah. No, she's a guy.

143
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.430
She used to be a guy and now she's breaking these women's records. Like,

144
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.470
what are we doing? This is crazy.

145
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.340
<v 1>Yeah, but to play devil's advocate, um, please do.</v>

146
00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.700
<v 0>Didn't fall and Fox get beaten by Ashley Smith. Yeah,</v>

147
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.250
because she sucks. That's really what it is. Actually. Evan Smith is good.

148
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.630
It shows she's so good. She listen. There's a lot of women.

149
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.610
That would be a lot of men, women who are not taking anything.

150
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.360
Who would beat a lot of men and it's happened. Um, uh,

151
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.670
uh, Jermaine Duran dummy who, uh,

152
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.700
was a super high level women's MMA fighter is uh,

153
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.340
won the 145 pound world title beat Holly Holm.

154
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.850
She fought a man in a kickboxing bout, knocked him out.

155
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.590
It's cause she's a fucking beast. She's really good and really technical,

156
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.740
super strong and just much better than a guy who wasn't on her level.

157
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.930
But she's just super exceptional.

158
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.520
But there's also women who fought men who were world champions,

159
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:57.480
who got knocked down, who there was a woman from, God damn it,

160
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.470
she was a, a female boxer from Holland.

161
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.690
Her name escapes me right now. She was,

162
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:08.820
she was a woman that they were always trying to ma match her up with Christy

163
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.150
Martin back when Christy Martin, the coal miner's daughter was a famous,

164
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.280
God dammit, why can't I remember her name? But she was a,

165
00:10:16.281 --> 00:10:20.790
an elite female boxer and she got knocked out by a man. It was ugly.

166
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.440
And the guy she knocked out,

167
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.480
the guy who knocked her out really wasn't very good.

168
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.200
He just clanged her on the jaw and coyote her.

169
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.710
But it was disturbing to watch, but somehow it wasn't disturbing.

170
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:35.520
When Jermaine to random, he knocked out the guy. Then it was like, yeah, girl.

171
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.370
Yeah, the, you can't,

172
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:43.320
you're always going to have people that are higher level skill. And Ashley,

173
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:46.860
Evan Smith, who's competed successfully in the UFC, she's very tough.

174
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.820
And she beat vallum Fox. Yeah. And that citizen, you know,

175
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.500
I'm not against Fallon, Fox fighting women that want to fight her.

176
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.510
I'm not against that. If they want,

177
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.590
I'm not against women fighting men to want to do, I'm not a man.

178
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.230
I'm not against people riding bowls. I'm not against people bungee jumping.

179
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.820
I should be able to do whatever the fuck you want,

180
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.330
but don't pretend that you're exactly the same as a biological woman.

181
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.870
Well, why the fuck did we have tests then? Why me? Why? What is it?

182
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.520
What does a chromosome, what are genetics? What are, what is it? Is it all,

183
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.360
we're just going to give it all away for ideology. And what about women?

184
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:29.950
Like this idea of being completely progressive and and looking at things.

185
00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:32.970
And and promoting equality. That's wonderful,

186
00:11:32.971 --> 00:11:36.210
but are you promoting equality for women? Like what about the women?

187
00:11:36.211 --> 00:11:40.880
What about a woman like you? What about a woman who's slight and thin? What do,

188
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.310
what are you supposed to do? How much do you weigh? I'm not going to tell you.

189
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.290
You're very fun. Okay. Let's pretend you're in the 105 pound weight class.

190
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.800
Do you feel like you can compete with the 105 pound man and know that seems,

191
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.560
this seems ridiculous, right? Well,

192
00:11:56.561 --> 00:12:01.270
it seems to me that we have to accept the fact that there's some physical

193
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:06.271
differences when the consequences are being gravely injured and this is what

194
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:07.300
martial arts are all about.

195
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.950
I'm trying to hurt you and I shouldn't have natural physical advantages that

196
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:16.180
come from having a Y chromosome in 30 plus years of testosterone in my body.

197
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.690
That just seems to be obvious to me and I didn't understand why,

198
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.430
but that was a Hill that I was ready to die on. I was like,

199
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:26.770
you guys can fuck off for you for that,

200
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.230
but you see that they've kind of left you alone now. Right?

201
00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:30.850
Because I do this cause I,

202
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.600
cause I can say things like this about it and I cause it makes sense.

203
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.050
And because when other people hear about it that are rational people, they go,

204
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:42.850
what? What's happening? Wait a minute, that's a guy. She was a guy for 30 years.

205
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.900
Like that's not right.

206
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.070
And the vast majority of people who even support trans rights,

207
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.690
including friends of mine who are trans are with me on this. They're like, yeah,

208
00:12:52.691 --> 00:12:55.210
that's crazy. Have you heard the term turf?

209
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.840
Am I surf and turf turf?

210
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:03.840
<v 1>No. Turf as in terf is trans exclusionary radical feminist.</v>

211
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:09.230
So this is a new slur that's being used against women who will say trans women

212
00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:12.030
are not women because they were not born women.

213
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.550
<v 0>Whoa. Trans exclusionary radical.</v>

214
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.320
<v 1>So you would kind of be a turf in this situation cause you're advocating for</v>

215
00:13:19.321 --> 00:13:23.910
women and the safety of women and saying that people who are born male but

216
00:13:23.911 --> 00:13:27.480
identifies female are not the same as people who are born female.

217
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:32.540
<v 0>Yes. But that doesn't mean that I'm discriminatory. No,</v>

218
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.620
it's a word that they use to try and discredit you. Good luck.

219
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.190
Have fun with that. I don't care see this a problem. But the,

220
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.460
the thing about this is I don't care because I really don't have any hate in my

221
00:13:43.461 --> 00:13:48.410
heart and I don't have any discrimination in my heart. Like I don't do well.

222
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.830
I can't speak for everybody. Some do, but some do. I'm sure.

223
00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:53.180
I'm sure if you were to look,

224
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:57.740
if you have a thousand people and a hundred of those people are a fucking

225
00:13:57.741 --> 00:14:01.100
asshole to you, it's going to feel like a lot of people, right?

226
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.190
So if you're a trans person and you're you, I mean,

227
00:14:04.191 --> 00:14:07.670
I've seen horrific things written to trans people online. I've seen it,

228
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.100
I've seen, I understand that there's real discrimination,

229
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.240
but I understand that you have to understand, Oh,

230
00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:17.360
you have to appreciate who your actual allies and who people who are rational

231
00:14:17.361 --> 00:14:22.361
people who actually care about you and who disagree with you on one very

232
00:14:22.851 --> 00:14:25.550
particular thing, and this is the only place where I disagree.

233
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:29.210
It's combat sports and it's because it's my area of expertise.

234
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.850
I've been doing it since I was a kid. Like,

235
00:14:31.851 --> 00:14:34.790
you can't tell me that there's not differences.

236
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:38.990
I've watched men and women fight my whole life. I know there's a difference.

237
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:44.530
And I know that from talking to endocrinologist and people who are experts in

238
00:14:46.431 --> 00:14:47.270
the human anatomy,

239
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.500
that there's just physiological differences that are insurmountable. They are,

240
00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:52.040
I've seen men

241
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.440
<v 1>and women hit the bag. It's a very different thing. Yeah.</v>

242
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.190
I mean I get where people are coming from, the people who are upset by this,

243
00:14:58.191 --> 00:15:01.400
because I think by acknowledging someone that someone was not born,

244
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:04.010
the sex that they identify as, it's almost like saying,

245
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.790
pointing out to them that they're different, but they are different. Well, yeah,

246
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.900
but are different.

247
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.470
But I can see how that can be upsetting for someone who identifies as the

248
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:13.304
opposite sex.

249
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.850
<v 0>Yeah. You know what? I can see how it's upsetting.</v>

250
00:15:17.851 --> 00:15:22.140
If you're short and you want to identify as being tall, you know what?

251
00:15:22.141 --> 00:15:25.140
If I wanted to pretend that I was seven feet tall and you'd be like, Joe,

252
00:15:25.141 --> 00:15:27.570
you're five, eight like are you an asshole?

253
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.180
Why are you saying I'm a five eight but you are.

254
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.500
So if I say you're a trans woman, which means you're a born a man, you haven't,

255
00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.410
why chromosome? They're like, well you're a piece of shit cat.

256
00:15:37.411 --> 00:15:41.940
How you point that out? Well that's what you are. It's not that you're negative,

257
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.750
uh, you are people who are dwarves or is that,

258
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.640
is it evil to say that a dwarf is a dwarf or a little person or whatever,

259
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.110
whatever phrase you want to use,

260
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.530
are we supposed to acknowledge that there's an issue?

261
00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:00.090
Like if someone is born with a handicap, are you supposed to, is that a fact?

262
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.600
Are you allowed to discuss it as a fact if you have autism,

263
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.830
my allowed to bring up the fact that you are on the spectrum or am I supposed to

264
00:16:07.831 --> 00:16:11.430
ignore it? Yeah. Is it discrimination? If you talk about reality,

265
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.920
if someone has a deformity,

266
00:16:13.921 --> 00:16:18.150
are you allowed to discuss it or is it discrimination to discuss reality?

267
00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.220
Because what are we doing with our language?

268
00:16:20.221 --> 00:16:23.850
What are we doing with the way we describe the actual things that are,

269
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.620
that exist in the world?

270
00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:30.030
And if we're not describing them in accurate terms cause we're trying to somehow

271
00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.180
or another stop people from getting hurt feelings,

272
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:38.160
what are these feelings based on these delusional perceptions of reality and why

273
00:16:38.161 --> 00:16:40.710
are we reinforcing these delusional perceptions of reality?

274
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.150
Because it seems to me that this kind of language and this kind of exclusionary

275
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:50.990
th th th th th the inability to use certain words and the inability to describe

276
00:16:51.391 --> 00:16:54.180
things accurately, correctly, and in many cases,

277
00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:56.970
scientifically it hurts everybody. Yeah,

278
00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.900
<v 1>I agree with that. I don't think facts themselves are hateful.</v>

279
00:16:59.901 --> 00:17:04.010
I think people who use facts to justify discrimination,

280
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.800
that's where the problem is. And that's where the efforts should be going.

281
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:09.680
Because when you start to deny facts, where does that leave you?

282
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.240
Where do you draw the line in that case?

283
00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:15.720
<v 0>Absolutely. But I think it's, there's something that's kind of cool about it,</v>

284
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.660
that there are trans people.

285
00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:23.160
And what's cool about it is that the world is weird. You know,

286
00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.210
and I'm, I'm not happy that they get a lot of hate,

287
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:31.620
but I'm kind of happy that they exist.

288
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.390
I wish they could just be women.

289
00:17:33.391 --> 00:17:36.720
I wish you could just like hit a switch and you really wish you're born a woman.

290
00:17:36.721 --> 00:17:41.040
Bam, you're a woman. But I suspect that even if you could do that,

291
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.440
some people would rather just be trans.

292
00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.440
Some people would look like there's a lot of people that I know that are trans

293
00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:50.970
and also have dicks and they want to the deck. Yeah. And they're like, okay,

294
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.900
like what's going on here? And you, you know that you're transphobic.

295
00:17:54.901 --> 00:17:58.650
If you're a straight heterosexual male and you're not willing to date a trans

296
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:00.600
woman with a Dick, but you know what it is,

297
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:05.160
it's actually a sexual preference for men who will date trans women who were

298
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.740
retaining their penis. That's what it's called in the literature.

299
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:09.720
They decided not to get surgery.

300
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:13.650
It's actually a particular sexual preference for the people that are attracted

301
00:18:13.651 --> 00:18:18.330
to that particular trans woman. Andrea morpho. Phelia Whoa.

302
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.380
Someone tell Jim Norton.

303
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:26.970
Um, nothing wrong with that either. No, nothing. Nothing wrong with that either.

304
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:31.830
Do what you do. This is the thing, the difference between a man and a woman,

305
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.190
a trans man, a trans woman,

306
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.540
and then someone who could actually be a woman who transitions.

307
00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:41.580
I think we're going to get to a point within, you know,

308
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:46.230
whether it's a hundred years or 500 years where we can use things like the,

309
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.850
the future version of CRISPR or whatever comes down the line.

310
00:18:50.851 --> 00:18:51.570
Next,

311
00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:55.800
some scientific innovation that's going to allow people to literally transition.
