00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.440
I wanted to continue my investigation, so I decided

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.620
to add another term. This time I used the

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.780
word election. And here's what was interesting, I noticed

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.620
these peaks spaced evenly out over time. And then I

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.660
realized that these peaks made a lot of sense

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.180
because the US Presidential election occurs every four years

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.790
in November. If I hover right over the graph,

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.840
I can see these peaks in November. Finally, I wanted

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.860
to see if there was a word that appeared more than

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.890
any of these other words in the last few years. So,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.580
I typed in the word Facebook. This created a drastic change

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.010
in the vertical scale in the graph. And I noticed Facebook

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.140
didn't even come out on the scene until around 2007. I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.930
think it's pretty cool that a word such as Facebook draws

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.980
words like chicken, music and movies. Facebook is certainly the giant

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.870
when it comes to this graph. This is one small example of

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.100
how data is everywhere around us and it's waiting

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.610
to be explored. Let's have you get your hands

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.697
dirty, by performing your own trend analysis. Search for

00:00:58.697 --> 00:01:01.506
celebrities, music, movies, or anything else that you find

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:04.330
interesting. You can use the time series graph that

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.150
I used, or something else on the site. Once

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.440
you've got your exploration, share it on the forums,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.340
and comment on any posts that you find interesting.
