00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.210
I've been asked to calculate
the probability of winning

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.080
the Mega Millions jackpot.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.650
So I thought that's what
I would do this video on.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.650
So the first thing is to
make sure we understand

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.680
what does winning the
jackpot actually mean.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.840
So there's going to
be two bins of balls.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.920
One of them is going to have 56
balls in it, so 56 in one bin.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.290
And then another bin is
going to have 46 balls in it.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.564
So there are 46 balls in
this bin right over here.

00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:27.980
And so what they're
going to do is

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.550
they're going to pick 5 balls
from this bin right over here.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.060
And you have to get the exact
numbers of those 5 balls.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.290
It can be in any order.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.470
So let me just draw them.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.820
So it's 1 ball-- I'll shade
it so it looks like a ball--

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:47.376
2 balls, 3 balls, 4
balls, and 5 balls

00:00:47.376 --> 00:00:48.500
that they're going to pick.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.583
And you just have to get
the numbers in any order.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.255
So this is from a bin of 56.

00:00:55.515 --> 00:00:57.390
And then you have to
get the mega ball right.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.190
And then they're
going to just pick

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.580
one ball from there, which
they call the mega ball.

00:01:02.926 --> 00:01:04.300
And obviously,
this is just going

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.410
to be picked-- this is
going to be one of 46,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.000
so from a bin of 46.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.050
And so to figure out the
probability of winning,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.420
it's essentially
going to be one of all

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.546
of the possibilities of numbers
that you might be able to pick.

00:01:17.546 --> 00:01:19.170
So essentially, all
of the combinations

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.570
of the white balls times
the 46 possibilities

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.294
that you might get
for the mega ball.

00:01:24.294 --> 00:01:25.710
So to think about
the combinations

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.293
for the white balls, there's a
couple of ways you could do it.

00:01:28.293 --> 00:01:30.960
If you are used to thinking
in combinatorics terms,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.370
it would essentially say, well,
out of a set of 56 things,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.820
I am going to choose 5 of them.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.790
So this is literally, you could
view this as 56, choose 5.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.065
Or if you want to think of
it in more conceptual terms,

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:48.865
the first ball I pick,
there's 56 possibilities.

00:01:48.865 --> 00:01:51.240
Since we're not replacing the
ball, the next ball I pick,

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.300
there's going to be
55 possibilities.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.730
The ball after that, there's
going to be 54 possibilities.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.189
Ball after that, there's
going to be 53 possibilities.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.730
And then the ball
after that, there's

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.330
going to be 52 possibilities,
because I've already

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.931
picked 4 balls out of that.

00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:10.389
Now, this number right over
here, when you multiply it out,

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.450
this is a number
of permutations,

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.920
if I cared about order.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.870
So if I got that
exact combination.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.320
But to win this, you don't
have to write them down

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.340
in the same order.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.806
You just have to get those
numbers in any order.

00:02:21.806 --> 00:02:23.180
And so what you
want to do is you

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.190
want to divide this
by the number of ways

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.760
that five things can
actually be ordered.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.040
So what you want to do
is divide this by the way

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.670
that five things can be ordered.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.230
And if you're
ordering five things,

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.940
the first of the five things can
take five different positions.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.240
Then the next one will have four
positions left, and then the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.130
one after that will have
three positions left.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.930
The one after that will
have two positions.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.116
And then the fifth one will
be completely determined

00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:46.990
because you've already
placed the other four,

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.520
so it's going to have
only one position.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.800
So when we calculate this
part right over here,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.620
this will tell us all
of the combinations

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.100
of just the white balls.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.640
And so let's calculate that.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:06.230
So just the white balls, we
have 56 times 55 times 54 times

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.710
53 times 52.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.196
And we're going to divide that
by 5 times 4 times 3 times 2.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.070
We don't have to multiply
by 1, but I'll just

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.870
do that, just to show
what we're doing.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.840
And then that gives
us about 3.8 million.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.150
So let me actually let
me put that off screen.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.830
So let me write
that number down.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:37.799
So this comes out to 3,819,816.

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.590
So that's the number
of possibilities here.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.110
So just your odds of picking
just the white balls right

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.960
are going to be one
out of this, assuming

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.410
you only have one entry.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.539
And then there's
46 possibilities

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.080
for the orange balls,
so you're going

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.382
to multiply that times 46.

00:03:51.382 --> 00:03:52.840
And so that's going
to get you-- so

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.070
when you multiply it times
46-- bring the calculator back.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.980
So we're going to multiply
our previous answer times 46.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.890
"Ans" just means
my previous answer.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.685
I get a little
under 176 million.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.329
Let me write that number down.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:25.470
So that gives us 175,711,536.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.267
So your odds of winning it,
with one entry-- because this

00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:30.600
is the number of possibilities,
and you are essentially,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.810
for $1, getting one of
those possibilities.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.839
Your odds of winning is
going to be 1 over this.

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:37.630
And to put this in a
little bit of context,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.220
I looked it up on
the internet what

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.780
your odds are of
actually getting

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.004
struck by lightning
in your lifetime.

00:04:43.004 --> 00:04:44.420
And so your odds
of getting struck

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.510
by lightning in your
lifetime are roughly 1

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.470
in 10,000-- chance
of getting struck

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.736
by lightning in your lifetime.

00:04:51.736 --> 00:04:54.360
And we can roughly say your odds
of getting struck by lightning

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.070
twice in your lifetime,
or another way

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.490
of saying it is the odds of
you and your best friend both

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.800
independently being struck
by lightning when you're not

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.330
around each other, is going
to be 1 in 10,000 times

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.150
1 in 10,000.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.480
And so that will get you 1 in--
and we're going to have now

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.980
eight 0's-- 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.660
So that gives you
1 in 100 million.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.130
So you're actually
twice-- almost,

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.460
this is very rough--
you're roughly twice

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.170
as likely to get struck by
lightning twice in your life

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.525
than to win the Mega jackpot.
