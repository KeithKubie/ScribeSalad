00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.000
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, we're very excited to
Dane Cook here today to an hour of fireside

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.540
chat with us.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.540
Yeah.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.540
[applause]

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.540
Pretty cool.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.540
So, Dane Cook is a comedian.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.540
He's an actor.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.540
He's an entertainer.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.960
And he's actually one of the first celebrities
that was on Google Plus, so we're really excited

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.050
to have him here this morning.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.980
Got a demo for us from the product.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.510
And we just really wanna hear from him about
how he's been using it.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.779
So, Dane's gonna join us and we'll just do
a really casual Q&amp;A.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.701
So Dane, you wanna come up?

00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:34.701
[applause and cheering]

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:35.701
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Thanks man.

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:36.701
Thank you.

00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:37.701
All right.

00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:38.701
What's up everybody?

00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:47.460
What's going on, hey?

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.190
[clapping]

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.780
You're all in my circles.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.780
[laughter]

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.450
As of right now.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.040
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah, it's automatic.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.579
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Why do we have four beverages
up here already?

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:59.579
[laughter]

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.579
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I don't know.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:01.579
Which one do you want?

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:02.579
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: And some of them have already
been consumed.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.579
[laughter]

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:04.579
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: This one's mine.

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:05.579
You can have it.

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:06.579
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Are these all the past--.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:07.579
Is this Eddie Izzard's and--.

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:08.579
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.030
Eddie was here yesterday and we talked about
that.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.030
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Yes.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.030
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Cool.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.030
So, we just wanted to do a little--

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.030
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Do a little rap battle?

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.160
Is that how we're starting?

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.160
[laughter]

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.160
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Just starting.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.540
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Drop a beat on me.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.540
[laughter]

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.710
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I can't.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.710
[laughter]

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.710
Cool.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.570
But yeah, we're just gonna ask some questions.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.330
So, maybe give us just a little bit of the
first questions I'm asking is you came from

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.760
not being a comedian to being a comedian.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.420
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Yes.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.800
That's how it starts.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.800
[laughing]

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.800
[laughter]

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.800
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: How did that happen?

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.450
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: There was a great period where
I was a comedian, but I still really wasn't

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.450
a comedian.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.540
I just told people that I was a comedian.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.920
How did that start?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.190
I'm from right outside of Boston, Arlington,
Massachusetts.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.190
All right.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.450
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Three out there.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.450
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Yes.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.450
Go Sox.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.920
I think we're in first place right now, I
do believe.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.760
You don't have to be sorry.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.200
Yeah, so I grew up in Arlington.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.300
Five sisters and a funny family.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.270
I'm the shy one.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.270
I really am--

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.270
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Fun.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.769
&gt;&gt;Dave: the quietest, shyest person in my
whole family.

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.290
Everybody else was really outrageous.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.819
And my mom was very physical.

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:19.930
Everything was very big with my mom.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.500
She'd be like, "Good morning.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.500
Breakfast is here."

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.500
[laughter]

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.900
And she would always dance and serve food.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.430
And then my dad was really like stoic.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.400
He was pretty badass.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.260
My dad was like this, but real understated,
dry sense of humor.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.470
And I love their style of comedy.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.371
And I already appreciated that they were funny
people, so as I got older and I told them

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:48.209
I wanted to be a comedian, I basically just
took my mom and dad's style and made it my

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.209
own.

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.180
'Cause I wanted to be physical, but still
have, like my dad, a cool swagger to him.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.799
And that's really how it all started.

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.060
And they were like, "No, you're not gonna
really do stand-up comedy.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.889
You're too shy and quiet."

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.150
I would puke every day on the way to school.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.150
[laughter]

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.150
Yeah, I really did.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.150
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I did this morning.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.150
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: It was called the "throw up tree."

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.249
I had the throw up tree.

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:14.099
And if I could make it past the throw up tree,
I would be OK at school.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.930
But most of the time, I was so anxious that
I would throw up at the throw up tree, hence

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.909
the name, and--.

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:27.040
But truly, I always wanted to be a stand-up
comic based on my funny family and we would

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.450
watch like, Saturday Night Live together.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.110
And I would watch my family laughing and I
would just watch them laugh and I was so enamored

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.790
by the fact that they loved that stuff.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.680
And then, they would act it out, that I think
it made me want to be a comedian to entertain

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.680
my family.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.720
And really it was always about making my family
laugh first.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.200
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, if you're the shyest,
what do your five sisters do?

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I don't know.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.390
I've never met them.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.450
[laughter]

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.450
They're pretty loony.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.169
And they're all like, you know the movie "The
Fighter?"

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:58.379
You've seen "The Fighter?"

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.499
You know the sisters in "The Fighter?"

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:01.499
[laughter]

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:03.079
That's my fucking family.

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.079
[laughter]

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.330
I'm not even kidding you.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.760
Like, I have the least of the Boston accent.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.819
I have a little, like at night, and I start
to get tired.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.819
[laughter]

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.700
But truly, if you watch that movie, the mother
in that is my sister Cathy.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.620
My sister Cathy, I can swear here, right?

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.620
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.620
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: OK.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.320
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: You guys are all over thirteen,
[inaudible]?

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.860
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: My sister Cathy will literally,
when I call her, she'll be like,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.500
[using a high-pitched female voice]
"Oh, my God.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.060
My fucking brother Dane is like, all over
the TV.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.730
It's fucking crazy."

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.730
[laughter]

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.730
All my sisters have that high-pitched, crazy.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.100
[using a high-pitched female voice]
"It's unbelievable."

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.930
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So from that, when did you
feel like you made it, or--

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:45.930
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Loosen up.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.930
Let's have some fun.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.930
[laughter]

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:48.930
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: It's Dane Cook.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.860
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I feel like I'm on "Inside the
Actor's Studio."

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.490
[laughter]

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.490
Talk about your battle with cancer, Dane.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.490
[laughter]

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.490
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Can we?

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.510
[pause] Now I don't know what to say.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.510
[laughter]

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.300
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: What do you want to know?

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.660
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: How about coolest performance
that you've done?

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:27.090
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I think hosting SNL was, because
watching it growing up and I would act out

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.740
whenever Don Pardo would say, [using Don Pardo
voice] "It's Saturday Night Live."

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:37.940
I would walk into the living room and pretend
I was the celebrity.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.940
[laughter]

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.510
And my family would clap for me and then,
of course, watch the show.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.220
And so, for my entire young adult life, I
would watch.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.310
Martin Short was a big influence.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.900
I loved brave comics.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.600
I used to love John Ritter and watch "Three's
Company," or Martin Short or Steve Martin

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.760
is a guy that really--.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.550
Just people that used vernacular, used physicality.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:10.360
And so, I would watch that show and I would
dream about being, coming through the door.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.460
And when I finally got the call from Lorne
Michaels to host, it was, it's still unbelievable.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.460
It was incredible.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.210
And that moment standing, you're standing--.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.870
When you're back there, there's nothing back
there.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.310
It's just like a plank of wood and it's just
completely pitch black.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.430
And it's just you and the producer, she's
wearing the headset, and you can hear in the

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.590
headset like, "Starring," and they're going
through the names.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.470
And you're just standing there.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.870
The double glass and you try to see through,
but you can't really see anything.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.900
And she'd be like this.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.310
Like, "20 seconds."

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.620
And then she's listening.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.410
"Ten seconds."

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.080
I remember just in that moment being like,
"Wow.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.140
My whole life I've been staring at this door
and now I'm going to walk through that.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.830
I've always wondered what was behind here.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:53.830
And I'm behind here."

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.830
[laughter]

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.830
And it was just like, crazy.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.120
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Were you still wondering?

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.090
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: It was unbelievable to walk out.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.040
And of course, the band's there and you're
hearing this famous theme music.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.300
And I almost forgot about being funny or--.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.590
I really just wanted to get to the mark and
look at the camera and be like, to my family,

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.450
be like, "I'm here!"

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.450
[laughter]

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.500
And not even care about the performance.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.150
It was truly a highlight of my life.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.150
Next to this.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:25.150
[laughter]

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.420
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: This would be Top Three
for me too.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.930
Top Three.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:30.930
Definitely.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.940
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Hmm.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.450
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I'll take this one.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:42.100
But you are here because we're really excited
to have you as one of--

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.100
[laughter]

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.980
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: [spit-take] You're excited?

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.980
[laughter]

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.860
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Not that excited.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.810
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: No.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.810
No.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:53.810
[laughter]

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:54.810
Classic spit-take.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:55.810
Come on.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.980
Right there.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:57.980
Let's--.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.190
What is this?

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.830
What are we doing?

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:03.830
[laughter]

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.650
We just locked hands so lovingly.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.650
[laughter]

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:08.940
That was like a--

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.310
[Dane Cook laughs]

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.850
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I had that planned.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.090
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Did you see that?

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:14.110
That was like out of "The Notebook" or something.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.110
We just--

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.110
[laughter]

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.110
I've never seen a high five.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.800
Can we do it again?

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.270
It just, to make, and then we did this.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.040
[laughter, clapping, cheering]

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.780
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Did we do it like this?

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.330
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Shaking like leaf, baby.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.330
[laughter]

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.290
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's how most rap battles
start.

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:35.290
We're on it.

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:39.669
But I am excited.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.669
We're excited.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:41.740
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I'm very thrilled to be up here.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.800
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Do you want take another
sip and I can say it again?

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.800
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Oh, no.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.870
One spit take per Google visit.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.870
[laughter]

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.629
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, I mean, can you give
us a little bit of background about--.

00:08:51.629 --> 00:08:56.269
'Cause MySpace, you are one of the main celebrities
that brought MySpace to the forefront.

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:59.249
Can you tell us about your journey through
the digital--?

00:08:59.249 --> 00:09:00.249
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Yeah.

00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:01.249
My goal was to destroy it.

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:02.249
[laughter]

00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:03.249
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Failed.

00:09:03.249 --> 00:09:04.870
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: It took me a while.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:05.870
[laughter]

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.630
I wanted to corrode it from within.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.630
[laughter]

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.199
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thank you.

00:09:12.199 --> 00:09:22.029
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: In 1999-2000, I was like just
sitting around in my underwear eating Fruit

00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:24.110
Loops, I remember.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.329
And just languishing.

00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:29.329
I would go on the road a little bit.

00:09:29.329 --> 00:09:34.050
I wasn't making very much money and I was
just like at that point in my career where--.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:38.529
Even my family was like, "What's going on
with this?

00:09:38.529 --> 00:09:39.529
What's happening?"

00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:45.860
And I remember watching a punk rock documentary
that made a great impact on me.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.639
And part of the documentary was they were
following this band called like, Dragon's

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:53.040
Breath, or whatever--some punk band.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:10:00.110
And part of this documentary was showing these
guys putting their flyers up on telephone

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.819
poles and stuff, and passing them out in Harvard
Square in Boston.

00:10:03.819 --> 00:10:05.949
And they're like, "Yeah, we're Dragon's Breath.

00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:06.949
Come see us."

00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:09.720
I remember one person grabbed the flyer and
was like, "Dragon's Breath?

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.480
But there's not even a date on here.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.480
What is this?"

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.070
And they were like, "Oh, we don't have a gig
yet.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.639
We just want people to know our name."

00:10:15.639 --> 00:10:21.569
And right in that moment, I was like, well,
instead of sitting around 23 hours of the

00:10:21.569 --> 00:10:28.149
day waiting to maybe perform at a comedy club
in front of ten people, maybe I can have an

00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:29.519
online flyer.

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:35.389
Maybe I can post my instant message screen
name and then eventually Friendster and then

00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:36.389
MySpace.

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:41.230
And just start inviting people to my comedy.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:48.199
So, it was really watching that that I realized
I could put more time/effort/energy into finding

00:10:48.199 --> 00:10:53.410
my fans if I were to join social networking
sites and really be a part of it.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:57.449
Not just superfluous posts every few days,
"Eating a club sandwich."

00:10:57.449 --> 00:11:02.620
Like, letting people into my world and letting
people know that there's jokes, there's a

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.620
journey.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:08.060
I always made it about us.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:14.730
And I got shit sometimes for I'm pandering
because I care about what my audience thinks.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.660
And I would refer to it as like, "We are doing
this."

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.559
"We just got Premium Blend.

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:21.100
My first Comedy Central."

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:27.560
But by doing that, I really built, I laid
a foundation with a group of people I've grown

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.560
up with now.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.399
I mean, some of first followers I still keep
in touch with.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.819
I've always corresponded.

00:11:33.819 --> 00:11:39.540
I'm insane about keeping everything in folders
and I have my first people I had IM chats

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.540
with on AOL.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.899
Some of them are married.

00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:44.769
I've been a part of their weddings.

00:11:44.769 --> 00:11:49.629
I mean, fans of mine that I've travelled through
the years with and it all started really with

00:11:49.629 --> 00:11:55.940
that idea of truly using those sites for something
more than just looking for hot chicks, which

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.389
I do that, too.

00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:58.389
[laughter]

00:11:58.389 --> 00:12:00.499
And it's so easy 'cause I'm me.

00:12:00.499 --> 00:12:01.689
[laughter]

00:12:01.689 --> 00:12:02.949
They're like waiting.

00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:06.820
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, you must have--

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.029
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: No, they're hot.

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:11.029
[laughter]

00:12:11.029 --> 00:12:13.130
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Can you prove it?

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.130
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Yeah.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.130
Join my circle.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.130
[laughter]

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:17.579
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: In it.

00:12:17.579 --> 00:12:19.439
[laughter]

00:12:19.439 --> 00:12:20.630
Wanna high five again?

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.620
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Let's do it.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.620
[laughter]

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.129
Oh, and then the slow--.

00:12:25.129 --> 00:12:28.110
We have a slow dismount thing.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:32.269
We keep adding more to it.

00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:34.970
Is this live, being fed to the world right
now?

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:35.970
OK.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.389
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Nah.

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:40.529
But so, you must have experimented with some
stuff on--

00:12:40.529 --> 00:12:41.829
[laughter]

00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:43.139
[clapping]

00:12:43.139 --> 00:12:50.970
You said to loosen up, right?

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:59.600
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I started making meth in my bathroom
at 14.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.600
[laughter]

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.119
Is what you're wearing considered a loafer?

00:13:05.119 --> 00:13:07.490
[laughter]

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.490
Experimenting with what?

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:09.490
With?

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.490
[laughter]

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:11.490
With my sexuality?

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:12.490
[laughter]

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:13.490
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I'll let you keep going.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:14.490
Whatever you think.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:15.490
&gt;&gt;Dave: What are you saying?

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.510
Stragglers?

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.529
Hi.

00:13:17.529 --> 00:13:18.560
Welcome.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.579
[laughter]

00:13:19.579 --> 00:13:23.319
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: But social networks first
of all.

00:13:23.319 --> 00:13:24.319
&gt;&gt;Dave: Social networks.

00:13:24.319 --> 00:13:27.319
Anything and everything.

00:13:27.319 --> 00:13:28.319
I love it.

00:13:28.319 --> 00:13:31.579
I have a genuine interest in it.

00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:34.000
I learned HTML code.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.369
Remember the MySpace things that would freeze
your page?

00:13:37.369 --> 00:13:38.430
The little hearts?

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:39.980
I started that.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:40.980
[laughter]

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.360
To ruin that space.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.680
No.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:53.230
I was just really interested in the tech that
went behind this device that I was using that

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.369
changed my life.

00:13:54.369 --> 00:13:55.829
I mean this sincerely.

00:13:55.829 --> 00:14:05.559
It's like, I remember at one point, like 2004
and '05, when it really started to turn into

00:14:05.559 --> 00:14:07.329
these massive college tours.

00:14:07.329 --> 00:14:08.429
And I finally was--.

00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:10.459
I could take care of my family.

00:14:10.459 --> 00:14:11.459
You know what I mean?

00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:18.079
I was taking care of my family telling stories
because they supported me, this big full circle,

00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:19.559
this Google circle.

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:20.559
And--

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:22.740
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: We paid him for that.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.300
I'm just kidding.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:32.920
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: And it was really an incredible
moment to realize that because of an authentic

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:38.890
affiliation I had with my fans that I was
able to pay, buy myself a home.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:46.800
To buy my family, my mom, a house, just from
spending that time during those days instead

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.759
of just playing video games and doing nothing.

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:50.759
Which I did that as well.

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:54.069
I fit it all in.

00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:55.420
It's been incredible.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.339
It's really been an unbelievable--.

00:14:58.339 --> 00:15:02.069
There's been many lows, but the highs are
too high to mention.

00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:03.069
It's crazy.

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:04.069
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:05.069
And--.

00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:06.069
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: And yeah.

00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:07.069
You seem enthused.

00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:08.069
[laughter]

00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:09.220
I'm sorry I'm not Eddie Izzard.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.220
[laughter]

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.660
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: You're better.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.660
But you are one of the first people--

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.660
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Yeah.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.660
[laughter]

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.809
I love this.

00:15:17.809 --> 00:15:18.809
[laughter]

00:15:18.809 --> 00:15:22.709
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Me, too.

00:15:22.709 --> 00:15:25.730
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I was one of the first what?

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.059
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: On Google Plus.

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:29.259
You got more in-depth with them this morning
from us.

00:15:29.259 --> 00:15:30.439
Can you tell us what you think about the product?

00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:32.439
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Yeah, I don't care for it.

00:15:32.439 --> 00:15:33.439
[laughter]

00:15:33.439 --> 00:15:37.389
I think it should be restarted from the ground
up with ideas that I have.

00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:42.110
No, I think it's, there's a lot in there.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.519
And I mean, what I realized today, finally
sitting.

00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:49.550
It's not just the streaming updates and even
though a lot of these sites you have the ability

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.699
to post your photos.

00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:56.850
I really love the community aspect, especially
with what I learned today with the Huddles

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:58.199
for the phone.

00:15:58.199 --> 00:16:02.740
And then, because even that, I love engaging
with my fans.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:07.410
And if I'm on a tour, I like being able to
say and I've done this for the last couple

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:13.309
of years on tour "Hey, send me a photo right
now to my email with your tickets."

00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:14.309
And people will send pictures.

00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:18.059
And if they're up in like the Z seats, I not
only bring them backstage to hang with me

00:16:18.059 --> 00:16:20.550
up until the show, then I put them in the
front row.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:25.750
And I've done that with my fans for the last
ten years.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:30.899
So, any way that I can have that ability to
have an even quicker correspondence.

00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:34.540
Now they don't have to send it to an email
to where I have to suss through and all that.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.800
It's like I can instantly share right there
and grab somebody right out of that audience

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.360
to come back and be a part of my special night
wherever I'm performing.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.360
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:49.139
You do a lot of the stuff like that with Twitter,
too.

00:16:49.139 --> 00:16:51.639
And Fridays, you ask for pictures.

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:55.639
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Can we talk about that here?

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:56.639
[laughter]

00:16:56.639 --> 00:16:57.999
I didn't know we could talk about that.

00:16:57.999 --> 00:16:58.999
[laughter]

00:16:58.999 --> 00:17:00.130
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: They'll cut it for the--.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.190
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I do.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.190
I'll do whatever.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.069
On weekends, I'll put a picture up like, "This
is what I'm doing.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.069
What are you doing?"

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:08.010
And people will send pictures from around
the world.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.370
I get photos from around the world.

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:14.179
Or, I'll tell people, "Do my Su-Fi," which
is my reverse rock and roll sign.

00:17:14.179 --> 00:17:20.459
And they send these pictures in from everywhere.

00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:21.919
I say this.

00:17:21.919 --> 00:17:26.769
If you ever stand behind me and check out
my emails, it's a story.

00:17:26.769 --> 00:17:34.890
It's like I, on any given day, you'll read
emails that are inspiring and sometimes really

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:40.899
moving to know that I've connected with people
through comedy in a way that's helpful in

00:17:40.899 --> 00:17:42.289
their life.

00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:48.179
And I know that comedy gave me a life, saved
my life really in many ways, dealing with

00:17:48.179 --> 00:17:53.710
a lot of just really hardcore anxiety when
I was a kid.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:54.710
But I had my outlet.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:18:01.110
And now, my outlet is sharing with other people
who may need somebody like myself who understands

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:05.200
and can understand being on both sides of
the spectrum: feeling like a failure, feeling

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:12.700
like I'm insignificant, and then feeling like
I have a voice and feeling like I have something

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.890
to share with people.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:16.890
Just one quick thing.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.799
I remember a teacher, Lucille Burk, said to
me in 10th Grade, the assignment was, she

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:25.640
said, put it up on the board, "What are you
going to do to be a contributing member of

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.640
your community?"

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.640
That was the question.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.970
And it was like one of those things that just
smashed me.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.779
It consumed me, this question of what am I
gonna do to give back.

00:18:34.779 --> 00:18:41.649
And I feel like this is how I can give back,
to be able to travel the world with comedy.

00:18:41.649 --> 00:18:42.710
I went to Iraq a couple years ago.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:47.919
I did shows for the troops over there and
to be able to bring comedy and entertainment

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.399
to alleviate stress.

00:18:49.399 --> 00:18:50.399
It's the best.

00:18:50.399 --> 00:18:51.399
I live a charmed life.

00:18:51.399 --> 00:18:52.840
And you're a part of it now.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.840
[laughter]

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.840
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thank you.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.130
A lot of anxiety being up here with you.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:00.230
But, can you share some of those stories or
any of those stories?

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:01.230
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: No.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:06.700
It's none of your fucking business.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.350
[laughter]

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:09.350
What stories?

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.080
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That people share with you.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:15.750
You said a lot of them were really touching,
about how you've touched their lives.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.640
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Oh, yeah.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.799
I mean, it's--

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:21.799
[laughter]

00:19:21.799 --> 00:19:26.750
Some are literally about very close with my
fans.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:27.750
[laughter]

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.650
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Go on.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:32.990
[Dane Cook laughs]

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:38.710
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I mean, first of all, one of
the most unbelievable correspondents I ever

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:43.350
had was with a soldier who is over in Iraq.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:48.460
And we started communicating back and forth
through one of the sites.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:53.550
And over the course of three or four months,
we would just continually update.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:58.400
And he was like, "I'm live in the"--they called
it the suck's--"I'm out in the suck."

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.450
And I'd be like, "I'm hanging by the pool,
baby."

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.450
[laughter]

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:04.000
And we just had this great report.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.669
And when I would go back and read it, it was
funny and it was--.

00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:10.380
And then I would ask questions about like,
"What was your mission last night?

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.679
What did you have to do?"

00:20:12.679 --> 00:20:16.880
And sometimes he would write me and say, "Terrible
night last night."

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.760
And he would share with me a loss within the
platoon.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:25.779
And then a week later, he would talk about
different comedians or my stuff or whatever

00:20:25.779 --> 00:20:27.120
and things that made him laugh.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:33.361
But there's one part of the correspondence
that just, to this day, is incredible, where

00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:39.340
he wrote me and said that they were in a fire
fight in the middle of the night.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.740
And he described in email that, I have this
one routine that I do where I say "every guy

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.409
wants to do a heist".

00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:51.600
I say, "Even more than sex with a beautiful
woman, we would love to do a heist.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.580
We wanna be a part of a heist."

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.970
And so, in the heist thing, I say the things
that you need in the heist.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.919
You need like a weapons expert.

00:20:58.919 --> 00:21:02.370
You need somebody to have the van to drive
the getaway van when you come out.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.029
And then I have a line where I say--.

00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:07.690
I'm acting it out and I'm saying, "The van's
never there."

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.169
Just like in the movies, when you get outside,
so you're out there going, "Where's the van?

00:21:10.169 --> 00:21:11.809
The van's supposed to be here."

00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:15.919
And you're firing and we want the van to be
there.

00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:19.750
And so, I had sent them over the CDs.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.520
And when he wrote back at this particular
correspondence, he said, "In the middle of

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.610
the fire fight as they were shooting into
the darkness, they all started yelling 'Where's

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.740
the van?'"

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.770
[laughter]

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:40.631
They're getting shot at in the darkness and
then to make it somewhat lighter, they're

00:21:40.631 --> 00:21:44.330
making each other laugh with a piece of material
that I came up with.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:49.769
And it's just like, it's so unbelievable.

00:21:49.769 --> 00:21:54.029
And to say flattering, is like there's no
word to describe it.

00:21:54.029 --> 00:22:01.610
But one of countless emails, that again, every
day, you open up the email every day and it's

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:02.610
potluck.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:06.289
It's gonna be crazy, weird stalkers, silly,
boobs--

00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:07.289
[laughter]

00:22:07.289 --> 00:22:12.529
and then there's--.

00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:21.630
And then you'll get an email like when I did
SNL actually the first time.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.139
I wanted to do a piece of material, actually,
it was my second SNL appearance.

00:22:25.139 --> 00:22:28.269
And I wanted to do a bit about suicide.

00:22:28.269 --> 00:22:30.350
Somebody that I knew had attempted suicide.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.529
I was angry about it and sad and all these
things.

00:22:32.529 --> 00:22:34.350
And I wanted to do this bit.

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.880
Lorne's supported it.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.810
And even though the network is very iffy about
it, he supported it.

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:41.279
And I did the bit.

00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:47.400
And I got people that were not happy that
I did this routine.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.350
And I expected that, you know?

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:51.510
So, I got a lot of heat.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:55.620
But then, I got letters that were--.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:23:03.730
I got a letter from a 15-year old girl, who
wrote me this deeply personal letter and paraphrasing

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:08.510
it was like, "I've been keeping this depression
from my family.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:16.020
And until we all were laughing together watching
you, then I felt I could bring it to my family."

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:21.919
And to be a part of somebody's life like that.

00:23:21.919 --> 00:23:25.610
And again, there's so many letters like that.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:31.139
And to use a site like this, to be able to
immediately communicate with that person,

00:23:31.139 --> 00:23:32.139
to be like, "Hey, it's OK.

00:23:32.139 --> 00:23:33.139
I know that feeling.

00:23:33.139 --> 00:23:34.139
I've been there."

00:23:34.139 --> 00:23:38.529
Or all the good times and the highlight moments
and the things that are just festive and happy

00:23:38.529 --> 00:23:42.960
and joyous, it's the best.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.809
And to be able to, again, I wanna be able
to utilize this technology this day.

00:23:47.809 --> 00:23:49.230
I always wanted my fans with me.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:50.230
I literally meant that.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.799
Like, I want you guys with me the whole--whatever
I can share of that part of my life.

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:55.799
So, I'm trying.

00:23:55.799 --> 00:23:58.330
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And on Google Plus, has
there been anything like that?

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:02.370
What has your experience been on actually
being on it, talking to fans with the comments

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:03.890
and plus oneing?

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:05.070
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Yeah, no.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.070
It's been good.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:10.039
Right now everybody's still in that place
where we're getting used to it.

00:24:10.039 --> 00:24:13.070
You're hitting buttons going like, "I didn't
know it did this."

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.230
[laughter]

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.210
But the experience has been really positive.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:17.600
And it seems like everybody that--.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.122
I'll put it this way, it's not like you're
seeing people leave circles as more and more

00:24:22.122 --> 00:24:23.230
people that are coming in.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:27.289
And the numbers are growing.

00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:31.750
Every time I hit that refresh button, I'm
psyched to see thousands more people that

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.419
are hopping onboard there.

00:24:33.419 --> 00:24:34.899
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:24:34.899 --> 00:24:41.830
So, at Google, we're awkward people, kinda
nerdy and all that stuff.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:42.830
[laughter]

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:43.830
So.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:44.830
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: What?

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:45.830
Are you awkward people?

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:46.830
I don't know.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:47.830
This place is kinda wacky, man.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.389
This is like, you got everything in here.

00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:51.960
I went down a slide a little while ago.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.960
[laughter]

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.850
And you got a pool that makes waves.

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:57.942
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And a lifeguard just in
case.

00:24:57.942 --> 00:24:59.160
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: You can live your whole life
right on here.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.250
You never even have to leave here.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.360
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: We were talking about that,
yeah.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.610
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: You guys should build robots
to have sex with.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:04.610
[laughter]

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:07.840
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: What are you implying?

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.090
That we need that?

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:14.429
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Well you know, 'cause there's
a lot of, you know, dorks.

00:25:14.429 --> 00:25:15.429
[laughter]

00:25:15.429 --> 00:25:18.980
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's what I'm saying.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.990
So, a lot of us need to learn how to break
the ice in certain situations.

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.990
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Yeah.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:27.009
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: A lot of people asked me
to ask you, can you give us your favorite

00:25:27.009 --> 00:25:30.690
joke or an easy joke that we can slide in
there?

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:31.690
[laughter]

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:32.690
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: No.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:33.690
[laughter]

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:34.690
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Please?

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:35.690
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: What about you?

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:36.779
Do you have any jokes?

00:25:36.779 --> 00:25:38.180
You said earlier that you had jokes.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.180
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.180
I'll try.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.390
I mean, you'll rate them for me.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:42.390
These are good.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:43.390
[laughter]

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:44.390
You ready?

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:45.390
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Go ahead.

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:46.390
[laughter]

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.399
You want me to give you an intro or something?

00:25:49.399 --> 00:25:50.399
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: No.

00:25:50.399 --> 00:25:52.419
Just take them on tour when you like these.

00:25:52.419 --> 00:25:54.929
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Whoa.

00:25:54.929 --> 00:25:55.929
Whoa.

00:25:55.929 --> 00:25:56.929
Whoa.

00:25:56.929 --> 00:25:57.929
[laughter]

00:25:57.929 --> 00:25:58.929
You gotta prove yourself here first.

00:25:58.929 --> 00:25:59.929
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Right.

00:25:59.929 --> 00:26:01.409
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: You gonna tell a joke or what?

00:26:01.409 --> 00:26:02.590
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.590
OK.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:04.590
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: All right.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:06.510
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Starting out simple.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:08.130
So, why don't lobsters like to--

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:09.490
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Wordy.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:10.490
[laughter]

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:11.490
I'm just kidding.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.559
I'm the king of wordy.

00:26:13.559 --> 00:26:14.919
So, it's good.

00:26:14.919 --> 00:26:15.919
Go ahead.

00:26:15.919 --> 00:26:18.100
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: These are short.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.769
Why don't lobsters like to share?

00:26:19.769 --> 00:26:24.590
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Why don't lobsters like to share?

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:33.700
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: 'Cause they're shellfish.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.529
[laughter]

00:26:35.529 --> 00:26:37.350
[clapping]

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:42.759
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: It's starting to feel good.

00:26:42.759 --> 00:26:43.759
[laughter]

00:26:43.759 --> 00:26:45.559
It's starting to feel right.

00:26:45.559 --> 00:26:47.623
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: You want another?

00:26:47.623 --> 00:26:50.830
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: You think that's gonna work in
front of Madison Square Garden?

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:51.830
[laughter]

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:52.899
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: You have the--.

00:26:52.899 --> 00:26:54.730
I've never actually been there.

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:58.840
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I'm going to think about it.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.840
[laughter]

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.840
Is that the protocol?

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.919
Is that the polite way to back away from--?

00:27:02.919 --> 00:27:05.760
I'm gonna give that some serious thought.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.279
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Don't tell me what you're
doing.

00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:13.929
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: We'll work on that bit.

00:27:13.929 --> 00:27:16.140
I'm trying so hard to let him down easy.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.140
[laughter]

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.140
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I got a laugh.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.470
I got at least two laughs.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:25.940
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: It was like a nervous, "I can't
believe he's saying that next to Dane Cook"

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:26.940
kind of laugh.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:31.110
Like, where they didn't know where to put
it, so you have to actually be like ah-haa.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.140
[laughter]

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.700
That's not a laugh.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.919
That's like a wince.

00:27:36.919 --> 00:27:37.919
[laughter]

00:27:37.919 --> 00:27:38.919
Ha-ha.

00:27:38.919 --> 00:27:43.110
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So help me out?

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.309
Or, what's my next--?

00:27:44.309 --> 00:27:47.980
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Is there a rule only open-toed
shoes here at Google?

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:48.980
I don't see.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.779
It's like the sandal capital of California.

00:27:50.779 --> 00:27:51.779
[laughter]

00:27:51.779 --> 00:27:53.840
Look at the bunions this guy's rocking.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.840
[laughter]

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.840
[clapping]

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.840
Good God.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.230
I'm gonna Google Earth your bunion.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:00.230
[laughter]

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:03.620
No, you did a good job.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.890
Good job.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:06.789
Let's keep going.

00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:08.059
Next question.

00:28:08.059 --> 00:28:09.970
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: What?

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:15.049
You're really not gonna tell us a joke?

00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:18.320
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I don't really know jokes.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.380
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Me neither.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.380
All right.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.380
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: No, I don't.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.029
I don't think people consider me a joke-teller.

00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:26.549
I tell stories and I basically just talk.

00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:31.019
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: How do you come up with
the stuff that you talk about on your days?

00:28:31.019 --> 00:28:35.320
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: You just experience stuff and
it goes in there.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:41.559
Like, I did this whole thing on a vicious
circle about my relationship that literally

00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:45.650
I was in at the time, where I was like getting
in these arguments with the girl.

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:49.190
And we got in a fight over stupid stuff like,
"I bought the noodles.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:50.860
Those are mine."

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.860
[laughter]

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.059
And I remember like, in the argument yelling,
"Those are mine.

00:28:55.059 --> 00:28:56.860
I bought those noodles."

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.860
Being like, "I have to put this in a routine."

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:00.860
[laughter]

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:05.620
I'm screaming about who bought noodles.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.470
And so you just realize.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:14.779
You actually, there was a huge chunk of my
formative years where I would just have like,

00:29:14.779 --> 00:29:16.179
"I'm in comedy mode today."

00:29:16.179 --> 00:29:20.650
And I would have my little notebook and I
would just go places I'd never been to live

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:23.770
life and do things and experience things I
never had.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:28.269
I'd go to a ghost town or I'd go to an amusement
park.

00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:31.720
I'd eat at a part of town that was sketchy
that I was nervous--.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:37.700
I would go places and look as a comedian and
try to live as a comedian.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:43.840
And then, as time goes on, you just start
to have that reaction to most things.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:49.299
There's really like a, and every comic is
different, but an indicator that you start

00:29:49.299 --> 00:29:54.230
to sense "this is funny and people will get
this."

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.279
Like, "This needs to be put out there.

00:29:56.279 --> 00:29:59.110
People will relate to this."

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.990
You just start to know.

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:06.279
And so it's always been really about just
collecting life and sharing it.

00:30:06.279 --> 00:30:08.350
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And you were saying earlier
that joke you have about bees.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:09.610
You said there was a funny story there.

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:10.759
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: A joke about bees?

00:30:10.759 --> 00:30:11.759
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Bees.

00:30:11.759 --> 00:30:12.759
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Bug bees?

00:30:12.759 --> 00:30:13.759
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Bug bees, yeah.

00:30:13.759 --> 00:30:14.759
Are you afraid of bees?

00:30:14.759 --> 00:30:16.570
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Well, no.

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.919
I did a joke where I said I would never wanna
be killed by--.

00:30:19.919 --> 00:30:22.370
I was thinking of ways I would never wanna
die.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:24.279
And I said I would never wanna get killed
by bees.

00:30:24.279 --> 00:30:25.309
And I did the routine.

00:30:25.309 --> 00:30:27.269
It was on my first CD.

00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:34.990
And then I was hiking one day, I was by myself,
and this strong breeze blew a swarm of bees

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:38.080
up over the canyon right into me.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.471
And I immediately went down to the ground
and all I could think of was, "I'm gonna get

00:30:41.471 --> 00:30:42.960
killed by my own act."

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.960
[laughter]

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:49.039
And I just knew every comic would just have
a field day if I actually got killed by my

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:50.039
own bees.

00:30:50.039 --> 00:30:51.039
But thanks for bringing that up.

00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:52.039
That was hilarious.

00:30:52.039 --> 00:30:54.220
[makes bomb dropping sound]
[laughter]

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:58.480
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I wanna give a chance for
people in the room to ask questions at that

00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.480
mic.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.220
So if you guys wanna start lining up if you
have questions.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.330
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Oh, this is like Oprah.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:03.330
[laughter]

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:04.809
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: While we're waiting for
that--

00:31:04.809 --> 00:31:06.289
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: People are gonna step on up?

00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:08.710
This guy's got a question over here.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:09.809
Just head on up to that mic.

00:31:09.809 --> 00:31:10.809
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Go to the mic.

00:31:10.809 --> 00:31:11.809
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Be careful.

00:31:11.809 --> 00:31:12.809
I got security everywhere.

00:31:12.809 --> 00:31:13.809
[laughter]

00:31:13.809 --> 00:31:14.809
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Seriously.

00:31:14.809 --> 00:31:15.809
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I'm not even kidding.

00:31:15.809 --> 00:31:16.809
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Hi.

00:31:16.809 --> 00:31:17.809
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Hi.

00:31:17.809 --> 00:31:18.809
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: My name is Jessica.

00:31:18.809 --> 00:31:19.809
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Jessica, how are you?

00:31:19.809 --> 00:31:20.809
It's nice to meet you.

00:31:20.809 --> 00:31:21.809
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: I'm great.

00:31:21.809 --> 00:31:22.809
How are you?

00:31:22.809 --> 00:31:23.809
I'm so excited to be here.

00:31:23.809 --> 00:31:24.809
Thank you for coming.

00:31:24.809 --> 00:31:25.809
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Absolutely.

00:31:25.809 --> 00:31:26.809
Where do I get one of those shirts, by the
way?

00:31:26.809 --> 00:31:27.809
I want a Google shirt.

00:31:27.809 --> 00:31:28.809
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: The Google Store.

00:31:28.809 --> 00:31:29.809
I can escort you after this if you'd like.

00:31:29.809 --> 00:31:30.809
[laughter]

00:31:30.809 --> 00:31:31.809
[applause]

00:31:31.809 --> 00:31:32.809
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: That's how you do it.

00:31:32.809 --> 00:31:33.809
[applause]

00:31:33.809 --> 00:31:35.139
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: So, that's a
yes, I'm taking it.

00:31:35.139 --> 00:31:36.889
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Yeah.

00:31:36.889 --> 00:31:41.490
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: So, I was wondering--

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:45.700
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Can we take a pontoon boat across
the Google River?

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.700
[laughter]

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.509
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Yes, we can do
that, too.

00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:50.720
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Maybe go by the Google leafy
glade?

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.840
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Have you seen
the conference bikes?

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:58.510
There's like an eight-person round bike and
we can take six friends and take a conference

00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:59.510
bike.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:00.510
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Oh, I heard about these.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:01.510
I would love to do this.

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:02.510
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: OK, great.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:03.510
So, I have two questions.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:04.510
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Wanna come on a conference bike?

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:05.510
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Sure.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:06.510
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Settle down.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.510
[laughter]

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.510
You're a maniac.

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:09.889
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: So, I have two
questions.

00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:13.080
One, what is your favorite of your skits to
perform?

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.169
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: The bee’s thing.

00:32:14.169 --> 00:32:15.480
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: The bees?

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.480
No, no, no.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.480
[laughter]

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.480
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Obviously.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.480
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: You have better
material than that.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.809
What's your favorite, like the best one you
think you have?

00:32:22.809 --> 00:32:25.769
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Um.

00:32:25.769 --> 00:32:29.710
[audience member shouting answers]

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:37.140
I think maybe, just because of the whole night
itself, the end of, or during Vicious Circle.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.270
'Cause that was in Boston.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:39.889
I did that at the Boston Garden.

00:32:39.889 --> 00:32:42.950
It was the biggest show I'd ever done to that
point.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:46.380
And I did a thing about an Atheist sneezing.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:53.549
And then this whole wild Aesop fable that
came out of this experience.

00:32:53.549 --> 00:32:56.840
And just performing that at my home town,
because you have to realize, I started in

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.620
Boston, I literally was playing Laundromats.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:02.320
I used to play a Laundromat where I'd take
a little Gorilla amp.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.419
I'd go in.

00:33:03.419 --> 00:33:04.419
I'd plug it in.

00:33:04.419 --> 00:33:09.710
I couldn't even afford a mic, but I had a
lapel mic from high school that I stole.

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:12.090
And it didn't even--.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.000
The clip had broken, so I had to hold.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.300
I couldn't even clip it.

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.870
I had to hold it like it was a Lilliputian
situation.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:20.419
And then I would tell jokes at this Laundromat.

00:33:20.419 --> 00:33:23.519
And there was one machine that I knew when
it kicked in it was gonna--.

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:26.771
So I had to time it with your load.

00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:27.940
I had a certain--.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:28.940
[laughter]

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.220
It's so sexual.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.880
That word is so sexual.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:33.880
[laughter]

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:34.880
It's so sexual.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.890
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Everything.

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:36.890
Everything.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:38.040
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Oh, God.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.210
And so I think doing that bit and in the moment.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.509
I'm very present when I perform as well.

00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:44.509
I look at people.

00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:49.629
I engage and I remember, like I can look at
that moment during the special and be like,

00:33:49.629 --> 00:33:50.629
"Wow.

00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:51.629
Look at this.

00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:53.499
I used to watch the Boston Celtics here.

00:33:53.499 --> 00:33:57.140
My dad and I would come in here and watch
games together.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:00.260
And I would fog out and dream about performing
here.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:04.570
“And I performed in front of five people
at a Laundromat who didn't give a shit.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:10.200
And now I'm performing in front of Boston
Garden and doing one of my favorite long-form

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.200
bits."

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:16.919
I was listening to a lot of Zeppelin before
I recorded that special, so I had all these

00:34:16.919 --> 00:34:18.579
nine minute long stories.

00:34:18.579 --> 00:34:21.139
So, that was probably a highlight moment.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:25.399
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: And if you weren't
a comedian, what is your dream job?

00:34:25.399 --> 00:34:26.399
[laughter]

00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:32.139
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Let me switch seats with this
motherfucker.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:34.940
[laughter]

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:39.260
Probably computer programming.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.260
[laughter]

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.950
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Relate to your audience.

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:45.780
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Um.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:51.290
But I actually always have loved design and
graphic design.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:52.290
Like, I learned all that.

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:54.639
On my album covers and stuff, I've created.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.200
So, probably something in that world.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.309
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Can I get a picture
with you?

00:34:58.309 --> 00:34:59.309
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Sure.

00:34:59.309 --> 00:35:00.309
[laughter]

00:35:00.309 --> 00:35:01.309
Right now?

00:35:01.309 --> 00:35:02.309
OK.

00:35:02.309 --> 00:35:03.309
[laughter]

00:35:03.309 --> 00:35:04.309
[applause]

00:35:04.309 --> 00:35:05.309
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: It's on video.

00:35:05.309 --> 00:35:06.309
[applause]

00:35:06.309 --> 00:35:07.309
It's on video.

00:35:07.309 --> 00:35:08.309
I got it.

00:35:08.309 --> 00:35:09.309
I'm a techie.

00:35:09.309 --> 00:35:10.309
All right.

00:35:10.309 --> 00:35:11.309
I got this.

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:20.180
[laughter and clapping]

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:29.700
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Woo.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:34.250
I might get laid at Google today.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:35.250
[laughter]

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:38.000
I never thought I would say that.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.869
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Conjugal visit.

00:35:39.869 --> 00:35:42.680
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: What's going on, brother?

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.960
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: What's up, Dane?

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.881
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: How are you doing?

00:35:47.881 --> 00:35:48.881
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Good, man.

00:35:48.881 --> 00:35:49.881
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: What's up, broham?

00:35:49.881 --> 00:35:50.881
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Hey, man.

00:35:50.881 --> 00:35:51.881
[laughter]

00:35:51.881 --> 00:35:52.881
Thank you for coming.

00:35:52.881 --> 00:35:53.881
Just piggybacking from what you said in the
last question, I'm also in the Laundromat

00:35:53.881 --> 00:35:54.881
phase of doing comedy.

00:35:54.881 --> 00:35:55.881
And so, thank you.

00:35:55.881 --> 00:35:56.881
It's great to see you.

00:35:56.881 --> 00:35:57.881
And I wanted to ask two things.

00:35:57.881 --> 00:36:01.590
How did you, during that time, how did you
keep your spirit from getting crushed?

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.059
And also,--

00:36:03.059 --> 00:36:04.520
[laughter]

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.240
what do you feel, how did you get what you
feel like was your first break?

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.630
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: First of all, your spirit must
get crushed.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:13.630
[laughter]

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:16.420
It is part of the journey, I think, with anything.

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:24.550
Of course, if you wanna be successful then
you learn from the most devastating, gut-wrenching,

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.800
humiliating--.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:34.410
There's certainly a lot, especially in entertainment,
because there's no rhyme or reason oftentimes.

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:37.550
The whole thing about "preparedness" and everything,
it really matters.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:43.329
Getting on stage more than the next guy so
that you have more abilities.

00:36:43.329 --> 00:36:48.310
For me, it was always about just having more
tools to be able to go to.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:49.800
My first CD comes out.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.490
"I don't think I knew enough language.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:53.740
“I need better jargon.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.000
I need to learn more words."

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.109
It's always about fine-tuning.

00:36:58.109 --> 00:37:09.400
And truly, letting those moments of unbelievable
frustration in and letting them come back

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.859
through your performance.

00:37:10.859 --> 00:37:16.380
Put it in there, all the aggravation, whatever
you can do to create a story.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:22.319
I remember driving back from Orono, Maine
one time in a crappy car that was on the verge

00:37:22.319 --> 00:37:23.380
of breaking down.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.230
And the guy, who was supposed to pay me, didn't
pay me.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:27.230
He left.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:28.559
So when I got off-stage, he wasn't there.

00:37:28.559 --> 00:37:29.559
So, I got screwed.

00:37:29.559 --> 00:37:31.480
I remember driving back and I was really--.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.690
I had no way of paying my rent.

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:37.570
I just remember driving home and being like,
"OK.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:38.570
You know what?

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.859
I just have to become more business-minded.

00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:47.059
I have to learn that side of it so that I
can know who this guy is before I deal with

00:37:47.059 --> 00:37:48.650
it before I even get there."

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:53.280
You have to, in anything you do, know your
enemy.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.480
Know your abilities.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.999
And go for it, man.

00:37:57.999 --> 00:37:59.250
You really have to--.

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:01.430
You can't half-ass this if you're gonna do
it.

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:05.780
You gotta really get out there and hustle.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:06.869
And the second question was?

00:38:06.869 --> 00:38:09.410
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Like what you felt
like was your first break?

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:12.040
Maybe not like, your Premium Blend.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.319
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Oh.

00:38:14.319 --> 00:38:19.040
Well, I was coming up in Boston and there
was a lot of really incredible comedians that

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.470
had--.

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:22.550
You know the Big Boom of comedy was like,
the 80s.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:26.859
That's when Seinfeld’s and Rosanne’s and
everybody exploded.

00:38:26.859 --> 00:38:28.000
I started in 1990.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.579
And so, it was like I was starting at the
end of the Boom.

00:38:32.579 --> 00:38:37.590
So, all these guys that maybe hadn't made
it in Hollywood came back to Boston.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:42.860
So, I was opening for mega-stars; people you
will never know, but that are still to me

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:48.100
some of the funniest people that I've ever
had the privilege of working with, under.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:53.200
And so, night after night for several years,
I was working with these guys.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:58.720
And I remember one time Kevin Knox was this
just powerhouse comedian.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.309
He would give a 100% even if there was one
person in the crowd.

00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:05.710
And I remember he gave me one of my first
headlining gigs.

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:10.700
And the joke that I wrote and opened with
on that gig--.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:16.710
Zoey Freedman, who used to book Letterman,
saw it and because of this one bit, it was

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:22.210
actually the Speak and Spell bit that I used
to do, that bit changed my life.

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:27.789
That one routine became part of this nostalgic
thing I was doing about youth and games.

00:39:27.789 --> 00:39:36.260
And it really was like the beginning of structure
in my writings.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:41.579
So, Kevin Knox changed my career by giving
me the headlining gig that Zoey Freedman attended

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:45.030
and said, "How would you like your first late
night spot on Letterman?"

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:46.030
Yeah,

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:47.990
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Thank you.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.690
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: You're welcome.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:51.800
Good luck to you, man.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.570
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Thank you.

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:54.570
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I'll see you at work.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:55.570
[clapping]

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:56.570
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: How's it going,
Dane?

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:57.570
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: What's going on, man?

00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:58.570
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Not a lot.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:39:59.570
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I gotta get outta here, but thanks
for--

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:00.570
[laughter]

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:04.720
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: It's been good.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.720
You've watched--

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.720
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: What's your name?

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.720
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Jesse.

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.720
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Jesse.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.720
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Thanks.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:10.720
You've watched the rise and fall of a couple
of social networks.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.720
Most recently obviously, MySpace is pretty
heavy downward slide.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.720
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Yeah.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.720
I destroyed that.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.200
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: But it actually
had a lot of great performer and entertainer-friendly

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.200
features.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.200
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Sure.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.220
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Is there anything
you're gonna lament the most of out that loss?

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:21.630
Is there anything you're looking forward to
in the future of social networking with entertainment?

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:27.390
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Well, I think that obviously,
immediacy is always great, to be able to have

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:28.440
that immediate connection.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.090
That's what any performer wants.

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:31.090
You want that.

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:38.300
That's why with Twitter, the Twitter version
for a comedian, the retweet is like an applause

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.300
break.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:43.670
You ask any comic, they're gonna go and look
at their at replies and if you get a lot of

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:44.670
retweets that's like, "Wow.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:46.610
OK, that joke killed.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.250
People are really digging it."

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:53.540
I think that what I'd like to see more of
and what was really great about today was

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:59.460
I wanna be able to learn to take my social
networking sites, coupled with my DaneCook

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:03.210
dot com, and I wanna turn it into a studio.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:08.980
I wanna be able to create an environment with
other artists.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:13.059
That's the next phase of my career and as
I'm rebuilding, 'cause I'm gonna re-launch

00:41:13.059 --> 00:41:17.930
DaneCook dot com and really make it an artists'
portal 'cause I love art.

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:18.930
I paint.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:19.930
I do music.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:24.010
I have other interests besides just stand-up
and I wanna be able to showcase those.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:27.830
But instead of just like, "Hey, look at all
the stuff I do," why not team up and partner

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:29.609
up with other artists.

00:41:29.609 --> 00:41:37.380
Then, to be able to use circles or any kind
of instant video access to say, "Hey, I met

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.319
this incredible artist named Niki Sabet."

00:41:39.319 --> 00:41:42.540
She creates these unbelievable sculptures.

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.401
What if I go over with her one day and she's
teaching me 'cause I'm interested in that

00:41:46.401 --> 00:41:47.990
and I wanna continue to do that?

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:51.869
Then we can do a live broadcast.

00:41:51.869 --> 00:41:54.680
She's earning new fans 'cause you've never
heard of her.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.671
I'm getting to show off another side of my
creativity, which I need to do if I wanna

00:41:57.671 --> 00:41:58.671
not be stagnant.

00:41:58.671 --> 00:42:00.270
Win, win, win, all across.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:07.500
So, I look forward to creating more of a living
environment to the best of our ability.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.660
Because it's like texting.

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.490
You can only text so much before you lose
emotion.

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:16.720
How many times have you texted somebody and
you start to just--.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.380
It becomes like this vacuum.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:21.730
It just doesn't have the depth.

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:29.330
And so, I'm trying to take it away from just
posting and more of like, social and live

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:30.330
aspects.

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:34.970
So, that's the next incarnation of what I'd
like to see happening more with Google Plus

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:37.079
and things that I'm incorporated with.

00:42:37.079 --> 00:42:42.440
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Any other comedians
or rising comedians you think you're up to

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.960
keeping an eye out for?

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.930
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I don't really care for any of
the others.

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:48.930
[laughter]

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:50.440
I mean, the guys that--.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.570
Every comic has a graduating class.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:56.900
We all break with people and the guys that
I broke with like, Gary Gulman and Bill Burr

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:01.059
and Patrice O'Neal and Robert Kelly and Al
Del Bene.

00:43:01.059 --> 00:43:07.710
These are the guys: Ben Gleib, Chris Army,
Chris Newberg; these are like the guys that

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:08.710
make me laugh.

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:09.710
They're my friends.

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:10.740
We went through the--.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.829
You laugh more at those guys too when you
go through the struggles and you really know

00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:16.819
what it is to dedicate your--.

00:43:16.819 --> 00:43:17.819
I can say this.

00:43:17.819 --> 00:43:22.350
Anybody who chooses to be a performer and
entertainer, it's like, you deserve to win.

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:23.350
You really do.

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:27.069
If you really are putting the time and the
sacrifice that it takes, I like to see people

00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:28.069
win.

00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:29.069
I wanna see people win.

00:43:29.069 --> 00:43:33.819
That's why I'd like to create an environment
where I can see more people get a shot at

00:43:33.819 --> 00:43:35.000
winning with their abilities.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.480
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Cool.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.480
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Yeah.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.480
See ya.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.480
[laughter]

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.480
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Hi.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.480
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Hi.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.210
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: We got some rapid
fire questions.

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.119
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: What are you two gonna go?

00:43:45.119 --> 00:43:47.650
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Well.

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:48.650
[laughter]

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:49.650
OK, rapid fire questions.

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:50.650
Ready?

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:51.650
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Oh, my God.

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.290
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: New York or LA?

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:55.290
Rapid fire.

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:56.460
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Rapid fire.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:57.460
OK.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:58.460
LA.

00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.460
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Beach or mountains?

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:00.460
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Oh, beach.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.460
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: BO or bad breath?

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:02.460
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Bad breath.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:03.460
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER $4: Me or her?

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:04.460
[laughter]

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:05.460
Just kidding.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.460
I'm married.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:07.460
Her.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:08.460
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Them.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:11.470
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: Lastly, Facebook
or Google?

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:13.030
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Google.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:16.150
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Thank you.

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:19.270
Can she give you a hug?

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:20.270
[applause]

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:22.790
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I see big things for this little
company.

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:23.910
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: She wants a hug.

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:31.890
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: You gonna come up and give me
a hug?

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:32.890
[laughter]

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:35.020
Oh, you smell fantastic.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:36.170
[laughter]

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:37.860
Ah, the smell of Google.

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:38.860
[laughter]

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:39.860
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: We all smell like that.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:43.540
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I signed a contract to say that
a hundred times today.

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:44.540
Hi, hello.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:45.540
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Hi.

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.540
Apurna.

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:47.540
My name is Apurna.

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:48.540
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Apurna?

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:49.540
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Apurna.

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:50.540
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Apurna.

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:51.540
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: A couple of questions.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:52.980
One is if you were to do--

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.510
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Everybody has a couple questions,
which I love.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:55.510
[laughter]

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:56.849
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: We sneak them
in.

00:44:56.849 --> 00:45:04.190
The first question is if you were to do an
infomercial, what product would you do an

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:06.400
infomercial for?

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.510
[laughter]

00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:11.720
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: What's your second question?

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.720
[laughter]

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.140
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Who is your favorite
comic?

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.140
Like, living or dead?

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:19.380
Phil Hartman, that you love today.

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:24.369
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I'm still thinking of the first
one.

00:45:24.369 --> 00:45:27.569
Definitely Steve Martin.

00:45:27.569 --> 00:45:29.520
Steve Martin was like--.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:33.130
My sister, Kelly, went and saw Steve Martin
perform at Madison Square Garden.

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.130
I was 15.

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:37.990
And she came home and she was like, I remember
the look on my sister Kelly's face.

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:43.770
And she sat down with me and said, "I can't
believe I just saw this one guy standing in

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:44.770
front of--."

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:48.960
And I said to my sister Kelly, "Someday I'm
gonna perform at Madison Square Garden."

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:52.740
And again, knowing how shy I was and really
what that meant for me to be saying that,

00:45:52.740 --> 00:46:02.460
was a big deal 'cause I was not, you know,
I didn't have any of the telling signs of

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.040
performing and all that stuff.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.859
But it was her seeing Steve Martin.

00:46:05.859 --> 00:46:07.579
And then I just became infatuated.

00:46:07.579 --> 00:46:08.860
And I wanted to emulate Steve Martin.

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:12.070
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Can you do an
impression of him?

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:14.050
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I can do like--.

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:15.050
[laughter]

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:19.770
I used to do that around my house.

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:26.000
But I finally had an opportunity to meet him
about a year and a half ago.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.630
And he sent me a copy of his book.

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:30.490
And he wrote something really wonderful in
it.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:31.790
It's an amazing comedy book.

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:32.960
It's called "Born Standing Up."

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:38.369
If you wanna know really the life of a comic,
then he nails it.

00:46:38.369 --> 00:46:43.590
And I got to sit with him and thank him, really,
and just tell him how appreciative I was.

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:45.010
And he didn't care for me.

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.010
[laughter]

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:50.160
And the first one?

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.160
Yeah.

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.160
ShamWow.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.160
I like that Sham--.

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.160
No, no.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.160
The chop thing.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.160
I would wanna sell one of those chop things.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.160
I'm obsessed.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.160
I love those chop whatever.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.160
You put anything in and chop it on up.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.160
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Thanks.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.819
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I met that guy.

00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:03.980
He's like a billionaire.

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:04.980
Chop chop guy.

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:05.980
Thank you.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:06.980
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: How's it going,
Dane?

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:07.980
I'm David.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:08.980
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: What's going on, man?

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:09.980
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: I was wondering
if you had any new material that you're working

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:10.980
on for an upcoming show.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:15.400
And if so, you could share a story or two
with us now.

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:19.880
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I'm just starting to tinker.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:24.720
I came off tour in February and it was a two-year
tour.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.940
I did over a hundred.

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:31.000
I wanted to do an arena tour and I did a hundred
arenas through the US and Canada.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:38.410
And it was, I had this idea of, "I wanna do
like a Metallica type, epic, huge tour."

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:44.059
I brought young comics that were breaking
out of the--.

00:47:44.059 --> 00:47:47.109
I wanted to introduce them to my fans basically
and stuff.

00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:48.109
So, yeah.

00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:52.940
I just basically put everything I could into
that couple of years and now I'm starting

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.880
to write and work on the new material.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.680
So, nothing that I have that's like--.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.920
I just gotta get back to the club.

00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.920
That's the other thing, too.

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.780
It all starts back in that little club.

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:03.410
You gotta go right back to the beginning.

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:07.840
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: What's the craziest
thing that's happened to you in the past month?

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.920
[laughter]

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.180
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Um.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.270
[laughter]

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:16.250
The craziest thing that's happened to me?

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:17.250
I don't know.

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:22.440
It's been a really relaxing summer, actually,
for the first time in a long time.

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.440
It's weird.

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.790
I've never taken time off.

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:25.790
I've never--.

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:27.010
I've been doing stand-up 22 years.

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:30.410
I've never taken more than maybe a couple
of weeks off, tops.

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:32.799
And so, to take a few months off is like bonkers.

00:48:32.799 --> 00:48:36.490
So, the craziest thing I've done is nothing.

00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:37.490
That's crazy to me.

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:41.809
I can't believe that I'm actually like, relaxing
and taking a little time.

00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:49.329
But I got some ideas for the next what I think
will be an interesting new kind of approach

00:48:49.329 --> 00:48:54.901
to how I wanna see stand-up go and how I'd
like to evolve with it and try something new.

00:48:54.901 --> 00:48:55.930
It's always about trying something new.

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:56.930
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: Awesome.

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:57.930
Well, please come back to Google.

00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:58.930
Thank you.

00:48:58.930 --> 00:48:59.930
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Oh, cool man.

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:00.930
Thank you.

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:01.930
[applause]

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:02.930
Appreciate it.

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:03.930
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: Hey, Dane.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:04.930
Andy Mathis.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:05.930
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Hey, Andy.

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:07.990
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: Thanks for joining
us here.

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:09.280
So you were extremely shy.

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.280
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Yeah.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:14.180
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: How did you, what
was that time where you just committed yourself

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:19.319
to get over the threshold and just get in
front of somebody and be willing to maybe

00:49:19.319 --> 00:49:20.840
humiliate yourself or not?

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:27.910
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: I joined drama when I was in
10th Grade.

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:35.579
And I met probably the greatest influence
of my life, my mentor, and just one of the

00:49:35.579 --> 00:49:36.980
greatest human beings I'll ever know.

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.050
His name was Frank Roberts.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:43.960
He passed away, unfortunately, a couple of
years ago of a stroke.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.410
Sixty-nine years old.

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:49.290
But the guy was just a powerhouse of encouragement.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:54.260
And I remember he pulled me aside after the
first class, the first day of class.

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.289
I couldn't believe I even joined because I
was just such a wreck.

00:49:57.289 --> 00:50:02.170
And he pulled me aside and he looked at me
and he said, "I see a lot of myself in you.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:04.510
I see a lot of your fear.

00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:09.400
And based on the few things that you said
today when I interviewed the class, I would

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.270
like to help you.

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:16.030
And if you would come in every day before
school, at like 7 AM, I'm gonna read plays

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:17.030
with you."

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:18.579
Like, this, at the end of that first class.

00:50:18.579 --> 00:50:19.770
And I was like, "He's trying to molest me.

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:20.770
He's gotta be trying."

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:21.770
[uproarious laughter]

00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:23.890
And I was so bored and shy.

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:25.710
And I was like, "Maybe I'll just go for it."

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:27.349
[laughter and clapping]

00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:33.819
I'll let him bat it around a little bit.

00:50:33.819 --> 00:50:35.289
[laughter]

00:50:35.289 --> 00:50:38.049
Frank Roberts, I wouldn't be sitting in this
seat.

00:50:38.049 --> 00:50:42.510
As much as my family was, my mother was just
my compass.

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:44.670
I always call my mom my compass.

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:48.069
She's like the commentary to my DVD extras.

00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:49.220
[laughter]

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:52.609
My dad was like the "don't tell me, show me"
kind of guy.

00:50:52.609 --> 00:50:56.910
He was tough and he didn't stand for the fantastical
ideas.

00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:58.789
He wanted to see the proof.

00:50:58.789 --> 00:51:04.890
But Frank Roberts, he really brought out the
artist in me.

00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:13.670
And he made have the ability to say, "I wanna
entertain.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.510
I am an entertainer."

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:18.290
Whereas I didn't think I'd ever be able to
truly say that.

00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:19.830
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: Awesome.

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:20.830
Thank you.

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:21.830
Thanks, I really appreciate it.

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:22.830
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Thanks very much.

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:23.830
You got it.

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:36.470
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Well, thank you very much
for being here.

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:41.870
&gt;&gt;Dane Cook: Yeah, definitely.

00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:43.220
[applause]

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:44.220
You did it, baby.

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.220
You did it.

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:46.220
You guys can go.

00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:47.220
This is our time now.

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:48.220
It's Google time.

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:49.220
Plus me.

00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:50.220
It gets weird when they stop clapping, doesn't
it?

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:51.220
[laughter]

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.220
Now it's just awkward.

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:53.220
Thank you, really.

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:54.599
Thank you for taking some time, everybody,
and welcoming me today.

00:51:54.599 --> 00:51:55.809
I appreciate it.

00:51:55.809 --> 00:51:56.619
All right.
