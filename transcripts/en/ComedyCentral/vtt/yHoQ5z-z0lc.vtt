00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.069
Now, today we were planning on

00:00:03.102 --> 00:00:06.239
doing one of our Voter Voices
segments, uh, but instead,

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:07.440
I'd like to take a moment
to assure everyone

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:09.609
that killer clowns are not real.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.644
They are a manifestation
of our anxiety.

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:13.146
People are super freaked out
by the election.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.314
Some goobers are taking
that anxiety

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:16.816
and they're just bringing it
into the real world.

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.618
They're trolling us all.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.753
And in a way, aren't they kind
of holding up a mirror

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:23.256
to society and reflecting
where we're at right now?

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.425
This sort of grotesque,
painted figure

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.860
that's darker than it seems
beneath the surface.

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:31.297
But I promise you, there is no
such thing as a murder clown.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.132
Yes, there is!

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:35.268
Jesus (bleep) Christ!

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:36.302
(evil laugh)

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:37.737
Hello!

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.707
(laughing):
I'm Giggles the Murder Clown.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.976
(evil laugh)
Giggles.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.179
You're real? What the...?

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:49.649
Ooh, yes, I'm real, Chris.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:53.853
And boy, oh, boy,
do I love murder.

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:55.555
(horn toots)

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:58.724
(applause)

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:00.993
(snickers)

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:03.396
First of all,
I think white face is wrong.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.365
-And...
-(laughter)

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:12.271
You're, you're not
gonna kill us, are you?

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:14.607
Probably not. Uh-uh.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.311
Hey... you want to smell
my flower?

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:19.312
No.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.847
It's full of human blood.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.948
All right.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:23.850
Oh! That's...

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:25.651
(laughing):
Giggles.

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:28.221
Why... Why are you here?

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:32.792
Oh, Chris, because this election
is very important.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:35.995
And I just want to make sure
our voices are heard.

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:40.600
Now I'm not here only on behalf
of murder clowns, okay?

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:45.171
I'm also here for thieving
magicians, loitering acrobats,

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:49.742
jugglers that are cannibalistic,
and Scientologists.

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:51.177
(applause)

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.045
HARDWICK:
Okay.

00:01:53.078 --> 00:01:55.781
Yeah.
Hey, hey.

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:58.451
If you don't vote,
you don't count.

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:02.555
Okay, so I assume, because
you're a violent psychopath

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:05.124
trying to sow chaos,
you're voting for Trump.

00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:06.692
Oh, no way, man.

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:09.595
He scares the (bleep) out of me.

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:11.764
-Seriously?
-Yeah, yeah.

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:13.266
Look, Chris, look.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.136
The-the paint on my face may be
rendered from the human fat

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.439
and kidney blood of my victims,
but I'm not crazy.

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:21.507
No, no, no, no.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.476
I am with her!

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.611
All right, uh...

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:27.446
Yeah.

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.615
I mean...

00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:32.451
That's why we're popping up
everywhere lately--

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:34.687
-to get out the vote.
-Oh.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.424
Just look at this map
of clowns being seen

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:40.593
from Atlas Obscura, huh?

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:42.895
We got Florida, Ohio,

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:44.497
Pennsylvania,

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.999
swing states, huh?

00:02:47.032 --> 00:02:49.902
But also, we clowns
feel comfortable there

00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:51.871
because they remind us of hell.

00:02:51.904 --> 00:02:55.641
Well, okay, okay, this is
shedding a lot of light on this.

00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:57.610
So, the murder clown thing
is all about voting,

00:02:57.643 --> 00:03:00.179
but why are you
luring kids into the woods?

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:01.814
Oh, boy, it's called

00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:04.951
grassroots campaigning, Chris.

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:07.086
You lure a kid into the woods,

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.922
tie them up,
wave around a chain saw,

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:12.692
boom-- another vote for Hillary.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:14.260
-Wh... I don't...
-Yeah!

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:15.361
No, hang on, though--

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:16.862
what about this footage
of a clown

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:19.799
going up to some random person's
door, brandishing a machete?

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:22.635
Okay, door-to-door
canvassing, Chris.

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:24.237
Come on.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.138
You knock on the door,

00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:29.442
you break in, you hide
in the attic for 15 years,

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:31.344
coming out only at night,

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.846
staring over the children
while they sleep

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.214
and breathing in their breath,

00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:38.117
boom-- another vote for Hillary.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.352
Okay.

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:42.822
-(horn honking)
-I get it, okay, I get it.

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.890
-(laughs)
-So, then I guess this footage

00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:46.559
of a clown chasing joggers
through a park

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:48.160
was just about
getting them to vote?

00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:51.264
Oh, no, actually, we murdered
the (bleep) out of those guys.

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:53.866
-Oh.
-Yeah, yeah.

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:55.968
But the point is

00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:58.304
everyone needs
to get out there and vote.

00:03:58.337 --> 00:04:00.373
Hey, as scary as we are,

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:03.442
we are nowhere near as bad

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:05.177
as Donald Trump, okay?

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.047
-(whooping, cheering)
-Thank you, thank you.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.716
I never... I never, ever...

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.286
I never thought I,
a murder clown,

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.720
would be saying this,

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:17.790
but please don't vote
for the psychopath

00:04:17.823 --> 00:04:21.360
who has fake hair
and an orange face. Please!

00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:23.129
-Please! -All right,
Giggles the Clown, everyone.

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:26.633
Voter Voices. These are people
from your community.

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:30.536
-It...
-(echoing): (Giggles laughs)

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.502
Where the (bleep) did she go?
