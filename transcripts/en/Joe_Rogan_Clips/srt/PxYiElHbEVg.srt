1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,540
Are So opposite because I've only
been in one fight in my life.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,610
It was in ninth grade playing basketball
and it was against a dude named Matama.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,640
Like I'll never forget,
his name is Matama Drake.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,940
And I threw one punch and I hit him
right in the face and he looks at me and

5
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:18,110
goes, what's up? And I was,

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,380
oh no.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,630
[inaudible] know.

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,020
Like, oh, we're good. Oh my God, you

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,820
get away with it. Oh yeah, we'd start
playing bass. Thank God. Like that was it.

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,440
Like literally I hit him as hard as
I could. I could take a shot. Oh.

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,870
And it was just like, what's up? I
was like, nothing. Nothing is up.

12
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:44,670
So that's the only time that you
back? No. Wow. No, cause I, I,

13
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:46,320
then I started, you know, oh you okay.

14
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:51,210
It's your ball man did not try to
get you back. I mean, and then I,

15
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:55,560
I was, there was a club in Houston named
power tools that I used to a gay bar. No,

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,380
w no, no, no. It to be right.
Yeah. It sounds like one
that was hardcore gay bars.

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,150
Houston,
the gay bar was called riches at the time,

18
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,030
but I worked at power
tools and I was a bouncer.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,850
So that's when I was like
250 pounds, you know? Uh,

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,670
you are a lot bigger when I met you.
Oh yeah.

21
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:15,270
Cause I played college football for
Arkansas, so I played outside linebacker.

22
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:19,430
So I was just stop lifting weights
or do you still put a little bit? No,

23
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,080
I'm all cardio now because yeah,
like trainers,

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,380
any trainer I work with since I got a
big frame or like what puts him said no,

25
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:29,370
I want to stay lean. Right. You know,
but it's good for old age to man.

26
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:33,510
You don't want to have back problems in
44 years old now. Yeah. I'm a crazy dude.

27
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,890
Two time flies.

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,400
51 see what 55 zero two in is so scary
when you read stories about people just

29
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,620
dropping dead too, like around her age.
Luke Perry. That's what I'm saying.

30
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,470
Mason Lee my age. Well, they said what?

31
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:52,230
What is the danger zone is like
45 to 55 with heart failure.

32
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,700
It's like cry in. Oh Man.
Did I beat my body up.

33
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,310
I'm running that bitch until
the fuck his wheels fall off.

34
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,890
I'm always getting stem cell shots and
I'll fucking run in hills and lifting

35
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,570
weights. I still live
heavyweights retarded. Yeah.
Why don't you tell that word?

36
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,000
Set it again. Trying to get that rid
of that word out of my vocabulary.

37
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:14,550
It just comes out sometimes. Why?
Why are you still lifting weights?

38
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,040
Like heavy like that?
Like what does it do for you?

39
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,000
Well it does a bunch of things. First
of all, if you want to train Jujitsu,

40
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,040
it's very good to be strong. Yeah, it
makes a big difference. First of all,

41
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:27,750
for defense, especially for defense,
you know like for offense for sure too,

42
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,120
but really you want to
be able to defend you.

43
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,510
Like defending is you have to be strong
but also you just like being bigger.

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,440
It helps. Yeah, I like it. Yeah. I
like being able to pick up things.

45
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:40,690
I liked the physical ability of beans
for, I liked being in shape too. Yeah.

46
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,630
Like being able to run for long distances.

47
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,910
I like knowing that I
can go rounds on the bag,

48
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,590
like I'll do fives hard rounds
on the back so you can run it on.

49
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:51,390
My knees are messed up.
I can't like get on a treadmill and raw.

50
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:54,660
I can do like I've done the stem and
the knee and it's helped out a lot,

51
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,140
but I'm still that dude that's on,
I'm like on the super fortunate.

52
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:02,110
I'm super fortunate. My
knee injuries, I've had knee
injuries, but um, my meniscus,

53
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,620
I only had one meniscus scope on my
left knee and it wasn't terrible.

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,210
Like I was back to full 100% function
after that. And my right knee, I didn't,

55
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,910
I have a little baby tear that
I've got some stem cell shot into,

56
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:16,240
but I had both of them reconstructed.
Their ACL were replaced,

57
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,830
but I'm no problems. They work, they
work great. Yeah. See, I just need to,

58
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,810
I listened to you and I, it's like you
always taken something and I'm like, Oh,

59
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:29,530
I've got to find out what that is and
now just want to get in better shape.

60
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,700
I'm in shape, but I, it's when you get
older it's just like tough. It is just,

61
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,780
it just key is writing it down
like you have to do it. Like do,

62
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,600
do you keep a daily schedule
off? Shit, you have to do it? No,

63
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,840
I just wake up and go.
I do have, I wake up,

64
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,590
I work out like a cardio workout
and then I do infrared sauna,

65
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,720
which has changed my life.
Changed Your Life, right?

66
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:53,710
Every morning I infrared sauna for now.
It's the best.

67
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,350
You sweat all that shit out.
You're like, you feel great.

68
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,350
Your skin glistens like I think it's
actually like changed the game for me.

69
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:05,800
I have more energy now. Everything's
better. It's so good for your body.

70
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,400
They did a study that showed
a 40% decrease in mortality,

71
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,360
mortality amongst all causes,
heart attack, stroke, cancer,

72
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:17,320
40% decrease with people that were
doing the sauna four times a week. Well,

73
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:21,220
I will tell you this because the whole
thing is everybody wants to feel young

74
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,660
and when you were young,

75
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,090
the thing you did most of sweat and I
feel like when I sweat, it just it's,

76
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,660
it feels,
I don't know,

77
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,350
I just feel good sweating because he
reminds me of when I played sports.

78
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:34,870
It reminds me even though I'm
not doing on the, you know,

79
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:37,600
I sweat a little on the treadmill,
but when I do that infrared,

80
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,530
it makes me feel great. Mom, I think
there's a bunch of shit going on,

81
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,230
but there's that. Yeah, for
sure. Like it's good to feel
good, like you're sweating,

82
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,090
but there's heat shock proteins.

83
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,730
Your body actually produces
anti inflammatory properties.

84
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:49,930
It's really good for you.

85
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,650
It's really good for joint aches
and all kinds of like this.

86
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,250
I used to think of the song as
being nonsense. Like what do you,

87
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:57,250
what do you fucking lane in
the Sauna for liquidity doing?

88
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:59,810
They're just getting hot school workout,
post workout.

89
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,700
What kind of sauna do you do though?
I do a regular song. Okay. Super Hot.

90
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,630
Regular Simon telling you you need to
try the infrared. It's Ken. Yeah. I mean,

91
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:09,730
but look, it's all just about
getting your body, Huh? Yeah.

92
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,520
Like it's good to try to infrared.
I'm sure. I'm sure it works great.

93
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:16,540
But this study, the 40%
decrease in mortality, that
was with a regular storm saw.

94
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,900
Okay. Yeah. That's why I got a
regular sauna because a doctor,

95
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,810
Rhonda Patrick told me that,
okay,

96
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,840
the studies that have been done have all
been done with a regular sauna and she

97
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:27,840
said there might be some
benefit for infrared on it,

98
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:32,430
but I don't know what's published. What
is, see if there's a benefit. See if this,

99
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:35,260
they can say what's the benefit
to infrared cooking my organs.

100
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:37,240
I don't even know it.
No, I don't think so. No,

101
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,110
I think it's great for just feel amazing
afterwards. Supposedly what happens,

102
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:42,810
right? It gets deeper in
your tissue or something.

103
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:45,910
Like it's supposed to go deeper inside.
I remember I was texting back and forth.

104
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:49,930
I was like, you gotta like if you do
the infrared sauna for like a week,

105
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,170
it's a game changer. It just
is too. So I don't know.

106
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:56,380
I would like you to try regular sauna to,
how hot does the infrared get?

107
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,360
A like 140 140 minutes by heating the air
though too. It's a difference. It's not,

108
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,700
it doesn't heat the air.
It's like you walk in and it feels,

109
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,240
it doesn't feel like it's that, but that's
just weird. That's your microwave shit.

110
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,160
None of that, man. It's like hot pockets.
Can you turn them into a hot pocket?

111
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,810
That's what I'm saying. I probably
burned it up all my organs right now,

112
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,170
but I don't know. I love it. I like
coming in and feeling that superheat.

113
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,020
You go in there and you're
like, oh, it feels so good.
