00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.610
We'd love to hear your thoughts on the dichotomy of honest self expression

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.140
versus normal face and or passion versus discipline.

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.430
Uh,
if you aren't caught up on all the podcasts,
normal faces game.

4
00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:16.390
I used to play with my kids where they would have to keep an expressionless face

5
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.370
or what I call the normal face,
good game by the way.
And you,

6
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.100
I would line up my kids and they would have to keep that face and then if they

7
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.160
change their expression anyway,
I would hit them in the head with a,

8
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.990
with the inside cardboard role of a thing of wrapping paper.

9
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.981
And,

10
00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:36.520
or I had eventually made like foam pieces for it because they were a little bit

11
00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:40.630
more durable and,
and you could hit really hard and it wouldn't hurt at all.

12
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.440
So anyways,
I know it sounds like you should call child services on me,

13
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.370
but it's fun game to play because as you hit one kid that makes the other kids

14
00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:50.470
laugh and then you ended up hitting them all and everyone's laughing and it's

15
00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:51.580
fun.
So,

16
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.990
and there's also a pragmatic reason to do it because it teaches people to

17
00:00:57.341 --> 00:01:01.150
control their emotions and there are times,

18
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.540
there are many times where you have to learn to control your emotions and as

19
00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:06.400
kids,
if you learn to control your emotions,

20
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.770
it's going to be beneficial for you in many ways.

21
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.850
What does that mean that you should keep a normal face all the time?

22
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.100
Never show emotions.
No,
it's not like that at all.
There's like everything else.

23
00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:22.120
There's a dichotomy that you have to balance.
If your kid wins a wrestling match,

24
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.400
you should be happy and great and smiling.
Yeah,
I five right.
That's cool.

25
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.280
If you bite

26
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.990
into a amazing piece of prime rib that your wife cooked for you,

27
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.340
then you should raise your fist to the air and say,
yes,

28
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.860
my wife,
the first time she ever cooked primary,
she,
she,
she,
we didn't know this,

29
00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:54.090
but she has a talent.
She knows she cooks dry chicken prime ribs.

30
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:55.000
She knocks it out of the park.

31
00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.130
First time she ever cooked prime rib and I took my,

32
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:03.970
I smelled amazing.
I was like,
Oh,
this is,
I took my first bite.

33
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.050
I looked at her and I looked up at her and I said,
I want to revamp,

34
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.420
redo our vows from marriage,
renew,

35
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.040
renew the vows.
So yes,
um,
you know,
scenarios like that.
Yeah.

36
00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:21.370
You want to show your emotions and if here's something,

37
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.800
if your team slacks off

38
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.310
and if you fail the mission,
you fail the task.
Of course you're going to own it.

39
00:02:30.311 --> 00:02:31.480
But you might,
you know,

40
00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:35.410
you might want to show a little anger about what happened so that everyone knows

41
00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:39.160
like,
oh,
who's chocolate doesn't normally get mad and he's mad.

42
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.800
And so we really did something bad.
And you know,

43
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.040
even though you're blaming herself,
like I can't believe,
I'd like to doubt.

44
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.900
You know what I mean?
Like you show a little bit that people go,
okay,

45
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.840
<v 1>yeah.</v>

46
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.090
<v 0>So there you're going to show you,
most of you,
if you get bad and we'll,</v>

47
00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:54.570
if you get news that,
that,
you know,
you've got a friend that died,

48
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.180
we knew that you've got to let those emotions out.

49
00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:01.540
There's all kinds of situations where emotions are not only acceptable,

50
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:03.970
but they're needed and they're required.
And in fact,

51
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.020
if you don't have emotions in those situations,

52
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.480
that's horrible.
You need to have them not only as a person,
as a human being,

53
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:16.840
you need to let out your emotions sometimes.
But as a leader,

54
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.910
if you don't show any emotions at all,
no one's going to follow you.

55
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:26.440
There is no connection between you and the people on your team.

56
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.210
And if you ever,

57
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.860
if you just sit there and think about people that you've worked for that didn't

58
00:03:30.861 --> 00:03:33.490
have show emotions,
you had no connection with them,
you don't care about them,

59
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.160
you'll leave.
You won't go the extra mile to get the job done.

60
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.770
So you have to show emotions.

61
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.230
But of course there are many times in life in the world where showing your

62
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:47.950
emotions are going to have a negative impact on your situation,

63
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:51.640
your you,
you give up the take down it.

64
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.960
You just do a competition and you show it in your face.

65
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.100
That person just thinks I just do right?
You don't show any emotion.

66
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:03.220
Their boss tells you you're getting stuck with the underperforming team.

67
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.350
Show any emotion,
right?
Don't,
don't.
Oh Man,

68
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.240
don't do that,
but hey,
what about this?
And there's a good one.

69
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.970
Boss is giving you feedback that you don't agree with.

70
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.400
Roll your eyes.
He's going,
I mean the the heavy side,

71
00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:25.160
the clenched teeth as you're trying to listen with this person,

72
00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:27.500
you don't even respect him.
He's telling us,
what's that gonna get you.

73
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.000
I'm not going to get you anything.
Then showing that negative emotion there,

74
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.130
you need to keep normal face in that situation.

75
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.480
Your kids doing something that's annoying.

76
00:04:35.481 --> 00:04:38.480
It's trying to test your patience and they're just trying to piss you off.

77
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.480
Don't let them keep it in check.

78
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.190
Get told to go to the other line in DMV after you've been waiting for an hour

79
00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:53.040
and one don't freak out.
Don't show any emotions.
Got It.

80
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.870
Here's,
here's another one.
We already talked about this one.

81
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.100
Your friends or poke in front of you because you missed a shot at the range or

82
00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:06.990
you got lost on a land navigation course or whatever.
Get All mad.

83
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.940
Don't get frustrated.
Don't show any emotion.
You know,

84
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.070
they make fun of your hair cut.
They make fun of your accent.

85
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:16.800
They make fun of whatever.
Don't show emotions.
Don't freak out.

86
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.590
That's the other balance.

87
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.450
Now there are also times where you might have to force yourself to show some

88
00:05:27.451 --> 00:05:29.550
emotion just to get the point across,
right?

89
00:05:29.551 --> 00:05:32.250
Your kid hasn't listened to you after five or six violations.

90
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.280
You might have to show some anger or they or they do something that's going to

91
00:05:37.281 --> 00:05:38.220
get him hurt,
right?

92
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.190
You got to show some emotion so that they realized that was real.

93
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.100
But flying off the temporary flying off the handle and losing your temper is

94
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.880
almost never does you any good.
So yeah,
you have to be balanced.

95
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:52.850
In order to be balanced,
you have to be in control.
In order to be in control,

96
00:05:52.851 --> 00:05:56.570
you have to detach from your emotion so you can control your emotions and not

97
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.610
let your emotions

98
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.770
<v 3>control you.
I think we already talked about this one part before it.</v>

99
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:07.850
We're like,
you know,
like with your kids or whatever and you're,

100
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.180
you fly off the handle,
not fly off the handle,
but you,
you show emotion,

101
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:14.180
you raise your voice and yell at them because this one is important.

102
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.190
This lesson that I'm teaching,
you obviously didn't get it before,

103
00:06:17.191 --> 00:06:21.050
it wasn't your thing.
He can do that every single time.
Of course,

104
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.320
every single lesson like,
okay,
Holy Hill is effective when it reads my voice.

105
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:27.380
Let me just raise my voice now.
Right.
Logically limb die if that,

106
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.420
if that is what induces their compliance,
let me just do that.
Right.

107
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:36.020
Doesn't work that way because after a while I like,
oh talk,
just don't noise.
No.

108
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.480
So yeah,
you've got to be like Christ.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Or yeah,

109
00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:44.150
just be like normal face,
north face,
north face,
everything you know.

110
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.260
And then like the one time you use it,
it's like the,
what do you call the,

111
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.480
there's this video game I used to play.

112
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:54.880
It's like you could just press the button and
blow up everybody.

113
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.600
Anyway,
long story,
but yeah,
don't use it all the time is what I'm saying.

114
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:03.730
Just use it like sparingly,
you're saying?
Yeah,
judiciously.
Cool.

115
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.140
That's a good ted.
Do know what you're saying?
