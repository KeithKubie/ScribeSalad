00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.490
well hunger is the ultimate expression

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500
well hunger is the ultimate expression
 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.390
well hunger is the ultimate expression
of poverty and that's why there are

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400
of poverty and that's why there are
 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.749
of poverty and that's why there are
still almost at this stage billion

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:18.759
still almost at this stage billion
 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.010
still almost at this stage billion
people suffering from hunger every day

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020
people suffering from hunger every day
 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.779
people suffering from hunger every day
that hunger is a combination of acute

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789
that hunger is a combination of acute
 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.999
that hunger is a combination of acute
malnutrition but that's a small

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009
malnutrition but that's a small
 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.130
malnutrition but that's a small
proportion that's less than ten percent

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140
proportion that's less than ten percent
 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.439
proportion that's less than ten percent
and the really serious problem is

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449
and the really serious problem is
 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.869
and the really serious problem is
chronic malnutrition about ninety

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879
chronic malnutrition about ninety
 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.390
chronic malnutrition about ninety
percent of the about a billion people

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400
percent of the about a billion people
 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.829
percent of the about a billion people
are suffering from chronic malnutrition

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839
are suffering from chronic malnutrition
 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.040
are suffering from chronic malnutrition
and it's it's about people being caught

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050
and it's it's about people being caught
 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.500
and it's it's about people being caught
in a desperate poverty trap and they're

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510
in a desperate poverty trap and they're
 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.180
in a desperate poverty trap and they're
not at the moment able to get out of it

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190
not at the moment able to get out of it
 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.369
not at the moment able to get out of it
and I think the challenge is to see find

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379
and I think the challenge is to see find
 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.710
and I think the challenge is to see find
ways of both dealing with the immediate

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720
ways of both dealing with the immediate
 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.630
ways of both dealing with the immediate
problem and also then helping people out

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640
problem and also then helping people out
 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.250
problem and also then helping people out
of the f of these poverty traps that are

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260
of the f of these poverty traps that are
 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.910
of the f of these poverty traps that are
stuck in we're very focused on on the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920
stuck in we're very focused on on the
 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.979
stuck in we're very focused on on the
whole area of acute malnutrition and we

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989
whole area of acute malnutrition and we
 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.109
whole area of acute malnutrition and we
were very instrumental in developing a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.119
were very instrumental in developing a
 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:02.910
were very instrumental in developing a
different approach to dealing with that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920
different approach to dealing with that
 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.070
different approach to dealing with that
called community therapeutic care which

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080
called community therapeutic care which
 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.410
called community therapeutic care which
has been adopted last year by the UN as

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420
has been adopted last year by the UN as
 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.420
has been adopted last year by the UN as
best practice but we're also dealing

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430
best practice but we're also dealing
 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.770
best practice but we're also dealing
with the whole area of chronic

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780
with the whole area of chronic
 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.170
with the whole area of chronic
malnutrition and that's where we're

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180
malnutrition and that's where we're
 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.390
malnutrition and that's where we're
trying to really break the cycle and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400
trying to really break the cycle and
 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.840
trying to really break the cycle and
that cycle involves women who pregnant

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850
that cycle involves women who pregnant
 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.090
that cycle involves women who pregnant
mothers who are underweight and badly

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100
mothers who are underweight and badly
 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.310
mothers who are underweight and badly
nourished producing children who are

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320
nourished producing children who are
 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.370
nourished producing children who are
underweight and particularly in the

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380
underweight and particularly in the
 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.200
underweight and particularly in the
first two years of life if children are

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210
first two years of life if children are
 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.210
first two years of life if children are
not properly nourished they're already

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220
not properly nourished they're already
 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.920
not properly nourished they're already
stomped income's in there and there's a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930
stomped income's in there and there's a
 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.660
stomped income's in there and there's a
huge proportion of the children in the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670
huge proportion of the children in the
 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.149
huge proportion of the children in the
countries we work in are affected by

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159
countries we work in are affected by
 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.890
countries we work in are affected by
stunting and that means mental and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900
stunting and that means mental and
 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.440
stunting and that means mental and
physical stunting which is irreversible

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450
physical stunting which is irreversible
 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.710
physical stunting which is irreversible
so really that's a key focus as well and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720
so really that's a key focus as well and
 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.200
so really that's a key focus as well and
then at the other end of the scale as we

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210
then at the other end of the scale as we
 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.320
then at the other end of the scale as we
people we're trying to find pathways out

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330
people we're trying to find pathways out
 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.930
people we're trying to find pathways out
of hunger for people people you know who

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940
of hunger for people people you know who
 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.969
of hunger for people people you know who
if we can improve their livelihoods if

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979
if we can improve their livelihoods if
 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.560
if we can improve their livelihoods if
we can get them earning that little bit

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570
we can get them earning that little bit
 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.140
we can get them earning that little bit
extra amount of income then you know

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150
extra amount of income then you know
 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.700
extra amount of income then you know
they can grow their own food and they

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710
they can grow their own food and they
 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.300
they can grow their own food and they
can really help themselves out of hunger

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310
 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.450
many of the countries we work in are

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460
many of the countries we work in are
 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.949
many of the countries we work in are
working in very fragile climates and

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959
working in very fragile climates and
 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.050
working in very fragile climates and
particularly areas like the Horn of

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060
particularly areas like the Horn of
 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.520
particularly areas like the Horn of

Darfur Chad all of these are very

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970
Darfur Chad all of these are very
 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.080
Darfur Chad all of these are very
vulnerable places where climatic change

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090
vulnerable places where climatic change
 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.199
vulnerable places where climatic change
and you know where we're facing into

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209
and you know where we're facing into
 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.050
and you know where we're facing into
more of this I'm making the lively

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060
more of this I'm making the lively
 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.600
more of this I'm making the lively
farmers livelihoods much more vulnerable

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610
farmers livelihoods much more vulnerable
 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.370
farmers livelihoods much more vulnerable
the rains that don't come on time or

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380
the rains that don't come on time or
 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.470
the rains that don't come on time or
that call me regularly and sometimes

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480
that call me regularly and sometimes
 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.880
that call me regularly and sometimes
come to 422 it too much rain and shorter

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890
come to 422 it too much rain and shorter
 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.650
come to 422 it too much rain and shorter
growing seasons all of these things so

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660
growing seasons all of these things so
 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.110
growing seasons all of these things so
we're looking at you know different ways

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120
we're looking at you know different ways
 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.240
we're looking at you know different ways
of how we can help that and and some of

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250
of how we can help that and and some of
 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.190
of how we can help that and and some of
that will will involve looking at

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200
that will will involve looking at
 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.860
that will will involve looking at
pastoralists lifestyle like lifestyles

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870
pastoralists lifestyle like lifestyles
 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.860
pastoralists lifestyle like lifestyles
because many of these areas in those in

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870
because many of these areas in those in
 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.900
because many of these areas in those in
those environments are dealing in the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910
those environments are dealing in the
 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.449
those environments are dealing in the
past pastoralists setting and finding

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459
past pastoralists setting and finding
 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.030
past pastoralists setting and finding
solutions to their problems is certainly

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040
solutions to their problems is certainly
 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.680
solutions to their problems is certainly
one of the things we're doing to deal

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690
one of the things we're doing to deal
 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.720
one of the things we're doing to deal
with hunger on a long-term and

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730
with hunger on a long-term and
 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.990
with hunger on a long-term and
sustainable way it's it's a lot more

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000
sustainable way it's it's a lot more
 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.820
sustainable way it's it's a lot more
than about either increasing

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830
than about either increasing
 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.250
than about either increasing
agricultural production or tackling the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260
agricultural production or tackling the
 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.770
agricultural production or tackling the
immediate problems of malnutrition it

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780
immediate problems of malnutrition it
 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.930
immediate problems of malnutrition it
really is about trying to look at this

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940
really is about trying to look at this
 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.599
really is about trying to look at this
in a holistic way obviously health it

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609
in a holistic way obviously health it
 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.880
in a holistic way obviously health it
has a very critical role to play in

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890
has a very critical role to play in
 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.890
has a very critical role to play in
terms of what some of the methods in the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900
terms of what some of the methods in the
 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.990
terms of what some of the methods in the
whole area of child survival so making

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000
whole area of child survival so making
 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.039
whole area of child survival so making
sure that mothers are properly have good

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049
sure that mothers are properly have good
 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.410
sure that mothers are properly have good
health and and small children are

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420
health and and small children are
 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.729
health and and small children are
properly both nourished and some of the

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739
properly both nourished and some of the
 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.949
properly both nourished and some of the
elementary causes I mean when you look

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959
elementary causes I mean when you look
 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.759
elementary causes I mean when you look
at it and we have close to 10 million

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769
at it and we have close to 10 million
 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.059
at it and we have close to 10 million
children a year die under the age of 5

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069
children a year die under the age of 5
 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.800
children a year die under the age of 5
10 million children under the age of 5

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810
10 million children under the age of 5
 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.890
10 million children under the age of 5
die every year and more than half of

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900
die every year and more than half of
 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.559
die every year and more than half of
that is caused through a combination of

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569
that is caused through a combination of
 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.289
that is caused through a combination of
malnutrition and easily preventable

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299
malnutrition and easily preventable
 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.059
malnutrition and easily preventable
diseases so if we're to make the biggest

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069
diseases so if we're to make the biggest
 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.789
diseases so if we're to make the biggest
most quickest in fact that's where we

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799
most quickest in fact that's where we
 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.830
most quickest in fact that's where we
have to start and then when you get into

came up with two core priorities the
first one was dealing with tackling

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100
