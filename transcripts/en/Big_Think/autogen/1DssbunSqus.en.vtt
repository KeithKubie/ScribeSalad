of the ways to think about it is that

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689
of the ways to think about it is that
 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.990
of the ways to think about it is that
from the ecological point of view it's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000
from the ecological point of view it's
 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.179
from the ecological point of view it's
pretty clear we need a major shift to a

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189
pretty clear we need a major shift to a
 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.039
pretty clear we need a major shift to a
whole new set of technologies the

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049
whole new set of technologies the
 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.539
whole new set of technologies the
technologies of the Industrial

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549
technologies of the Industrial
 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.510
technologies of the Industrial
Revolution which took nature as if it

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520
Revolution which took nature as if it
 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.620
Revolution which took nature as if it
were endless and in free supply and we

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630
were endless and in free supply and we
 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.120
were endless and in free supply and we
could pollute the atmosphere without

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130
could pollute the atmosphere without
 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.010
could pollute the atmosphere without
ever paying attention to it pollute our

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020
ever paying attention to it pollute our
 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.870
ever paying attention to it pollute our
rivers cut down all our trees and so

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880
rivers cut down all our trees and so
 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.870
rivers cut down all our trees and so
forth our technology our economic system

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880
forth our technology our economic system
 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.819
forth our technology our economic system
the way we value things it's all based

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829
the way we value things it's all based
 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.300
the way we value things it's all based
on that idea which is a crazy idea and

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310
on that idea which is a crazy idea and
 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.069
on that idea which is a crazy idea and
and the sort of the chickens are coming

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079
and the sort of the chickens are coming
 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.910
and the sort of the chickens are coming
home to roost on that as we've d fouled

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920
home to roost on that as we've d fouled
 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.160
home to roost on that as we've d fouled
the climate run down our ecosystems and

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170
the climate run down our ecosystems and
 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.789
the climate run down our ecosystems and
so forth to get to a new kind of

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799
so forth to get to a new kind of
 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.649
so forth to get to a new kind of
production and consumption system which

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659
production and consumption system which
 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.959
production and consumption system which
actually respects and restores the earth

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969
actually respects and restores the earth
 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.569
actually respects and restores the earth
it means we're going to have to do a lot

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579
it means we're going to have to do a lot
 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.199
it means we're going to have to do a lot
of investing but that's investing at a

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209
of investing but that's investing at a
 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.229
of investing but that's investing at a
local scale at a smaller scale it's a

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239
local scale at a smaller scale it's a
 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.390
local scale at a smaller scale it's a
whole different economic model than the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400
whole different economic model than the
 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.990
whole different economic model than the
one we've been

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000
