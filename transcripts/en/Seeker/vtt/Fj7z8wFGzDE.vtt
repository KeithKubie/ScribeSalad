00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.931
Since the early 1900s, researchers have been
working on ways to turn radioactive material

00:00:04.931 --> 00:00:07.859
into an electric current that lasts.. for
decades.

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.080
Yeah, that’s right.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.760
We’re talking about nuclear batteries!

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.490
This class of batteries is known as betavoltaics,
and they’re powered by the beta-decay of

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.580
a radioactive material—hence the name.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.221
Beta particles are basically just high-energy
electrons, so setting a beta-emitting material

00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:28.029
up next to a semiconductor is virtually all
you need to get an electric current in motion.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.140
Though their power output can be pretty low
(we’re talkin’ less than an AA battery),

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.059
they last as long as it takes the material
to decay.

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.170
And since radioactive materials can have half-lives
of centuries to millennia, that means batteries

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.900
that could last for decades without any noticeable
power loss.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.019
As an aside, betavoltaics are different from
the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.190
(or RTGs) that NASA uses for space missions.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.480
Those are powered by the HEAT of radioactive
materials, like plutonium, instead of beta

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.960
particles directly—and are also sometimes
referred to as nuclear batteries.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.720
But betavoltaics can be made smaller and safer
than RTGs, and with the incredibly long lifetimes

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.500
that nuclear promises.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.540
Back in 1954, the Radio Corporation of America
announced the development of their first betavoltaic

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.540
battery.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.390
And at the time, it was a big deal.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.990
RCA imagined them being used in wristwatches,
hearing aids, and radios.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.740
And in the February 1954 issue of LIFE magazine,
RCA even compared their invention to Edison’s

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.740
lightbulb.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.479
But, while lightbulbs are literally everywhere,
I would wager you probably don’t own a device

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.369
that runs on nuclear batteries.

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.110
Today, betavoltaics are mainly used in deep
space and military applications- far away

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.799
from the average consumer.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.479
And there are a lot of factors involved as
to why that is, but a big one is safety.

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.180
Like I said before, betavoltaics are safer
than other nuclear power systems, but some

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.950
beta-emitting materials can still be pretty
dangerous.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.649
For example, RCA’s prototype from 1954 ran
on Strontium-90, exposure to which can cause

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:01.649
leukemia.

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.789
And even though their battery was coated with
radiation blocking materials, it still probably

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.950
wasn’t the safest thing to hand off to anyone
walking down the street.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.979
But we’ve come a long way!

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.090
In recent years, several research teams have
been looking for a way to safely harness the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.819
power of betavoltaics.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.379
And one team at the University of Bristol
is making one out of DIaMonDZ!

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:27.180
We talked to Dr. Neil Fox, who’s developing
a new prototype made out of carbon-14, a naturally-occurring

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.430
radioisotope that’s in our atmosphere and
in all living things..

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.640
It’s also a common nuclear power plant waste
material.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.010
[Dr. Neil Fox ] “So our research has really
been about looking for ways to repurpose that

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.130
material, so that it effectively can be recycled.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.180
And carbon-14 is a particularly attractive
one because it’s not really on the list

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.250
of really nasty radioisotopes.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.849
It’s a fairly, friendly material to work
with..”

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.340
Fox’s team isolated Carbon-14 and synthesized
a diamond out of it.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.020
In doing so, they created a radioactive diamond
that could produce an electric current(!!).

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.520
Granted, it’s a small one- not enough to
power your phone.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.330
But it IS enough to power smoke detectors,
emergency signs, IoT devices, sensors in jet

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.099
engines or deep sea cables, and even e-readers.

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.209
And it could power all of those things for
decades, without needing to be replaced.

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.390
As for safety?--
[Dr. Neil Fox] “It is totally safe because

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.069
we’re talking about a device which is made
of diamond.

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.430
The radioactive part is actually diamond as
well And all of the radiation, all of the

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.959
power of the device is completely absorbed
by the diamond structure around it.”

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.730
But perhaps one of the most impactful applications
of this battery is for medical implants.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.030
Today, they largely rely on lithium ion batteries,
but those have limitations.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.209
[Dr. Neil Fox ] "I mean there’s some little
girl, she has to have some fairly intrusive

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.189
surgery on her hearing implant every 26 days
they have to change the battery on this thing…

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.050
We’re constantly getting emails from people
who’ve got all sorts of implants…So if

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.700
you can provide them with a solution where
it’s fitted to last for decades, even for

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.030
a lifetime, that’s got to be worth something."

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.560
So, today’s nuclear batteries might not
be what scientists imagined back in the 1950s,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.160
but a nuclear diamond battery that could go
inside you?

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.910
Still pretty dang cool if you ask me.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.340
