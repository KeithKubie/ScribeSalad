00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.160
In this lesson we have
reviewed how caches work and

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.590
what are the concerns and
choices when designing caches.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.730
We will use this knowledge in most of
the subsequent lessons in this course,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.910
starting with lessons on virtual
memory and advanced caches.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.560
And we will definitely need this
knowledge for our projects.
