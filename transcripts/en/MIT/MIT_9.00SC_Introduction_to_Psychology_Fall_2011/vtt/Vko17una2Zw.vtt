00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.710
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:38.610
So we've come to a topic that
I think feels to us like

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.870
intuitively almost the core of
psychology might be about is

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.348
personality.

00:00:43.348 --> 00:00:47.172
Why are some things easy
for us and hard for us?

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:48.810
Why do we like some things
or something else?

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.824
Why do people around us behave
kindly or rudely, supportively

00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:55.184
or loyally or whatever?

00:00:55.184 --> 00:00:58.870
What can we understand about
personality scientifically?

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.382
So how do psychologists try
to study it in a somewhat

00:01:02.382 --> 00:01:04.379
systematic fashion?

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.970
Some key concepts that we're
finding are traits, states,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.630
and context.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.180
Traits--

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.170
I'll come to these.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.750
And then finally some brain
correlates for personality.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.130
So I love this quote, because
I think it's about

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.980
individuality, which says, every
person is in certain

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.930
respects like all
other people--

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.780
and we think that's true.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.190
There's something deeply similar
among all humans, also

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.700
about psychology, also
about our brains.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.550
Like some other people, that
is, there's dimensions of

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.450
individuality, or like some
other people, like if we're a

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.740
male or female, if we're this
age or that age, this culture

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.180
or that culture, like math or
don't like math, like vanilla

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.080
ice cream or don't
like ice cream.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.740
And then finally, we come down
to the unique set of things

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.130
that make you you.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.920
And that's very hard to study,
the unique things

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.510
that make you you.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.770
But the second level, dimensions
of individuality,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.520
we can study in personality.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.480
It's obviously a big one
that we feel in our own

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.460
lives and around us.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.889
So this is the old original
"Star Trek." Like many

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.660
programs, or in TV series, it
plays out really in part--

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.780
they go from galaxy to galaxy
and struggle with various

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.330
opponents, civilizations.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.520
But it almost always
comes down to a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.820
personality thing, right?

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.450
The Captain Kirk who wants to
be aggressive and charge in

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.300
there and do something very
emotional, Spock who's the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.920
pure rational machine, and McCoy
who represents a sort of

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.930
humane touch, as opposed to
the rational thought.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.260
And somewhere in between is the
man who has to pick the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.650
action to command
the ship, right?

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.490
So every show plays out
with him asking him

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.560
to be human, right?

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.060
And him asking him to be
rational, and him killing

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.690
somebody who's trouble making.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.710
OK.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.860
So what do we mean
by personality?

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.710
A set of behavioral, emotional,
and cognitive

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.860
tendencies that people
display over time.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.070
When we talk about personality,
we really mean

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.140
something that we think is
consistent in ourselves or in

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.750
other people.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.700
It's that somebody is
shy, somebody's

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.120
helpful, somebody's rude.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.340
And across situations, not just
one place, one time, but

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.390
pretty regularly.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.130
And that varies across people.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.220
That distinguishes them
from one to another.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.880
Something that's kind of--

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.130
there's some similarities,
but people vary in this.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.650
And so when people think about
this, they think in three

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.970
categories as they
conceptualize it.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.690
One is traits.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.380
By trait we mean something
that's in you that's constant

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.610
across situations and times.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.540
But we also think of
it as a continuum.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.730
So for example, we talk about
introversion/extroversion or

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.190
outgoingness and shyness.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.780
It's not that everybody's
one or the other.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.850
Along that path from being
extremely shy to extremely

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.550
outgoing, many of us are
somewhere in between.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.550
And then we can talk about
states, how we are

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.800
temporarily.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.140
How do we feel, excited, afraid,
that kind of stuff.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.460
And then situations we're in,
because they're specific at

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.700
times and places, and
that influences us.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.740
We're fearful, we're happy,
we're looking forward to

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.880
something, we're not looking
forward to something.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.870
So these are different pieces
that might end up in how we

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.600
feel inside and how we
act on the world.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.140
So here's a very funny thing,
because it's a very different

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.140
line of research than
practically anything else

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.750
that's out there.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.150
Very active, because we're so
curious about personality.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.190
Here's how people have basically
approached it.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.750
Not everybody, but the main line
scientific perspective.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.800
They looked in the dictionary,
originally in the 1930s, for

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.270
this line of work, and they
said, let's look at all the

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.420
adjectives in the dictionary
that we think might describe

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.010
personality in some sense.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.240
They found nearly 18,000 words
in the dictionaries that

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.420
seemed to be adjectives for
describing people, and

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.420
something that might be
about personality.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.730
Whether you're affable, or
amiable, congenial, convivial,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.510
cordial, friendly, genial,
sociable, welcoming.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.670
These are all synonyms, right?

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.010
They all mean roughly the
same thing, we think.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.250
But they found 18,000 terms
there because we think a lot

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.050
about other people, and talk a
lot about other people, and

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.870
other people are interesting
to us.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.610
And as I said, we're not going
to study 18,000 dimensions of

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.330
personality, especially
when lots of them

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.910
overlap like this.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.100
So what we're going to do is
see, are there some underlying

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.020
traits, a manageable set of
personality traits or

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.110
dimensions, that many of these
18,000 adjectives sort

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.050
of boil down to.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.160
So a manageable set of
personality dimensions.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.780
So how do people measure
personality in some way?

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.380
And for those of us who like
to measure things by

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.090
behavior-- you do a test, or
you push a button, or we

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.180
measure your brain--

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.160
personality research is always
funny, because the bulk of it

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.230
is people's self report
about themselves.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.930
And about the last thing most
of us in psychology trust is

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.050
people's reports about
themselves.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.840
And what we think is--

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.260
for many reasons that we can
talk about a little bit--

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.010
what we think is that people,
when they fill out a piece of

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.850
paper describing themselves,
they start to have all kinds

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.540
of thoughts like, OK, I'm
outgoing, but compared to who?

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.630
Do I want to fill this out like
I really like to think

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.500
about myself, or how I think I
really am, or am I sometimes

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.330
this way and sometimes
that way, which

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.140
is the right answer.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.560
OK?

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.460
So all these things bother us
as researchers, but we don't

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.020
have a more direct path
towards personality.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.490
So we can interview people
about their personality.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.300
We can observe--

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.500
I'll talk about some studies
that involve observation.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.150
But by far the dominant mode
of collecting somewhat

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.810
quantitative data about
personality are questionnaires

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.720
of the kind you just got
handed out to you.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.370
Thank you, Tyler.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.750
And the most famous one of all,
which you have in your

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.310
hands, is the so-called big five
personality dimensions.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.400
There's many other aspects of
personality-- we'll talk about

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.370
that-- but this is the
most famous one.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.060
And it was derived in some
sense objectively and

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.930
empirically from factor
analysis like this.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.680
What they said is we have this
huge number of terms, but many

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.740
of them are either very similar
to one another, or

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.540
what we might call
anti-correlative, they're sort

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.650
of opposites.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.680
So for example, if a person is
rude, are we also likely to

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.520
think of them as kind?

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.860
Now you could have--

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.490
there's many movies of the rude
senior citizen who turns

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.620
out to have a heart of gold
underneath, right?

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.110
But in general, if you say this
person's rude, usually

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.990
they'll go, and they're
so kind, right?

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.680
We think of them as sort of
opposites in personality.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.040
If somebody's dependable
or carefree.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.730
Now, maybe you know somebody
who's both dependable and

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.260
carefree, but we tend to think
carefree people are not so

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.900
dependable.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.280
They can be delightful
dependable people.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.840
But now, rude-- you can be
dependable and rude or

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.560
dependable and polite, right?

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.960
OK, so get a feeling of that.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.710
So they have people fill out
tons of pieces of paper saying

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.790
how do they feel these factors
describe them.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.960
And they start out with this
huge universe of terms, and

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.600
then they try to boil it down,
and boil it down, and boil it

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.040
down, by looking at--

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.200
Oh, this doesn't show up
very well, does it?

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.560
Oh, well.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.260
Correlations--

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.640
you have the notes.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:11.150
So you can guess without being
able to see, you can guess--

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.710
let's pick two things.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:18.900
If I pick the adjectives
carefree and dependable, kind

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.650
of go together or
not go together?

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.500
Doesn't tend to go together in
people describing themselves.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.940
How about hard working
and dependable?

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.370
Kind of goes together.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.419
So they said, we can take a lot
of these adjectives and

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:36.409
say piles of them go in one
area, well, we'll just pick a

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.409
few words to describe
that dimension.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.400
Piles of them go in
another area.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:46.090
And they boil it down basically
by factor analysis,

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.800
and they end up with five
big factors in this

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.260
most widely used one.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.520
So here's two of them.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.440
And here comes a big thing.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.540
They have the factor which is
basically just mathematically

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.950
a set of adjectives that travel
together, that are

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.080
highly correlated when people
describe themselves.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.855
And they're somewhat
anti-correlated or

00:09:05.855 --> 00:09:07.470
uncorrelated with the
other dimensions.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.950
That's purely empirical.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.380
Now, though, they have the set
of adjectives, like carefree

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.670
or dependable, not hard-working
or hard-working.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.960
Now they have to say, what's the
label I'm going to put on

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.500
that dimension of human
personality?

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.700
There's no science for that.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.730
That's judgment.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.220
But five of them get fixed.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.220
And once these got fixed,
they've become the terminology

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.560
of the field.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.780
So they said, we're going to
call one conscientiousness.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.170
Those are people who say they're
not carefree, they are

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.820
dependable, and they
are hard-working.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.810
Does that make sense?

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.050
Or somebody's agreeable--

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.440
that's one of the other big
five, separate five.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.970
If somebody says, I'm pretty
compliant, I'm pretty kind,

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.070
and I'm seldom rude.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.840
So I'm going to give you
a minute to try this.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.160
You can fill it out fully.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.320
So your piece of paper
that you have is a

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.910
version of this test.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.110
It's the real thing.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.620
One side tells you
how to score it.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.880
Don't look at that, the other
side at the bottom.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.430
Just try a few items for fun
if you feel like it.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:12.160
And you can fill it out later
and score yourself or print it

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.860
out from the notes and
score your friends.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.230
Use it responsibly,
the knowledge.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.610
And you can just have an
intuition of what does it

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.370
mean, because almost all
personality research, almost

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.830
all of it does exactly what
you're doing now, which is

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:31.160
gives you a piece of paper, and
have you describe yourself

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.410
to yourself.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.930
I'll give you a minute just
to get a feeling for it.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.880
I think it's kind of fun.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.990
And the feeling you
get, like--

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:49.860
so people worry about stuff,
like who are you comparing

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.560
yourself to?

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.250
If you're outgoing,
compared to who?

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.000
Compared to Robin
Williams, OK?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.560
Maybe not so much.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.290
Compared to your roommate?

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.170
Maybe yes.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.520
So all these questions, like
where do you get these number

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.740
from, how do you come to these
answers, and so on.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.670
People worry about polishing
your image.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.235
Oh yes, I'm always polite.

00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:11.910
I'm nearly perfect when I'm
asked to describe myself, OK?

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.510
So to the extent that
people did that, it

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.180
wouldn't work, right?

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.200
Because everybody would look
perfect all the time.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.640
So these big five are openness,
conscientiousness,

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.880
extroversion, agreeableness,
and neuroticism.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.060
And for memorizing for tests,
OCEAN is the acronym.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.790
These were the ones that have
come out as five separable

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.220
dimensions that seem to cover
a tremendous amount of

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.620
individual descriptions of human
personality, and are

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.870
widely used in research.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.635
So here's your big
five inventory.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.590
Here's--

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.460
on the backside, how to score
it, if you feel like figuring

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.900
out what this test would
say about yourself, OK?

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.740
You could be honest with your
scoring, because we're not

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.470
going to collect it, it's just
you describing you to

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.720
yourself, if you're curious.

00:12:11.205 --> 00:12:12.370
And now I'm going to go on.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.030
And you're more than welcome
to finish it

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.640
whenever you want.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.380
It's yours to keep.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.090
And here's how we would score
it, or you would score it.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.520
It tells you on the
bottom what to do.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.260
For conscientiousness--

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.310
and we'll come back
to this, it's a

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.180
really interesting measure.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.960
If you rate yourself as somebody
who does a thorough

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.880
job, is a reliable worker,
perseveres until the task is

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.620
finished, does things
efficiently, and makes plans

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.790
and follows through with them.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.650
The higher you rate yourself on
those-- this makes sense--

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.300
you're more conscientious,
right?

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:43.870
The less you say, that you're
somewhat careless, you tend to

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.290
be disorganized, you tend to
be lazy, and you're easily

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.090
distracted, well, those
are negative

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:50.530
things for that dimension.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.540
Does that make sense?

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.060
So you have to watch when you
score it which are the

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.980
positive and which are the
negative as you score them,

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.980
would you get a plus
or a minus.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.020
And they try to make it either
way, so that if you constantly

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.120
say yes, you ought not to score
anything that makes

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.810
sense, even to yourself.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:08.760
Anyway, so here's the big
questions, right?

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.380
All this sort of research
behind or this factor

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.050
analysis, you'd want
to know two things.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.680
Are they stable?

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.090
Do they really describe
a person across

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.750
situations and time?

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.420
That's what we mean
by personality.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.010
And secondly, do they predict
behaviors and life outcomes?

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.110
Is there something about them
that goes with things that we

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.450
care about, variably
across people?

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:31.050
So where people have looked at
this over some number of

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.470
years, it correlates 0.5
to 0.7 across 30

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.980
or 40 years of life.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.360
Height and sex, to think about
it, correlates 0.4.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.880
Again, height and sex is kind of
an-- people will pick that

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.480
to think about.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.100
On average, men tend to be
taller than women, but lots of

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.330
women are taller than lots
of individual men, OK?

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.530
So it's a stronger relationship
across time.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.520
It's more stable than
what you'd predict

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.180
by height and sex.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.830
And here's something
really interesting.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.890
They tested people across
seven years-- within

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:03.970
childhood, within young
adulthood, within the 30s, and

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.220
in the 50 to 70 age range.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.770
And here's something
kind of striking.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:09.930
If you test people twice across
seven years, starting

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:14.730
from infancy as best you can--
or questions about them

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.980
because they can't
fill out forms--

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.970
to adulthood, the striking thing
is that the older you

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.780
get, the more consistent
you become across

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.240
a seven year period.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.430
The older you get, the more
consistent you become.

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:28.910
So how might you
interpret that?

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.140
There's a couple different
ways you

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.750
could think about that.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.990
The older you become, the more
consistent you become in

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.160
describing your personality--

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.550
let's pretend your descriptions
are accurate--

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.940
the more consistent your
personality is.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.050
Did you expect that?

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:47.820
Is that what you expect?

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.117
Something opposite?

00:14:50.117 --> 00:14:51.115
Yeah?

00:14:51.115 --> 00:14:53.776
AUDIENCE: They get older, they
kind of develop habits and get

00:14:53.776 --> 00:14:55.110
set in their ways.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.540
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.620
So there's two ways to describe
getting older.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.880
Like me, I get set in my ways.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.840
Right?

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.420
That's OK.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.770
Or I'll say it the other way,
we discover the ways that we

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:07.700
really like.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.660
OK?

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.620
My friend Robert Sapolsky at
Stanford, who writes fantastic

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.410
books and who's a fantastic
lecturer, had an essay where

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:19.960
he said he noticed in his late
40s or 50s, that the people in

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.100
his working lab that they were
playing irritating music.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.970
It was just bothering him when
they were playing the music.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:30.390
And it was music that people of
your generation listen to.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.450
He said, why is it irritating?

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.860
Because when he played his--

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.590
when he played The Beatles or
whatever, they were irritating

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:37.050
to his parents, OK.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:38.440
So what's going on?

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.430
And he said, oh.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.440
And so he did a little informal
study, he talked to

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.230
people of different ages and
people in restaurants, they

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:49.020
said, at what age do people seem
to stop wanting to do new

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.180
things, and get stuck in their
ways, or find what they like

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.170
and stick with it?

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.810
And there's no one answer.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.180
But he found a tremendous number
of people, by about 30

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:01.010
to 35, that's their music, they
like sushi or they don't

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:03.100
like sushi.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.910
They have their set of stuff
that they have going for them

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:06.920
or they don't like.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.500
And so you could say they
get stuck in their ways.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.730
You could say they discover
what they like

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:12.920
and stick with it.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.260
And here's an age more of
exploration and variability.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.150
Who knows?

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.200
But it's kind of interesting,
the older you get, the more

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.962
consistent you get.

00:16:21.962 --> 00:16:23.550
Is this flexibility?

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.080
Is this chaos?

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.220
You could look at
it either way.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.020
There's no real answer.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.010
People have looked at these
scores and asked whether

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:31.815
things like--

00:16:31.815 --> 00:16:35.010
do they vary with
age and gender?

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:41.270
So for example, these broken
lines are neuroticism, which

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.010
is a funny label.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:42.970
It really means--

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.830
neuroticism is the bad side
of it, stability is the

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:46.490
good side of it.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.650
You could also say too stable
could be boring and inert.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.930
You could relabel these
things pretty much.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.330
But on average, women's scores
are a little bit less stable

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.280
than men, a little bit more
outgoing, a little bit.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.210
By age, you get a few trends.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.760
This will not surprise
you, actually.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:12.210
So for neuroticism--
again, stability--

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.540
that neuroticism decreases
with age.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.640
People get more stable and they
get more conscientious as

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.140
they get older.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.460
You kind of expect that.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.770
People get more used to their
habits and more stuck in their

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.829
ways, that we would
call stability.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:29.090
So, let's ask for people who
score high or low on these

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.330
measures, what do
they go with?

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.970
So for these five fundamental
personality measures.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:37.010
So people who score highly on
the neuroticism scale-- again,

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.410
these labels are tricky--

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:42.100
but it means ranging from very
stable and emotional sense to

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.680
very labile--

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.790
they pay more attention to
threat in the environment,

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.280
more stressed when given a
surprise math test, have a

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.320
higher divorce rate,
more susceptible to

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.690
depression and anxiety.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:56.000
At the very, very, very highest
scores of neuroticism,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.290
it's a big risk for depression
and anxiety.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.900
And one of the deep questions
always is, to what extent are

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.250
what we call psychiatric labels
extremes of personality

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.060
or something beyond
personality?

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.890
This is a much deeper issue
than you'd think.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:11.840
We'll come back to
it in psychiatry.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.840
Because some people say there's
no such thing, for

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.100
example, as social
anxiety disorder.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.590
It's a recent invention
for what people

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:21.540
used to call shyness.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.540
I don't think that's
right, mostly.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.270
But this debate goes on, because
there's not a sharp

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:32.410
boundary between being a little
shy and so shy that you

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.980
don't leave your house
to meet people.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.950
That's kind of an extreme.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.330
But most people--

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.890
it's not one person is here and
the next person's here,

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.380
there's people all along
the continuum.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.090
Where you draw the line is
a challenging issue.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:46.370
Highly extroverted people versus
highly introverted,

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.410
that sort of shyness
and outgoingness.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:49.400
This will be a big surprise.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.930
Highly extroverted people-- by
these personality measures--

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.200
attend more parties, they're
more popular, they're

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.140
identified as leaders in
college, they live with and

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.380
work with more people, they're
less disturbed by sudden loud

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.400
sounds or intense stimuli.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.690
You can do experiments in a
laboratory and get these

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.960
differences.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.080
None of these are sort
of surprising.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.260
They're just telling you there's
something correct

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.110
about these personality
measures.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:11.410
Highly agreeable people are more
willing to lend money,

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:12.750
have higher high school
grades, and have

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.860
fewer arrests as adults.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.760
But the cool thing is not--

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.560
I mean, you're not surprised.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.690
But the fact that they fill out
a questionnaire sitting at

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.870
a desk like you do, predicts to
some decent extent over the

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.830
population whether they'll
go to jail or not.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.330
That's kind of interesting.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.700
More openness to experience.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.140
You're more likely to major
in the humanities--

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.380
not us--

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:42.040
change careers in midlife,
perform better in job training

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.810
programs, and play a
musical instrument.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.970
But these are massive
statistical things.

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.630
Because kind of conversely--

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.290
well, you know there's very
interesting relations between

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.500
musicality and sort of math
and science backgrounds.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.900
So that seems to go
against this.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.370
So these are big averages.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.860
Maybe, I think, in some ways the
most interesting one, for

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.930
practical reasons, has turned
out to be conscientiousness,

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.370
and that's like doing what
you're supposed to do.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.830
More sexually faithful to
spouses, higher job ratings,

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.980
smoke less, drink less, drive
more safely, live longer, less

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.690
risk for Alzheimer's Disease--
spectacularly less risk.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:17.800
OK?

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.660
And also play a musical
instrument?

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.620
So the Alzheimer's Disease is
kind of interesting, because

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.880
what we think is happening--
and we don't really know--

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.220
is this.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.770
So you may know there's
basically one gene, now, more

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.950
recently, a couple other
genes, identified as

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.020
significant risk genes
for Alzheimer's.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.080
But the one powerful
well-identified one is the

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.190
so-called APOE gene.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.740
And that is a significant
risk gene.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.920
If you're homologous for that,
you have a higher risk for

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.060
Alzheimer's.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.910
But that best-known,
best-characterized gene is a

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:59.100
far smaller risk factor,
mathematically, than being low

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.180
conscientiousness.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.920
And we don't know what that
really means, right?

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.460
What's your guess?

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.730
And nobody knows.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.280
This is just an empirical
finding, and it's been

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.400
replicated a number of times.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.900
What's your guess?

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.040
So conscientious people do
what they're supposed to.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.850
All the things that you're
supposed to, in the morning,

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:18.190
get up and do, they do
them pretty well.

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:19.440
Right?

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.690
Make your bed, do your laundry
regularly, brush your teeth

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:28.210
regularly, have your medical
appointments regularly, eat

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.830
well, exercise, all the things
that everybody tells you is

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.560
good for you, conscientious
people are more

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.070
likely to do it.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.890
Yeah?

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:35.360
AUDIENCE: It's sort
of an analogy.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.300
The thing is that someone who
continuously uses them more--

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.260
more of the pipeline,
basically.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.036
Keep water going through them,
makes it less likely that it

00:21:43.036 --> 00:21:45.160
will clog the pipes--

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.910
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
something like that.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:48.060
The pipeline analogy.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.440
If you keep flushing it
regularly, instead of clogging

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.130
it up with bad things that are
bad for you or whatever.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.180
In the end, there has to be
a biological mechanism.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.020
In the end, there has to be.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.380
But maybe it's a lifetime
of doing healthy things.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.940
And they add up and up, day in,
day out, month in, month

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.410
out, year in, year out.

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:05.190
That they somehow, in some
way, either fend off

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.980
Alzheimer's disease or diminish
its expression for

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:08.570
much longer.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:09.690
Does that sound OK?

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.170
But it's a very compelling
finding.

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:13.400
All right.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.040
So then there's always a
fun question up for our

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.460
personality, and there
will be one big

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.570
surprise here, I think.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.325
I'll tell you this
is our surprise.

00:22:20.325 --> 00:22:22.430
[INAUDIBLE] was reminding
me that--

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:23.940
there's a parents visiting
weekend, which

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.260
is not today, right?

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.160
But a few years ago, I gave this
lecture on that, and I

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.870
came to a conclusion that
parents will find impossible,

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.390
untrue, and very disturbing.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.030
Get ready.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.280
Here we go.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.560
Again, we're always curious,
our personalities--

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.310
whether we're outgoing
or not, agreeable or

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:43.500
not, open or not--

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.560
how much of that is in our genes
at birth, how much is

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.610
that in our environment in terms
of parental influence,

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.440
and sibling influence, and
school, and so on.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.800
So the usual way to this, until
we know the true biology

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.110
of this, are estimates from
twin studies and children

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.430
reared apart and reared
separately.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.330
So let me start with
the twin studies.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:06.270
So these are identical twins in
green versus dizygotic or

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.260
fraternal twins, shared

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.910
environment, some shared genes.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:13.230
The difference about this is
thought to be an estimate of

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.040
pure genetic heritability.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.030
And say you get a pretty
good one--

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.510
extroversion and openness
the most, maybe--

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:26.000
but definitely a genetic
contribution to personality.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.390
That's the evidence
from twin studies.

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:32.180
And it's even impressive if
you do not self report

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:34.160
questionnaires, but behaviors
that people describe,

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.340
activities they do.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.060
Time spent watching television,
number of

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.870
childhood accidents, tendency
for marriage and divorce,

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:43.230
religious attitudes, your
balance between work and

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.340
leisure, do you want to be at
work all the time or leisure,

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.710
or what the balance
ought to be.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:51.820
0.5, that's about half
heritable, estimated.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:52.440
Happiness--

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.760
we'll come back to happiness
ratings.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.040
The way people rate happiness,
it turns out, is if you do a

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.760
one to seven scale,
that's the field.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.330
OK?

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.310
Seven means happy all
the time, one means

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.230
miserable all the time.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:04.710
That's the way happiness
research is done.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:07.140
In the last lecture, we'll talk
about what people think

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.040
people need to do to be happy.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.150
But one thing we know is that
people tend to have happiness

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:13.950
set-points--

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:16.340
you may know this amongst your
friends or yourselves--

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.430
that is, on average, a person
will be very happy, or

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:23.110
moderately happy, or pretty
grumbly most of the time.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.680
OK?

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.530
Something happens in their lives
that's really good or

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.390
bad, they'll move a little bit,
but they'll slide right

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:28.030
back to it.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:31.070
There's nothing better or worse
about one or the other,

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.570
but it's just people tend
to be pretty set.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.590
And the estimates from twin
studies are about half of your

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:39.110
chronic sense of happiness, day
in and day out, it comes

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.840
from genes, is the estimate.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.320
So that's a big piece.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.760
But here's the kind
of stunning thing.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.530
And in the next couple
slides I tell you.

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:48.644
Let me tell you the bottom
line, let me

00:24:48.644 --> 00:24:51.040
tell you the evidence.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.440
The empirical evidence could
support a position that

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.450
parents and family environments
have zero

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:01.490
influence on your personality.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.400
Then the question is, what is
the environmental influence?

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.270
Because we know it's
not all genetic.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:10.320
But wherever it's been looked at
carefully, parents and home

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:15.270
environments appear to have, as
far as they can see, nearly

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:16.820
zero influence on your
personality.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.670
Now this is the thing that
drives parents crazy.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.780
Because as a parent, I can
tell you, from the moment

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:24.010
they're born, or even months
before children are born, to

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:26.560
the moment you're no longer
around to take care of your

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.410
children, you want them to
develop the right kind of--

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.620
be a happy person,
a good person.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.230
Hopefully something about
conscientiousness, do well in

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.340
life, right?

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.480
And you're doing every little
thing to encourage that.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.170
The comments you make, the
schools you send them to, the

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.940
activities you encourage them to
do, you want them to have a

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.750
personality that will be happy
for them and good for them and

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:47.190
thriving, right?

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:51.180
So to be told that whatever you
do doesn't matter is kind

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.200
of a big shock.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.990
And we don't really know
the depth of this.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.420
And it sounds like
it's ridiculous.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.090
But I can tell you the empirical
evidence kind of

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.390
supports it.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:02.350
So for example, for the twin
studies, it makes no

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.940
difference at all for
personality dimensions whether

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:09.030
twins are raised together
or raised apart.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.650
So they're in different families
or the same family--

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:12.550
doesn't make a difference.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.600
All the heritable estimates
remain exactly the same.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.080
So where are the environmental
factors coming from?

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.840
We believe there's environmental
factors, but we

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.760
can't spot them.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.805
And what's fascinating about
these things is that we as

00:26:24.805 --> 00:26:27.010
human beings-- and this is
just an example now--

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:31.060
always want to understand who we
are as some sort of willful

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.150
response to our environment.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:38.450
So here are two identical
twins reared apart.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.760
And they're both super neat.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.270
OK?

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:46.210
And neither one of them tells
you, well, it's in my genes,

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:47.320
what else was I going to do?

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.520
None of us mostly think that.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.600
Outside of some dire
circumstances or diseases, we

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.860
mostly think, it's my choice
this morning whether I'm going

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.830
to make my bed or not.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.020
It's my choice if I do laundry
this year or not.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.206
Yeah.

00:27:01.206 --> 00:27:05.400
AUDIENCE: Could that other 50%
come from things part of the

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.060
environment like
diet or health?

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.290
PROFESSOR: Could the other 50%
come from things like diet or

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:10.280
other things in the
environment?

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.400
It could.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.850
But even that tends to
go by families some.

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:19.720
Some families just say, here's
a few years worth of potato

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.230
chips, good luck.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.370
Another family's going, oh my
gosh, you didn't eat carrots

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.500
all month long.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.960
Even that tends to be,
on average, someone

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.880
environmental, right?

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.310
Both by economic opportunity,
part of the world you're in,

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.950
parental attitudes, right?

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:33.550
I agree with you.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:34.450
It's got to be something.

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:37.620
And maybe we just don't have
the whole story right.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.210
But here's two twins telling
you why each of

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:41.720
them is very neat.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.230
OK?

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.250
The first one is, my mother.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.720
When I was growing up-- this is
one household, one twin--

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.890
she always kept the house
perfectly ordered.

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:50.950
I learned from her.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.730
What else could I do?

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.730
I had a model in my parent.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:56.000
She was neat, I'm neat.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.180
Here's the other twin, who
is also very neat.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.080
The reason is quite simple.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.420
I'm reacting to my mother,
who was a complete slob.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:01.990
OK?

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:03.850
So they're complete
opposite stories.

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.370
I'm modeling my parents.

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.960
I'm rebelling against
my parents.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.510
But you know that they're
identical twins, and they end

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.550
up in the same place.

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:12.433
Yeah?

00:28:12.433 --> 00:28:13.683
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:25.920
PROFESSOR: That's another
interpretation.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.000
This is a good question.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.120
The question is, I'm pretending
the explanations

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.630
have nothing to do with
anything, and you're saying

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:31.700
maybe this a personality
thing.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.990
Somebody who chooses to model
their parent or just somebody

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:36.400
who chooses to rebel against
their parent.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.520
Maybe that's the personally
dimension, right?

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.770
It could be.

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.810
It's just neatness.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:46.010
Twins who aren't neat tend to go
the same way and twins who

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.060
are neat tend to go
the same way.

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.640
About 50 percent of the effect
is in the genes.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.350
I don't know.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:51.650
I'm not saying that things
aren't there.

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:55.430
It's a bit of a mystery,
it's a bit of a shock.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.080
So here's a couple
more things.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.050
Biological, non-twin
siblings--

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:02.310
OK, so these are siblings
but they're not twins--

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.310
are far more similar
to one another

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:05.940
then adoptive siblings.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:06.500
OK.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:06.930
That's OK.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.140
That's the genetics, right?

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.860
Because the adopted child
is into the family.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.390
But here's a shocking one.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:15.110
For personality, children are no
more similar to an adoptive

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:18.710
sibling than are two randomly
selected children.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:22.120
So in a household, if you have
an adopted child and a

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.410
biological child in that
household, sharing the same

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:27.830
environment, they are no more
similar, one to the other,

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:31.350
than two random children
in the world.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:34.820
OK, where is the effect
of the environment?

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.550
Where is the parental effect on
the two children in terms

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.240
of personality?

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.210
So people have mounted
this argument.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:43.800
So let me pick another one.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.070
Put up your hand
if you want to.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.060
I'll put up my hand.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.540
How many people grew up in a
household where one or more

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.310
parents spoke in a noticeable
accent?

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:53.340
I mean, I did.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.350
Let's just try this here.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.440
How many of you who have your
hand up-- keep your hand up--

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.380
did you keep your
parents' accent?

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.460
Where's the environment?

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.970
In your critical moments of
language development, you were

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:10.730
hearing that accent.

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.420
Where is the environment?

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.850
And you could say, well, yeah,
but there are other people

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:14.550
speaking other things.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.260
Yeah, but then zero parental
influence on the way in which

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.520
you produce your language.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.840
So there's a lot of different
things to think as we move

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.700
from language to personality,
but it's turning out to be

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.810
surprisingly hard on some
dimensions to show an

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:30.610
influence of parental
environment on child

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:31.730
development, especially
in personality.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:32.548
Yeah.

00:30:32.548 --> 00:30:35.964
AUDIENCE: So, first off, for
the adopted sibling thing.

00:30:35.964 --> 00:30:39.380
It seems like that way, not only
would they get similar

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.308
parental environment, but they
also probably have similar

00:30:42.308 --> 00:30:43.290
school environment--

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:43.690
PROFESSOR: Oh, yes.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.710
It's worse than that.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:46.810
This is a very good question.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:49.120
It's not only that they have
adoptive parents, if they have

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.780
another kid in the house,
there's another kid in the

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.590
house, they probably go to the
same-- if they go to church or

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:57.150
synagogue or anything
like that.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:02.680
Same school, same state, same
influence of whoever's the NBA

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.870
basketball champion.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:05.770
The whole list.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:07.290
And it seems to be--

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:09.206
you can't identify
anything in that.

00:31:09.206 --> 00:31:10.870
Yeah?

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:16.226
AUDIENCE: Something that is
biological but not in DNA,

00:31:16.226 --> 00:31:17.710
that is also 50-50?

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:18.260
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.330
So diet would influence that.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.782
Who knows?

00:31:22.782 --> 00:31:24.856
AUDIENCE: Stuff like you're born
with, so that it's not

00:31:24.856 --> 00:31:27.662
just as an environmental thing,
but it's not, strictly

00:31:27.662 --> 00:31:29.630
speaking, in your DNA.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:32.150
Because that's what
identical twins--

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:34.630
PROFESSOR: Well, let me stop
you there for one moment.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:37.770
I think at some level of
analysis, all environmental

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:38.290
influences--

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:40.580
education, parenting,
everything--

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:44.410
will have a biological
counterpart in your body and

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.360
in your brain, right?

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.280
Because the environment has to
affect you by how it changes

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.630
your body or brain.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:52.540
After you're born.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:53.310
It could be added in.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.010
There's things--

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.370
methylation, there's a lot--
yeah, it could be all those

00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:01.680
things, but who's
driving that?

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.390
So it's not--

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:05.370
my bet is that we'll discover
stuff about this that

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.280
we don't grasp yet.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.600
The answer is not going to be
parenting makes no difference,

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.580
or environments make no
difference, or schools make no

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.340
difference, for personality.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.610
But we just don't know how to
think about that yet is the

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:19.870
best guess, because it's
just hard to believe.

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:20.512
Yeah.

00:32:20.512 --> 00:32:23.450
AUDIENCE: Is there a correlation
between IQ and any

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:24.580
kind of personality?

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.030
PROFESSOR: IQ and personality?

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:27.655
There is a moderate--

00:32:27.655 --> 00:32:29.460
of conscientiousness
especially,

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.490
but that makes sense.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.110
On average--

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:35.650
and we certainly know people
who are very smart and very

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:39.430
sloppy, but on average, the more
conscientious you are,

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:41.580
like if you go to school, you
do your homework, that kinds

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.385
of stuff, there is a positive
correlation.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:48.640
So there's all kinds of--
one question is how much

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.880
personality is fixing
your environment.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.100
So how much is the way you are,
from the moment you're

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.000
born, driving actually the way
the teacher responds to you in

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.820
school, the way the parent
responds to you?

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.310
And so that's why your
personality's already driving

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.760
your actual environment.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.070
Because we could say, well,
you're in a school, but

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:06.952
really, do you like the
teacher, do you

00:33:06.952 --> 00:33:07.810
not like the teacher?

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:09.020
Do you like your parents?

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:09.820
Do you follow them?

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.100
Do you oppose them?

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.830
Maybe those kinds of things
are happening.

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:18.240
Sometimes people think that your
personality is driving

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.010
the way your environment
responds to you.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.480
It might be done by
sibling contrast.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.070
So you may have this
experience that--

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.990
parents and other people and
siblings yourself often think

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.140
a fair bit how they are similar
or dissimilar from

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.570
their own sibling, and
they might overdo it.

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:39.410
Because a parent has two kids,
one kid's like 1% more

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:43.060
outgoing, and they go, that's
the outgoing one.

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:46.380
One kid plays 5% more time on
the piano, and they go, oh,

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.480
she's the real musician.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.920
And because he plays two more
baseball games a year, he's

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.020
the athlete.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:54.580
And then it starts to snowball
that way, OK?

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:55.800
Or parent identification.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.060
Could kids who identify with
one parent or the other,

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.770
again, by their predispositions,
sort of be

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.500
driving the way their parents
interact with them in a way

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.130
that's, again, driven
by the personality?

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.070
The personality--

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:08.370
from the first moment, for
one reason or another--

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:11.120
is molding the environment
around it and carrying the

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.179
environmental effect as well.

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:17.310
So one of the giant fights in
all of psychology is this.

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:18.435
And there's not going to
be an answer, I'll just

00:34:18.435 --> 00:34:20.550
tell you the debate.

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.020
And it's at the core of this
question of why do we do the

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.000
things we do.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.949
So personality adjusted
psychologists will say, it's

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:28.500
these things we've
just discussed.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.179
It's our predispositions to like
things and not like other

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:33.880
things in a general way
are personality.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.960
Social psychologists--

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.440
and we'll spend two lectures in
just a few weeks on social

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:37.969
psychology--

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:41.730
say people are all
kind of the same.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:45.870
It's all about the social
situation we're in.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.350
Probably it's like one of these
nature-nurture things.

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.270
Probably something about the
situation is something about

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:51.969
who you are.

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:56.520
But let me tell you how some of
this debate is played out.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:01.130
So a famous study that went
against the idea of a

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:04.890
personality being constant
across situations and time

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:06.530
came from Walter Mischel.

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.020
And they looked at
conscientiousness.

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.710
And they said, OK, some kids
score high or low or medium on

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.140
conscientiousness.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:16.850
Now, let's look at 19 specific
behaviors in their life.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.170
Not their report of how they
are, or their parents' report

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.590
of how they are, but things they
do that we can measure.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.830
How often do they
make their bed?

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:24.410
How often do they go to class
like they should?

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:26.430
How often do they complete their
homework assignments?

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:28.910
How often do they have
good class notes

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:29.730
when they leave classes?

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:33.310
So things you can check,
yes or no.

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:37.190
And they said gee, what we
notice is somebody tends to be

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.310
pretty consistent about whether
they make their bed or

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:41.020
not every morning-- not
perfect, but pretty

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.150
consistent.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.900
But that same person may or
may not be so good at

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.150
completing homework
assignments.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.430
And that person that's very
consistent on completing

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:52.920
homework assignments may or may
not be so good on having

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.020
neat class notes.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:59.590
So it's not that people aren't
consistent, but it's far more

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:02.070
specific about what they're
consistent about than a big

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:04.910
personality dimension that
covers a range of things that

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:05.810
ought to go together.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.150
So this is situationism.

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:10.290
You behave in a certain way
in a certain situation.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:12.200
It's not like you have a
personality that moves from

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:16.300
situation to situation and
predicts the same behavior.

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.310
And here's another example of
how they follow kids in a

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:21.890
summer camp, and here's
different behaviors from one

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:23.280
child to another child.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:28.310
So this is a child who, when a
peer approaches, how verbally

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:29.600
aggressive they are.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.180
And so, aggression
is high this way.

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.320
These are different
situations.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.160
And you can see for one child
they're aggressive in this

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.570
situation when they deal with
an adult, and in this

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:39.530
situation this other child is
aggressive when he or she

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.220
deals with a peer.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.880
So if you were to say there's
an aggressive thing about

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.710
people-- they're aggressive or
they're not-- well, this

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:47.890
person's aggressive with a
peer, and this person is

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:51.070
aggressive specifically
with an adult.

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:53.430
And so is aggressiveness
a personality thing?

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:56.430
Or situation by situation
by situation?

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:58.100
In the movies you see
all the time--

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.920
if you watch The Sopranos or
many movies, it's not uncommon

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.590
to have the crime figure be
really kind of nice with his

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:10.450
family, and really brutal with
a competing criminal gang.

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:10.600
Right?

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.350
Have you seen that?

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:15.330
They're kind of nice at home,
and then they go shoot people

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.350
on two seconds notice
if they're

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:18.220
fighting about something.

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.700
So you see that kind
of an idea.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.510
Another thing that people have
looked at that's related to

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:28.760
personality is temperament.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.190
So it's an innate, biologically
based propensity

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:34.900
to engage in a certain
style of behavior.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.050
It's broader than a trait.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:39.230
I'll describe one that's been
well studied, but people like

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.540
it because they think
it's observable.

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.720
So with traits, it's hard to
just look at you and say

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.430
you're extroverted or you're
conscientious.

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:48.020
I could follow you around
all day and

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.690
maybe have an estimate.

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:52.830
But here, temperaments are
broader than traits, and you

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:56.050
can see it in terms of
people's sociability,

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:57.680
emotionality and
activity level.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.460
You can just follow
them and see them

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.260
behave in certain ways.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.910
So let's think about the
temperament of shyness.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:06.350
So the way these studies were
done at Harvard was that some

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:08.240
babies, even at six weeks,
are more reactive

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.150
to make sudden noises.

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:10.410
They're more fussy.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:12.620
About 20% of children
could be that way.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.925
They make a noise or something
and they cry, they get

00:38:14.925 --> 00:38:16.650
disturbed, they're unhappy.

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.870
And so he called those children
high-reactive or

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:21.610
inhibited babies.

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:23.120
They use those two terms
for the same

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.540
idea, versus low reactive.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.770
Ones who were very disturbed by
the environment, and ones

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:29.800
who were, like, no big deal.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.770
And the ones who were inhibited
babies cried more,

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:34.870
they were distressed more, they
showed more activity,

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:38.110
faster heart rates, higher
levels of cortisol.

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:39.720
And they even have-- they could
measure this in some

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.440
cases-- faster heart rates
in the womb, even

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.790
before they were born.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:43.820
Their hearts were racing.

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.750
So all they'd need is that
one last little thing.

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:47.680
And the idea is that maybe
their sympathetic nervous

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.360
system is easily aroused,
seeks less arousing

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.170
situations, and it's inhibited
because they're already

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:56.700
internally so aroused,
they want calm.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.200
So there's going to be a
surprise in this story.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.830
But as you go, in terms of
thinking about shyness, and

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:04.780
you can measure these at two
months or four months with

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:06.660
these very simple little things
you do with babies to

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.020
see how they respond
to some noise.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.580
And to a decent extent, it
predicts shyness in later

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.140
childhood and adulthood.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.780
About a quarter of the children
who look pretty

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:19.990
inhibited aren't shy, but about
75% who look pretty

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.480
inhibited end up shy.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.230
So that's a pretty good
prediction from a

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:25.290
two-month-old to
a young adult.

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.330
About 75% of these
children who look

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.800
pretty shy at two months--

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.440
and of course, they're not shy
in a group, they're just

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.970
responding to noises--

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:35.040
end up being kind of
shy as adults.

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:44.000
And they studied these until age
21, and again, in several

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.530
outcomes, specifically things
like-- let's pick one--

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.240
crime, how often they
get in crime.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.270
Children who are well controlled
don't get so much

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:54.740
into crime.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:59.410
Children who at 21 had poor
control at age three are more

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:00.650
likely to get into trouble.

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:04.130
So as if these temperament
factors in early, early

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:07.420
childhood are already risk
factors for doing better or

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:10.610
worse in the world.

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:14.320
Another one that people enjoy
studying is sensation seeking.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.130
You know, the bungee jumpers,
the people who like to

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:20.770
parachute, people who enjoy
the thrill of activities,

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:23.160
novel, high-stimulation
situations.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.920
Statistically they have more
fun, probably, in some ways.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.070
They're more likely to dive,
they're more likely to drive

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:31.100
fast, they're more likely to
have drug or alcohol use,

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.900
they're more likely to send
flame emails, listen to punk

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.260
music, and have driving
accidents.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:38.460
So it's an interesting mix
of enjoyment and trouble.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:41.540
And there's some evidence they
have lower levels of something

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.740
in the blood that may be a
measure of something that lets

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:47.710
dopamine last longer in the
synapse in your brain.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:50.800
Dopamine is the reward
neurotransmitter.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.330
So you could imagine that if
the reward hangs around

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:56.820
longer, maybe you're more
drawn towards instantly

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.750
rewarding things.

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:04.745
Another sort of, I think,
two-dimensional classification

00:41:04.745 --> 00:41:06.060
of personality.

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.790
Again, one dimension that
he focused on was this

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:11.620
introversion to extroversion
or stable to unstable.

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.600
This is neuroticism or
introversion/extroversion in

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.280
the big five.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.220
But there's some interesting
turns on this.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.160
Here's the interesting turn.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.380
I mentioned it, but let me
tell you one more time,

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:22.250
because it's counter-intuitive.

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.120
It's the opposite of what you
think in terms of what people

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.390
have found.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:27.860
So we think of extroverts as
people who go to parties, are

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.620
very talkative, very outgoing,
run around and have a social

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.390
time, and introverts as more
likely to be shy, quiet,

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.940
withdrawn, right?

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.920
That's the definitions
of the words.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.495
But what people have found in
a variety of studies is that

00:41:39.495 --> 00:41:40.310
extroverts-- the outgoing
people--

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.710
are less easily aroused.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:44.020
So it's as if they
seek stimulation.

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:48.110
It's as if their internal
arousal is low, and they want

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.280
things that are stimulating in
their environment to push up

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.400
their internal arousal, right?

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.170
Introverts are the
opposite around.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:57.460
Introverts are aroused already,
and it's as if they

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.780
seek environments that are
quiet, so their arousal is not

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:02.820
pushed above some level
of discomfort.

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:05.120
So intuitively you might think
extroverts are more aroused

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:10.530
internally, but the thought is
that extroverts are actually

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:14.170
seeking arousal because they're
a little lower inside.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.800
Introverts are already feeling
pretty aroused, so they don't

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.630
need more bungee jumping.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:22.690
They're already feeling like
they're bungee jumping, OK?

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:24.760
So then they're all seeking
this sort of

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.260
optimal level of arousal.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.070
So, for example, extroverts do
better in noisy settings, they

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:32.900
can take the extra stuff,
they don't mind it.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.820
Introverts are more sensitive
to pain, and they salivate

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:36.700
more to lemon juice.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:41.570
They're already kind of revved
up, is the story, internally.

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:43.730
So here's one--

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:46.560
we couldn't do this early in
the course, and this almost

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.420
has practical concept--

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.040
you could think about this
for your own test taking.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.025
A three-way interaction.

00:42:53.025 --> 00:42:55.690
This is three factors that all
interact with one another in

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:58.790
performance, and it involves
situation and personality.

00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:59.970
So here we go.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:01.840
So the three factors are whether
you're introverted or

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.540
extroverted, whether you're
taking a test-- a GRE kind of

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:08.610
a test-- in the morning or the
afternoon, and whether you

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:11.390
drank a cup of coffee before
the test or not.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:14.160
Three different things
floating around.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.010
And here's what people have
found several times in

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:18.920
experiments when you're
taking a test.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.840
Here's the upshot
of the studies.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:25.180
If you're introverted and the
test is in the late afternoon

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:27.210
or evening, drink coffee.

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:30.230
If you're outgoing, drink
coffee in the morning.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:32.820
And I'll tell you the
logic of this.

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.500
All right?

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.140
So here's the idea.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.190
Many studies have shown-- and
you may know this, if you

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:41.250
think about people you
know or yourself.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.630
On average, introverts are most
aroused in the morning.

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:45.240
They tend to be get up early in
the morning and get their

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.430
day going people.

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:48.310
Maybe because they didn't
party deep into

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:50.400
the previous night.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.345
There's cause and effect that's
really hard to pull out

00:43:52.345 --> 00:43:54.520
in all of this.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.340
But introverts are more aroused
in the morning and

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.620
less in the evening.

00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:59.206
On average, they're the kind of
people who are get up early

00:43:59.206 --> 00:44:00.500
in the morning, go
do their stuff.

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.450
In the evening they want to
mellow down and maybe not go

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:04.450
to sleep so late.

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:06.590
Extroverts are more aroused
in the evening,

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:07.810
and less in the morning.

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:09.300
And this is on average,
and this has been

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.650
found a number of times.

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:13.050
So again, you can imagine if
you're taking a test, if

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:16.040
you're under-aroused,
you could use the

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.070
coffee to perk you up.

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:18.830
If you're over-aroused, the
coffee is going to make you

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:20.470
jittery and push you over.

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:22.260
So depending on the time of day,
you're going to be in one

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.430
state or the other depending
on the kind of

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:24.190
personality you have.

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.710
Does that make sense?

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:28.070
These three things come together
like that in the

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:30.660
famous Yerkes-Dodson Law of
performance, which is this.

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:33.030
And this is observed
in many years.

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:34.830
Here's arousal, how
aroused you are.

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:39.030
Super aroused, super nervous,
shaky, so sleepy you're about

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:41.110
to crash out.

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:42.540
Somewhere in the middle
usually goes with best

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.130
performance, because
this is too much,

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:46.950
and this is too little.

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:47.630
You know that.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:49.900
If you're too nervous, you don't
tend to perform well.

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.760
If you're too kind of out of
it, you don't perform well.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.830
Somewhere in the middle
is just right.

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.690
So here's extroverts,
for example.

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:02.460
In the morning, they're pretty
low on this, they could use

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.860
some coffee to move
to optimal.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.976
Here's introverts in the
morning, they're already ready

00:45:06.976 --> 00:45:08.720
to go, I'm ready to go,
I'm ready to go.

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.820
The last thing they need
is more coffee.

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:14.520
I hope it's not a bubble test
because my hands are shaking.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.050
OK?

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:17.490
So three things.

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:20.450
The kind of personality you
are, the time of day, and

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:22.920
whether your drinking coffee
helps you to move to this

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.880
middle position or not.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.420
Does that makes sense?

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:27.760
So that's three different
factors sort of adding up to

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.120
optimize performance or not.

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.390
OK, lastly I'd like to talk a
little bit about some things

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:37.400
we know about brain correlates
of personality.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:42.480
And in some areas, these brain
things are more informative at

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.490
a broad level.

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:45.420
Because sometimes people will
say, well, personality is all

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.900
this check box stuff.

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.830
Is it even relevant to
anything biological?

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:50.900
Now, if it's relevant
to behavior,

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.370
it's relevant to biology.

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:56.140
Behavior is biology, or
biology is behavior.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.650
We're not going to get one
relative to the other.

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:00.490
But still, until recently,
people couldn't measure this.

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:01.780
So these are pictures of--

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.530
not of brain functions, of a
task turning on-- we'll see

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:05.920
pictures of those in a moment.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.510
This is measurement of
brain structure.

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:11.880
Measurement of brain
structure.

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:15.470
And specifically, thickness
of cortex.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:17.920
So what you're seeing is a
statistic here, which is, the

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.710
more extroverted you are, the
thicker your cortex is here.

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:23.740
The more conscientious, the
thicker your cortex here.

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:28.700
The more neurotic, the thicker
your cortex here, and so on.

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:31.720
So we don't understand these
deeply, but we do see

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.130
physically measurable
correlates of these

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:36.250
personality dimensions.

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:38.500
So that's physical
brain structure.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.090
Let's talk about some
function things.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:44.370
This is a slide you saw before
that in the amygdala, the more

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:46.960
emotionally intense something
is, the more the response.

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.890
The more neutral it is,
the less the response.

00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:53.170
Here's a positive happy
picture, right?

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:54.140
I'm going to show you
a neutral picture.

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:56.140
I'm going to show you
now the bad picture.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:57.470
Don't look if you don't
want to see it again.

00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:58.260
It's the one you saw before.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.250
Close your eyes for a moment.

00:46:59.250 --> 00:46:59.850
Bad picture.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:00.010
OK.

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:00.580
Here we go.

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:01.940
Now you can all look.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.990
So people are introverted
or extroverted.

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:07.560
Extroverts are sociable,
talkative.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:11.020
Introverts are, on average,
more reserved or quiet.

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:14.150
Extroverts report more positive
experiences, more

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:16.120
susceptible to positive
mood induction.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.440
Lots of evidence for some
differences among them.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.520
So imagine a study where you
show people positive and

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.320
negative slides.

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:24.510
Again, people will say, well,
if I'm on a diet, this is

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:28.230
really negative, or something.

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:29.090
You have people rate them.

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:30.760
But on average these are
negative, and on average these

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.790
are positive.

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:36.120
You measure their personality,
and here's what you find in

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.370
the amygdala.

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:43.590
The more extroverted they are,
the more their amygdala

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:46.060
responds to positive things.

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:48.480
The more introverted they are,
the more it responds to

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.830
negative things.

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:53.390
So here's exactly what we mean
by personality sort of

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:54.220
instantiated in one example.

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:55.990
And it's not the only example.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:57.030
What do we mean by
personality?

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:59.370
We mean there's a constant
situation--

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:01.760
let's pretend a party
you go to.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.090
A party deep in my memory.

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:05.310
I remember parties I went to,
the music is playing, and

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:07.930
there's sticky beer on the
floor, and there's people you

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:09.590
know and a lot of people
you don't know, right?

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:12.810
So who walks in the door and
thinks this is awesome?

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:14.230
The extrovert, right?

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:17.240
Who walks in the door and thinks
why did my friend drag

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:17.720
me to this?

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.500
I could be doing something
good like chess at home.

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:26.270
So now, identical situation,
different-- but that's true of

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:27.970
so many things and preferences
in life.

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:29.950
That's almost what we mean
by personality, right?

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:31.750
Who likes what?

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:34.020
Situations, people,
activities.

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:38.230
So for extroversion, here's the
amygdala going, positive

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:39.410
things, whoopee!

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:42.620
They notice, so to speak, in
their amygdala the positivity

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:43.210
of the environment.

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:45.250
They're drawn to things because
they see positive.

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:47.850
Here is the introverts going,
danger, danger.

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:48.570
OK?

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:51.030
Everybody sees the same set of
slides, but people are drawn

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:53.580
to the positive or the negative
aspects of this.

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:54.850
And you could say, is one
better, the other worse?

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:55.710
Well, no.

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:58.110
Avoiding dangerous things
is a good idea.

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:00.130
Enjoying positive things
is a good idea.

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:01.830
One is not better
than the other.

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:02.850
They're just different.

00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:05.570
You're tuned to different
rewards in life.

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:07.490
And this is one example
of that.

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:09.440
How about a smiling face?

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:12.610
Who thinks a smiling face is an
invitation to go over and

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:13.290
meet somebody new?

00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:15.760
The introvert or
the extrovert?

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.646
Help me on this.

00:49:16.646 --> 00:49:18.820
Who thinks the smiling
face is pressure?

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:19.770
Do I go over?

00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:21.020
Are they smiling at me?

00:49:23.696 --> 00:49:25.450
Or I'm going to go over
and then they're

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:26.700
not gonna like me.

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.260
They like me now, right?

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.220
I should tell you,
I was quite--

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.920
only in my teaching mode do
I appear extroverted, OK?

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.310
But I definitely was
an introvert in

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:36.550
high school and college.

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:38.080
So if I make fun of
introverts, I'm

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.820
making fun of myself.

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:43.970
So here's a response
to fearful faces.

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:45.910
And we talked about that
before, response in the

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:48.040
amygdala regardless
of personality.

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.700
But now when we talk about the
response in the amygdala for

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:55.070
happy faces, big response if
you're extroverted, little

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:56.790
response if you're
introverted.

00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:59.630
Because a happy face is like
compelling, cool, wonderful

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:04.780
for the extrovert, and not as
enticing for the introvert.

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.670
So again, the way we might
imagine, how do individual

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:08.980
differences in personality
play out?

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.130
They play out that some things
are beguiling, wonderful, and

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:13.070
other things not so much.

00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:15.652
And depending on your
personality, that can vary.

00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:22.620
So these are the children who
were studied from the ages of

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:29.130
two and four months who were
shy in temperament,

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:30.700
inhibited, in orange.

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.035
And they compared them to
the most uninhibited.

00:50:33.035 --> 00:50:34.680
They take the extremes.

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.950
But it's a very rare thing when
you have a behavioral

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:40.770
assessment of a child in their
infancy, and then you brain

00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:44.950
image them about 20 years later
when they're grown up.

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:48.440
So now you're making this 20
years of your life story, and

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:51.380
again in the amygdala, what
they find is this.

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:56.080
If you look at the people who
are uninhibited, here's a

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.570
novel face they see for the
first time in the scanner, or

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:00.440
a face they've seen many times,
and there's not much

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.770
difference.

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:03.380
For the people who are
inhibited, you see a much

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.990
bigger amygdala response
to the novel face.

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:08.130
Well, this is exactly what you
might intuitively think

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:09.930
shyness would be about.

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:12.490
If you're a shy person and you
know somebody well, I think a

00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:14.440
lot of shyness disappears.

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.460
But where shyness shows the most
is a face that you don't

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:20.560
know, a new person you haven't
met, and maybe you're not so

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.290
comfortable with them yet.

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:25.300
So this is exactly the pattern
you might expect, that it

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.470
doesn't matter too much for an
extrovert, a new face, a

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:28.910
familiar face--

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:30.635
made familiar in the experiment,
not somebody you

00:51:30.635 --> 00:51:31.470
really know--

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:33.230
it doesn't make much
of a difference.

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:35.825
For the person who is inhibited,
much more response

00:51:35.825 --> 00:51:38.585
to the face they see for the
first time only, as opposed to

00:51:38.585 --> 00:51:42.275
a face they've grown
familiar with.

00:51:42.275 --> 00:51:45.130
A couple more examples
along this line.

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:46.010
Here's another scale.

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:47.550
There's an infinite
number of them.

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:50.340
The Spielberger State and Trait
Anxiety, so, state and

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:50.980
trait, right?

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:53.720
So they ask you-- this is just
a reminder of that--

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:54.750
how do you feel right now?

00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:55.520
That would be your state.

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:56.210
Right now.

00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:57.280
Do I feel at ease?

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.400
Do I feel upset?

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.770
And in general, how do you
feel, at ease or upset?

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:04.100
So this is day in day out,
this is right now.

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:07.200
We're going to focus on the
trait, how you say you feel

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.810
day in, day out.

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:12.630
And now they're going to show
you faces of people who are

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:17.020
shown in full view, or who are
shown in a subliminal masked

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.000
version where a fear or neutral
face is followed by

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:19.730
another face.

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:21.010
This is the critical face.

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:24.060
So you see a face that you see
pretty well, or you see a face

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:26.310
that's presented under
circumstances where you can't

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:28.820
tell what the face was.

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:29.880
OK?

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.210
At first they say, what happens
if we show you the

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:34.720
regular face that you
see perfectly well?

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:35.850
Nothing makes much
of a difference.

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:37.550
Here's the amygdala response
to fearful face.

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:39.980
You've seen this now
multiple times.

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.620
But kind of interestingly, you
get a smaller response in the

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:46.600
amygdala, and it's driven by
how anxious you report

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:49.150
yourself to be on
a regular basis.

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:51.630
So the interpretation is this.

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:53.930
If you see a fearful face, you
go, well, it's a fearful face,

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.620
I know it's a fearful phase,
we're all the same.

00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:59.190
If you subliminally present
it, you have an

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:02.080
unknown source of danger.

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:07.030
What we intuitively imagine
anxiety is is feeling danger

00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:10.600
or threat in your environment
more than is helpful, more

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:11.950
than is comfortable.

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:12.700
OK?

00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:14.330
And you don't even
know exactly why.

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:16.040
It's not entirely rational
when you're

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.790
anxious in that way.

00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:20.350
And so what happens is, the more
anxious you are, the more

00:53:20.350 --> 00:53:24.120
these subliminal faces drive an
amygdala response, and you

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.010
don't have control over that,
because you don't know what

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.910
happened, because it was
subliminally presented.

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:29.040
Does that make sense?

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.340
When it's clear, everybody
knows what to do.

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:33.740
It's just a face and
not that scary.

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:36.630
But when it's an unknown source
of a bit of unease, the

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:39.430
more chronically anxious you
are, the more the brain's

00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.910
responding.

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:42.420
Or we might say, the bigger
the brain response is the

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:47.270
basis, perhaps, of the
chronic unease.

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:49.710
So we talked also before about
the amygdala being important

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:53.050
for recognizing fearful
expressions.

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:56.340
And then I want to share
two last examples.

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:57.800
How about genetic influences?

00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.280
So we know genes are a big part
of the story, but how big

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:00.970
a part of the story?

00:54:00.970 --> 00:54:02.840
So again, we talked about
single nucleotide

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:06.330
polymorphisms, common
genetic variance.

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:08.450
And here's one that involves
a serotonin

00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:10.830
transporter in the amygdala.

00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:15.380
There's a short or long allele,
so we'll have two of

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:16.660
these, all of us.

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.650
The short allele is
weakly correlated

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:20.930
with anxiety traits.

00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:23.890
All this genetic stuff is pretty
weak at the moment, for

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:25.830
reasons that are not
well understood.

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.630
I'm only presenting you ones
that have been at least

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:28.780
replicated once.

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:31.070
But practically every genetic
example I'm going to show you,

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:33.190
there's been non-confirmations
as well.

00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:34.740
We don't know why this is.

00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:37.410
The genes are just so far away
from complex human behaviors

00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:38.950
is probably the answer.

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:41.710
But what has been replicated
a number of times is this.

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:45.200
If they show you fearful faces,
and you have the short

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.160
allele, the one that's slightly
associated with

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:50.145
anxiety, this is the difference
between people with

00:54:50.145 --> 00:54:51.730
the long allele and the shorter
allele, a much more

00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:54.910
powerful response to fearful
faces if you

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:55.790
have the shorter allele.

00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:58.470
So a single gene can be
correlated with a more potent

00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:01.060
response to a sort of
threat stimulus.

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:03.550
And again, that goes with our
sense of anxiety, and what we

00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:06.610
might call a less than desirable
response to threat

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:08.810
in the environment.

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:12.410
So here's the last two slides.

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:17.430
But it's the dream we all have
in understanding people, and

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:19.470
actually all animals on the
face of this planet, but

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:22.120
people most of all if you're
curious about people, which

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:25.380
is, what is the interaction
between the genes we're born

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:27.730
with and the life we lead,
and how does that end up

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:29.480
with us being us?

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:32.950
And it's incredibly hard to
study that, because everybody

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:37.350
says in biology and
neuroscience, we know it's a

00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:39.780
gene by experience
interaction.

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:43.020
The genes will make you strong
in some circumstances and

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:44.850
vulnerable in others.

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:46.530
But it's very hard
to specify that.

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:48.590
The genes have been
hard to identify.

00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:50.610
And we can't put people
into experiments.

00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:53.340
We can't say, we'll take two
identical twins and we'll put

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:56.290
one into some horrible household
full of stress and

00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:58.720
horribleness, and then one into
a delightful household,

00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.730
and then see them at 20
and see what happened.

00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:01.210
OK?

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:02.440
We're just not allowed
to do that, right?

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:06.620
So we can't experiment on the
environment, and the genes are

00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:11.040
poorly understood, very poorly
understood, in relation to

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.850
basic human behaviors.

00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:15.630
But there's a study from Caspi
that is a glimpse of where we

00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:16.730
think the field might
be going.

00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:19.200
But I'm going to warn you that
this has not always been

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.520
replicated.

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.150
It's been replicated sometimes,

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.940
but not other times.

00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:26.700
So it's an asterisk, but it's
still a finding that's really

00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:29.790
quite striking, if it turns
out to be roughly correct.

00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:32.800
So again, this is polymorphism
of the same gene that's

00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.880
associated with anxiety.

00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:37.870
And what they did in a very
large sample in New Zealand

00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:46.040
was catalog stressful life
events ages 21 to 26, job,

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.820
whether you have a job or not,
your salary, decent housing,

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:50.950
terrible housing, good health,
bad health, happy

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:52.830
relationships, no relationships,
terrible

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:53.480
relationships.

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.940
People are filling out forms
telling you about the stresses

00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:57.530
in their life.

00:56:57.530 --> 00:57:00.830
And then they also have
information about childhood

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:01.380
maltreatment.

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:04.700
Some of these children, very
sadly, when they were younger

00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.080
were treated very poorly, they
were abused in some way or

00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:10.610
another, were in very terrible
circumstances, and some not.

00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:12.920
So they're going to look at
stressful events in childhood

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:18.350
and adulthood, and sort them
out by the allele that the

00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:21.720
individuals have, the gene
version, and what they find

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.360
is-- and I'll show you the
graph in a moment--

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:25.680
more depression and suicidality
in response to

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:29.310
stressful events if you have a
short version of the allele.

00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:31.650
The short version, we just said,
is the one that seems to

00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:35.025
drive a bigger anxiety response
to fearful faces in

00:57:35.025 --> 00:57:36.220
the amygdala, OK?

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:40.570
So it seems, first pass, to be
a gene that's associated with

00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:45.120
responding in a more anxious way
to environmental stress,

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:47.810
threat, and bad things.

00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:49.010
So here's a couple of graphs.

00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:50.430
I'll just do a couple
with you.

00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:55.170
Here's the probability of major
depression if you've had

00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:59.130
no maltreatment as a child, if
you've probably had some, or

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:02.650
you've had documented horrible
maltreatment as a child.

00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:04.920
And what you can see if you have
the long version-- this

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.070
is this line here--

00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:09.610
the long version of this
allele, no difference.

00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:14.910
It's as if if you happen to be
born in the biological lottery

00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:18.920
that we all participate in at
birth with these version of

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.140
these genes-- and maybe many
other genes that are part of

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:23.890
this story, but they just
measured this one.

00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:27.610
That it doesn't matter whether
you live in a nice supportive

00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:30.970
environment or a brutalizing,
horrible one, your probability

00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:32.800
of depression is
about the same.

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:36.560
It's a protective gene for
stresses of life that are

00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:37.900
visited upon you.

00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:42.070
If you have the opposite,
the short version, look.

00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:44.840
The worse the environment, you
double your chances of

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:46.230
depression.

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:50.660
It's as if you're born with a
gene that, if you're given a

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:51.910
terrible environment--

00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:54.200
this is exactly the interaction,
right--

00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:57.090
then you're very susceptible
to that.

00:58:57.090 --> 00:59:01.540
And you see the same rough
pattern in all of them, that

00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:05.310
individuals who have this
version of the gene seem to be

00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:09.520
relatively impervious to
environmental stressors.

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:11.800
The ones born with this version
of the gene are

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.310
terribly-- so if this person's
born with this version of the

00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:15.880
gene, but happens to be
in a nice supportive

00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:17.550
household, no problem.

00:59:17.550 --> 00:59:19.010
Right?

00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:21.870
But if they happen to be born
into a household where they

00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:26.200
experience, sadly, severe
maltreatment, big problem.

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:28.300
And so this is exactly what we
imagine if we understood in

00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:32.100
any depth what people are
about, the genetic

00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:34.600
potentiations you're born with,
what's easy for you or

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.640
hard for you by genes.

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:39.380
And the world your handed as
an infant, not under your

00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:41.600
control, but the environment
you're given, supportive or

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.480
threatening, how those two
things play out in a sort of

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:50.640
duet, making you safe or
putting you at risk.

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:52.320
That's exactly what would--
then we would deeply

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:57.190
understand the biology and the
psychology of human life.

00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:58.840
So this is the kind of study
that gets a lot of attention,

00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.705
because if we had it exactly
right, which we don't yet, we

01:00:01.705 --> 01:00:03.890
would understand something
really deep about people and

01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:05.140
vulnerability in environments.
