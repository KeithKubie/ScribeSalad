00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.670
agricultural implement

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.588
that was adapted to war.

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:07.382
This is the flail.

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:10.552
It was used in un-armored
fighting into the 16th century,

00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:12.721
but we know that
the Kaiser Maximilian --

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:16.224
the Emperor Maximilian --
used flails almost exactly like

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:18.309
this in knightly
tournament fights.

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:21.813
Usually, the head has
a 360-degree pivot.

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:23.273
The physics behind that,

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:27.277
it can just deliver
an unbelievably hard hit.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:31.656
And this shaft is so heavy that
it in itself is its own weapon.

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:34.451
And you'll see people
sometimes even choke up on it

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.494
and use close in...
Yes, like a little bat, yeah.

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:37.954
...like this.
Like a billy club, yeah.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:39.497
You know,
for the most part, your hand

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:41.583
cannot be down here
or it's gonna get hit.

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.669
And you'll see it used
in a figure-8 kind of action.

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:47.881
You'll see it used
in a 360-degree

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.967
rotation clockwise,
counterclockwise.

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.887
It's, uh --
It is a mean, mean weapon.

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:59.225
Sinou: One of the most dangerous
features about a flail

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:02.604
is that it's very difficult
to defend against.

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:04.981
People general
use defensive, uh,

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:08.193
defensive postures like this,
using the haft of their weapon

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:10.111
or using the blade
of their weapon to defend.

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:11.946
-Yeah.
-This'll go -- When this hits...

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:13.698
Don't hit yourself.
...it'll go
right over the top.

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:15.408
Yeah.
And look at the range,
you know?

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.910
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.496
It's still gonna hit its target,
so defensively,

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:21.289
you're gonna have
to really be mobile.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.916
You're gonna have to use
your legs to get --

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.417
to get away from this.
-Yeah.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.628
The other thing is
the sheer weight of this.

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:30.006
The weight and the way
the weight transfers on this,

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.966
um, if you miss a shot,

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:35.887
the momentum is a lot different
than what you're used to.

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:37.889
And this also --
Like, you just saw my hand.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:41.309
As it goes around, you could
actually twist it in your hand.

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:45.104
â™ªâ™ª

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:46.689
Any time you have
a flexible weapon,

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.399
they're difficult to ward
against,

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.568
to cover against,
to parry.

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:52.987
And in this case,
this one actually has a capacity

00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:57.242
to hit your self
as you're swiping a blow.

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:59.035
-That is --
-Quite a monster.

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:01.830
Yeah. I would say that's--
it's an understatement.
