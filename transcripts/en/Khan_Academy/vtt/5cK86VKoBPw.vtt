00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.160
We're asked to look at
the table below.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.530
From the information given,
is there a functional

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:14.250
relationship between each person
and his or her height?

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.050
So a good place to start is
just think about what a

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.890
functional relationship means.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.430
Now, there's definitely
a relationship.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.740
They say, hey, if you're
Joelle, you're 5-6.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.450
If you're Nathan, you're 4-11.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.000
If you're Stewart,
you're 5-11.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.990
That is a relationship.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.050
Now, in order for it to be a
functional relationship, for

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.820
every instance or every example
of the independent

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.000
variable, you can only have one
example of the value of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.390
the function for it.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.730
So if you say if this is a
height function, in order for

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.610
this to be a functional
relationship, no matter whose

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.610
name you put inside of the
height function, you need to

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.050
only be able to get one value.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.020
If there were two values
associated with one person's

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.040
name, it would not be a
functional relationship.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.915
So if I were to ask you what
is the height of Nathan?

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.870
Well, you'd look at the table
and say, well, Nathan's height

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.910
is 4 foot 11.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.350
There are not two heights
for Nathan.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.810
There is only one height.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.790
And for any one of these people
that we can input into

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.760
the function, there's only one
height associated with them,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.660
so it is a functional
relationship.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.880
We can even see that
on a graph.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.290
Let me graph that out for you.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.340
Let's see, the highest height
here is 6 foot 1.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.370
So if we start off with one
foot, two feet, three feet,

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:57.330
four feet, five feet,
and six feet.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.680
And then if I were to plot the
different names, the different

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.600
people that I could put into our
height function, we have--

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.580
I'll just put the first letters
of their names.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.990
We have Joelle, we have Nathan,
we have Stewart, we

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.540
have LJ, and then we have
Tariq right there.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.090
So lets plot them.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.540
So you have Joelle, Joelle's
height is 5-6, so 5-6 is right

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.430
about there.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.800
Then you have Nathan.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.860
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.390
Nathan's height is 4-11.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.220
We will plot to him
right over there.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.730
Then you have Stewart.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.010
Stewart's height is 5-11.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.910
He is pretty close
to six feet.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.430
So Stewart's height-- I made him
like six feet; let me make

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.630
it a little lower-- is 5-11.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.060
Then you have LJ.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.560
LJ's height is 5-6.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.340
So you have two people with a
height of 5-6, but that's OK,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.090
as long as for each person
you only have one height.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.950
And then finally, Tariq
is 6 foot 1.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.375
He's the tallest guy here.

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:13.040
Tariq is right up here
at 6 foot 1.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.600
So notice, for any one of the
inputs into our function, we

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.810
only have one value, so this is
a functional relationship.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.695
Now, you might say OK, well,
isn't everything a functional

00:03:23.695 --> 00:03:24.180
relationship?

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.620
No!

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.530
If I gave you the situation, if
I also wrote here-- let's

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:36.030
say the table was like this and
I also wrote that Stewart

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.760
is 5 foot 3 inches.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.560
If this was our table, then
we would no longer have a

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.950
functional relationship because
for the input of

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.130
Stewart, we would have
two different values.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.980
If we were to graph this, we
have Stewart here at 5-11, and

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.980
then all of a sudden, we would
also have Stewart at 5-3.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.300
Now, this doesn't make a lot of
sense, so we would plot it

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.510
right over here.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.050
So for Stewart, you would have
two values, and so this

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.880
wouldn't be a valid functional
relationship because you

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.210
wouldn't know what value to give
if you were to take the

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.120
height of Stewart.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.600
In order for this to be a
function, there can only be

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.890
one value for this.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.960
You don't know in this situation
when I add this,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.240
whether it's 5-3 or 5-11.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.620
Now, this wasn't the case, so
that isn't there and so we

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.810
know that the height of Stewart
is 5-11 and this is a

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.300
functional relationship.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.220
I think to some level, it might
be confusing, because

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.800
it's such a simple idea.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.520
Each of these values can
only have one height

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.530
associated with it.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.600
That's what makes
it a function.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.430
If you had more than one height
associated with it, it

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.450
would not be a function.
