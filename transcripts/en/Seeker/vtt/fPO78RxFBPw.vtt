Hey guys, Amy here on DNews answering your
questions about muscles!

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.290
Neko recently asked us if we can make a video
about why our muscles grow big when we exercise.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.220
We all want to get big and strong, building
muscles to have lean bodies and to be able

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.130
to squat our coworkers for funsies.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.000
But what actually happens when you workout
that makes your muscles grow?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.250
There’s more to muscles than you might think.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.750
We have different types of muscles: cardiac,
smooth, and skeletal muscles.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.520
Smooth muscles are responsible for the contracting
movements of hollow organs like blood vessels,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.540
the gastrointestinal tract, bladder, and uterus.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.880
Skeletal muscles are made up of bundles of
individual muscle fibers that are themselves

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.150
strands of proteins that grab onto one another
and pull.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.720
These muscle are attached to bones, and it’s
the contraction, that pulling, that causes

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.330
your bones to move around your joints.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.530
That’s what happens when your muscles contract.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.710
These are controlled by the somatic nervous
system.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.560
The cardiac muscle, the one that makes your
heart pump blood throughout your body, is

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.270
involuntarily controlled.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.329
Your heart and the muscles that control it
are obviously an important part of working

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.409
out or playing sports, but when we’re talking
about building muscles we need to focus on

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.409
skeletal muscles.

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.560
There’s a little more to skeletal muscles
than just the fibers that make them up.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.130
Muscle are broadly categorized into two types.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.830
Type I or slow twitch muscles are more efficient
at using oxygen to generate energy.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.900
And as the name suggests they can work longer
before being exhausted so these are the ones

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.810
that you use for duration sports like long
distance running.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.909
Type II or fast twitch muscles rely on anaerobic
metabolism to create fuel, or more simply,

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.080
they use your body’s stored energy for shorts
bursts of activity.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.010
These are the ones your body uses when sprinting
or weightlifting.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.340
When you build muscle, you’re actually breaking
down these muscle fibres and building them

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.340
back up.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.229
There are a couple of ways to do this.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.549
Hypertrophy is an increase in the size of
the muscle due to an increase in the size

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.090
of the muscle fibers; while hyperplasia happens
when you actually split muscle fibers to eventually

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.880
grow more of them, though some trainers suspect
that this splitting doesn’t actually create

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.040
new fibers, it just changes existing ones.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.909
The exact process of muscle growth isn’t
entirely understood, but leading theories

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.090
say that lifting something heavy, like a weight,
breaks the muscle fibers apart, and then those

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.810
fibers grow back in a way that allows them
to compensate for the damage and protect themselves

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.120
against future damage.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.129
This happens naturally, but lifting speeds
the cycle up so you rebuild muscle faster,

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.169
and the more you breakdown the more you grow
back!

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.980
Which is why you need to rest between workouts;
you need to give your body time to repair

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.200
itself, and help that process along with protein.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.200
And that’s where the increase to muscles
comes from.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.200
Speaking of bulking up,Toyota has been doing
some augmentation of their own with the TRD

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200
line of Toyota Trucks.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200
Enhanced to rule the off-road!

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.379
So does this clear things up or do you still
have more questions about muscles?
