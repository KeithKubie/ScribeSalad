I had not known Richard Ernst before

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470
I had not known Richard Ernst before
 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.120
I had not known Richard Ernst before
nineteen sixty-nine when I moved from

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130
nineteen sixty-nine when I moved from
 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.549
nineteen sixty-nine when I moved from
Bell Labs to say ETH in Zurich and

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559
Bell Labs to say ETH in Zurich and
 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.099
Bell Labs to say ETH in Zurich and
Richard had just moved from California

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109
Richard had just moved from California
 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.240
Richard had just moved from California
to the ETH a few months before I did and

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250
to the ETH a few months before I did and
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.349
to the ETH a few months before I did and
they didn't have offices for us so they

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359
they didn't have offices for us so they
 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.070
they didn't have offices for us so they
just put wooden barracks on top of the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
just put wooden barracks on top of the
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.890
just put wooden barracks on top of the
physical chemistry building and the two

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900
physical chemistry building and the two
 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.950
physical chemistry building and the two
of us were there side by side isolated

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960
of us were there side by side isolated
 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.119
of us were there side by side isolated
from everybody else and we had

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129
from everybody else and we had
 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.340
from everybody else and we had
instrumentation joint the common

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350
instrumentation joint the common
 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.069
instrumentation joint the common
instrumentation in the basement and

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079
instrumentation in the basement and
 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.260
instrumentation in the basement and
that's how we started to interact and

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270
that's how we started to interact and
 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.660
that's how we started to interact and
then we organized a big Congress

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
then we organized a big Congress
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.889
then we organized a big Congress
together that was in 1974 and during the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
together that was in 1974 and during the
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.939
together that was in 1974 and during the
time we prepared this Congress

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949

we actually worked together for more

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150
we actually worked together for more
 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.110
we actually worked together for more
than 10 years so we had joint research

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120
than 10 years so we had joint research
 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.530

programs we had joint employees and I

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540

think it's fair to say that between the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870
think it's fair to say that between the
 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.040
think it's fair to say that between the
two of us return multi-dimensional NMR

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050
two of us return multi-dimensional NMR
 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.380
two of us return multi-dimensional NMR
into a useful method not only for

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390
into a useful method not only for
 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.180
into a useful method not only for
biological work but for chemistry at

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190
biological work but for chemistry at
 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.630

large and this meant long hours we often

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
large and this meant long hours we often
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.670

discussed until midnight well he had

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680
discussed until midnight well he had
 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.500
discussed until midnight well he had
only two and you see this was a very

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510
only two and you see this was a very
 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.010
only two and you see this was a very
small group and we were very tight not

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020
small group and we were very tight not
 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.250
small group and we were very tight not
to lead led the information out before

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260
to lead led the information out before
 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.970
to lead led the information out before
it was ready and so we would describe

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980
it was ready and so we would describe
 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.760
it was ready and so we would describe
this it was very difficult see there

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770
this it was very difficult see there
 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.150
this it was very difficult see there
were experimental details to be soft and

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160
were experimental details to be soft and
 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.420
were experimental details to be soft and
we needed a company to make new hardware

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430
we needed a company to make new hardware
 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.690
we needed a company to make new hardware
so that our ideas could actually be put

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700
so that our ideas could actually be put
 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.470
so that our ideas could actually be put
into experiments notice it was a very

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480
into experiments notice it was a very
 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.440
into experiments notice it was a very
intense collaboration
