00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:18.846
&gt;&gt;Tonya: I grew up here at Hartville.

00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:21.066
I moved here in third
grade and I graduated here.

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:25.986
&gt;&gt;We are kind of your
traditional small town.

00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:28.226
We've got our square with
the courthouse on it.

00:00:28.546 --> 00:00:30.976
We've got old buildings that have
been around since the Civil War era.

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.706
&gt;&gt;When I first came in
the classroom I was one

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:40.736
of those traditional teachers.

00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:42.046
I would stand in front of the class.

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:44.076
I would give the notes.

00:00:44.556 --> 00:00:48.706
Nothing really ever worked great.

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.936
&gt;&gt;And then once eMINTS was brought
in and I went through that training,

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.316
learning how to help the
students work in groups,

00:00:57.726 --> 00:01:01.206
learning how to guide them.

00:01:01.356 --> 00:01:07.386
&gt;&gt;It was amazing to see the
student who was always resistant

00:01:07.386 --> 00:01:10.056
to education gradually and slowly

00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:12.776
over the school year they start
getting involved with the group

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:16.666
and never been involved
before, start making friends

00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.396
that had never made friends before.

00:01:19.916 --> 00:01:23.166
&gt;&gt;You could see it in the
student's eyes that big "aha" moment

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:27.786
when the light bulb goes off and
you can tell they finally got it.

00:02:05.116 --> 00:02:08.636
&gt;&gt;Doug: Well today we're working
with catching up on some websites

00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:10.616
that you may or may
not be familiar with.

00:02:10.836 --> 00:02:14.366
&gt;&gt;Monica: The biggest thing we
do is help teachers learn how

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:15.906
to be learners again.

00:02:16.596 --> 00:02:18.366
&gt;&gt;Doug: Just a second
ago you guys were talking

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:19.896
about what your favorite
part of working

00:02:19.896 --> 00:02:21.626
in a technology classroom was.

00:02:21.946 --> 00:02:23.596
And so now I want you to think again.

00:02:23.886 --> 00:02:27.896
If you could create a word
or a phrase or a picture

00:02:27.896 --> 00:02:30.986
to describe what you just talked
about, what would that be?

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:33.656
&gt;&gt;One of the things I do is I
deliver the professional development

00:02:33.656 --> 00:02:34.956
for the district teachers.

00:02:34.956 --> 00:02:38.876
&gt;&gt;I try to make the trainings
be active and meaningful.

00:02:38.876 --> 00:02:41.676
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You know you've got the
live, laugh, learn and the lifetime

00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:43.946
because it's a lifetime skill
that we're teaching them.

00:02:43.946 --> 00:02:46.396
&gt;&gt;Doug: A lot of times teachers
don't get that opportunity

00:02:46.396 --> 00:02:51.466
to just be an instructional
designer with other teachers.

00:02:51.656 --> 00:02:52.686
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Enhanced interaction.

00:02:52.686 --> 00:02:54.066
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Enhanced
interaction, that's it.

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:54.696
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I like it.

00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:57.746
&gt;&gt;Doug: In a typical school day
they may work with children all day

00:02:57.746 --> 00:03:01.456
and then when the bell rings and the
students go on the bus they may have

00:03:01.506 --> 00:03:05.366
to work by themselves or they
go home and when you come

00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:07.666
to an eMINTS training you're
working with your peers.

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:09.406
&gt;&gt;Tonya: They go out and
they collect all this data

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:12.946
and they compile all these graphs
and they put it all together

00:03:12.946 --> 00:03:15.696
in the PowerPoint and they have
to stand up and teach the rest

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:18.996
of the class, they have a better
understanding of those concepts

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:23.086
of the scientific method and
how important your hypothesis is

00:03:23.086 --> 00:03:25.866
and how you have to follow
that all the way through.

00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:28.106
&gt;&gt;Doug: Here's what we will
do next with that word,

00:03:28.106 --> 00:03:33.126
phrase or picture is we have a
graffiti wall and we're going to ask

00:03:33.206 --> 00:03:37.756
that you come up, select a
pen and either write your word

00:03:37.796 --> 00:03:41.056
or write your phrase or draw your
picture on the graffiti wall.

00:03:43.546 --> 00:03:48.436
&gt;&gt;Tonya: Doug Caldwell, you know, he
stands up there and he models what 

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:50.376
us as teachers should be
doing in the classroom.

00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:53.256
After the explore time
he brings us all back

00:03:53.256 --> 00:03:57.976
and had us do a graffiti wall, a
sharing what we learned and 

00:03:57.976 --> 00:04:00.536
talking about as a group 
"Here's what I looked at,

00:04:00.536 --> 00:04:01.756
what am I going to do with it?"

00:04:01.756 --> 00:04:04.916
so that helps me to know that
in my classroom it's important

00:04:04.916 --> 00:04:08.626
to get them back in that group and
say "Okay, here's what I've done."

00:04:08.626 --> 00:04:11.586
So other students can kind of
like "Oh, I've got an idea now."

00:04:11.586 --> 00:04:14.346
&gt;&gt;Monica: It's a two-year program.

00:04:14.686 --> 00:04:17.436
The person who is doing their
professional development sessions

00:04:17.496 --> 00:04:21.776
facilitating those, comes into their
classroom on at least a monthly basis

00:04:22.186 --> 00:04:26.586
so they are very tightly woven with
eMINTS, with their facilitator,

00:04:26.816 --> 00:04:31.036
with the materials and with their
colleagues in this learning community

00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:35.466
over a period of two years and that's
when the changes begin to take place.

00:04:35.906 --> 00:04:40.826
&gt;&gt;Student: Every animal has to have
its adaption to its environment.

00:04:40.856 --> 00:04:41.366
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:04:41.366 --> 00:04:42.976
&gt;&gt;Doug: Why do you think
that understanding that all

00:04:42.976 --> 00:04:44.666
that stuff you just
mentioned is important?

00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:47.516
&gt;&gt;Student: It's
important to know

00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:48.806
if the animal can live there or not?

00:04:48.806 --> 00:04:52.106
&gt;&gt;Tonya: What I want you to
do now is I need you to come up

00:04:52.696 --> 00:04:57.056
with either a picture or a word

00:04:57.706 --> 00:05:00.876
that represents what
you just talked about.

00:05:01.226 --> 00:05:06.516
&gt;&gt;What has helped me is, I choose one
thing, maybe one lesson I really want

00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:10.876
to work on and I work on it
and I get it done and I use it

00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:13.546
with the students and then
I'll move on to another lesson.

00:05:16.526 --> 00:05:19.656
&gt;&gt;Doug: We're bringing technology
to the rural school, instead

00:05:19.656 --> 00:05:21.476
of throwing a teacher in
that room and saying "Hey,

00:05:21.476 --> 00:05:23.066
enjoy all your new tools."

00:05:23.476 --> 00:05:27.246
We try to talk about, during the
trainings, how we will use the tools,

00:05:27.246 --> 00:05:28.996
how would students use the tools?

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:30.996
What is the role of the teacher?

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:32.646
What is the role of the technology?

00:05:33.276 --> 00:05:35.906
&gt;&gt;Doug: I saw your entry point 
where you used the graffiti wall.

00:05:35.906 --> 00:05:37.696
&gt;&gt;Tonya: Yes that was a
really neat thing last night.

00:05:37.696 --> 00:05:40.256
I really liked using it
so I really enjoyed it.

00:05:40.316 --> 00:05:45.186
It helped us focus our attention on
our unit so I think it's a great-

00:05:45.186 --> 00:05:46.216
I'm hoping to use it more.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:50.356
&gt;&gt;I have discovered that if
students are digging and finding it

00:05:50.356 --> 00:05:53.356
for themselves they will
learn it much better.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:57.676
So it has really changed
my view of education.

00:05:58.536 --> 00:06:01.766
&gt;&gt;Doug: A teacher met me in the
teacher's lounge and she was crying.

00:06:01.996 --> 00:06:04.556
She said "That was the most
powerful thing I've ever done.

00:06:05.576 --> 00:06:06.786
I really took a chance.

00:06:07.086 --> 00:06:10.016
I wasn't sure that my students
would respond, but I followed

00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:12.856
through then the students
generated some terrific questions.

00:06:13.426 --> 00:06:16.116
And there are things that I wouldn't
have thought of as an adult."

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:19.906
And it was really meaningful to the
students because they were trying

00:06:19.906 --> 00:06:22.366
to solve problems that
meant something to them.
