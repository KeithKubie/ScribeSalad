00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:10.350
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.810
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Gulsun Saglamer,
thank you for being with us.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.270 position:56%
It's a privilege for us to have you.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:23.930
And you are the president of the
Technical University of Istanbul.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.280
And as I heard yesterday, not only
the only one who is president,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.110
the only woman president of
such an institute in Turkey,

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.740
but the only one in Europe.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.080
And probably one of the
very, very few in the world

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.840
who has reached this position.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.060
Why don't you tell us
something about your background.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.360
Where did you grow up?

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.620
How did you make it [laughs]?

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.160
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Well, thank
you very much for inviting me here.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.980
It's a great honor for me.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.070
And in terms of technical
universities

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.620
and technology universities,
the information is right.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.400
I'm the only female director

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.890
in the Europe among the
technical universities.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.480
And we are going to hold a
meeting at the end of this month,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.160
a directors meeting called
technical universities

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.140
and technology universities in
Istanbul Technical University.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.950
So we are very active as a
network at European level as well.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.850
So if you look at my background.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.150
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Your background, yes.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.450
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: My background.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.860
I was born in the Trabzon which
is small city along the Black Sea

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.650
Coast, Eastern part
of Black Sea Coast.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.030
And it's a historical city.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.520
And I was born there in 1945
just after the Second World War.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.970
And I brought up there and
until 17, I was in Trabzon.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.640
And when I was nine years old, I
fell in love with architecture,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.070
and I decided to be an architect.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.370
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
What inspired you?

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.330
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Well, I think
all the buildings around us,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.100
you know, historical buildings.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.290
And new ones also came in
at that time, you know,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.530
several buildings started to
be constructed in Trabzon.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.070
So all of these activities
created important impact

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.420
on my decision, I believe.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.190
And I also read a book about
architecture in the schools.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.760
So it was a very impressive book,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.210
and I couldn't find
it later on, you know.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.270
So afterwards I checked where could
I study architecture in Turkey,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.150
and I realized that ITU
is the best place to go.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.200
So when I was ten years old,
I decided that I should go

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.050
to Istanbul Technical
University to study architecture.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.100
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
So you started young.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.400
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Yes.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.420 position:56%
So I started like that, and I came
to Istanbul when I was 17 years old.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.410
And I graduated from
Istanbul Technical University

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.940
for architecture.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.050
And I started as a research
assistant in the university.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.470
And I got all of my
degrees from my university.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.710
My PhD is also my from university.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.760
And I worked with many
research groups at the national

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.560
and international levels.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.910
And I have been very active in the
international networks as well.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.840
So all of these activities
and research activities

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.670
as well brought me to
the vice directorship

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.030
in the university in 1992.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.090
So I served as a vice
director for four years,

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.270 position:56%
then afterwards the director decided
not to run for the next period.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.690
And then I decided to
run for directorship.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.040
And at that time people
told me that, well,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.120
it's not easy to be elected because
they said that I am a female,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.630
I'm a woman, and I'm an architect
in a technical university.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.100
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Architecture is not quite.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.400
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Not, yes.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.230
It's not, you know,
very well represented,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.250
I believe, in the university.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:34.020
So I have never thought
of, you know, such a case.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.750
Because, you know, if you
would like to do something,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.750
I've never have an idea that.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.050
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
That you cannot do it.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.350
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer:
That I cannot do that.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.040
So I told them that
this is nonsense.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.830
I mean, it has no.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.130
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: No relation.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.430
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer:
No relation at all.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.160
So we started to work with our
colleagues to prepare the project

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.470
and program for the four years.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.190
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: An
architecture program?

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.490
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer:
Not architecture.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.110
The whole university.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:10.330
We created the very extensive
project, many projects, in fact.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.680
But there was an umbrella program.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:21.880
So when we started campaign, I
started to tell about our projects

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.310
and program to my people and
in our system [inaudible].

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.190
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: For director.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.490
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: For director.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.590
So I talked to the people face
to face at least half of the.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.890
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Faculty.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.190
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Faculty, yes.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.490
But on the other hand,

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.230
I also organized many small
meetings in the departments.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:54.610
So and then I had the most votes,
and I had nine male competitors.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:55.910
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Oh, really?

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.210
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Yes.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.970
But I got the most votes and
six of the candidates were sent

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.870
to the higher education council

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.840
and higher education council
elected three of them according

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.220
to their achievements
and their program.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.680
And as I was on the first place
in the list, they didn't touch it,

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.660
and they also brought our program.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.320 position:56%
And higher education council sent it
to the president of the university,

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.970
and the president of the
university appointed me.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.360
That's how it started.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.970
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
That's how it started.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.270
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Yes.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.840
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: What about
your family, your parents?

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.300
Were they supportive
of your choices?

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.760
Did they like the idea that
you were going to architecture?

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.160
Or did they think architecture
is for boys?

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.710
Or did they think, no?

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.010
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: No.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.530
I think, as I said yesterday,
I have never had any.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.670
I have never observed
any obstacle around me.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:56.190
Always my family and my
environment was very supportive.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.070
And because they wanted
girls to study,

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.050
to go further to have good
positions in the society.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.080
So my family, my father
was a businessman.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:16.490
And although there wasn't lots
of women around at the top level,

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:22.710
you know, in the small and Italian
city, but they supported me.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:29.130
I have two brothers older than
me, they supported me as well.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.430
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
They're architects?

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.730
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: No.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.320
One is engineer, mechanical
engineer.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.210
The other one is economist, so.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.510
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: I see.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.810
So each one of did his own thing.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.110
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Yes.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.410
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Yes.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:41.710
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: And
but they all supported me.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.390
And when I came to Istanbul, you
know, it was my dream came true.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.870
I mean, I'm Istanbul
Technical, I'm in the university,

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.430
Istanbul Technical University.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.170
And I'm studying architecture.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:58.360
It was the most beautiful dream
that I realized in my life.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.730
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And did
you work in architecture?

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.030
Did you build?

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.330
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Yes, I did.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.630
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Tell me.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.930
Tell me about it.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.230
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer:
Well, I love designing.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:12.470
I have designed lots of buildings,
hotel buildings, housing units,

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:18.470
settlements, and bank
buildings, office buildings.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.210
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Here in
Istanbul or all over Turkey?

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.750
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Many places.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.090
The last one that I designed
when I was the vice director

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.690
of the university is the nursery
buildings of the university.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:31.990
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Oh, really?

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.290
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Yes.

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:34.590
And.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:35.890
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
How did you design it?

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.350
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Well, I,
it's a very interesting design.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.620
Because I didn't want
to design something

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.950
which will remind us,
you know, homes.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.330
Just the normal.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.270
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: The
traditional way of doing it.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.570
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Yes.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:54.040
I try to construct design a kind
of nursery that the students,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.680
the children inside
the building will feel

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.550
that life is complicated,
not very simple.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:07.410
So the space that I wanted
to provide is giving a kind

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.220
of impression that you
have different views

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.550
from different angles.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.850
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: How interesting.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.150
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: In
the main hall, you know.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.570
So when you move inside the atrium,
you have completed different.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.870
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Perspectives.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.170
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Perspectives.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.640
So this recalled it as the
constructivist architecture.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.390
So it's in that style.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.780
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: It's
a philosophical issue.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.210
I mean, it is giving
children the idea

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.600
that there are different
perspectives to life.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.900
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer:
Yes, that's right.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.200
That's right.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.240
That's what I wanted
really to obtain.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.250
And this building got two prizes.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.830
One is national, the other
one is international.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:55.010
OECT, OECD in the year 2000 has
chosen about 50 buildings all

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.310
over the world, educational
buildings, to be awarded.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.170
And my building is one of them.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:06.940
So but I haven't designed anything
since then because I'm so busy

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.780
with directorship and
at the university.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.010
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: What are some of
the programs that you introduced?

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.020
You know, the programs
that captured the support

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.260
of the faculty and
who voted for you?

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.100
Because you said you created
a big umbrella with a lot

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.000
of different projects
for the university.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.300
What are some of the projects?

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.600
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Well, you know,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.300
just my university is a
traditional university.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.900
It was established in 1773.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:32.650
So this year we are going to
celebrate our 230th anniversary.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.120
So it's a traditional university,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.710
but we have had very young
academic staff in the university.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:44.730
This young generation, you
know, always we started to talk

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:50.520
about restructuring our
university after 1980s.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.680
We kept talking and working on
several aspect of the university.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.570
We brought the solutions
to the administration,

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:01.430
to director, to the deans.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:06.170
But we didn't get good, you know,
response from the administration.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:11.270
So I think the motivation came from
the young academics that wanted

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:16.440
to change the university and create
a kind of flexible environment

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:23.280
in which we will be able, we will
be able to have constant progress,

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.670
constant innovation,
constant development.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:31.560
And, you know, these
are the basic motives

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.530
that the people really wanted
to achieve in the university.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:42.340
So our program showed
that it's possible.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.680
If you want to change
the university,

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.190
it's possible to change it
and to restructure everything

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:54.080 position:56%
and to have a flexible
environment in which we will be able

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.040
to govern the university in
a kind of organized anarchy.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.770
Not very well defined, you know.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.720
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Yes, yes,
yes, to allow creativity.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.020
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Yes, yes.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.040
To allow people to create
many different, you know.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.340
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Innovate, yes.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.790
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Yes, innovate
and create many different ideas

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.450
and to be able to realize them.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.260
That was the main motives.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:21.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So your faculty
is also creative and involved inside

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.940
and outside the university?

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.240
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Yes.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.410
People say that, you know, when I
go to the international meetings,

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:31.940
people keep talking about
how difficult it is, I mean,

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.770
to change the traditional
university.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:39.960
But the motives came from
our young academic staff

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.540
and also from our alumni.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.130
This is very interesting

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:47.620
because alumni is very
powerful in this country.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:53.240
We have two presidents, three
prime ministers, many ministers,

00:12:53.240 --> 00:13:01.890 position:56%
many important businessmen, and many
important scientists and engineers

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:03.800
in the country and
all over the world.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.100
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
So they're very proud

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.940
of their institutions
and they support it.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.240
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Yes.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.710
And they said that we have to
restructure our university,

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.000
we have to be dynamic enough to
adjust ourselves to the changes.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.040
So alumni and young academic
staff created this atmosphere,

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.630
and I was just there.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.930
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deb: The catalyst.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.230
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Yes, just, yes.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.570
Just right time I was there.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.700
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And you
brought them together and you were.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.000
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Yes.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.300
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Well,
I have to thank you.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.680
This has been a wonderful
experience for me to learn

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.200
about the dynamic director
that you are

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.470
and the way you have
inspired your faculty.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.990
Men and women.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:51.680
And I wish you the very best in
the future of your university

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.190
and in your own future
and that of your students.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.060
And thank you so much
for being with us.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.360
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer:
Thank you very much.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.590
It has been wonderful
session for me.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:00.890
Thanks a lot.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.750
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Well, it's
been our pleasure and our honor.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.050
Thank you.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.350
&gt;&gt; Gulsun Saglamer: Thank you.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.620
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
