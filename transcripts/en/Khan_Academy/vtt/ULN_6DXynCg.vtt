00:00:00.098 --> 00:00:02.025
- [Voiceover] Kim, we've been
doing a couple of videos where

00:00:02.025 --> 00:00:06.483
we saw how slavery became more
and more of a political issue

00:00:06.483 --> 00:00:09.594
as we're going through the early 1800s.

00:00:09.594 --> 00:00:11.963
You go all the way to
the Compromise of 1850,

00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:16.281
the Fugitive Slave Act,
it really starts to anger,

00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:19.625
especially, definitely
abolitionists, who are always

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:23.131
very against slavery
under moral arguments,

00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:24.524
but, also, a lot of the anti-slave folks,

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.380
Republican party forums, and then we have

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.561
the election of Abraham Lincoln, in,

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:32.976
let's see, if we zoom in on this timeline,

00:00:32.976 --> 00:00:36.018
this is from 1860 to
1870, we zoom in there,

00:00:36.018 --> 00:00:39.315
and if we really zoom in on
the early part of that decade,

00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:42.612
Lincoln gets elected in November of 1860,

00:00:42.612 --> 00:00:44.910
which seems, at least
based on this timeline,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.743
to start catalyzing a whole
chain reaction of things.

00:00:47.743 --> 00:00:49.601
- [Voiceover] Yeah, this
is a time when things

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:54.546
happen really fast, Lincoln is
elected in November of 1860,

00:00:54.546 --> 00:00:58.842
but this is before we have
our modern election timeline,

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:02.835
when presidents actually
take office in January.

00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:05.065
Presidents in this time
period didn't take office

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:09.058
until March, so there is
this huge lame duck period

00:01:09.058 --> 00:01:11.705
where everyone's kind of
wondering what's going to happen

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:13.888
when Lincoln actually
takes the presidency.

00:01:13.888 --> 00:01:17.287
- [Voiceover] The current
president during the election

00:01:17.287 --> 00:01:20.724
is Buchanan, and he's the lame duck.

00:01:20.724 --> 00:01:21.931
Someone else has been elected,

00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:24.787
and he has to kind of
pretend to be president

00:01:24.787 --> 00:01:29.477
for, what is it, five months,
until the actual inauguration.

00:01:29.477 --> 00:01:31.497
- [Voiceover] Right, this is
no president's favorite time,

00:01:31.497 --> 00:01:33.425
when everyone knows that a new president

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:36.791
is going to be coming in, so
their influence is waning.

00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:39.740
What's important in this
time period is that,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.944
after Lincoln is elected,
and as we talked about

00:01:42.944 --> 00:01:45.893
in the last video, without
a single southern vote...

00:01:45.893 --> 00:01:47.588
- [Voiceover] He wasn't
even on the ballot.

00:01:47.588 --> 00:01:49.376
- [Voiceover] He wasn't even
on the ballot for most places.

00:01:49.376 --> 00:01:52.743
Southern states start to think about

00:01:52.743 --> 00:01:53.857
what they're going to do,

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:58.083
so they know that Lincoln is
an anti-slavery president.

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:00.196
They think that having Lincoln in office

00:02:00.196 --> 00:02:03.540
is going to be a direct challenge

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.188
to the institution of slavery,

00:02:05.188 --> 00:02:08.764
so in this period of a few months,

00:02:08.764 --> 00:02:11.852
from December, at the end of 1860,

00:02:11.852 --> 00:02:16.798
to February in 1861, the southern states

00:02:16.798 --> 00:02:18.516
think about what they're going to do.

00:02:18.516 --> 00:02:20.373
They send commissioners around saying,

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:22.417
"Do you think we should secede?"

00:02:22.417 --> 00:02:25.064
"Yeah, probably, we should secede."

00:02:25.064 --> 00:02:27.525
So in this two-month period,

00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:30.218
what they call the secession winter,

00:02:30.218 --> 00:02:33.260
seven states in the South secede.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.023
- [Voiceover] At this
point, did they think that,

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:38.786
this is an act of war by seceding,

00:02:38.786 --> 00:02:42.246
or did they think, "Hey, we
can secede if we want to"?

00:02:42.246 --> 00:02:44.335
- [Voiceover] I think
they don't really know

00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:48.120
whether the United States
is going to act decisively

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.837
to try to keep them in the Union,

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:53.484
they're just waiting to find out.

00:02:53.484 --> 00:02:58.104
- [Voiceover] At this
point, Lincoln is waiting

00:02:58.104 --> 00:03:00.682
to become president, James
Buchanan is the president.

00:03:00.682 --> 00:03:03.723
He's not really in a position
to do much of anything.

00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:07.253
When does this become an all out war?

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:09.946
- [Voiceover] Lincoln
actually takes office in

00:03:09.946 --> 00:03:14.946
March of 1861, and shortly
there after, a southern fort

00:03:16.354 --> 00:03:19.483
off the coast of
Charleston, South Carolina,

00:03:19.483 --> 00:03:21.563
Fort Sumpter, they let him know they're

00:03:21.563 --> 00:03:23.174
running out of supplies.

00:03:23.174 --> 00:03:25.643
So, this is a federal fort, which reports

00:03:25.643 --> 00:03:28.012
to Washington D.C., which is in a way,

00:03:28.012 --> 00:03:30.357
sort of trapped behind this enemy line

00:03:30.357 --> 00:03:33.050
in South Carolina, the
state that has seceded.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.908
So, Lincoln says, "All
right, well I'm going

00:03:34.908 --> 00:03:37.113
to send you a ship to resupply you."

00:03:37.113 --> 00:03:40.991
When the ship gets to
the Charleston harbor

00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:45.031
southern forces from South
Carolina fire on the ship.

00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:48.700
- [Voiceover] Lincoln
wasn't naive, he knew that

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.837
that these states had now seceded

00:03:49.837 --> 00:03:53.808
for a few months,
especially South Carolina.

00:03:53.808 --> 00:03:58.336
He knew that it was
going to be viewed as him

00:03:58.336 --> 00:04:03.336
replenishing a fort, from their point

00:04:04.094 --> 00:04:05.464
of view, on their territory.

00:04:05.464 --> 00:04:06.996
- [Voiceover] Right,
from their point of view.

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:09.411
You could also have just
said, "Here's some hungry men,

00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:11.361
I'm getting them some food, let me put

00:04:11.361 --> 00:04:13.985
my boat into the harbor,
and we'll get them

00:04:13.985 --> 00:04:15.750
their supplies and then I'll leave."

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.141
I think it was really
up to the southerners

00:04:18.141 --> 00:04:20.951
whether they used this as an opportunity

00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:23.366
to reject federal authority.

00:04:23.366 --> 00:04:26.407
- [Voiceover] And was it just
food? Or were there arms?

00:04:26.407 --> 00:04:28.126
- [Voiceover] Well, it was a federal fort,

00:04:28.126 --> 00:04:30.981
so it was everything they needed
to keep this fort running.

00:04:30.981 --> 00:04:33.071
- [Voiceover] So, it
seems like on both sides,

00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:34.789
people knew where this was going.

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.458
If war breaks out, South
Carolina is going to say,

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:39.828
"Hey, we don't want
this thing replenished,

00:04:39.828 --> 00:04:41.384
in fact, we want to take that fort. "

00:04:41.384 --> 00:04:44.216
From their point of view,
it's on their territory.

00:04:44.216 --> 00:04:45.493
Lincoln's like, "I'm not going to let this

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:49.023
whole secession thing go,
I want to replenish the

00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:50.903
force that I'm probably going to need."

00:04:50.903 --> 00:04:53.481
And then what happens?

00:04:53.481 --> 00:04:56.426
- [Voiceover] So, after
the southerners fire

00:04:56.426 --> 00:05:00.698
on this Union boat, Lincoln
realizes that this rebellion

00:05:00.698 --> 00:05:04.831
is very serious and so he calls for 75,000

00:05:04.831 --> 00:05:07.478
volunteers to come into the army

00:05:07.478 --> 00:05:09.963
and suppress the rebellion.

00:05:09.963 --> 00:05:12.504
- [Voiceover] This is shortly after the...

00:05:12.504 --> 00:05:16.080
- [Voiceover] Right, this
is just days after the April

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.330
firing on Fort Sumpter.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.941
- [Voiceover] so 75,000 volunteers,

00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:22.659
which is massive by any standards,

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.190
but the country is a lot
smaller then than it is today.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.843
- [Voiceover] Yeah, there
were only about 30 million

00:05:27.843 --> 00:05:29.236
Americans at that time,

00:05:29.236 --> 00:05:32.603
so the country is
literally ten times smaller

00:05:32.603 --> 00:05:36.922
than it is today. So,
75,000 volunteers is a lot.

00:05:36.922 --> 00:05:39.336
- [Voiceover] And then
what does that catalyze?

00:05:39.336 --> 00:05:43.887
- [Voiceover] Well, now war
is serious. The United States

00:05:43.887 --> 00:05:46.720
is gathering an army
and the southern states

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.460
know that this US army is going to invade.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.850
- [Voiceover] From their
point of view its an invasion,

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.054
from Abraham Lincoln's point of view,

00:05:56.054 --> 00:05:58.376
they're viewed as, this is a rebellion,

00:05:58.376 --> 00:05:59.978
and we're just going
to quell the rebellion.

00:05:59.978 --> 00:06:02.788
- [Voiceover] Right, so
the southern states think,

00:06:02.788 --> 00:06:05.109
"We're our own country."
They've made themselves

00:06:05.109 --> 00:06:07.129
the Confederate States of America.

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.846
Lincoln doesn't accept that
they're their own country,

00:06:09.846 --> 00:06:12.540
these are just some states
that are in rebellion

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.258
as part of the United States.

00:06:14.258 --> 00:06:19.258
- [Voiceover] At that point,
is it all out? We've only

00:06:19.737 --> 00:06:20.922
had seven states secede.

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:24.033
- [Voiceover] Right, so
there are a few states that

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:28.561
are still on the fence after
Lincoln's inauguration.

00:06:28.561 --> 00:06:32.607
They feel strong cultural
unity with the United States,

00:06:32.607 --> 00:06:36.043
but these are slave states,
and so after Lincoln calls

00:06:36.043 --> 00:06:38.737
for these 75,000 volunteers
that kind of pushes

00:06:38.737 --> 00:06:39.828
them over the edge and says,

00:06:39.828 --> 00:06:41.755
"All right, this is going to be war.

00:06:41.755 --> 00:06:44.100
It's going to be a war over
whether slavery exists,

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.678
we care about the existence of slavery,

00:06:46.678 --> 00:06:48.930
and so we're going to join with the

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.368
Confederates, in the
Confederate States of America,

00:06:51.368 --> 00:06:52.459
and join the rebellion."

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:55.664
Most notable among these is Virginia.

00:06:55.664 --> 00:06:58.752
Virginia is not on of the
original states that secedes.

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:01.236
Most of the action in
the Civil War is actually

00:07:01.236 --> 00:07:05.114
going to take place in
Virginia, and Virginia's

00:07:05.114 --> 00:07:07.366
greatest general, Robert E. Lee,

00:07:07.366 --> 00:07:11.824
is then pushed to, in his
mind, defend Virginia,

00:07:11.824 --> 00:07:13.449
and become the leading general

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:15.632
for the Confederate States of America.

00:07:15.632 --> 00:07:17.280
- [Voiceover] Geographically,
it's right at the border,

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.064
obviously their home to
a major military figure,

00:07:22.064 --> 00:07:26.011
and they were an
economically powerful state.

00:07:26.011 --> 00:07:27.311
- [Voiceover] Yes, absolutely.

00:07:27.311 --> 00:07:30.306
- [Voiceover] So then at
that point it's all out war.

00:07:30.306 --> 00:07:35.306
- [Voiceover] It's all out
war, and in July of that year,

00:07:35.693 --> 00:07:37.852
there's really the first
battle of the Civil War.

00:07:37.852 --> 00:07:42.852
First couple of months, everyone
is just gearing up for war.

00:07:43.286 --> 00:07:47.210
The forces of the United
States and the forces

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.321
of the South, finally meet in battle,

00:07:50.321 --> 00:07:53.061
what we call the Battle of Bull Run,

00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:56.962
which is in Manassas, Virginia,
northern Virginia today.

00:07:56.962 --> 00:08:00.561
People really think at
this point that it's

00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:03.533
going to be a crushing
defeat for the South,

00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:06.808
in fact people don't even
really know what war is like.

00:08:06.808 --> 00:08:11.683
There are stories that
civilians from nearby

00:08:11.683 --> 00:08:16.683
packed a picnic to come
sit on a hill above

00:08:16.953 --> 00:08:18.695
this battle and watch it, sort of like

00:08:18.695 --> 00:08:20.622
we might watch a football game now.

00:08:20.622 --> 00:08:22.944
They were quickly disillusioned of what

00:08:22.944 --> 00:08:24.430
war was actually like, they had to

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.868
run for their lives because this was

00:08:26.868 --> 00:08:30.281
a violent battle and it showed that it was

00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:31.813
not going to be a quick war.

00:08:31.813 --> 00:08:34.135
The South decisively wins this battle,

00:08:34.135 --> 00:08:37.084
and from that point forward they know

00:08:37.084 --> 00:08:39.290
it's going to be a very
long and bloody conflict.

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:43.887
- [Voiceover] You mentioned
the first seven states secede,

00:08:43.887 --> 00:08:48.340
and then you have Lincoln
building up a real army,

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.476
then you have four more states secede,

00:08:50.476 --> 00:08:52.380
even those some of these states feel

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.936
an affinity to the United States,

00:08:53.936 --> 00:08:55.677
they are slave states,

00:08:55.677 --> 00:08:57.163
but not all the slave states left.

00:08:57.163 --> 00:08:59.346
- [Voiceover] Right, there are four

00:08:59.346 --> 00:09:00.878
more slave states that stick around.

00:09:00.878 --> 00:09:04.268
Most important of those is Maryland.

00:09:04.268 --> 00:09:06.288
Maryland, of course, is right on the

00:09:06.288 --> 00:09:08.099
border of Washington D.C.

00:09:08.099 --> 00:09:09.283
- [Voiceover] D.C. is sandwiched

00:09:09.283 --> 00:09:10.584
between Maryland and Virginia.

00:09:10.584 --> 00:09:12.650
- [Voiceover] Right, and
so if Maryland leaves

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.878
and joins the rebellion,
then Washington D.C.

00:09:15.878 --> 00:09:17.874
is in real trouble because they will be

00:09:17.874 --> 00:09:19.894
completely surrounded by enemy territory.
