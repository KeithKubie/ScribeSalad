Continuing in the vein of graphing equations, let's look at a different

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:08.250
equation. y equals 3x minus 5. To move toward eventually graphing this, let's

00:00:08.262 --> 00:00:12.660
start by throwing out this xy table. I've already given you, lucky for you, all

00:00:12.672 --> 00:00:16.830
of the x values and for each of them, I'd like you to find the corresponding y

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:17.155
value.
