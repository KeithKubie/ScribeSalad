00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.490
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Welcome to the Authors at
Google presentation of "Another Science Fiction"

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.800
by Megan Prelinger. The late 1950s and early
60s were the golden age of science fiction,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.830
an era when the farthest reaches of imagination
were fed by the technological breakthroughs

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.279
of the post-war years.

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.779
While science fiction writers expressed the
dreams and nightmares of the era in pulp print,

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.550
real life rocket engineers worked on making
space travel a reality. The imaginations of

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.340
many Cold War scientists were fed by science
fiction literature and companies often promoted

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.900
their future capabilities with fantastical,
colorful visions aimed at luring young engineers

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.510
into their booming workforce.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.510
[laughter]

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.660
Well, engineering anyway. In between the dry
articles of trade journals, a new visual vernacular

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.410
sprang up. Aerospace industry ads pitched
the idea that we live in a moment where anything

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.410
was possible.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.450
Gravity was history. And soon, so would be
the confines of our solar system. "Another

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.670
Science Fiction," presents nearly 200 entertaining,
intriguing, inspiring, and mind-boggling pieces

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.381
of space age eye candy. I can tell you this
is true because I have given this book to

00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:09.880
a few people as a gift. It's a gorgeous book.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.630
It had been widely praised, in case you don't
know that or didn't read the email I sent

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.520
around. William Gibson said it is "a brilliant
tour through the iconography and literature

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.719
of America's grandest corporate dream-time--the
Space Age."

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.950
The prop master for Mad Men said that he wished
he had this book when he started Mad Men.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.600
"It is a concise visual historical reference
in mid-century advertising, unique and beautiful."

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.609
Jonathan Lethem, the author of "Motherless
Brooklyn" and "Fortress of Solitude," called

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.719
this book "stupendous."

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:48.100
And one of the founders of the science of
rocketry, who is on the rocket team that actually

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.540
built the US Space Program and consulted with
Stanley Kubrick for "2001" said, and I quote,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.289
"To the author of this remarkable work must
go well-deserved laurels for rescuing rocket

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.429
space ad artwork from virtual obscurity.

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.119
Megan Prelinger's book is a treasure that
should find worldwide readership of space

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.220
historians, lovers of space art, and all who
seek to understand the evolution of humanity's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.959
transition to a space-faring species." Which
bring us to Megan Prelinger.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.151
An independent historian and life-long collector
of space history ephemera and science fiction

00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:26.560
literature, she is co-founder and architect
of information design of the Prelinger Library--a

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.040
private research library--open to the public.
Here in San Francisco, I believe?

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.040
&gt;&gt;Megan Prelinger: Just down the street.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.750
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Just down the street, which
houses more than 40 thousand books and other

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.560
print artifacts on North American regional
and land use, history, media, and cultural

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.030
studies and technology, including a space
history collection.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.180
She is also a naturalist and a rehabilitator
of aquatic avian species. She lives and works

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.800
in San Francisco. Ladies and gentlemen, please
help we welcome Megan Prelinger.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.269
[applause]

00:02:52.269 --> 00:03:00.110
&gt;&gt;Megan Prelinger: Thank you, Chris. Wow.
That's one of the most fulsome introductions,

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.110
ever.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.799
&gt;&gt;Chris: We're glad you're here.

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.920
&gt;&gt;Megan Prelinger: [laughs] OK. Thank you
all for sticking through that, too. And hanging

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:16.379
out to hear the talk. And I hope you will
have some fun. So, this project. It started

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.269
as a project before it was a book.

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:25.689
It was about me being really fascinated, a
kind of a deep-driven history geekish, to

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:33.860
read as if they were a novel. Issues of Aviation
Week and Missiles and Rockets just straight

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:42.900
through, starting at the very early years
of the space era in the mid-1950s. And I was

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.500
looking for untold stories that might have
been contained therein.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.030
And just reading the articles, when I noticed
that suddenly, of course, it wasn't sudden--in

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:02.500
'57 something changed. The articles took on
an entirely different tone after Sputnik flew.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.439
Our American Space Program was suddenly funded
and flushed with cash.

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:13.819
Not only did the stories go from being a kind
of cautious and hypothetical to being dramatic

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:22.049
and driven and visionary. But something else
happened on the pages of the papers of the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.800
magazines, which is that advertising really--it
sprang to life.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:36.590
Almost overnight after Sputnik, the ad artwork
turned into bold colors and started this process

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:44.710
of this kind of five-year process of cross-fertilization
with science fiction literature to start to

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.720
depict and drive the space program that was
coming up ahead.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.990
One of the very earliest visual fixations
of artists doing artwork for industry was

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:06.449
the Vanguard Satellite. It was round and cute.
And it was a showcase for the developing miniaturization

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:13.930
of electronics. So, it's often depicted in
this lovely translucence. And I think one

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.199
reason Voyager was so attractive was that
its round shape suggested a little Earth,

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.770
a little Moon.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:30.229
It was visually quite distinct from say, the
Explorer satellite, that looked like a missile

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:42.710
or like a bullet. And there was a lot of work
being done in the minds of engineers and artists.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.080
And this was at a time when engineers and
artists started to work closely with one another

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.900
to visually differentiate what the peaceful
space program would look like as opposed to

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.599
what was really better-funded--the Military
space program we're all familiar with.

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:09.550
And so, shapes that drew attention towards
peaceful explorations tended to have a lot

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:16.190
more weight in the visual narrative. And as
soon as people--. We had the satellites up

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:22.520
in the air, the electronics miniaturization,
enabled satellite technology, people right

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.020
away started visualizing lunar exploration.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.139
And here's a radio set. I was always closely
tied to developments in electronics. Here

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:39.419
goes a radio set on the moon. And right along
with that was the assumption that human space

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:46.970
exploration would be enabled by the technological
developments. And there was huge excitement,

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:52.440
of course, about the prospect of lunar colonization,
Martian colonization.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:59.880
These were widely, broadly, roundly discussed
at the time. This was an artwork by an artist

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:10.580
named Willi Baum, where he's utilizing visual
modernism to depict the idea of agriculture

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:19.300
on the moon. But it act--. Here's another
Willi Baum. It actually wasn't that simple

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:27.750
because at the time, there wasn't this clear
understanding that scientific exploration

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:34.120
and the cultural value of human exploration
were their own separate things.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.780
And people tried to convince scientists that
human space exploration had the same kind

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:50.990
of scientific value as planetary sciences.
And there was this uncomfortable attempt to

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.480
align them. And because of that, human space
exploration, it actually really suffered as

00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:02.440
a cultural project. It was under contention.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:11.700
It was politically fraught. Then no less so
than today by a majority of people in Congress

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:18.080
who didn't want to fund it. Majority of scientists
who didn't think it should be funded. I guess

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:26.419
it wasn't an appropriate expression of fiscal
or technological or scientific resources.

00:08:26.419 --> 00:08:31.360
And so, when I read the articles--. So, I'm
reading Missiles and Rockets magazine and

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:40.659
watching the visual narrative of this advertising
artwork go by while reading the stories about

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:48.230
how leaders at Caltech and leaders at MIT
and leaders at the National Science Foundation

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.480
were all going on record against human space
flight.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:59.920
And I really started seeing the ads as having
their own--. They're building their own ideological

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:10.029
narrative that human space flight is beautiful
and that it's inevitable and that it's the

00:09:10.029 --> 00:09:17.500
kind of cultural totality of its significance
makes in inescapable.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:25.640
And ultimately, that cultural totalization
expressed in these images did win the day

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:32.800
'cause they spoke where they needed to speak.
And President Kennedy funded the Human Space

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.660
Flight Program. But so, the advertising was
convening this cultural ideology.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:46.410
It was also recruiting engineers at the same
time. And so, you see these different kinds

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:55.140
of dialogues going on. At once, space is peaceful,
welcoming, and inevitable. At the same time,

00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:02.450
if you're an engineer and you want to be challenged,
it's got to also look impossible and look

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:10.360
like a series of the biggest, most complicated,
and most exciting engineering problems that

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.089
have ever been faced.

00:10:12.089 --> 00:10:20.940
So, you see these, what I came to think of
as "the precarious astronaut" series of images

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:29.600
right alongside a lot of other visual ideas
and narratives that were being promulgated

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:36.640
at the same time. And then, sometimes, I'd
take a break from reading Missiles and Rockets

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.320
and Aviation Week and go look at something
else.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:47.120
And this is in Life magazine. And this was
a funny expression of the extent to which

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:56.089
our little cultural debate about space exploration
migrated out into different, and became a

00:10:56.089 --> 00:11:04.670
little driver of different kinds of anxieties
or utopian ideas. And all kinds of corners

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:05.670
of culture.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:12.560
And this is an ad for life insurance. And
it still kills me when I notice that thanks

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.320
to the gifted book designer--this was on the
cover of the book--because this is not an

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:27.260
aerospace ad. It's a borrowing of the "are
we in utopia or dystopia if we're floating

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:42.910
in space?" to tap that little wonder ball
in our heads and convince us to buy life insurance.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.630
[pause]

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:55.399
And then the ships started to get designed.
And after a while, astronauts were depicted.

00:11:55.399 --> 00:12:05.070
They were both precarious and safe at the
same time. And they're having the grand adventure.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.900
I especially like this one, this grand adventure.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:22.449
So, 1959, the era of Bonanza, we're more in
the era when the space exploration was replacing

00:12:22.449 --> 00:12:29.149
narratives of the West and cowboys and stuff
like that, as our major stuff of our cultural

00:12:29.149 --> 00:12:37.139
imagination. And here we are in this one that's
like a cabin. And the console is like a stove-top

00:12:37.139 --> 00:12:42.519
and they guy in the back is shaking a cocktail
shaker.

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:44.519
[laughter]

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:49.149
And these guys have all the space in the world
to float around and they're off having the

00:12:49.149 --> 00:12:55.529
grand adventure. One thing I learned about
studying these images is you can actually

00:12:55.529 --> 00:13:07.470
watch technological change happen in real-time
if you look behind what's behind.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:15.769
And around about 1960--this ad is from late
in 1959--and early 1960 in the technical aviation

00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:23.670
engineering journals, astronautics and aeronautics,
suddenly these huge physics proofs are published

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:29.019
that explain the relationship between volume
and cost in space.

00:13:29.019 --> 00:13:34.089
[man chuckles in audience]
And after those calculations are published,

00:13:34.089 --> 00:13:40.570
you don't see depictions of spacious space
cabins anymore.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.750
[pause]

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:54.949
So, I also learned some things about rocket
propulsion. Again, so along with electronics

00:13:54.949 --> 00:14:00.420
miniaturization, there were also some very
rapid technological changes happening in fuel

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:08.230
systems design at the time. And the design
of fuel systems was going to feed quite a

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:13.230
bit into what interplanetary spacecraft were
going to look like.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:20.899
And this ad is a negative example 'cause most
of the ones that looked like missiles did

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:31.670
not fly as ideas as visual narratives. So,
most artists working with engineers or working

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:38.870
with marketing people at engineering firms
were--. But artists were given access to engineering

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:42.029
plans and met with engineers about what they
were designing.

00:14:42.029 --> 00:14:47.380
But a lot of times, engineers were still working
at the idea level, or at the part level. And

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:53.660
it was up to the artists to figure out what
the whole might end up looking like. And so,

00:14:53.660 --> 00:15:00.080
you can some kind of not so missile-like rockets.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:06.690
And then, there were these discoveries about
you had to have spherical fuel tanks 'cause

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:11.830
of some of the molecular structures and some
of the compounds used in fuels, such as hydrogen,

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:20.270
that didn't fit well into the square or confined
spaces very well at all.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:25.839
And suddenly, artists started working with
the engineers--"How are we gonna incorporate

00:15:25.839 --> 00:15:31.810
spheres into the design of rockets that are
gonna have to periodically be, to some extent,

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:38.029
aerodynamic?" And this was an open question
and this open question is--.

00:15:38.029 --> 00:15:46.670
This is the place where art, engineering,
and science fiction merged and swirled together

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:55.550
for a few years. Here's another rocket. And
it's actually just a pile of spheres--a stack

00:15:55.550 --> 00:16:05.589
of them going to the moon. And then, this
one. How about it? The Christmas tree rocket.

00:16:05.589 --> 00:16:10.019
This was actually what I thought was gonna
go on the cover of the book, but I love that

00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:18.410
cover. But how about that one, you know? And
this image is actually the image that gave

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:26.709
me the idea for what to call the book because
I realized that the picture was working.

00:16:26.709 --> 00:16:36.360
It was pulling me in as a reader. Here are
these guys. Are they greeting an arriving

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:44.610
ship or waving good-bye to a departing ship?
They're looking onto this desert floor with

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:53.459
something of a millennial fervor. That taps
into a lot of pre-existing stories.

00:16:53.459 --> 00:16:58.080
And then, there was this realization that
the pictures were not just pictures, but they

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:07.230
were pulling me and every engineer who was
reading the magazines into something more

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:14.100
than just imagery, but into a story that was
this other--. It was this science fiction--another

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:20.430
science fiction about real-world technological
emergence.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:34.500
Sphere rockets. Tubes. Whoops. Yup. And then,
the mid-century modernists come in and they

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:45.180
create beautiful abstracts based on the images
of the engineers and other artists. At the

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:49.470
time, there was some truly science-fictional
technologies being proposed, one of which

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:58.100
would be that we could have hybrid nuclear
battery and liquid fuel propulsion vehicles

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.380
that would scoot around effectively in interplanetary
space.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:10.270
Here's one idea. They tended to look like
X-wing fighter pilots from Star Wars. Kinda

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:23.410
funny. Hello. Hello, Star Wars. And then,
I was a life-long reader of science fiction.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:34.380
And--. Louder? So, if you look at science
fiction over the decades and centuries, it

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:42.600
tends to anticipate technological development
and often to lead to technological development.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:50.670
And I wondered, when I started to focus in
on this 1957 to '62 time frame, if science

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:58.570
fiction would continue to lead or not. So,
I took a fine-grained view and actually compared

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:06.850
month by month stories, images, and ideas
between magazines of fantasy and science fiction,

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:11.840
analog, and the tech magazines that I was
reading.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:17.430
And actually found that in these few years,
science fiction had to--there was a reversal

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:22.670
of polarity. And science fiction started to
play the role of the follower for, I think,

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:31.000
the first time. And only for a little while.
But so, this ad was published in 1959. And

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:39.180
then this was a cover of F and SF six months
later.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:47.280
And I think there's a direct connection. There
were three nuclear rocket programs in the

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:55.690
US--NERVA, Rover, and Orion. There was some
creative visualization of what nuclear rockets

00:19:55.690 --> 00:20:01.190
would look like. But the question weren't
as broad as with liquid fuels in terms of--.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:06.650
There was no question of spheres or anything
like that. So, you get what we think of as

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.290
a more conventional rocket shape with these
ideas of nuclear rockets, except when we come

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:19.501
to this, which is an idea based on an Orion
spaceship. So, there's a basic idea for a

00:20:19.501 --> 00:20:27.320
nuclear rocket that it would have a little
reactor and it would just lift off and go.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:33.600
And it would look like a toothpaste tube.
And there it is. Project Orion was something

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:41.370
completely different. It was an attempt by
Manhattan Project engineers to arrive at a

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:45.510
peaceful application of nuclear bomb technology.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:51.890
And instead of having one core reactor that
runs continuously, like a power plant, that

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:58.250
this ship would actually be powered by ejecting
a series of mini bombs out the back of it

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:07.440
and would be propelled by the force of the
explosion of these bomblets. And this was

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.440
a real project.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:15.690
It was funded. It was totally highly classified
during all the time that it was funded. So,

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:22.770
when this this ad for the atomic pulse rocket
saying, coyly, "a similar project is past

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:28.420
pilot study in the Defense Department," the
Defense Department went to Congress and asked

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:34.770
for veto power over the table of contents
of Missiles and Rockets and Aviation Week

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:42.290
magazines and tried to gain an injunction
against the magazines from publishing anything

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:47.180
that was influenced by leaks of classified
material.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:59.920
They lost. I'll park here for a minute. This
isn't in the book. Sorry. You can enjoy it

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:09.540
here now. So, we didn't get atomic reactor
powered rockets. They were politically disabled.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:14.780
Really, as soon as people realized that if
you ever had any launch failure, even once

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:21.930
ever, that ten-mile radius around the launch
facility would be a dead zone for a hundred

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:27.860
years, then that was the end of all three
of our nuclear rocket programs.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:37.330
But we did develop isotope-powered batteries
that are atomic in the sense that they're

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:44.710
powered by decay and half-life of isotopes.
And they run really well and the first one

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:54.550
was launched in 1961 on a naval navigational
satellite. And this is a poster for the Voyager

00:22:54.550 --> 00:23:01.800
spacecraft, which, as we know, is now approaching
the outer limits of our solar system.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:07.960
And it's isotope-powered and it's been isotope-powered
since it launched 33 years ago. And I just

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:14.000
mention the isotope batteries because, actually
right now in the US, we have a crisis of isotope

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.930
fuel and NASA only has enough radioisotope
fuel for battery-powered planetary exploration

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:28.880
spacecraft to fuel half of their planned planetary
programs in the next 20 years.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:38.120
So, remember that. Which--. I used to demonstrate
what I really got out of this literature is

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:45.250
that it offers a sort of a prism for looking
at this relationship between technological

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:50.260
fact and science fiction and the past, the
present, and the future.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:56.080
And the more I learned about history, the
more unstuck in time our historical moment

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.110
of today comes to seem to be because just
as in science fiction, the deeper you get

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:10.610
into it, the closer tomorrow seems to relate
to yesterday. And one case in point is electric

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:11.910
propulsion.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:24.360
Actually, I met this man. These are real engineers
who were photographed looking at a pinch plasma

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:30.800
engine in a laboratory. And they had their
names published in the ad, so I was able to

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:36.450
look them up and make contact and get to know
them. And one of them came to one of my readings

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:37.450
on the East Coast.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:42.490
It was awesome. He was like, 90, and it was
very sweet. And they also sent me all this

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:48.500
literature to help me understand ion drives.
Anyway, so ion drives, they tried to test

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:53.160
them in the laboratory in the 1950s and tried
to test them in the 1960s and tested them

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.480
in the 1970s and tested them in the 1980s.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:03.100
And because of materials instability problems,
they didn't work for the first 45 years that

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:12.670
they were developed. No matter how fantastic
the spaceships were that were imagined to

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:20.610
be powered by them. No matter how pretty the
pictures were, the materials instability problems

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:28.490
kept them from flying until 2001 when the
first one flew.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:36.780
Finally. It took 45 years. And once the bugs
were worked out, we do rely pretty heavily,

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:48.300
regularly on these kinds of engines for a
satellite and low-power interplanetary craft.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:55.930
So, if I'd been reading the news release in
2001 without having done this research, I

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:56.930
would've actually--.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:03.361
It was reported as new in 2001. And there's
just an interesting historical window. New

00:26:03.361 --> 00:26:10.920
isn't always new. Sometimes, it means that
somebody worked on it for 45 years. Another

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:19.750
case--solar sails and space junk. So, solar
sails were widely promulgated, utopian promise

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:24.900
of swift, fast, and clean interplanetary travel.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:33.120
They're narrativized by the best of the best,
"The Wind from the Sun," all about solar-powered

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:41.780
spacecraft. At the same time, the utopian
impulse embedded in the civil, the impulse

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:49.470
to civil space exploration anticipated the
problem of space junk and anticipated strategies

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:54.710
for pulling space junk out of orbit at the
same time.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:27:04.470
Now, neither being green in space, nor pursuing
technologies that had no military app, neither

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:12.130
of those was really marketable or fundable
in the 1950s, in the Cold War era. So, initiatives

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:18.450
to head off the problem of space junk were
not followed up on as were solar sails--just

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:19.670
not funded.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:26.930
No military apt. No funding. One of the ideas
was that there would be rescue vessels in

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:37.050
space. And this is a rescue vessel rescuing
people who--. They're in pretty deep doo-doo

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:38.050
of asteroids.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.050
[laughter]

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:46.540
It just hit their space station where they
were living. And then, in 2010--a year ago,

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:54.110
a year and a couple months ago--the first
solar sail was launched by Japan. Thank you,

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.130
JAXA.

00:27:55.130 --> 00:28:01.800
This was a provable technology here in the
US we've had. The Planetary Society has tried

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:12.470
to launch solar sail spacecraft. And due to
technological difficulties from using ex-Cold

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:20.220
War leftover launch hardware, they had launch
failures and the solar sails were destroyed

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.340
on launch.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:29.780
But the Japan Space Agency got one up last
year. Right at the same time was this idea

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:36.000
that actually originated in Britain, that
if we can get solar sails up, we can use them

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.931
to attack the problem of space junk and attach
to--. Like, use the little solar sails. They're

00:28:42.931 --> 00:28:44.010
called NanoSails.

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:50.850
Attach them to space junk and pull the space
junk out of orbit. So, 50 years later, these

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:59.570
two ideas--one's just an idea, one's a technology--they
actually converged. So, in 1962--the book

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:06.160
starts in 1957--when the advertising started
to get really interesting and ends in 1962.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:12.420
What happened? Why? That was the year that
the design decision for the Apollo spacecraft,

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:18.610
including the lunar lander, was announced.
And it was an engineering solution and it

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:23.960
didn't address any of the visual romanticism
of a rocket landing on the moon.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:32.740
In fact, it didn't end up addressing any of
the visual romance of space exploration at

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:40.530
all. It was this.

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:46.370
[laughter]

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:53.900
And it was really the beginning of the end.
So, it was that. It was this design decision.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:59.100
And there just wasn't really a way to pretty
it up.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.260
[laughter]

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:10.550
And there was also the hard fact that once
the engineering work and design had gone into

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:17.440
first Mercury, then Gemini, and then Apollo,
all the budgets were plateaued and stopped

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.440
growing.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:23.010
And recruitment slacked off. So, this all
happened at the same time and the two were

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:32.040
tied together. Designers did still try to
make the Apollo visually interesting through

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:47.510
a little minimalism here and there, but it
didn't work. But we did go to the moon.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.590
[pause]

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:56.550
One thing that we do besides run our print
library is historic film archives. And we

00:30:56.550 --> 00:31:05.420
collect--. My partner back there is the lead
collector of home movies. And this is actually--.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:12.090
I like to show this when I talk about "Another
Science Fiction" 'cause both the book and

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:24.090
this movie express a level of heartfelt participation
in space exploration that we need to bring

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:25.090
back.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:36.940
And this is a home movie of the lunar landing
shot off the TV. So, I'm showing it not just

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:44.090
to show that this is what it looked like when
we went to the moon, but the film itself is

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:53.070
this piece of evidence of a time when people
would've had their 8- and 16-millimeter cameras

00:31:53.070 --> 00:32:04.340
out, stuck them on a tripod, and aimed it
at the TV to hold the moment.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:17.740
Also, once we knew what the rockets and the
hardware were really going to look like, and

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:28.250
once there was an astronaut core, the live
astronaut core took the place of the live

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:33.980
color TV pictures of the moon, if you had
color TV in 1969.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:41.850
Not that many people did. But the charisma
of the astronauts and their stories took the

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:51.570
place of what the sci-fi, romantic advertising
had done and spoke to a broader public. A

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:57.380
word about the artists. Most of these artists
were making work for industry and were not

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:04.840
necessarily allowed to sign their work and
remain anonymous.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:11.980
Some artists had enough of their own identity.
Frank Tinsley was a writer as well as an artist.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:15.730
And I came to realize in the course of the
research that a lot of the fantastical and

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:21.710
utopian ideas expressed in his artwork probably
originated with him and were less a part of

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:25.090
what any one firm was actually doing.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:36.110
This was confirmed when I was given this book
for my birthday. Tinsley, he wrote it, as

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:42.710
well as illustrated it. The illustrations
are fantastic. But he's not shy with his vision.

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:43.710
[laughter]

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:52.510
Not shy at all. The first million years. All
right. He should've been a Long Now Fellow.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.370
[laughter]

00:33:54.370 --> 00:34:02.660
And then, the work of Willi Baum, which really
stands out visually. He's a classically trained,

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:12.130
Swiss, modern graphic designer. Did absolutely
spectacular work. So, I tried to find these

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:20.889
artists and I tried to--. And I discovered
in my dismay that Frank Tinsley died in 1964,

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:24.139
long before I was born or even before the
moon landing.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:31.700
So, he never got to see any of that. And I
had been a better researcher, it might not

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:38.250
have taken me four years. But I did find Willi.
And he turned out to live only five miles

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:39.920
from me.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.210
[laughter]

00:34:41.210 --> 00:35:00.290
So, we got to be friends. [laughter] And today,
our future in space is in our hands. This

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:07.770
is a home movie made by a guy named Robert
Barnes, who built all the models from model

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:15.380
kits himself. And with string, he animated
them and he told the story in his own movie.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:21.220
And this is where we're back today. We're
gonna build the future of our space program

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:28.300
and maybe even go to Mars.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.370
[laughter]

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:40.590
Yeah. Moon landing.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:43.660
[pause]

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:50.310
Whatever we do from now as a society, it's
going to be built with our own hands. We're

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:59.660
not from here on out. And that's my talk.
I did get to go to the shuttle launch last

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:05.951
month, which was one of the most amazing things
I've ever done. And that's the end. So, thank

00:36:05.951 --> 00:36:07.530
you.

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.110
[applause]

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:15.430
Questions? Come on. Yeah?

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:26.450
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: So, I can't help but wonder if
there's a parallel period of history here

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:33.780
in the Valley, which is the boom years in
Silicon Valley and you have similar trade

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:41.800
magazines that also no longer exist. NewBit?
What did they call it?

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:52.290
But again, there was a sort of optimism about
progress and about what can be built and so

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:57.540
forth. And I'm curious about it's like another,
if there's parallels and also interesting

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:05.230
differences between the, I think--. What comes
to mind is hard to visualize what we're going

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.230
to building.

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.230
&gt;&gt;Megan Prelinger: What, yeah.

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:11.710
&gt;&gt;MALE #1:[Laughs] You know? No one predicted
Google as it is now even then exactly, except

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:12.710
maybe Larry.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.950
&gt;&gt;Megan Prelinger: Right. There are definitely
economic--.

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:19.390
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: Megan. Could you repeat the question
so it will get on the tape?

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:25.120
&gt;&gt;Megan Prelinger: Oh, right. The question
was whether there are parallels between Silicon

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:35.630
Valley cycles of boom-town eras and the space
boom era. And there are definitely--.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:39.530
What are the similarities and differences?
There are definitely economic similarities

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:48.470
that are closely tied with economic similarities.
I think in the Cold War era, the economics

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:55.810
was more of an external to the technology.
The technology was reliant on a lot of outside

00:37:55.810 --> 00:38:00.710
funding from the Cold War economic surplus.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:09.690
And in the tech boom years, the technology
drove its own boom, rather than having a boom

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:14.650
imposed on it from the outside. So, that's
the main difference I see. And of course,

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:18.930
the other, yeah, there's a big difference
in how technology is visualized today because

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:27.490
we can blend a design to concepts and phenomena,
like Google is like a phenomena, more than

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:29.080
objects. Exactly. Yes.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:37.900
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: I was curious what you're working
on since you finished this book, aside from

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:44.480
giving talks about the book itself. Are you
on to similar projects or are you working

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.500
on another book?

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:50.830
&gt;&gt;Megan Prelinger: The question is what am
I working on now. And yes, I can't, I don't

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:56.220
want to get anybody too excited, except I'm
so excited. But it won't be out for like,

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.780
at least probably three more years.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:05.530
But it's, I couldn't fit a space electronics
chapter into this book. The material on space

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:12.370
electronics was larger than could fit in any
chapter format in this book. And it's become

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:16.680
its own book. It's called "Inside the Machine:
Electronics in the Modern Century."

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:22.410
Forthcoming in 2014 from W. W. Norton. And
that's what I'm working on. Another project

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:28.940
of a life--. I mean, I thought this was a
project of a lifetime, but I'm 110 percent

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:39.950
as excited and engaged with that as I was
with this. So, yeah. You have any more questions?

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:42.370
OK. Thank you. Thank you. This was a lot of
fun.

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:42.540
