[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.610
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE: Lindsey is
going to be talking to us today

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.090
about the interaction between
food and our emotions.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.040
And I'm super excited
for her to be here.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.310
She's been featured on
"Oprah," "The Lisa Oz Show."

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.290
She's been in "Real Simple."

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.160
So we're very, very
lucky to have her.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.360
She lives in Pittsburgh
with her husband

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.590
and her pup, Winnie Cooper,
who is exceptionally cute.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.950
And today we're going to hear
Lindsey talk to all of us

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.930
about some of the
concepts in her book.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.130
We are going to have
a Q&amp;A at the end.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.930
So start thinking
about your questions.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.770
And there is a Dory for
everybody who is watching

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.000
the livestream,
Go/LindseySmith-Dory.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.650
So go ahead and
add your questions.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.152
And for those of you live,
if you ask a question,

00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:52.860
we're going to be
giving you away a book.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.130
So start thinking
about questions.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.942
And I'm super excited to
welcome Lindsey to the stage.

00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:00.388
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.388 --> 00:01:02.800
LINDSEY SMITH: Thank you.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.570
Hey, everyone.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.260
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.120
And we get to fruit
and veggie it up

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.940
via pantsuit and the stage.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.440
So we got to bring a little
fruit and veggie life to Google

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.120
today.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.490
I want to start off by
just telling you a story

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.550
and how all of this came
together for me with food,

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.430
and mood, and really, how
I became the Food Mood Girl

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.260
and why I care about this.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.860
In 2011, I graduated
from nutrition school.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.310
And as a fresh
graduate, I was so

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.860
excited to bring nutrition
knowledge to everyone,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.690
everywhere.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.560
I mean, I was so into
healthy living, and juicing,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.460
and eating right.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.640
I mean, I was eating quinoa
before quinoa was cool,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.005
when it was like $15 a pound.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:46.880
You know what I mean?

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.150
You could only find it at
certain specialty stores.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.910
And with this, I decided
that I felt the need

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.035
to educate friends and family.

00:01:56.035 --> 00:01:56.910
You know what I mean?

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.150
And by educating, being like,
oh, what's on your plate there?

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.930
Ooh, pizza, again?

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.610
What are you eating?

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.400
I cared so much about
health that I wanted people

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.720
to have this knowledge.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.570
I wanted people to get
excited about eating

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.690
fruits and vegetables,
and eating quinoa,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.790
and all of these things.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.430
And I had this judgmental
approach, though.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.540
And all of this came to a head
in the Pittsburgh airport.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.250
So let me tell you this story.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.920
It was right after I graduated.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.800
I was on my way to a
nutrition conference.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.130
So I had just got out
of Western Pennsylvania,

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.394
the mecca of meat and potatoes.

00:02:36.394 --> 00:02:38.810
I don't know if anyone has
ever been to Pittsburgh before,

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.360
but we put fries on salad.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.410
So I was like, oh, I'm going
to be with all of my nutrition

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.790
people, all of my health peeps.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.520
There's going to be 5,000
of us at this conference.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.830
We're going to be doing
kale shots off yoga mats.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.150
It's going to get
real crazy up in here.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.540
So I'm a recovering
Type A perfectionist.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.240
So I go to the airport like 10
hours early, because I'm like,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.400
am I going to-- you know,
I don't want to be late.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.590
So I get to the airport early.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.750
And I was like, you know what?

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.170
This would be a great time
to write a blog about the six

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.410
benefits of juicing kale and why
you need to do it in your life.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.940
So I get to the airport
early, and I decided to write.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.720
So I look over at this
little section in there.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.662
And there was
probably 10 tables,

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:24.870
and no one was sitting there.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.870
And I was like,
oh, this is great.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.620
I'll go sit there.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.810
This is perfect.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.290
So I go.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.614
I get my hot water.

00:03:30.614 --> 00:03:32.780
And, of course, I bring my
own teabag wherever I go.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.640
Because you can't
trust the airport tea.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.660
And so I get my hot water.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.470
I get my tea.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.660
I set up this little
station for myself.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.030
And I'm like, ah,
writing about kale.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.800
This is so great.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.780
So like 5, 10 minutes go by.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.320
And all of a sudden, I
see people coming out

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.430
of this door in
this little section.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.050
And I look up, and I see
it says, "Employees Only."

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.820
So I'm in this
employees only section.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.290
I didn't realize that I was.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.790
And I was like,
well, you know what?

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.750
I'm not being bothered.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.060
To each his own.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.080
It's all good.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.950
I'll just stay here.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.160
If someone kicks me
out, it'll be fine.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.501
So another like 5,
10 minutes go by.

00:04:12.501 --> 00:04:13.250
And this is early.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.320
This is like 7 o'clock
in the airport.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.370
And all of a sudden,
this woman comes out

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.370
of this door, and this--

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.030
I'm going to do the best
impression of her that I can.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.651
She comes out.

00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:24.650
She's on her cell phone.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.170
And she's like, I
hate this place!

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.600
This place sucks!

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.640
F you!

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.440
Bah!

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.630
And I'm like, oh, my goodness.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.880
I'm like, what is
wrong with this woman?

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.620
I'm like, does she not realize
I made a Feng shui thing here?

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.137
Like, this energy is just not
good for what I have going on.

00:04:43.137 --> 00:04:44.470
But she's just, like, miserable.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.260
And she comes out of the
employee only section.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.910
I'm like, whatever.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.430
She left.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.800
I was like, OK, you
know, to each his own.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.520
I'm going to go back
to writing about kale.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.250
So another 5, 10 minutes go
by, and this woman comes back.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.930
And this time, she had
a tray full of food.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.510
And of all the other nine tables
she could sit, where do you

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.870
think she sat?

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.130
Directly in front of me.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.150
But at this point, my computer
was blocking-- kind of

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.856
like blocking her.

00:05:13.856 --> 00:05:16.230
But I'm sitting there, and
I'm like, she's in a bad mood.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.672
She's miserable.

00:05:18.672 --> 00:05:20.880
I was like, I kind of want
to know what she's eating.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.130
Because remember, I cared.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.255
I wanted to educate people.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.320
So I was like, should I look?

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.836
Shouldn't I?

00:05:28.836 --> 00:05:29.460
I was like, OK.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.360
I'm going to look
what she's eating.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.943
Because clearly she
was in a bad mood,

00:05:31.943 --> 00:05:33.840
and I need to see what's
going on with her.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.370
So my computer's up, right?

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.720
And I can't really see.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.405
So I'm like-- all of
a sudden, you just

00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:41.460
see my head peek
out from my computer

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.370
to try to get a glimpse
of what's on her tray.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.130
And I could not make
this story up if I tried.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.950
This was about 7:30
in the morning now.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.660
On her tray, this woman had a
large Ben and Jerry's chocolate

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.550
milkshake.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.160
Some people are like, oh,
isn't that considered kind

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.570
of a smoothie?

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.264
And I kind of want those
for breakfast myself.

00:06:03.264 --> 00:06:04.680
As if that wasn't
enough, she then

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.640
had a large bowl of chocolate
ice cream with whipped cream

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.820
on top, right next
to the milkshake.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.010
As if that wasn't
enough, she then

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.740
had a large omelette
with hash browns,

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.330
and she's just
pouring ketchup on it.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.650
And this is at 7:30
in the morning.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.140
And the health coach in
me is like, oh my god.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.700
Does she not know
what she's doing?

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.170
Is she not knowing
that what she's eating

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.836
is directly affecting
how she's feeling?

00:06:29.836 --> 00:06:31.890
And the reason why she
is coming out here,

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.650
and she's so miserable,
and she's flipping out

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.150
is because of all this food?

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.562
And I was so angry with her.

00:06:38.562 --> 00:06:40.020
I was like, oh, I
want to tell her.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.370
I want to tell her that
there's more out there for her.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.760
But I was like,
Lindsey, you're going

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.860
with your nutrition peeps.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.330
You're going to be with
them in a couple hours.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.314
Just calm down, relax.

00:06:49.314 --> 00:06:50.730
You're not trying
to get arrested.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.420
So I was like, OK.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.080
So I put some of the essential
oils or something on me

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.720
and was like, we're
going to calm down.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.430
So then, 5, 10 more minutes go
by, and I hear some shuffling.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.930
And I'm like, do I look?

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.190
Don't I look?

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.560
But then I'm like, I'm
kind of already invested.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.920
I need to know what she's doing.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.325
So again, peeking
around the computer.

00:07:11.325 --> 00:07:14.700
At, like, 7:35,
7:40 in the morning,

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.410
this woman now pulls
out a lunchbox cooler.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.390
I'm like, are you kidding me?

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.140
More food?

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.370
What could you possibly need?

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.536
And then I'm calculating it.

00:07:24.536 --> 00:07:27.990
I'm like, you just ate 3,200
calories, 87 grams of sugar.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.440
There's probably 87
chemicals in that milkshake.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.110
And I'm getting so
upset with this woman.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.710
I'm like, uhh.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.019
So I'm like, OK, calm down.

00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:40.810
But then she pulls out
her lunchbox cooler.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.290
And I'm like, OK, I need
to see what she has in it.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.800
And at like 7:40 in the morning,
this woman, on her tray,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.700
pulls out five
prescription medications.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.220
And one by one, she's slurping
them down with her chocolate

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.350
milkshake.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.730
And at this point, I am
furious with this woman.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.611
I'm like, oh my goodness.

00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:00.360
Do you not realize
that what you're eating

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.026
is directly affecting
how you're feeling

00:08:02.026 --> 00:08:03.750
and all of these medications--

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.540
you know, you wouldn't have
to take them if you would just

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.980
eat properly and--

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.087
you know, you-- oh, I
was just so frustrated.

00:08:10.087 --> 00:08:11.920
I could not believe
that this was happening.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.930
So at this point, I
put my laptop down.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.099
I'm just looking at
her like, it is on.

00:08:18.099 --> 00:08:20.390
But then I'm like, I'm not
really going to do anything.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.850
[LAUGHS] But I was
like, it is on.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.370
And I just couldn't believe
that someone could do that

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.300
to themselves, to eat
that way and then think

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.510
that the medication
was going to help.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.330
So at this point, I was really
engrossed in this woman.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.400
And I was just like, I
need to know everything

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.570
and what she's doing.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.059
But I was like, just calm down.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:45.010
So I was trying to
calm myself down.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.900
But I just kept staring at her.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.930
And then five more
minutes go by,

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.940
and then this is when
everything changed.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.220
It's 7:30 in the airport.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.020
And this woman pulls out her
lunchbox cooler once again.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.720
And I'm like, more food?

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.440
More drugs?

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.350
What could you possibly need?

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:08.450
And at 7:45 in the airport, this
woman sits back in her chair.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.880
She takes a sigh.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.854
She looks at her food.

00:09:11.854 --> 00:09:12.770
She looks at the tray.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.430
She looks at the drugs.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:19.650
And she looked
defeated, like the food,

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.190
and the drugs, and
all of that, just won.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.530
She pushes her tray forward.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.966
She grabs her lunchbox
cooler once again.

00:09:27.966 --> 00:09:29.340
And in the middle
of the airport,

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.860
this woman opens up the cooler.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.680
She lifts up her shirt, she
rubs herself with alcohol,

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.570
and she injects herself
with an insulin shot.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:43.660
And at this point, I was no
longer mad at this woman.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.420
I was no longer frustrated
with this woman.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.250
I really was able,
in that moment,

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.860
to see a reflection
of my own self

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:58.150
and the trajectory of
the path that I was on.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.250
I thought, what if, at
the end or the beginning

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.750
of the day, this woman--

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.390
the only thing she had
to make her feel better

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.160
was that chocolate milkshake?

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.420
She clearly didn't like her job.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.970
She was irritated at
someone on the phone.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.180
And what if that
was the only thing--

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.100
and if she was diagnosed
with something, being

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.190
diagnosed with any disease--

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.590
and I know personally--

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.730
is a challenge.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.100
And it's something that
you need to work through.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.060
And so when I
watched this woman,

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.630
I was at first so judgmental.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.067
And I realized, you know,
she was no different than me

00:10:37.067 --> 00:10:38.400
and I was no different than her.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.950
The difference is I was able
to choose a different way

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.890
and to get on a healthier track.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.750
Because when I was 12 years
old, I suffered from anxiety.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.660
I was actually
hospitalized at age 12.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.950
I was taken out of
school, put IVs in my arm.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.900
And I too used food
to fill a comfort,

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.570
to fill a void that
I felt within myself,

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.900
my low self-esteem.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.640
And so when I watched
her, I realized

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.840
I was no different than her.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.590
And here I had been judging
people, judging my family,

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:17.550
judging my friends, judging this
stranger at the airport, when

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:22.470
really what I needed to start
to understand and foster

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.870
was real empathy and meeting
people where they are.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.280
Because we don't know.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.350
We don't know someone's life.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:32.400
We don't know what
they're struggling with.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.680
And it's meeting them where
they are and actually listening.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.910
So this moment actually
changed the entire trajectory

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:39.540
of my career.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.942
Because I was this crazy
judgmental person when

00:11:43.942 --> 00:11:46.150
it came to food and nutrition,
thought I knew it all,

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.600
wanted to evangelize
everyone I met.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.650
And what I realized is that
it's a lot deeper than that.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.234
And so today I want
to share with you

00:11:54.234 --> 00:11:55.650
some of these
principles that I've

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.220
learned, not only
in my own journey,

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.810
but through working with
people, and through seminars,

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:01.620
and through--

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.770
just hearing people's stories
when it comes to food.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:09.210
And the first thing that I truly
believe when it comes to food

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:13.950
is that we were born
emotional eaters.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.830
And I know that's kind
of a bold statement.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.650
Because so many of us, when we
think of emotionally eating,

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.676
we think of the breakup
with the ice cream.

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:24.300
Or we think of a
stressful day at work,

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.510
and I want pizza, or
a burger, or fries.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.550
And that is one aspect of it.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.660
And it is a spectrum.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.940
But our true being
are emotional eaters.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:39.110
What does a baby, a newborn,
do when they're hungry?

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.820
They cry.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.280
What did I do yesterday
when I was hungry?

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.250
I cried.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.720
We're no different from that.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:53.240
And so because I truly believe
that we're emotional eaters--

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.639
and I look at it as
really a positive thing.

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:57.680
I look at it as something
that we can learn from,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:02.600
that we can foster that empathy
within others and in ourselves,

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.660
and learn more about ourselves
through realizing that.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:11.360
Which brings me to my next
point, which is listening,

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.040
listening to your body.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.450
So many times, we--

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:19.340
how many of us have ever
been on a diet before?

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.960
That's like everyone.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.430
That's like 99.9% of
people in the world.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.000
I really want to meet
the 0.01% person that's

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.950
never been on a diet.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.122
But maybe you've done
the buddy system.

00:13:30.122 --> 00:13:31.580
How many of you
have done the buddy

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.540
system, where you're like,
yeah, we're doing this together?

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.340
And we're going on this plan,
and it's going to be great.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:42.950
And so maybe it's a partner,
or a friend, or a coworker.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.470
And you decide to
get on this plan,

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:46.820
and you're all jazzed about it.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.750
And you're checking
in with each other.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.541
And you're like, yeah,
this is going great.

00:13:50.541 --> 00:13:51.620
And week 1, right?

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.120
Week 1 is the big week.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.829
It's like when you
start feeling better,

00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:56.870
and you can start seeing.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.380
And your friend is like,
oh, I'm just loving this.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.200
This is so great.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.310
I think I just lost three
pant sizes in one week.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.430
This is incredible.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.130
I have so much more energy.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.890
And you're on the
scale, like, oh, my god.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:11.750
Did I just gain weight?

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.040
Is that possible?

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.650
We're doing the
same exact thing!

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:21.000
And that's because every
body is so different.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.360
And so I think that
it's great that there's

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.760
different diets and lifestyles.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.200
But I think what
we need to do is

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.510
take that information from
it and learn to figure out

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.610
what our body needs
and what truly

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.410
is going to fuel our body.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.460
Because they're
all so different.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.340
A quick example of this.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.270
When I first got into
health and nutrition,

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.500
we learned all the dietary
theories that there are,

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.760
pretty much.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.710
And there's a lot of them.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:50.330
And I was really big
into the blood type

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.430
diet and some different diets.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.380
And I thought-- I was like, yes.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:58.220
My body is meant
to be vegetarian.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.160
This is what it is.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.750
So I was a vegetarian for eight
years, and then I went vegan.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.510
And about six months into
it, I got really sick.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.510
I mean, I passed out
in the shower, sick.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.030
And here I am this health
person, this health coach.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.210
So it's like, yes, I eat fruits
and veggies, and I'm so great.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.850
And here I was passing
out in my shower.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:17.720
And it was not--

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.430
it was not one, a good look.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:24.840
And two, it proved
against what I know now,

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.780
which is that we're
so bioindividual

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.560
and we're so all different.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.020
And so when that happened,
I got really sick.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:37.640
And then I was like, all of a
sudden, I was craving a burger.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.690
That's all I wanted.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:40.580
I was just like, I--

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.550
but my mind was so ingrained
in being in this one way,

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.127
not listening to my body,
being OK, this is what you are.

00:15:46.127 --> 00:15:47.210
This is what you're doing.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:51.620
It almost became part of who
I was, that I was vegetarian.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.450
It was my label that I wanted
to wear and let everyone know.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.101
And I wasn't actually listening.

00:15:57.101 --> 00:15:59.600
And all of a sudden, I'm just
craving this and craving this.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.810
So finally one day, I decided--

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:03.560
I told my husband.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.080
I was like, I think
I need a burger.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.670
Will you go with me?

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:08.880
It was a big deal.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.450
I was like, we need to make
sure that it's grass-fed.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.770
I need to know the cow's name.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.560
I was like, we've really
got to be OK with this.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.440
He was so excited.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.190
He was like, yeah.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.023
He's like, I can't wait
to get this on film.

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:23.480
And I'm like, oh my god.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.284
So we go to this joint.

00:16:25.284 --> 00:16:26.700
And I'm literally--
I kid you not.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.022
I'm walking in like,
I hope no one sees me.

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:30.980
If they know that I'm--

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.030
I'm just getting a
veggie burger, guys.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.950
And so I go, and I
order this cheeseburger.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.440
And I eat it.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:45.980
And I felt so much better,
instantly so much better.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.820
And what I realized is I
was definitely lacking iron.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.780
There were certain things in
my diet that I wasn't getting

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:54.650
and that I needed.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.610
And it was in that instance
that I was like, you know,

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.350
listening to your
body is so important.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:02.100
Because we put
labels on everything.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:06.440
And we want to constantly label
things, including our diet,

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.550
and put ourselves
in these boxes.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.740
But our bodies change.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.650
Every six months, your
taste buds are changing.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.619
And your body is constantly
evolving, and adapting,

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:16.740
and changing.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.069
And so you need to
be open and to listen

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:23.140
so that you can really
see what your body needs.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.660
And when it comes to cravings,
like that red meat craving--

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.450
oftentimes, we look also at
cravings as a really bad thing.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.400
We're like, oh,
I'm craving this.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.250
I'm so bad.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.170
Cravings are actually
the gatekeepers

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.690
to let our bodies know
what they really need.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.340
And the more that you listen,
the more that you understand,

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:47.190
and the more that you can truly
foster a closer relationship

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.130
with you and your body, you
won't ever have to diet again.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.980
Because you'll know what
your body needs, when--

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.000
at what times.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.900
And you'll be able to
adapt, and flow, and change,

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:05.230
rather than being so restrictive
and so intense about it.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:10.180
So the next point, when it
comes to food, and mood,

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.910
and emotions, and
this whole concept,

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.620
is not only listening
to your body,

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.310
but also feeling your feelings.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.620
So many of us--
the reason why we

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.390
are quick to grab a Snickers
bar, quick to grab chips,

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:28.150
or whatever it may be, is
because we don't actually

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:32.350
stop and allow ourselves
to feel whatever feeling

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:33.940
that we're feeling.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.400
And we're just quick to
go to the next thing.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.090
A quick-- another
little story about this.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.160
This was in 2014.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.060
This one day, it was a
rainy Saturday afternoon.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:50.080
And all of a sudden, I
got this intense craving

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.910
for a grilled cheese.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.000
And I'm not talking like
those highbrow grilled cheeses

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.810
from, like, San Francisco,
you know, where they're like--

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.230
have all these crazy ingredients
on them, and they're like $25.

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:07.135
I'm talking I wanted Wonder
Bread with butter and Land

00:19:07.135 --> 00:19:08.080
O'Lakes cheese.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.750
That's what I wanted.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.710
And so I almost--

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.210
I had my keys in my hand.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.610
I'm ready to go out the door.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:15.610
And then I just stopped.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.725
And I said, what's
actually going on here?

00:19:18.725 --> 00:19:20.350
Let me just sit with
this for a minute.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.570
Let me just feel
this for a minute.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:27.760
And so what I had realized is
I had this moment of clarity

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.660
and this moment of being
able to feel what I actually

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.350
was feeling.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.370
And it was grief.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:34.750
And it was sadness.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:39.160
Because my dad
passed away in 2012.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.090
And when I was a kid on
rainy Saturday afternoons,

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:44.920
he would make me
a grilled cheese,

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:51.220
and we would watch copious
amounts of "Unsolved

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.850
Mysteries," which,
as a seven-year-old--

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.350
I was like seven
at the time-- like,

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.600
the parenting choice of
letting your child watch--

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.433
you know, that's besides
the point-- letting

00:20:00.433 --> 00:20:02.260
me watch "Unsolved Mysteries."

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.390
But the point is I was--
in that moment, when

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:08.110
I was craving that grilled
cheese, the raininess,

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.670
the Saturday
afternoon-- all of that

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.562
brought the feeling
of being with my dad.

00:20:12.562 --> 00:20:14.020
And so that's what
I really wanted.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.850
That's what I was
really missing.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.740
And so at that point,
I had a decision.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.698
I was like, well, I can
eat the grilled cheese,

00:20:19.698 --> 00:20:22.480
eat it, appreciate it I
can make an upgraded one.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.870
I can-- but then
I was like, huh.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.990
I wonder if "Unsolved Mysteries"
is anywhere online right now.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.330
And I did find it
on Amazon Prime.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.850
And I was like, I'm going to
watch "Unsolved Mysteries"

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:37.270
this rainy afternoon,
and really honor and feel

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.410
that feeling in that way.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.840
And let me just tell you,
"Unsolved Mysteries,"

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.870
as an adult, is a horrible show.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.360
I was like, why was I
allowed to watch this?

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.921
This is so bad.

00:20:47.921 --> 00:20:49.420
They actually do
these reenactments.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.294
It's the whole thing.

00:20:50.294 --> 00:20:52.560
I was like, oh, my goodness.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.810
But it actually made me laugh.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.710
And feeling that feeling
and going with that--

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.950
it actually ended up
providing me with nutrients

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:03.640
and providing me with a sense
that the grilled cheese never

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.420
could.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.130
And that's because I
allowed myself to feel.

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:14.050
So listening to your body,
feeling your feelings--

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:17.290
and, you know, the
last thing with this

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.920
is to prescribe as necessary.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.420
And what I mean by that
is food can greatly

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.790
help with your emotions.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:32.060
And your emotions can dictate
the food choices that you eat.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.940
And so I think it's
important to understand

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.630
how both play into your life
so that you can truly see what

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.460
you may need at certain times.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.240
For example, in my new
book, "Eat Your Feelings,"

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.910
I actually map out some
of the different emotions.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.780
So for example, if
you're sad, your body

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.210
really wants serotonin.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.090
And it can find that
in carbs and sugar,

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.190
basically, so pizza and cookies.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.810
So when we're sad, our initial
quick knee-jerk reaction

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.580
is to go to the
pizza and the cookies

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.710
because it's going to
give us that quick fix.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.760
However, long term, what your
body needs-- like I said,

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.020
it wants the serotonin.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.800
And so incorporating foods
such as nuts and seeds--

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.280
is just one example
that actually help

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.470
your body produce serotonin--

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:24.340
can give you longer term
benefits, rather than

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.540
that quick fix.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.040
Some of the other
ones that I have--

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.270
if you're sad, if you're
stressed, grounding foods.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.860
When you're stressed
out, usually it's

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.106
all in your head
and your upper body.

00:22:35.106 --> 00:22:36.730
And so eating foods
that are grounding,

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.938
that are lower to the Earth,
can actually help ground

00:22:38.938 --> 00:22:42.906
you, so things like
carrots and sweet potatoes.

00:22:42.906 --> 00:22:44.030
So if you're sad, stressed.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:47.620
If you're tired, you
want something energizing

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.100
and uplifting, so
citrus, or leafy greens,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.790
or something like that.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.740
And if you're
hangry, when you're

00:22:55.740 --> 00:23:00.140
so hungry that you become
angry, like I do, many days--

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.290
I always say that.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.410
You don't care if it was made
by Julia Child or a child,

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:06.180
you just need food
and need it now.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.820
So to avoid being
hangry, though, you

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.030
could fuel up on things like
healthy fats and proteins

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:15.075
earlier in the day, so you don't
get those 2 PM hanger shakes.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.530
Sad, stressed, tired, bored--

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.074
or hangry-- and bored.

00:23:21.074 --> 00:23:22.740
If you're bored,
again, that's something

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:27.360
that your brain actually needs
energy when you're bored.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.300
And so if you're a bored
eater, where you're just like,

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.549
oh, I have nothing else
to do, chips sound great.

00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:34.840
And then you're like, well,
now I need something sweet.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.150
So this sounds great.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:37.920
But really what you
need is something

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.310
like a healthy fat, something
to truly fuel your brain so

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:45.960
that you feel energized and that
you feel active in your brain.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.470
So like I said,
listening to your body,

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.140
feeling your feelings,
prescribing food as necessary--

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.600
all of these things are
this really intricate dance

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.230
that your body will work with
you on, if you choose to listen

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:05.970
and if you choose to really
understand the deeper

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:09.810
connections that the food
and mood plays into it.

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:20.430
So to put this in full circle
and to wrap all this together,

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.370
I want to read a quick
little thing from my book.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:28.500
It's called the "Food
Mood Girl Femifesto."

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.000
And this kind of
wraps up everything

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.170
that we just talked about.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.870
Your body is a magical machine.

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.690
It's like a computer
program specifically for you

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:40.340
and only you.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.450
Cherish it.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.560
Trust it.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.259
Treat it with respect.

00:24:44.259 --> 00:24:45.800
Talk to your body
like you would talk

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.380
to a really cute dog,
except not in public,

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.720
because that might be weird.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.600
Take time to eat
really good real food.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.080
That includes leafy
greens and a cookie.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.580
Eat everything with love.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.080
Cook everything with love.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.500
Love is always the
secret ingredient.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.880
Ask questions.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.530
Be open to growth.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:08.150
Ask more questions.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.910
Be kind to yourself and others.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:12.350
Release judgments.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.390
Challenge conventional norms.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.610
Do something that scares you.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:19.220
Listen more, react less.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.490
Laugh your ass off, preferably
in the company of others,

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.530
but by yourself is cool too.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:26.940
Listen to your gut.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.710
Always listen to your gut.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.530
It's right 99% of the time.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.960
Embrace your body's unique size.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.480
Know that it will
change and evolve.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.920
It might grow and shrink, but
it still loves you all the same.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.690
And above all, love yourself.

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:44.910
Like, really, truly
love yourself.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.610
Celebrate and appreciate
yourself daily.

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.490
And remember, this is the
only body in life you have.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.750
So love it up the best you can.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:57.210
And when all else
fails, just Google it.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:57.910
I had to, guys.

00:25:57.910 --> 00:25:58.410
I had to.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:25:59.500
Sorry, I just had to.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.910
I had to throw something
cheesy in there.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:05.130
But I appreciate you
all for being here

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.190
and for listening to this.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.450
And I think we're going
to open it up to a Q&amp;A,

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.310
so if you have any
specific questions.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.470
I know we have some coming in.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:17.051
Love to answer it for you.

00:26:17.051 --> 00:26:17.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.800
Yeah, thanks.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.800
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE: Thank
you so much, Lindsey.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.730
LINDSEY SMITH: Thank you.

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.500
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE:
So we have a couple

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.300
of questions on the Dory.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.880
So we can take Dory questions
and also live questions.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.380
And as a reminder,
we definitely are

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.290
excited to give away some books.

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:36.600
So we want to definitely
take it away with questions.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.630
So we'll start with one
from the Dory, which

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.330
I think is really, really
relevant to what we were just

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:42.390
talking about.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.990
So it's an anonymous
question, and it says,

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:47.840
how do you suggest
combating boredom eating?

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.870
It's so easy.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.470
I Google to stop by our
micro kitchens, which you've

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.070
witnessed, for a snack, when
all you need is a break,

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:58.317
or to make food when you
just want to watch TV.

00:26:58.317 --> 00:27:00.900
LINDSEY SMITH: Well, why don't
you take the break or watch TV?

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.983
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE: Yeah.

00:27:01.983 --> 00:27:03.890
That's a very valid answer.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:05.690
LINDSEY SMITH:
Sometimes, what I find

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:09.920
is we overthink things when
it comes to stuff like this,

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.510
and health, and nutrition.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:15.530
Even something like that,
we know what we want to do.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:16.695
But what is stopping us?

00:27:16.695 --> 00:27:19.070
And I think that's where it's
stopping and really feeling

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:23.620
our feelings, being able to say,
wait, do I just need a break?

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.230
Yeah, let me go
get some fresh air.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.020
Or yeah, I just want to
veg and watch TV tonight.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:29.750
And that's OK.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:32.297
Sometimes we think we need
to be doing something more.

00:27:32.297 --> 00:27:33.880
But we need to allow
ourselves to have

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.200
those moments of the breaks.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.760
And I think that
that's sometimes

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.550
why we gravitate towards
food, because it makes us feel

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.200
like we're doing something.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.810
It's like, well, I
accomplished a lot today

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:47.290
by eating three bags of Doritos.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.180
It gives us a sense
of purpose, almost.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.590
But really, we
just need a break.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:52.840
And so allowing yourself
to have that, I think,

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.070
is really important.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.370
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE: Yeah.

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:56.670
And I think that's super
relevant for Googlers,

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.900
because a lot of
us work nonstop.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.110
And so that reminder of
just letting yourself

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.650
take that time is
really helpful.

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.108
LINDSEY SMITH: And
oftentimes, when

00:28:05.108 --> 00:28:07.930
you allow yourself to step
away and take that break,

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.300
you'll find that you're
more productive later on.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.824
You find that you think that you
have a million things going on

00:28:13.824 --> 00:28:16.240
and that you need to do all
of these things and have them.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.490
But if you just allow yourself,
then your energy is more clear,

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.870
your mind is more clear, and
you can go into that situation

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.797
and probably even do
it at a faster rate

00:28:24.797 --> 00:28:27.130
than if you would just try
to power through and struggle

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:28.120
through it.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.920
I know that from
personal experience.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.710
Writing a book is not
an easy thing to do.

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.409
You're like, oh,
snacks and laundry.

00:28:34.409 --> 00:28:36.700
When you start doing laundry
instead of writing a book,

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.700
you know that's like really bad.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.830
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE: I
think we've all been there.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:40.810
Maybe not the writing the book.

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:43.180
But the doing laundry to
procrastinate anything else.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.042
LINDSEY SMITH: Yes.

00:28:45.042 --> 00:28:47.500
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE: Do we want
to have any live questions?

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.499
We have a mic in the
back, if you don't mind,

00:28:49.499 --> 00:28:50.790
so that everybody can hear you.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.123
LINDSEY SMITH: It's so official.

00:28:52.123 --> 00:28:53.945
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE:
It really is.

00:28:53.945 --> 00:28:56.320
AUDIENCE: So this is kind of
similar to the question that

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.140
was just asked.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.950
But I realize I
almost never eat fruit

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.410
because it takes me a long
time to prepare it, to cut it.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.080
And if I want to
get a snack, it's

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.330
just easier to grab a
bag of chips, as opposed

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:12.440
to taking five minutes
to cut and wash a fruit.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.260
So what tips do you
have to feel more

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.810
motivated to eat healthier?

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.305
LINDSEY SMITH: So
a couple of things.

00:29:20.305 --> 00:29:22.430
One of the key things in
the book that I talk about

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:24.630
is everyone says you
are what you eat.

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:26.390
That's like, you
are what you eat.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:29.570
I believe you are what you chop.

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:30.440
It's true.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.060
Because you're
like, I don't like--

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.500
it takes me five
minutes to chop.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.617
And so that's what stops
you from doing that.

00:29:36.617 --> 00:29:38.450
Because it's easier to
grab the other thing.

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.951
Or how many of you have
ever tried to cut an onion

00:29:40.951 --> 00:29:42.200
and you're still figuring out?

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.880
You're like, wait,
which way do I

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:48.020
turn it to get slices
versus dices, right?

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.910
And so that's what
stops us from doing it.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:59.620
So my one suggestion is
don't feel like, I guess,

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.240
overambitious.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.230
If you've got to get the
pre-cut, get the pre-cut.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:08.260
If the pre-cut is going to make
you eat it, get the pre-cut.

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.690
Whereas we have these
grandiose ideas,

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:12.690
like, oh, but I
need to be doing--

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.260
but I need to actually cut it.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:18.699
And then we end up buying a
bag of onions and they rot.

00:30:18.699 --> 00:30:20.740
Because we're like, well,
I don't really want to.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:24.040
Just buy the pre-chopped.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.350
And then as far as
from the day-to-day,

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:30.130
if there are fruits and
vegetables that are easier,

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:33.320
that you're like, OK--
like a banana, for example.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.040
Or like a Clementine,
or an orange,

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.390
or something like that,
something that is faster

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:39.800
and you know that.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:46.792
But then also checking in with
yourself and saying, why am I--

00:30:46.792 --> 00:30:49.930
why is this-- kind of like
sitting with that deeper

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:56.170
question of why am I allowing
these other things to stop me

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.650
from taking the time to do this?

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:03.730
And just being a little bit
more real with yourself too.

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.010
It's not an easy fix.

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:07.390
We're complicated.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.700
We're these computer systems
that are very intense.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.950
So it's just kind of always
checking in with yourself.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.320
And I think you'll
start to realize.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.840
And then maybe in
a month from now,

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:20.200
we'll see you out here, cutting
the apples and being like,

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.190
yeah, I did it.

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:23.720
It just takes some time.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.970
So hopefully that answered.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:25.450
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:26.700
LINDSEY SMITH: Yes, thank you.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.630
AUDIENCE: So if you're
feeling one of these emotions

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:38.080
you mentioned, like
sad, tired, hangry,

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.680
and you try to satiate that
emotion with the recommended

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.140
foods, and it's just
not getting there,

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.660
you're still feeling
that emotion.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.764
What do you do?

00:31:47.764 --> 00:31:50.180
LINDSEY SMITH: Well, I think
that there's multiple things.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.721
So someone asked me this really
great question the other day.

00:31:52.721 --> 00:31:54.430
It was, do you
think of your method

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.820
as prescription or preventative?

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.310
And I think that's kind of
similar to what you're saying.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:05.560
I think some days, you just want
the chocolate fudge brownie.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.090
Eat the chocolate fudge brownie.

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:09.040
Eat it.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.840
And I find what happens
is, what we'll often do--

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.120
sometimes there's just--

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.110
we want that thing.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.000
And that's OK.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.990
It's OK to have that, and to
eat it, and feel good about it.

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:22.540
When you eat something
that your body--

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.210
let's just say, for
example, you really

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:28.360
want this chocolate
fudge brownie.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.619
That's what your craving is.

00:32:29.619 --> 00:32:31.660
And you're like, oh-- but
you're beating yourself

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:32.200
up in your head.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.380
You're like, well, I
shouldn't have that.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.250
I don't want that.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:36.340
I shouldn't do it.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.455
And then you're like, well,
maybe I'll just have--

00:32:38.455 --> 00:32:40.780
then the chocolate fudge
brownies are right there.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.139
And you're like, oh,
I'll just have one bite.

00:32:43.139 --> 00:32:44.180
And then you're like, no.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.346
And then your friends are
over eating carrot sticks.

00:32:46.346 --> 00:32:48.280
You're like, why
can't I be like them?

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.460
And then it's like this whole
stressful thing in your mind.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.200
And what you're doing
to your body, when

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.420
you stress about eating
something like that,

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:59.740
is physically, that stress
is no different than any type

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:02.080
of other stress, like if
someone's attacking you.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.640
Your blood rushes
to your feet to run,

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.316
to your hands to
fight something off,

00:33:06.316 --> 00:33:07.440
and to your brain to think.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.920
So the last thing it's
thinking about doing

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.378
is digesting that
chocolate brownie

00:33:10.378 --> 00:33:11.800
that you're stressing about.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.390
So if you really
want something--

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.224
or then the other thing
we do is we're like,

00:33:15.224 --> 00:33:16.931
wow, I really want
the chocolate brownie,

00:33:16.931 --> 00:33:18.340
but I'm trying to be healthy.

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:24.070
So I'm going to have
some cacao nibs,

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:25.450
and then you eat the cacao nibs.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.360
And you're like, but
that doesn't satisfy it.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.836
And then you have
something kind of bitter,

00:33:29.836 --> 00:33:31.210
so then you want
something sweet.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:34.510
So then you're like,
well, now I'll have fruit.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.470
Now I want something salty.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:40.915
And then you spend all
day trying to get the--

00:33:40.915 --> 00:33:43.570
when if you would have just
ate the chocolate brownie

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.750
and appreciated it, and
savored it, and looked at it

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.250
as something like--

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:51.970
I guess precious-- looked
something at it like, wow,

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:54.129
this is something I really
get to enjoy right now.

00:33:54.129 --> 00:33:56.420
I'm going to savor it, I'm
going to feel good about it,

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.630
I'm going to eat it with
love, I'm going to--

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.670
really just bring
that into that.

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:02.520
And then you'll end
up processing it.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.020
You'll get any nutrients that
are in that chocolate brownie.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.560
You will get them.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.659
And you'll also
digest it differently.

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:12.520
And so I think there's a
balance of something like that,

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.870
when you want a craving.

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:17.860
And then also thinking of
this as preventative as well.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.871
By eating more of those
foods, it's called--

00:34:19.871 --> 00:34:21.370
what we learned in
nutrition school,

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:22.578
which is called crowding out.

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:28.510
So if you find yourself really
struggling with depression

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.082
or anxiety, and you start
incorporating more foods,

00:34:31.082 --> 00:34:32.540
it's not going to
happen overnight.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.540
But over time, what happens
is the more that you

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:38.980
eat those foods, it naturally
crowds out the other thing.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.900
People ask me all
the time, Lindsey,

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.448
how do you just have a piece of
dark chocolate and you're OK?

00:34:43.448 --> 00:34:44.739
Or you don't want these things?

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:46.239
I don't feel like
I'm depriving myself.

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:47.863
But naturally, just
the way that I've--

00:34:47.863 --> 00:34:49.270
I've been doing
this work since I

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:51.880
was 12 years old, since
I suffered from anxiety

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.500
and started to get help.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.840
And the first thing I did
was go to a wellness center

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.130
in my hometown.

00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:02.186
And through that experience,
I started learning

00:35:02.186 --> 00:35:03.310
about health and nutrition.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.670
And so this has been
over half my life.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:08.470
And so being easy
on yourself as well,

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.222
but also looking
at it as OK, I'm

00:35:10.222 --> 00:35:11.680
going to start
eating more of these

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.420
to naturally crowd out more
of those other cravings.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.320
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.150
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE: That's
just such a fair point.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:22.850
We all are constantly
beating ourselves up.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.150
And I know you've written
quite a bit about food guilt.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:26.900
LINDSEY SMITH: Um-hmm,
my whole last book.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.335
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE: It
was all about food guilt.

00:35:28.335 --> 00:35:28.630
LINDSEY SMITH: Yeah.

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:29.750
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE: But I
think since that came up,

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:31.966
can you talk to us a
little bit about what

00:35:31.966 --> 00:35:33.590
you recommend for
people who are trying

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.187
to get out of that cycle?

00:35:35.187 --> 00:35:36.020
LINDSEY SMITH: Yeah.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.680
So I did a survey
with the Nielsen group

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:44.210
and found that 85% of
women and 65% of men

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:45.985
experience food guilt
on a daily basis.

00:35:45.985 --> 00:35:47.360
And so I was
thinking about that.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.760
And I'm like, going in--
what are they called, MKs?

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.240
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE: Um-hmm.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.823
LINDSEY SMITH: OK,
going into the MK--

00:35:51.823 --> 00:35:52.820
I'm learning the lingo.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:56.930
Going into the MKs over there.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.550
Or into your pantry, into your
fridge, out at a restaurant.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:04.370
85% of the time,
women, specifically,

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:07.730
are feeling guilty, are
feeling stressed about food.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:11.130
And like I said, that is
causing stress on your body.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:13.680
You're not able to
digest things as well.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.380
So part of that is being able
to go into every situation.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.400
I always say, go into
every situation with food,

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.570
whether it's kale or a
cookie, with a sense of love

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:25.220
and appreciation for that.

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:29.145
I had a client once, and
I was teaching her this.

00:36:29.145 --> 00:36:30.770
And the one day,
she's like, Lindsey, I

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:32.930
was craving a
McDonald's cheeseburger.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:36.100
And I was like, OK,
what did you do?

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.120
I wanted to know.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.750
And she was like, well,
I was beating myself up,

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.387
but I was going to
go get it anyway,

00:36:42.387 --> 00:36:43.970
but then I was doing
that whole thing.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:45.020
But then I remembered
what you said.

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.561
So I was like, OK,
I'm going to allow

00:36:46.561 --> 00:36:48.230
myself to go there, to do this.

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:51.730
She was like, so I
went, I ordered it.

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:55.220
I was real nice to
the drive-thru people,

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.080
and I was like, thank you.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.670
And I go and pull over.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:01.490
And she's like, and I sit
there with my hamburger,

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:04.610
and I'm just like thinking
about the whole process

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:05.990
this hamburger took to get here.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.950
I was like, wow, the
farms that had this wheat

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:10.490
to make this bun.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:11.240
And she was like--

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.740
I mean, she was
really going for it.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.892
And she was like, I
stopped and appreciated it.

00:37:14.892 --> 00:37:16.600
She's like, and then
I ate the hamburger.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.650
And she's like, and guess what?

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:18.420
I was like, what?

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:19.970
And she's like, I
didn't get sick.

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:20.990
She's like, normally,
I would get sick.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:22.954
She's like, but I ate
a McDonald's hamburger,

00:37:22.954 --> 00:37:23.870
and I didn't get sick.

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:24.870
So I'm a little worried.

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:30.050
What she did is she was
like, and then I did it,

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:33.057
and I let it go, and it
didn't sit with me for weeks.

00:37:33.057 --> 00:37:34.640
I wasn't constantly
thinking about it.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.010
And she's like, to be
honest, it didn't even

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:38.457
do what it normally did for me.

00:37:38.457 --> 00:37:40.290
Because now I'm at the
point where I'm like,

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:43.160
OK, I don't feel
that like I need it

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.710
or that it's going to
provide me with something.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:49.160
Because I've been able to
just see it for what it is

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.440
and not make it a
bigger production

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.730
or bring more emotional
value than what it really is.

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:58.940
And oftentimes, we do that,
because food is very emotional.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.750
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE: Yeah,
that makes a ton of sense.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.353
Any live questions?

00:38:03.353 --> 00:38:04.677
Yeah, go for it.

00:38:04.677 --> 00:38:05.510
LINDSEY SMITH: More.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:07.990
Woo.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:09.720
AUDIENCE: So when
you have craving,

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.450
when do you know you
should go for it,

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:12.947
or when should you hold back?

00:38:12.947 --> 00:38:14.530
LINDSEY SMITH: That's
a good question.

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:16.590
I would say, you're
probably going

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:18.510
to not like me for this answer.

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:22.230
But I would say, I think
you really have to--

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:24.390
that's when it comes to
listening to your body

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:29.370
and being able to decipher
some of the differences.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:35.290
And I think it's not going
to come by being perfect.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.830
It's going to come from giving
in to a craving and being like,

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.770
oh, I didn't feel that
great because of it.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:46.770
Or it's not even giving in,
allowing yourself to go for it

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.960
and then seeing how you
feel in that moment.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.890
And taking all of
this as information,

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:55.630
thinking a bit like a Google
search, except for your body.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:56.790
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE:
Ooh, there you go.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:58.050
LINDSEY SMITH: Look at that.

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.480
I'm just really
cheesing it up today.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.107
But thinking of it as like
a search that's like, OK,

00:39:04.107 --> 00:39:05.190
this works or this didn't.

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:06.898
And asking yourself
the deeper questions,

00:39:06.898 --> 00:39:09.510
like, OK, well, why
am I craving this?

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:11.560
Is there something
happening today?

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.400
What's my stress level like?

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:19.380
And I even map out in the
book some different questions.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:20.610
Let me see where they're at--

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:22.230
different questions
to ask yourself

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:25.860
when you are feeling
like you want

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:33.817
to have something to really
kind of stop and ask yourself.

00:39:33.817 --> 00:39:34.900
I can't find it right now.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.600
But it's in here.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.960
The other thing that I
just noticed here too, is--

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.181
I'm like, look at what
I notice in my own book.

00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:46.170
But the other thing
that I noticed

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:50.520
is sometimes, part
of my method and my--

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:54.310
in this book, specifically--
is going deeper.

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:58.080
But then also saying,
OK, I'm craving sugar.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.130
I'm craving this.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.960
And then I have a
chart in here that says

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.240
what your body may really need.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.995
And so you'll be able
to start putting--

00:40:04.995 --> 00:40:06.870
it's like putting the
puzzle pieces together.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:10.090
You do the searches and
then you start mapping out.

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:13.290
And you're like, oh, so for
me, if I'm craving a burger,

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:19.400
I know that it's probably
that time, people, and my iron

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:23.290
is getting low, and that's
just what my body needs.

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:26.380
And so I know how
to fuel it properly.

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.690
But it didn't always
come that way.

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:33.634
So I think that can help.

00:40:33.634 --> 00:40:36.050
AUDIENCE: What's your approach
to influencing your friends

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:39.410
and family to eat healthier
without becoming that person?

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:40.580
LINDSEY SMITH: Ooh!

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.190
Girl.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:47.930
So my approach is just
having empathy for people,

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:49.640
trying to meet people
where they're at.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.790
When my dad got sick in 2000--

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:57.320
2010, I believe,
I was like, Dad,

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.880
we need to be
doing ginger shots.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.830
And I was telling
him all these things.

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:05.360
And what I realized
is that I had

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.520
to meet him where he was at.

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:11.870
He was a drinker, and a
smoker, and loves McDonald's.

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:13.760
I'm not going to--

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.361
this man is not going to
start doing ginger shots.

00:41:18.361 --> 00:41:20.360
So then what I did is I
met him where he was at.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.640
I was like, Dad, I bet you
can't do this ginger shot.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.830
Since he was a
drinker, I was like--

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:26.509
I like masked them
and was like, I

00:41:26.509 --> 00:41:28.050
bet this would be
too strong for you.

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:29.133
I know you're a vodka guy.

00:41:29.133 --> 00:41:31.490
But this ginger is even
stronger than vodka, Dad.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.570
And so it became kind of a joke.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:35.990
But I think meeting
people where they're at.

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:38.660
I think one of the
things that I try to do

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:42.500
is just have that empathy for
people and try to foster that.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.490
Because I have never
really met anyone

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:49.700
that got healthier
because of judgments.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:54.350
And if anything, it leads
to horrible eating cycles

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:55.610
over time.

00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:57.170
So something that
I try to do is just

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:01.280
be the example myself
and bring things.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.680
Bring a certain salad, or
a certain dish, or a bread,

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.760
and let them try it.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.540
And my mom had never
tried hummus before.

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.340
And I brought it.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:11.780
And now she's like, oh--

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:12.494
sorry.

00:42:12.494 --> 00:42:14.660
I'm from Pittsburgh, so
when I talk about my parents

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:15.770
I do the Yinzer accent.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:17.030
And it just almost came out.

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:20.150
Because we call ourselves--
people say yinz instead of you

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:21.200
guys or y'all.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:21.800
We say yinz.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.670
So my mom's like,
oh, I just loved it.

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:28.065
Oh, I just loved that
hummus that yinz got.

00:42:28.065 --> 00:42:28.940
That's how they talk.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.637
And then my father-in-law
the one day--

00:42:34.637 --> 00:42:35.720
he knows that I'm in this.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.580
And this was so sweet.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.254
He was like, Linds,
I got that quinoa

00:42:40.254 --> 00:42:41.420
that you were talking about.

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.540
And I was like, you mean quinoa?

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.220
But it showed that
they were interested.

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.360
And it was because this
is the way that I live.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.985
And I'm not going to
try to change you,

00:42:49.985 --> 00:42:52.100
but I will bring
something so that you

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.050
can try it and enjoy it too.

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:57.050
And so I think, with that, I've
seen changes in my own family

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:59.660
members through just
leading by example

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.905
and not being judgmental.

00:43:02.905 --> 00:43:04.280
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE:
That's huge.

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.560
I love your point about
people don't change

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.282
because they feel judged.

00:43:08.282 --> 00:43:10.490
They're going to change when
they're ready to change.

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:11.573
LINDSEY SMITH: Absolutely.

00:43:11.573 --> 00:43:16.220
And when I was the judgmental
person, everyone just hated me.

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:17.990
In fact, my friends
have a running joke.

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:19.739
They were like, yeah,
remember that period

00:43:19.739 --> 00:43:22.730
where we all stopped
talking to you.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.880
I'm like, those are great times.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.800
I was like, but at
least I had kale.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:33.172
it's just because that's
just not how we thrive.

00:43:33.172 --> 00:43:34.130
Now, some people maybe.

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.730
But I doubt it.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:36.260
It's probably a very
small percentage.

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.009
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE:
Yeah, I would say so.

00:43:41.164 --> 00:43:41.705
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:41.705 --> 00:43:43.000
I have a question.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.730
For all these fad
diets, which ones do you

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:49.450
find the most misleading or--

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:51.550
dangerous is too
extreme of a word--

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:56.260
and which ones do you see as
healthier options and ones

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:59.507
that you can incorporate along
with your daily nutrition?

00:43:59.507 --> 00:44:00.340
LINDSEY SMITH: Yeah.

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:01.370
That's a good question.

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:06.280
I think that the ones that
I hate the most personally

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:10.150
are the click bait
things that are like,

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:13.000
the five fruits that
are ruining your life.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.637
And I'm like, but it's fruit.

00:44:15.637 --> 00:44:17.470
You know, there's like,
why you should never

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:19.360
have a banana ever again.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.947
And I'm like, but it's a fruit.

00:44:21.947 --> 00:44:23.530
And I think that
that's where it comes

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:25.970
to listening to your body,
because then-- some people,

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:27.440
yeah, a banana is great.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.340
Some people-- it may
not sit well with you.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.160
So those are the ones
that I don't like.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:40.330
If anything is too restrictive,
over time, it's not feasible.

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:43.480
So if something is too--

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.094
I know a lot of people--

00:44:45.094 --> 00:44:47.260
some of these people are
my friends that have these,

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.010
so I don't want
to call them out.

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:52.480
But there's certain
trends, there's certain--

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:58.810
like diet programs that
come around every year.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:04.170
And I think the
problem with them

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:07.530
is that they're so
restrictive that long term,

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:09.957
it's hard for that to
become a lifestyle.

00:45:09.957 --> 00:45:11.540
Because then we carry
the guilt in it.

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:13.860
We're like, well,
I'm not doing--

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:18.110
oh, I want grains now, or
I want something now, then.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:20.830
And I can't have it.

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:21.810
So I think that.

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:26.040
I think the biggest thing
is more plant based.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.680
We can all afford to
eat more plant based.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.400
I think that's one thing
that I can get behind,

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.800
just because we should
all be eating more fruits

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.240
or vegetables anyway.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.580
So incorporating more
plant based foods

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:42.060
into your lifestyle, I think, is
one that'll never really go out

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.769
of style because of that.

00:45:44.769 --> 00:45:46.560
But it really just
comes down to listening.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:51.540
Because you can do any of those
types of diets and see what

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.770
feels best for you.

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:55.800
So if you're doing paleo,
that may work really well,

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.430
and you may say yes.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:58.860
And it can change.

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:02.100
I didn't eat poultry
for 10 years.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:05.460
And this past September,
all in one day,

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.950
I was like, I just need a
whole chicken right now.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:09.180
And I don't know.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:09.930
And you know what?

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:12.610
It was my collagen.

00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:15.240
I needed more
collagen in my joints.

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.000
And I was eating chicken,
and I was like, fine.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.560
My joints felt so much better.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.280
And so it can change.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:27.120
And being open to that, and
taking what you learn from it,

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.570
and going from there.

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:29.410
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE:
So I have a question.

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:30.201
LINDSEY SMITH: Yes.

00:46:30.201 --> 00:46:33.090
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE: I work
with a lot of women who suffer

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.100
or have suffered from
eating disorders.

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.430
So listening to their bodies
is really, really hard.

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:40.500
What recommendations
do you have for people

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.480
who are just getting
started on that journey

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.960
and maybe don't even
know what that means?

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.030
LINDSEY SMITH: I think
paying attention.

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:49.609
And I also think
finding support,

00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:51.150
you know, like
someone like yourself,

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:54.840
or just being able to
have someone that you

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.400
can talk to about these things.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.820
Because I think sometimes
talking through things

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:04.290
can help you realize,
oh, yeah, this

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:07.071
is why I did this or
this is why I did that.

00:47:07.071 --> 00:47:09.570
And being able to have that
kind of sounding board, I think,

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:10.750
is really important.

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:14.190
And then I think for anyone
just starting with the basics,

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:17.040
doing one thing a week for
yourself and your health.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.870
So many times we're like, I'm
going to the grocery store.

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:22.620
I'm getting all the
fruits and vegetables.

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.400
I have meal plans for days.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.032
I've got breakfast, lunch,
and dinner planned out.

00:47:27.032 --> 00:47:28.490
And then by Wednesday,
you're like,

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:30.600
oh, I just want a burger
from the local joint

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.520
down the street.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:35.510
Or half your groceries
just end up sitting there.

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:38.010
You don't eat them because it's
not what your body is really

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:38.590
wanting.

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:41.320
And so instead of going
all in, I just tell people,

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.660
hey, do one thing a week.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.950
Drink more water.

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:45.630
It's simple.

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:47.110
We don't do it, include myself.

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:51.490
I'm like, I need to start
hydrating this trip.

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.345
But just doing simple things.

00:47:53.345 --> 00:47:55.470
And over time, it just
becomes part of who you are.

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:56.580
And then the awareness.

00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:00.510
Because some people are at a
point where, like you said,

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:03.510
they're so conflicted
with all these things.

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:05.760
The other day I went
in a grocery store,

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:10.120
and there was half
the fat avocados.

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.380
I was like, what?

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:13.880
That's how they
were marketing them.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.890
And I'm like, half
the fat avoc--

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:17.770
just eat the avocado.

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:20.910
And all it was was an
avocado cut in half.

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:23.640
That's all it was.

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.290
It was just packaged like that,
like it's now half the fat.

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:30.010
I'm like, yeah, I can go get
one off the bin over here

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:31.405
for $3 less.

00:48:34.669 --> 00:48:36.710
But being bombarded with
that stuff all the time,

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:37.790
especially with an
eating disorder,

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:38.870
can be very sensitive.

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:41.860
And so I think seeking support
and then starting small

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:45.740
and being OK with yourself--
or not OK with yourself,

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:50.170
but being OK with
starting small.

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:51.960
Because it's hard
for a lot of people.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.190
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE:
Yeah, thank you.

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:54.310
We have another live question.

00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:54.790
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:55.270
LINDSEY SMITH: Hi.

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:57.436
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
suggestions for situations

00:48:57.436 --> 00:48:59.740
where you can't really
control your food?

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:00.910
I'm also from Pennsylvania.

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:02.269
So when I go home, it's like--

00:49:02.269 --> 00:49:03.310
LINDSEY SMITH: What part?

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:04.870
AUDIENCE: Northeast.

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:05.460
Scranton.

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:06.710
LINDSEY SMITH: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:08.300
AUDIENCE: So my mom
will be like, hey,

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.030
I know you like
avocado and kale now.

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:13.119
But here she bakes a pizza and a
dozen cupcakes for the two days

00:49:13.119 --> 00:49:13.660
you are here.

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:18.556
LINDSEY SMITH: So a couple
of my own personal tricks.

00:49:18.556 --> 00:49:20.180
I don't know if this
will work for you.

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:24.340
But I just tend to
bring snacks and bring--

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.250
so if I was going home,
I'd be like, oh, I'm

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:29.170
going to stop and
get some whatever.

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:32.440
And then you'd get something
healthy and bring it to share.

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.780
I'm always big into like
bringing things to share,

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:38.260
and selfishly, because
I want to know what

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.940
I'm walking into a little bit.

00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:45.370
And also, if there's something
that you want when you're home

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:49.330
or where it's hard,
I think it's just

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:52.210
going back to being mindful
of not beating yourself up

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:56.320
being like OK, this is
two days we're here.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.040
I brought these
snacks, and we're good.

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:00.820
But I know my mom really wants
to go to this pizza joint

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:02.110
because it means a lot to her.

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:04.557
And this is her way
of showing love,

00:50:04.557 --> 00:50:06.640
so I'm going to just
appreciate it for what it is.

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.410
And being kind of a little
bit easy on yourself.

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:11.320
And I think that'll
help you actually feel--

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.861
you'll probably feel
less anxious going home.

00:50:13.861 --> 00:50:16.360
Because you probably already
pre-worry about that before you

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.980
go home.

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:20.830
So I think that'll help you
ease into it a little bit more.

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:24.250
And just give yourself some
grace and empathy as well.

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:30.190
Because we tend to just beat
ourselves up before anything.

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:32.990
We pre-worry about food
more than I have ever.

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:35.251
And even myself,
I'm like, oh, am I

00:50:35.251 --> 00:50:37.000
going to know what I
eat when I get there?

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.860
It's like this thing.

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:44.020
But I think controlling what you
can, but then giving yourself

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:47.246
grace moving forward,
if that makes sense.

00:50:47.246 --> 00:50:48.710
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:49.870
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE: Any
other live questions?

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:51.245
Otherwise, we have
a few minutes,

00:50:51.245 --> 00:50:55.300
and I want to tackle
one more Dory question.

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.290
So I love the question
about anxiety.

00:50:57.290 --> 00:51:01.300
So what other things did you do
to help overcome your anxiety?

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.940
And if you still get anxious
today, how do you cope with it?

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:04.731
LINDSEY SMITH: Yes.

00:51:04.731 --> 00:51:06.550
So I definitely
still get anxious.

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:09.500
I'm not perfect.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.940
One of the things
when I was a kid--

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.440
and I don't think
I mentioned this--

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.370
but I suffered from anxiety.

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:16.520
I was hospitalized.

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:20.450
And I was kind of
intuitive as a kid,

00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:23.870
and I think which leads to the
approach that I take today,

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:25.730
because I've tapped into that.

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:30.350
But I said to my parents,
I was like, you know what?

00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:32.840
I don't want to
continue this way.

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.850
This is not being--

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:37.481
going to the hospital,
like all this, this isn't--

00:51:37.481 --> 00:51:38.480
I don't want to do this.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.340
So do you think I
could try something?

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:41.210
Could I get therapy?

00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:43.187
So my parents were like,
yeah, cool, whatever.

00:51:43.187 --> 00:51:44.270
We'll take you to therapy.

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.197
I'm like, great.

00:51:45.197 --> 00:51:47.030
They've never been to
therapy in their life,

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:48.405
but they're like,
sure, whatever,

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:50.090
which I was grateful for.

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:52.580
So I started going to
therapy, and it was OK.

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:57.020
But my therapist was old school,
so it was very straightforward,

00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:58.110
like OK.

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:00.560
And as you can tell, I'm wearing
a fruit and veggies suit.

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.060
I like to keep it
a little bit real.

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:08.540
My sister's eight
years older than me.

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.580
And she started going
to this wellness center,

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:12.590
and I saw a shift in her.

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:14.040
We suffered from similar things.

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.099
And I said, hey, can
I try that instead?

00:52:16.099 --> 00:52:17.390
So they were like, sure, great.

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:19.760
So I started going to
this wellness center.

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:24.630
And we really focused
on eating mindfulness.

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:29.210
He taught me Tai chi,
actually, as a 12-year-old.

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:30.350
Yeah, I know.

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:33.740
Acupuncture-- I was
doing all of it.

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:37.610
And those things
really helped me.

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:39.440
And by ninth grade,
I was actually

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:43.490
teaching stress management
workshops to my student council

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:44.810
conferences.

00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:47.100
Because I learned all
these different tools.

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:49.740
So I definitely think
that food is a part of it.

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.370
I know what foods can trigger
me and can trigger anxiety

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:53.780
within me.

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:57.660
But then sometimes,
I get anxiety.

00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.850
And I'm like, I
didn't eat anything,

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:02.850
I don't even feel
stressed in my mind.

00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:04.500
But my body is anxious.

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:10.080
And so for me, a lot of times
it has to do with taking less

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:13.560
screen time-- which I know is
not something Googlers want

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.360
to hear--

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.972
or just allowing
myself to veg out.

00:53:18.972 --> 00:53:21.180
Because so many times, I'm
one of those people that I

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:24.550
like to feel accomplished,
and to be doing something,

00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:27.240
and always have a
project to be working on,

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:33.240
to go forward on something,
but allowing that downtime.

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.610
And through that, I feel
like I have a toolbox,

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:38.190
and I can be like, OK,
well, let's try this thing.

00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:38.940
This doesn't work?

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:40.290
OK, let's try this.

00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:42.570
And so I have some different
resources like that,

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:46.530
like meditation or
lessening the screen time,

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:49.060
and making room for fun.

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:52.732
I didn't do that for years,
where I just was like, oh, I've

00:53:52.732 --> 00:53:53.940
got to grind, got to do this.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.860
And I wouldn't even
allow myself to have

00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:57.660
fun in situations
that should be fun

00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:59.618
because I'd always be
thinking about the things

00:53:59.618 --> 00:54:00.960
that I needed to do.

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:03.510
So making sure that you have
and allow time to just play,

00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:07.590
and have fun, and be silly,
and act like a little kid.

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:09.630
Sometimes I do that.

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:11.600
I'm ready to ride
those bikes after this.

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:14.670
I'm like, form my little
bike crew or whatever,

00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:16.010
just ride around Google.

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:17.090
Just stuff like that.

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:18.390
Silly, but it's fun.

00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:22.562
And it gets you out of
the stress sometimes.

00:54:22.562 --> 00:54:23.770
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE: Awesome.

00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:25.650
Well, thank you, Lindsey.

00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:28.290
We're so glad that you
were able to join us

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:32.760
and will now stick around for
questions and to give everybody

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.299
their book.

00:54:33.299 --> 00:54:34.340
LINDSEY SMITH: Yeah, woo!

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:34.870
KATHERINE EDGECUMBE: Thank you.

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:36.150
LINDSEY SMITH: Yay, thank you.

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:38.900
[APPLAUSE]
