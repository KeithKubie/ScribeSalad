00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.410
Competition is part of
what makes us human.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.530
We strive to be better,
stronger, faster.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.994
We set rules, invent sports,
arrange contests,

00:00:31.994 --> 00:00:34.210
and we yearn to win.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.020
Science and technology are tools
we use to improve our

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.030
performance.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.600
But while carbon fibre tennis
rackets and aerodynamic

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.970
bicycles might represent the
cutting edge today, sports and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.410
technology have been linked
since the very earliest

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.040
Olympic games more than
2,000 years ago.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.946
To ensure fairness, they would
draw a line in the dirt.

00:00:54.946 --> 00:00:58.430
But to improve things and ensure
continuity, year on

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.140
year, they cut two grooves
in a marble sill.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.000
You would stand on the sill
and put your toes in the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.180
groove before you started.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.210
It's one of the earliest
examples of sports technology,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.960
and something you can
still see today

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.210
at Olympia in Greece.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.470
Fast forward through history,
and we crash into the

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.090
Industrial Revolution.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.540
And for the first time, the
average worker had a little

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.760
bit of disposable income.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.950
But there were huge
numbers of them.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.400
And thanks to the new labour
laws, they also had the

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.970
Saturday afternoon off.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.150
So what to do with that time?

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.700
And the answer lies here in
Sheffield's Kelham Island

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.810
Industrial Museum and on the
fantastic shelves over there.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.120
So 19th century Sheffield was
a huge manufacturer of

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.830
cutlery, of hand tools,
and of cannon shells.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.450
So at lunch time on a Saturday
afternoon, the whistle would

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.140
go, and the workers would clock
out using the clocking

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.650
machines over there.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.190
They would then go down the pub
for a couple of hours and

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.910
then pass through those
turnstiles there into the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.550
football matches.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.840
And that's why traditionally
football starts at 3 o'clock

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.410
on a Saturday afternoon.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.760
The story is all there
on these shelves.

00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:42.440
[TRAIN WHISTLE]

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.930
The concentration of people,
existence of leisure time, and

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.910
availability of disposable
income were all required for

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.090
the development of team
sports like football.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.480
And that situation arose through
the technology of the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.960
Industrial Revolution.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.570
The steam engine was a key
development that powered mass

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.700
production.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.075
So when in 1827, Edward Budding
invented the lawn

00:03:04.075 --> 00:03:07.360
mower, steam power churned them
out by the thousands, so

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.480
that a neat lawn was no longer
the preserve of the rich.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.640
And in 1843, Thomas Hancock
patented the vulcanization of

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.690
rubber, so changing the rubber
ball from some obscure ancient

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.970
Mesoamerican invention to a
mass produced play thing.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.960
So with flat lawns and a bouncy
rubber ball, lawn

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.210
tennis was not far behind.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.190
When we consider the legacy of
the Industrial Revolution, we

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.240
might imagine scenes
like this.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.370
But these mills and factories
drove not just technological

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.010
change, but also changes
to society.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.160
And sports is an intimate
part of that.

00:04:01.054 --> 00:04:04.840
The Bessemer converter is a
symbol of large-scale steel

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.250
manufacture.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.340
Much of that steel went into
Britain's railways, and that

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.310
changed the landscape forever.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.220
Suddenly, huge numbers
of people

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.100
could travel long distances.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.980
And for sport, that
was a revelation.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.790
Football teams could travel to
away games, and fans could

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.459
follow them.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.210
And whether there were crowds,
there is money.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.860
So in little more than
a generation.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.580
sports had gone from something
that few could

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.570
afford to big business.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.630
Technology has driven sports
and, in turn, sports has

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.000
driven technology.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.350
We built these huge cathedrals
to sports.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.050
And we filled them with
technologies to help improve

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.600
our athletes' performance.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.140
Timing is no longer done
mechanically, but we use

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.610
fully-automated timing
systems.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.040
Telephoto lenses have
revolutionised the way the

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.450
media covers our sport, as have
the high-speed digital

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.220
cameras that have just
come on the market.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.510
Modern materials have profoundly
changed the nature

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.300
of some of our sports.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.150
And now science is so important
to sports that my

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.620
title is Professor of Sports
Engineering, something that

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.960
couldn't have happened a
mere two decades ago.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.275
These films are about the
next part of the story.

00:05:13.275 --> 00:05:15.910
They're about how we use our
scientific understanding of

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.820
sports to improve our athletes
and how it's changed the

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.591
nature of some of
those sports.

00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:25.980
We go to see how technology can
help a coach train their

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.290
athletes more effectively--

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.250
Oh, wow, I love that.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.000
--how we're developing ways to
measure and understand a sport

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.500
more deeply, but without
disturbing performance, and

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.200
how we can model all the
elements of a sport to test

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.515
the limits of the game and
safeguards its future.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.190
Ultimately, though, it's about
how we keep that balance

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.880
between progress
and tradition.

00:05:54.365 --> 00:05:55.615
Is it cheating?

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:29.862
