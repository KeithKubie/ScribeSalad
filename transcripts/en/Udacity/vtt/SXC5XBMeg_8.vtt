00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.589
What did you come up with, David?

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; So I started at the root,
is the origin North of 5N?

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.030
It certainly is.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.240
Is the origin East of 5E?

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.330
No, it's not.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.630
And is the origin East of 3E?

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.613
No, it's still not.

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:16.096
So I said Y would go
down here alongside A.

00:00:16.096 --> 00:00:17.850
That's good, David, but of course,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.200
we must find a way of
discriminating between A and Y.
