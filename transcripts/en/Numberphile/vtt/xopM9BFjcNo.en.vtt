00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.230
BRADY: I noticed one other thing, I noticed
on your board you have a magic square.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.230
Correct.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.260
BRADY: Why is that there today?

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:17.940
You know I spend part of my life doing interviews
and sometimes you have to vary things, you

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.480
know change a bit from the usual.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.949
And so in that interview this was to recall
my initial interest in mathematics.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.230
When I was a kid this was the kind of thing
that I loved doing - magic squares.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:40.430
I think it’s one of the oldest mathematic
memories that I have, doing large magic squares.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.420
There are techniques for doing the magic squares
when it's an even number but for instance

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.050
you would do like this.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.100
A child can learn how to do this.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:14.819
And I often explain about this in the schools
- it gives you some sense of mystery and power

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:16.929
of mathematics and algorithmics.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.509
And there you are Brady, see, it's magic.

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.740
BRADY: So basically this is to entertain journalists?

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.979
That's correct.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.609
But a bit more than that.

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:44.329
In this particular case the interview was
intended for children.

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:50.340
If I tell the children “you know mathematics
is so good for the GDP because its so good

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.049
for technology” and so on - not sure they
will like it.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.909
But if I tell them when I was a kid, at your
age, I loved to do this kind of figures and

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.779
it was kind of making me dizzy in a way to see
the properties of the numbers - this was my

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:09.390
start - and then it became my job.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.860
BRADY: How do you find striking that balance
Sometimes when you're talking to people about

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.200
mathematics you have to talk about things
like GDP and the important role it plays in

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.200
society.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.360
And other times you just want to show someone
a magic square and just excite them - is that

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.060
not enough, exciting them?

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.450
Does it frustrate you that you’re always
having to come up with these justifications

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.450
for mathematics?

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.400
You have to justify.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.350
Part of the reason is there has been some
excess in the past I guess in insisting on

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.780
mathematics for itself - mathematics for the
the beauty of it - and somehow we have to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.100
insist also on the other side now.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.520
But it's okay, you have to balance.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.550
Every time I say something about the utility
of mathematics, I will balance it with something

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.940
about its beauty.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.940
And vice versa.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.820
BRADY: It’s unusual to hear a mathematician
talk like that, you sound almost half politician.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.040
You think that's important?

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.570
Pure mathematics is not enough these days,
you've got to sing for your supper?

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:18.010
In front of you is not just a mathematician,
I'm director of an institute, already six

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.840
years.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:29.120
For the past four years I have been supporting
a project of expanding my institution and

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.500
managed to raise 13-14 million Euros for that
project.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.850
This can only be achieved if you know how
to talk to society; talking to businessmen,

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.290
talking to bankers, talking to politicians,
talking to school masters, talking to everybody.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.830
If you don't manage to talk the way they understand,
you will not become their friend.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:01.080
BRADY: But when you were younger man doing
some of your work you're most famous for - most

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.500
awarded for - were you thinking like that
then?

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.200
Or were you just doing it for the pleasure
and was it just about mathematics then?

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.230
You know when I chose my subject, Boltzmann
Equation, my adviser wrote for me the Boltzmann

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:22.620
Equation, okay one variant of the Boltzmann
Equation, I asked is it useful and who used

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.620
it?

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.690
And for me at that time this was an important
question.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:33.310
To know that it was important in the modelling
of rarefied gases, important for construction

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.210
of shuttles or planes or simulation of what
goes on around the wing of the plane and so

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.210
on.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.250
It was important for me.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.930
And later when I worked on it I discovered
I really loved it for the beauty of the study,

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.960
that the more I was going into it and the
more it was a world opening for me.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.000
It was a curiosity that was driving me then.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.160
But to get into it I first had to be convinced
of its utility.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.790
There's no shame in something being useful.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:18.900
Somehow it's a little bit of poison that Hardy
has instilled in our minds, making us feeling

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.450
ashamed of what is useful.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.940
These were other days, other times and different
context.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.470
Now we should not be ashamed of what is useful
and even understand that when it is useful

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.290
it is even more beautiful.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.060
There has to be some useful and some useless.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.940
Sometimes the useful becomes useless, sometimes
the useless will become useful.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:50.120
There has to be room for all kinds of mathematicians
and it's a big illusion to think that there

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.290
is a real recipe to decide what has to be
funded and what should not.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.980
You know you have to allow some uncertainty
in the system.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.470
If you try to predict, you lose the most interesting
parts.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.070
BRADY: Do you think mathematicians are good
at outreach?

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.410
Do you think mathematicians are good at explaining
themselves?

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.240
In general mathematicians are not so good
at outreach.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.230
And there are reasons for that.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:24.100
Some reasons are related to the field itself;
because we go into such details.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.560
You know even between ourselves mathematicians
it is difficult to communicate.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.730
It's so hard to communicate between mathematicians
of different specialties.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.889
To talk to the oouter public, the outer audience,
is an even greater challenge.

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:44.840
You have really get to the point, understand
what you want to share and so on.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:51.560
Another reason is when you are into mathematics
you have been so high on the scale of complexity

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:58.120
of reasoning that you are living in some kind
of altered reality.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.889
You think that everybody on the street is
able to understand complicated reasoning and

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:04.889
so on.

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:09.740
And you get very frustrated when you discover
that's not the case.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.560
And then there's a third reason, I guess.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:22.740
Which has to do with, how do you say, the
business model of mathematics so to speak.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:29.270
The physicists, the chemists, the biologists
- they are often in contact with the industry.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:37.210
Or the people who run big teams, they have
to negotiate budgets, fundings, with the big

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:43.580
pharmacy companies, or with the big sponsors,
otherwise they don't have enough funding for

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.550
the experiments and so on.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:50.290
And so they their learn to --- their rhetoric
and speech and so on.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:58.040
It struck me when I first attended the conferences
of Nobel Prizes how good were some of the

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:04.290
people, Nobel Laureates, in physics and biology,
to present themselves.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:09.750
And I attributed that to the fact that they
had to do it already many times for the funding

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:15.919
in their career to people who were really
out of their world, and it was very important

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:18.990
to convince those people to trust them.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:23.760
BRADY: And historically mathematicians don't
need as much funding?

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:30.630
Historically we don't need the companies,
historically no such need for support.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:36.200
I need the companies now because I am working
on this outreach interface.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:43.380
We are soon opening some kind of museum of
mathematics - soon means in three years or

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.450
something.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:50.890
This will be impossible without the contribution
of the industry, the economic world, so I

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:57.600
had to learn to talk to them otherwise my
projects could not have come

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.300
into life.
