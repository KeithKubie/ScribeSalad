[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.800
SPEAKER: It's an
honor to be here.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.260
I wanted to begin by saying that
I've been interested in Cuba

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.510
for a long time.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.160
We have an employee named
Brett Perlmutter, who's here,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.010
who's really one of the
heroes of the company, who,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.990
working with a team, has figured
out how we engage in Cuba.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.510
And Google's position
is that we want

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.050
Cuba to be as successful
and connected as possible,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.840
and we've done our part.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.170
And I went to Cuba 2 and
1/2 years ago, and then more

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.900
recently, in December, so my
second visit, during which time

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.270
I met with
[INAUDIBLE] Leal who's

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.007
the historian of the country.

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:52.340
And I thought it would be
interesting to talk about Cuba

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.800
here with people
who are interested,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.510
but also to honor your service
and commitment to your country.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.390
So your background-- probably be
the most significant historian

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.880
in the country,
officially has the title

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.050
of the historian of Havana.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.370
But if you've been
to Havana, you

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.830
know that it is the cultural
center of the country.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.670
And I thought we should start
by asking you about Jose Marti

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.330
and why he's so important and
why you're here in New York.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.480
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.250
INTERPRETER: Well,
first of all, I'd

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.767
like to thank you all
for welcoming here,

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:56.350
specifically to the headquarters
here in New York City, which,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.120
by the way, is absolutely
beautiful and inspiring.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.380
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.170
INTERPRETER: I'm actually
in New York on, if you will,

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.160
what is a romantic
visit of sorts.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.720
20 years ago, I
came to New York,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.120
and I found myself
in Central Park.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.030
And I found a beautiful
sculpture of Jose Marti.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.210
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.920
INTERPRETER: It was actually
put together or created

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.370
by an artist, an American
artist, who was a bit avant

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.190
garde in her creation,
because of the fact

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.320
that no other
sculpture of its type

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.940
had ever been seen of a poet,
historian, or statesman,

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.850
and it drew my attention.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.600
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:03:23.057 --> 00:03:24.890
INTERPRETER: Huntington,
who was the author,

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.050
studied the Italian
school of culture,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.700
and she was able to take
the idea or personality

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.640
behind Marti and really
hone in on his personality

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.800
to create this work of art.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.523
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:03:49.546 --> 00:03:51.670
INTERPRETER: And, of course,
the type of technology

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.740
that she used in
creating this went

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.720
against every kind
of school of thought

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.790
at that time in the
creation of this monument.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.630
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:44.650
INTERPRETER: And,
of course, an idea

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.180
came to mind at
that time, which was

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.110
to create a work of art that was
similar to the same sculpture

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.240
that I had seen in Central Park.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.650
This was an idea
that, of course,

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.810
took two decades in the making.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.430
And at the moment,
I'm actually very

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.180
close to coming to
fruition with that idea.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.060
And, of course, the idea
of creating a copy of this

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.810
is also to create the same
type of sensitivity and genius

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.600
that this artist used in
honing in on the life of Marti

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.620
here in New York
City, who actually--

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.420
he lived 15 years here
in New York, more time

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.770
here than he did in Cuba.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.620
And he experimented
with culture and all

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.080
of the American
know-how at that time.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.720
So, of course,
now at this point,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.850
I'm trying to see
what I can do to bring

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.150
that same type of appeal that
is found in this work of art

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:40.310
to the city of Havana that
saw Marti be born in Cuba.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.530
SPEAKER: It's interesting
that in Cuba, there

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.360
are no statues of Fidel Castro.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.570
And yet there is
a great reverence

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.310
for both Fidel and Jose Marti.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.720
Why is it that there are
no effigies of Fidel,

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.350
but you're very
focused on Marti?

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.020
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.370
INTERPRETER: He was
completely against any sort

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.190
of cult of personality,
anything that

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.540
involved creating monuments
or statues or plazas

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.580
or institutions.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.410
And he was completely
in tune with the idea

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.620
that Marti tried to leave
for the world, which

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.030
was to create a better world.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.290
He then himself knew that
Marti believed in this,

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.670
and it was emblematic.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.570
You would probably say that my
words are a bit contradictory

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.730
in what Fidel wanted, but in
essence, his passion will also

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.530
be part of this statue.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.510
And it's also the
America that Marti

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.470
wanted to create, our America.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.550
SPEAKER: So Google has
also helped with Marti

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.780
by building a virtual
reality demonstration

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:52.290
that we have showed off
for using our VR goggles.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.850
And so I'd like to
understand a little bit more

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:02.370
about the history of Havana
and its preservation.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.370
You were heavily
involved in making

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.520
Havana become a
UNESCO World site

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.300
and preventing its development.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.550
Was that your idea?

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.250
Was that Fidel's idea?

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.880
How did it really work?

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:59.882
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:08:59.882 --> 00:09:01.340
INTERPRETER: First
of all, I'd like

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.960
to thank Google for the
creation of the goggles,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.250
where children are able to sort
of witness the history that's

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.830
been played out in Havana
for a very long time.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.390
It's almost as if their feet
have been held to the fire,

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.764
so to speak, so that they can
actually witness everything

00:09:17.764 --> 00:09:19.100
that's happening in real time.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:24.440
And secondly, the restoration
of the Cuban Civic Center

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.180
for History, which has now
seen a Renaissance in what

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.880
is the new history that
will be created in Cuba.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.790
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.960
INTERPRETER: Of
course, in keeping

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.930
with the tradition of
Spanish literature,

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.690
which is always to look back
into the past and sort of look

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.630
at everything romantically and
think that the past is always

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.670
better than the present
or even the future,

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.180
this sort of seems to
be the proper setting

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.790
for the narration of this film.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.180
And of course, this
would be the best link

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.072
for the past to the future.

00:10:16.072 --> 00:10:17.780
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.100
INTERPRETER: Of
course, this idea

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.710
was never really
understood, and I'd

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.400
like to hearken back to what I'd
like to call heroic times about

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.310
four decades ago, where I was
walking through the streets

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.980
and collecting all
sorts of information

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.080
to then be able to
recount all of this

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.610
and use this as a
point of departure

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.332
for this kind of
[INAUDIBLE] project.

00:10:54.332 --> 00:10:56.040
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:10:59.231 --> 00:11:00.730
INTERPRETER: Of
course, I then found

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.350
faithful workers, who
accompanied me on this task,

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.010
or adventure, if you will.

EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:

EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:11:44.117 --> 00:11:45.825
INTERPRETER: And of
course, at that time,

00:11:45.825 --> 00:11:48.610
Alejo Carpentier, one
of the contributors

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:52.900
to the American letters, saw
this very thin, frail, young

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.540
boy walking down the streets
with a load of rocks.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.180
And he asked, who is this boy?

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.760
And someone said,
someone who's actually

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.690
chasing an impossible dream.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.450
And he said, he will
probably make it.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:08.140
He will probably get very far
with that two-wheeled cart.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.820
And it's actually
prophetic on his part

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.160
that he actually said that.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.910
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:

that point, my work

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.180
actually became a sort of
Greek republic, if you will.

EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:12:26.485 --> 00:12:28.360
INTERPRETER: Since I
had to create everything

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.860
from its inception,
it's as though I

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.470
had to create both the bow
and arrow at that point.

EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:12:44.447 --> 00:12:46.030
INTERPRETER: Of
course, at that point,

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.490
Fidel came to me with a
delegation from Chile.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.220
He came to old Havana,
and apparently, someone

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.570
had mentioned what
I was trying to do.

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.490
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:13:04.002 --> 00:13:05.460
INTERPRETER: And
of course, he then

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.760
asked me, what is
it that you need?

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.426
This was after he had
finished his tour.

00:13:08.426 --> 00:13:09.760
And I said, absolutely nothing.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.260
And he said, if I asked you for
something, you won't come back.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.132
He laughed, and he
laughed a lot, actually.

00:13:15.132 --> 00:13:15.840
And then he left.

of course, instead

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.920
of being a subordinate
of his or someone

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.190
that was in need of something,
he actually became a benefactor

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.580
to this grand opus.

EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:

to its inception as it is now.

EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:14:03.246 --> 00:14:06.810
INTERPRETER: At that point,
many fortresses in the island,

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.140
on the island-- over
50 palaces, churches,

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.850
and all sorts of
plazas and arches--

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.030
began to be refurbished.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:19.087
Radio and TV also lent
their help to this,

00:14:19.087 --> 00:14:21.420
and it was all to sort of
create the infrastructure that

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.020
was necessary so that then

with the Americans

and that Cuba was a
very important part

of the Spanish empire, and
much of their Caribbean work

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.890
was done from
Havana, which is why

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.500
Havana is such a rich place.

EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:

INTERPRETER: I was recently
in Cuba a few weeks ago,

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.644
and I'd like to ask you
a question concerning

00:24:35.644 --> 00:24:37.310
the restoration of
the infrastructure,

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.710
specifically the buildings.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.320
Do you think that
that is in the works?

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.030
Is the work being sped up?

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:48.662
How long do you foresee that
happening in the near future?

00:24:48.662 --> 00:24:50.370
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.690
INTERPRETER: And since you
say that, I believe so.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.260
I believe so that we
will be able to do that.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:31.090
I've recently been studying a
lot of the monuments in Cuba,

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:35.080
and I've been working with
architects and archaeologists.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:40.120
Recently, we've tried to locate
the remains of the old city

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:40.870
walls.

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:42.670
Unfortunately, those
remains are now

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:44.740
covered by parking
lots for buses

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.900
of all types, tourist buses.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.890
And you know, at that
point, I said, break it all.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:52.740
If you need to open
the streets, do so.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.490
And I'm the kind of
person that's actually

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:57.760
been very lucky and fortunate,
because every time I crack open

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.040
the street, I find
something below.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.650
We did find the remains
of the city wall,

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:06.640
and we're very happy
about that at this moment.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:11.080
And with that same spirit, we
hope to pursue other projects.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.570
You know, it's
very easy to build,

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:15.640
but it's very
difficult to restore.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.180
And unfortunately, we haven't
been very lucky in the area,

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.890
in the economic arena.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:23.890
You know, it's funny something
like UNESCO will grant me

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.200
a title of a count,
but they won't

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.180
allow us to receive
the money that we

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.090
need to do this to
make sure that we

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:37.090
can improve upon our national
heritage, which is our city.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:41.725
It's easier to get blood than it
is to get money in some cases.

00:27:41.725 --> 00:27:43.620
SPEAKER: Do we have
a question here?

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.270
Yes, sir.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.980
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:28:14.474 --> 00:28:16.390
INTERPRETER: Thank you
so much for being here.

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:18.348
Thank you so very much
for your wisdom as well.

00:28:18.348 --> 00:28:22.500
I'd like to put a rather
uncomfortable question to you,

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.560
if you will.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.280
But there is a long history
of American companies

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.320
that have gone to
Cuba specifically

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.800
to exploit its riches.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.710
What can you say at the
moment about the situation?

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.760
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.560
INTERPRETER: Again, if you
ask me this question now,

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.440
and if I am put to the
alternative knowing

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.215
full well what's
being offered to us,

00:29:52.215 --> 00:29:54.340
I think the most important
thing now is that now we

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:56.900
are stewards of our own future.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:02.130
We are stewards of our own
sky and our own land in Cuba.

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:03.940
And it is up to
us now to decide.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.380
Perhaps in the
past, it would have

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.901
been more difficult
to decide what to do,

00:30:08.901 --> 00:30:09.900
what to do in this case.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.010
What are our choices?

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:16.210
The alternative that is before
us now is an interesting one,

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:19.630
and again, I will say
this for a second time.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:24.550
The word, romantic--
revolutions are not romantic.

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.550
But I would be hard
pressed to believe

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:31.000
that if I saw a revolution
that wasn't romantic,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.874
I would probably be
very doubtful of it.

00:30:34.874 --> 00:30:36.740
SPEAKER: Yes, sir.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.690
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:30:47.492 --> 00:30:48.950
INTERPRETER: What
do you believe is

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:51.450
one of the most important things
that Americans need to know

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.730
to change their view on Cuba?

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:56.220
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:32:06.112 --> 00:32:08.320
INTERPRETER: The first thing
I'd like for you to know

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.510
is that Cuba is a friendly
and hospitable country.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:14.530
We welcome any and
all to our country.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:16.720
If there are athletes
present, and, of course,

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.303
their national anthem
is being played,

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:19.562
everyone stands in respect.

00:32:19.562 --> 00:32:21.520
If you're walking down
the street as a tourist,

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.570
people greet you.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:25.780
The most important thing is
that we have different views

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.365
and different ways of thinking.

00:32:27.365 --> 00:32:28.990
And of course, there
are certain dogmas

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:31.450
that have been
imposed, particularly

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:34.660
in the realm of economics.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.390
The United States is one of
the only countries in the world

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:39.250
that cannot visit Cuba openly.

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.200
Its citizens cannot
visit Cuba openly.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:47.860
It is easier for you to visit
the democratic country of North

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.470
Korea than it is to visit Cuba.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:54.670
We are tied by historical,
poetic, and artistic ties,

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:56.830
and that is what we
need to focus on.

00:32:56.830 --> 00:33:01.300
And we need to make sure that we
vanquish any sort of separatism

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.140
on our part.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.010
It is time to destroy
any kind of wall

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:06.790
that we may have
built in the past.

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:09.100
It is time to unite,
and it is time

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:14.290
to remember that we are
more together than we think.

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:17.590
SPEAKER: As a person who's been
to North Korea and to Cuba,

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:21.280
I can tell you it's easier
to get to North Korea.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.640
So Professor is correct.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:29.680
The good news is if you've
not been to Cuba before, it's

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.210
relatively easy to go under
one of 12 categories now,

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:37.770
and I would strongly
recommend that you visit.

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:40.750
Strong, strong recommendation
that you visit.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:43.070
Yes, ma'am.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.389
I'm so happy about this new era
which is being born in Cuba.

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:26.420
I'd like to know
what you think is--

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.040
what is your dream for
Cuba at the moment,

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.210
particularly for the future?

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:34.226
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:35:52.349 --> 00:35:54.140
INTERPRETER: Every
single error, of course,

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.390
poses its own challenges.

00:35:56.390 --> 00:36:00.020
And sometimes those challenges
are not prudent at the moment.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.780
And of course, with the opening
of the relations between Cuba

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.240
and the United States,
there are many things that

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.890
still need to be worked out.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:08.870
There are many
delicate issues that

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:10.760
still need to be talked about.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.980
But I believe that we are
definitely on the right path.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.110
My dream, my wish
for Cuba is that Cuba

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.810
will become more participatory,
that its population will

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:23.930
be more involved in its future,
that there will be more equity,

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:25.700
and that there will
be more prosperity.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:29.000
Of course, the Cuba of
yesteryear, the Cuba from two,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.940
three years ago will no
longer be in existence,

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.940
that people will be
able to have a life full

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:39.770
of dignity, that, of course,
the difference, the anguishing

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:43.410
difference that richness
versus poverty poses

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:46.100
will also allow people
to live a better life,

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.340
and ultimately, that there
is more justice for everyone.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.470
That is the main goal,
and that is the thing

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:55.260
that I am dreaming for in Cuba.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.370
SPEAKER: Yes, sir.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.420
And I think we
have one following,

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.250
and these will be our
last two questions.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:01.886
So yes, sir.

INTERPRETER: Thank you
so very much for coming.

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:52.720
I wanted to mention that
one of the successes

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.980
of the Cuban revolution was
the push for literacy in Cuba.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.500
And of course,
today, the internet

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.620
is a proponent of
this on a world scale.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:06.130
What do you believe is
something that we at Google can

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:09.280
do to afford the
children of Cuba access

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.930
to information and content to
better allow them to get access

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.470
to a well-rounded education?

EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:05.910
INTERPRETER: First
of all, I'd like

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:09.690
to answer your question
with the same excitement

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:14.280
and respect that you
garnered or warranted me.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.830
The fact that Google
came to Havana

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:21.750
and showed its respect by
offering to help us with this

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.730
is something that is
of true importance,

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:26.880
because we have been
denied bandwidth in Cuba

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.690
for a very long time.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:30.990
And as you mentioned,
it is imperative

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:32.890
that we do right
by our children.

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:34.710
In fact, the most
important thing

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.810
that we can do for
the Cuban children

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:40.180
is to provide them with
an equal education.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:44.520
In fact, they are its
most important capital.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.440
Aside from any
type of technology

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.180
that can be brought
to the island,

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.980
its citizens are
actually the ones

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.140
who are the stewards of
the country and the ones

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.640
that will help us in the future.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.240
The idea of social
peace in the country

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.340
is something that we
have promoted also.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.020
There are no
kidnappings in Cuba,

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.140
because if we were
to kidnap someone,

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:07.990
there would be no money to pay
for the kidnappers, of course.

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:11.850
So we would like to also
welcome Google again

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:16.350
to our coasts to
live out the life

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:18.960
that Marti had envisioned
through this virtual reality

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.030
that they so graciously
provided us with

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:22.590
and that they've created.

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:25.094
Thank you very much.

00:41:25.094 --> 00:41:28.170
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:41:34.234 --> 00:41:36.650
INTERPRETER: Thank you so much,
Professor, for being here.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:40.610
As a historian, what do you feel
is the impact of the internet

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:41.860
on society?

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.830
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:41:51.054 --> 00:41:52.970
INTERPRETER: Well, I'd
like to first point out

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:57.560
that my generation would bring
a cassette recorder to a party,

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.410
and we had to carry the
equipment among two people.

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:02.690
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:42:51.961 --> 00:42:53.960
INTERPRETER: Well, I'll
start off with the word,

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.530
sensational, because it's
been a sensational revolution.

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:00.762
When I think about the
19th century in New York

00:43:00.762 --> 00:43:02.970
and everything that happened
involving the telephone,

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:05.840
the radio, it is awe-inspiring
to think that you can look up

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.510
anything now on the internet .

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.670
Amazing is the word.

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:13.190
It's something that you can
look up on Google at any point.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.791
In fact, I work very
closely with my assistant

00:43:15.791 --> 00:43:17.540
to look up anything
that I need on Google.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.610
As a historian, sometimes
I need to make sure

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:21.720
that I verify a
source, or perhaps I

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.990
have omitted some
type of factoid.

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:28.220
And it's amazing that today,
you can do all of this.

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:32.650
And we are at the threshold
of a new generation.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:36.510
SPEAKER: When the history
of Cuba is written,

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:38.950
and the history of
Havana is written,

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:41.170
it will be history of Dr. Leal.

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:47.530
Foolishly with a
wheelbarrow, he set out

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:53.260
to preserve one of the
great things of humanity.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:57.130
I admire him greatly,
and I encourage

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:01.090
you to spend as much time as
you can to study his work.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:03.580
And it's a great honor to
welcome you here to Google.

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:09.770
EUSEBIO LEAL SPENGLER:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:45:13.019 --> 00:45:14.810
INTERPRETER: Thank
you-- first of all, sir,

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:18.410
thank you so much for opening
your doors here at home to me.

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.750
And it's amazing, because
ever since we met,

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:24.260
I believe that our admiration
was always reciprocated.

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:28.700
It's been a great honor for
me to come here to visit you

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:29.965
in your very own headquarters.

00:45:29.965 --> 00:45:32.090
And interestingly enough,
I've never really thought

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:35.540
about what sort of memory
will be held about me

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.810
or had about me in
posterity in the future.

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:42.770
I've always liked to walk
around old cemeteries

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:45.110
and read all of
the inscriptions.

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:46.945
We'll never forget you.

00:45:46.945 --> 00:45:49.070
It's interesting, because
I've never really thought

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:52.359
about this, but as I
think about my own life,

00:45:52.359 --> 00:45:53.900
I think that the
most important thing

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.150
is what I haven't
accomplished in life,

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:57.770
what has yet to be done.

00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:01.190
And I've always said, I wish
I could live once again.

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:04.190
I could have one more life,
and I'd do it all over again.

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:06.230
I'd do exactly
what I did before.

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:09.800
And I would dedicate it
to the very same ideals.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.360
And, of course, I
would choose to be

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.810
born in the same land, the very
same land in which I was born--

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:15.650
Cuba.

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:16.380
So thank you.

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:18.380
SPEAKER: Thank you all,
and thank you, Dr. Leal.

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:22.030
[APPLAUSE]
