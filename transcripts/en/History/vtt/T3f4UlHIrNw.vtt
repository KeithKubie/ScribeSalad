00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.500
J NEILSON: Smiths, welcome to
our strength test.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.460
I'm going to take each of
your multi-purpose blades

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.620
and I'm going to
pry, hammer, and chop

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.380
into these nails and spikes.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.210
I want to see what they're
going to do to your blades.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.380
I'm not too concerned what
your blades do to them.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.210
Nicholas, you're up first.
How are you feeling?

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.500
NICHOLAS: A little nervous.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.460
J NEILSON: We're
going to do it anyway.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.460
NICHOLAS: I know, I know.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.380
J NEILSON: OK, let's do it.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.750
[music playing]

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.420
NICHOLAS: I'm feeling
as nervous as I felt

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.080
going into this competition.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.330
But I'm fairly
confident in the edge.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.170
I'm very confident
in the hammer.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.750
If those pry teeth hold up,
I might just stand a chance.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:59.000
[music playing] [hammering]

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.420
J NEILSON: All right Nicholas,
we've got a couple issues here.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.080
During the pry it popped
off one of your teeth here.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.790
And it actually, instead of
pulling the nail out further,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.210
it actually buried the head
further into the wood block.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.290
Now coming over to the hammer
strike, having this down here,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.790
it's like taking
a hammer at home,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.290
cutting the handle off and
just trying to use that.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.920
That's big design
flaw right there.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.580
On the plus side, your blade
edge held up pretty well.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.540
Mark, how are you feeling
after seeing that?

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.750
MARK: Tear it up.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.290
J NEILSON: Oh,
don't tell me that.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.380
MARK: I'm feeling
excited and nervous.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.040
I hope my blade doesn't explode.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.120
But either way I'm
in a good mood.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:49.580
[music playing]

00:01:49.580 --> 00:02:05.420
[hammering]

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.500
J NEILSON: Mark,
overall I like this.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.250
The pry tines were
a little bit tight.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.420
I had to actually wedge it in
there to get that nail out.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.250
Problem I have is
the hammerhead.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.330
It's not that much wider
than the nail heads itself.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.670
So it's really hard getting
an accurate strike on there.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.670
On your edge, it actually
held up pretty well.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.670
You've got little
wrinkles there.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.710
But overall, everything
stayed tight.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.710
Good job.
MARK: Cool.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.120
Thank you.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.880
J NEILSON: So Garrin,
how are you feeling?

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.040
GARRIN: I'm feeling a little bit
more nervous than I was before.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.210
J NEILSON: OK.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.830
Well, let's see
what happens here.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.170
[music playing]

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.460
GARRIN: When I saw
Nicholas's fork break,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.830
I thought, Oh God, this
can't be good for me.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.540
I've got the same steel.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.330
I've got the same design.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.880
So I'm worried about the same
exact thing happening for me.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:07.330
[music playing]

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.920
J NEILSON: All right
Garrin, obviously we

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.420
got a problem here.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.420
It was such a clean
break, what I'm thinking

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.920
is you probably had some kind
of microfracture in the edge

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.670
that we couldn't even see.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.250
Trying to lever it up, the teeth
we're just burying in the wood.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.330
So when I tried to jam it in
and lever it up the other way,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.250
bang.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.080
That's when we blow apart.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.830
WIL WILLIS: Nicholas,
Garrin, both of you

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.710
had a problem in
the strength test.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.250
Nicholas, your blade
suffered significant damage

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.920
by losing one of the teeth.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.250
However, we were able to do
the chop test with your blade.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.830
Garrin, your blade
snapped in half.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.750
That is catastrophic
blade damage

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.580
and you can no
longer even continue

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.000
with our strength test.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.540
And for that reason I
have to ask you, Garrin,

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.250
to please leave the forge.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.790
GARRIN: [bleep] I'm
feeling pretty [bleep]..

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.920
I agree with the decision
that the judges made.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.210
But I really wanted to see
Doug do a cutting test.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.420
Knives are not crowbars,
tell your friends.
