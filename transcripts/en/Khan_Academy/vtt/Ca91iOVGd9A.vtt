00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.203
- [Voiceover] What's up everybody?

00:00:01.203 --> 00:00:03.667
I wanna talk to you about beat frequency,

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:05.021
and to do so let me talk to you

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:07.693
about this air displacement
versus time graph.

00:00:07.693 --> 00:00:09.583
So this is gonna give you the displacement

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:14.121
of the air molecules for any
time at a particular location.

00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:16.590
So say you had some
speaker and it was playing

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.296
a nice simple harmonic
tone and so it would sound

00:00:20.296 --> 00:00:21.852
something like this.

00:00:21.852 --> 00:00:23.636
(tone playing)

00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:27.212
That's 440 hertz, turns
out that's an A note.

00:00:27.212 --> 00:00:29.196
People use that a lot when
they're tuning instruments

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:32.810
and whatnot so that's this
sound would sound like,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.036
and let's say it's sending this sound out

00:00:35.036 --> 00:00:38.296
and at a particular
point, one point in space,

00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:40.685
we measure what the
displacement of the air is

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:42.057
as a function of time.

00:00:42.057 --> 00:00:43.763
Let's just say we're three meters

00:00:43.763 --> 00:00:45.397
to the right of this speaker.

00:00:45.397 --> 00:00:47.116
Just so we have a number to refer to,

00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:49.084
so there's air over
here, the air's chillin,

00:00:49.084 --> 00:00:52.297
just relaxin and then
the sound wave comes by

00:00:52.297 --> 00:00:54.688
and that causes this air to get displaced.

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:56.155
It moves back and forth.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:58.580
A minuscule amount but some amount,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.325
and if we graphed that displacement

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:02.859
as a function of time
we would get this graph.

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.263
So in other words this entire graph

00:01:05.263 --> 00:01:08.497
is just personalized
for that point in space,

00:01:08.497 --> 00:01:10.782
three meters away from this speaker.

00:01:10.782 --> 00:01:12.029
So why am I telling you this?

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:14.592
Well because we know if
you overlap two waves,

00:01:14.592 --> 00:01:16.359
if I take another wave and
let's just say this wave

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.903
has the exact same
period as the first wave,

00:01:18.903 --> 00:01:20.152
right so I'll put these peak to peak

00:01:20.152 --> 00:01:21.693
so you can see, compare the peaks, yep.

00:01:21.693 --> 00:01:23.275
Takes the same amount of time

00:01:23.275 --> 00:01:25.380
for both of these to go through a cycle,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.783
that means they have the same period,

00:01:26.783 --> 00:01:28.363
so if I overlap these,
in other words if I took

00:01:28.363 --> 00:01:31.428
another speaker and I played
the same note next to it,

00:01:31.428 --> 00:01:34.080
if I played it like this I'd
hear constructive interference

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.502
cause these are overlapping peak to peak,

00:01:36.502 --> 00:01:38.544
valley to valley perfectly.

00:01:38.544 --> 00:01:40.906
This note would get louder
if I was standing here

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:43.362
and listening to it and it
would stay loud the whole time.

00:01:43.362 --> 00:01:45.739
It would just sound
louder the entire time,

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:47.250
constructive interference,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.674
and if I moved that speaker
forward a little bit

00:01:49.674 --> 00:01:51.852
or I switched the leads,
if I found some way

00:01:51.852 --> 00:01:53.342
to get it out of phase so that

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:54.930
it was destructive interference,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.033
I'd hear a softer note,
maybe it would be silent

00:01:57.033 --> 00:02:00.003
if I did this perfectly and
it would stay silent or soft

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:03.084
the whole time, it would stay
destructive in other words.

00:02:03.084 --> 00:02:06.406
So if you overlap two waves
that have the same frequency,

00:02:06.406 --> 00:02:08.915
ie the same period, then
it's gonna be constructive

00:02:08.915 --> 00:02:11.111
and stay constructive, or be destructive

00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:14.404
and stay destructive, but
here's the crazy thing.

00:02:14.404 --> 00:02:15.623
Let me get rid of this.

00:02:15.623 --> 00:02:19.006
What if we overlapped two waves
that had different periods?

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:19.994
What would happen then?

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:21.048
Let's just try it out.

00:02:21.048 --> 00:02:23.608
So let me take this wave, this
wave has a different period.

00:02:23.608 --> 00:02:25.362
Look it, if I compare these two peaks,

00:02:25.362 --> 00:02:26.395
these two peeks don't line up,

00:02:26.395 --> 00:02:28.434
if I'm looking over here the distance

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:31.206
between these two peaks is not the same

00:02:31.206 --> 00:02:33.086
as the distance between these two peaks.

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:35.537
It's hard to see, it's almost the same,

00:02:35.537 --> 00:02:38.766
but this red wave has a
slightly longer period

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:40.930
if you can see the time between peaks

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.973
is a little longer than
the time between peaks

00:02:42.973 --> 00:02:44.465
for the blue wave and you might think,

00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:47.170
"Ah there's only a little difference here.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.799
"Can't be that big of a deal right?"

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:49.991
It kind of is.

00:02:49.991 --> 00:02:53.231
It causes a new phenomenon
called beat frequency,

00:02:53.231 --> 00:02:54.805
and I'll show you why it happens here.

00:02:54.805 --> 00:02:57.071
So if I overlap these two.

00:02:57.071 --> 00:02:58.583
So now you take two speakers,

00:02:58.583 --> 00:03:00.502
but the second speaker you play it

00:03:00.502 --> 00:03:03.594
at a slightly different
frequency from the first.

00:03:03.594 --> 00:03:04.589
What would you get?

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:05.880
Let's just look at what happens over here.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.220
They start out in phase
perfectly overlapping, right?

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.443
Peak to peak, so this is constructive,

00:03:11.443 --> 00:03:13.701
this wave starts off constructively

00:03:13.701 --> 00:03:15.496
interfering with the other wave.

00:03:15.496 --> 00:03:16.993
So you hear constructive interference,

00:03:16.993 --> 00:03:18.364
that means if you were
standing at this point

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:22.400
at that moment in time, notice
this axis is time not space,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.039
so at this moment in time right here,

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:26.393
you would hear constructive interference

00:03:26.393 --> 00:03:29.135
which means that those
waves would sound loud.

00:03:29.135 --> 00:03:30.642
Sound really loud at that moment,

00:03:30.642 --> 00:03:33.981
but then you wait, this red
waves got a longer period.

00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:35.670
So it's taking longer for this red wave

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.453
to go through a cycle, that means they're

00:03:37.453 --> 00:03:39.358
gonna start becoming out of phase, right?

00:03:39.358 --> 00:03:41.202
The peaks aren't gonna line up anymore.

00:03:41.202 --> 00:03:42.830
When this blue wave has displaced

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.318
the air maximally to the right,

00:03:45.318 --> 00:03:47.481
this red wave is gonna
not have done that yet,

00:03:47.481 --> 00:03:49.903
it's gonna take a little longer
for it to try to do that.

00:03:49.903 --> 00:03:52.480
So these become out of phase,
now it's less constructive,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.444
less constructive, less constructive,

00:03:54.444 --> 00:03:56.925
over here look it, now the
peaks match the valleys.

00:03:56.925 --> 00:04:00.095
This is straight up
destructive, it's gonna be soft,

00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:01.727
and if you did this perfectly

00:04:01.727 --> 00:04:03.756
it might be silent at that point.

00:04:03.756 --> 00:04:05.781
You wait a little longer
and this blue wave

00:04:05.781 --> 00:04:08.493
has essentially lapped
the red wave, right?

00:04:08.493 --> 00:04:10.899
You waited so long the
blue wave has gone through

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:14.390
an extra whole period
compared to the red wave,

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.049
an so now the peaks line up again,

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.438
and now it's constructive again

00:04:17.438 --> 00:04:19.086
because the peaks match the peaks

00:04:19.086 --> 00:04:20.469
and the valleys match the valleys.

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:21.494
So at that point it's constructive

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:23.595
and it's gonna be loud
again so what you would hear

00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:25.956
if you were standing at this
point three meters away,

00:04:25.956 --> 00:04:29.661
you'd first at this moment in
time hear the note be loud,

00:04:29.661 --> 00:04:31.287
then you'd hear it become soft

00:04:31.287 --> 00:04:33.257
and then you'd hear it become loud again.

00:04:33.257 --> 00:04:34.886
You'd hear this note wobble,

00:04:34.886 --> 00:04:36.671
and the name we have for this phenomenon

00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:40.838
is the beat frequency or
sometimes it's just called beats,

00:04:42.075 --> 00:04:44.777
and I don't mean you're
gonna hear Doctor Dre

00:04:44.777 --> 00:04:46.618
out of this thing that's
not the kind of beats

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:48.173
I'm talking about, I'm just talking about

00:04:48.173 --> 00:04:51.479
that wobble from louder
to softer to louder.

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:52.589
Actually let me just play it.

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:53.842
Let me show you what this sounds like.

00:04:53.842 --> 00:04:56.082
So if we play the A note again.

00:04:56.082 --> 00:04:57.486
(tone playing)

00:04:57.486 --> 00:04:58.735
That's the A note.

00:04:58.735 --> 00:05:01.508
Let me play, that's 440 hertz, right?

00:05:01.508 --> 00:05:03.076
That's a particular frequency.

00:05:03.076 --> 00:05:05.075
Let me play just a slightly
different frequency.

00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:06.742
I'll play 443 hertz.

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:09.737
(tone playing)

00:05:09.737 --> 00:05:10.952
And you're probably like that just sounds

00:05:10.952 --> 00:05:13.087
like the exact same thing,
I can't tell the difference

00:05:13.087 --> 00:05:15.570
between the two, but if I play them both

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.661
you'll definitely be able
to tell the difference.

00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:18.861
So I'm gonna play them both now.

00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:22.489
Here's the 443 hertz, and here's the 440.

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.915
(two tones playing)

00:05:24.915 --> 00:05:25.933
And you hear a wobble.

00:05:25.933 --> 00:05:27.322
This thing starts to wobble.

00:05:27.322 --> 00:05:28.845
So let me stop this.

00:05:28.845 --> 00:05:30.291
So that's what physicists
are talking about

00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:32.638
when they say beat frequency or beats,

00:05:32.638 --> 00:05:33.875
they're referring to that wobble

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.261
and sound loudness that you hear

00:05:36.261 --> 00:05:38.825
when you overlap two waves
that different frequencies.

00:05:38.825 --> 00:05:40.244
This is important, it only works

00:05:40.244 --> 00:05:42.620
when you have waves of
different frequency.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.212
So what if you wanted to know
the actual beat frequency?

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:46.702
What if you wanted to know how many

00:05:46.702 --> 00:05:48.912
wobbles you get per second?

00:05:48.912 --> 00:05:51.318
So how often is it going from constructive

00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:53.330
to destructive back to constructive?

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.255
If that takes a long time the
frequency is gonna be small,

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:58.586
cause there aren't gonna
be many wobbles per second,

00:05:58.586 --> 00:06:00.387
but if this takes a short amount of time,

00:06:00.387 --> 00:06:02.185
if there's not much time
between constructive

00:06:02.185 --> 00:06:04.258
back to constructive
then the beat frequency's

00:06:04.258 --> 00:06:07.410
gonna be large, there will
be many wobbles per second.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.688
How would you figure
out this beat frequency,

00:06:10.688 --> 00:06:13.461
I'll call it FB, this
would be how many times

00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:17.741
this goes from constructive
back to constructive per second.

00:06:17.741 --> 00:06:19.661
So if it does that 20 times per second,

00:06:19.661 --> 00:06:22.008
this thing would be
wobbling 20 times per second

00:06:22.008 --> 00:06:23.732
and the frequency would be 20 hertz.

00:06:23.732 --> 00:06:24.951
So how do you find this if you know

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:26.686
the frequency of each wave,

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:28.286
and it turns out it's very very easy.

00:06:28.286 --> 00:06:30.232
I'm just gonna show you
the formula in this video,

00:06:30.232 --> 00:06:31.699
in the next video we'll derive it

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.192
for those that are interested,

00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:34.714
but in this one I'll
just show you what it is,

00:06:34.714 --> 00:06:35.953
show you how to use it.

00:06:35.953 --> 00:06:37.703
So the beat frequency
if you wanna find it,

00:06:37.703 --> 00:06:40.098
if I know the frequency of the first wave,

00:06:40.098 --> 00:06:43.158
so if wave one has a frequency, f1.

00:06:43.158 --> 00:06:45.430
So say that blue wave has a frequency f1,

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.235
and wave two has a frequency f2,

00:06:48.235 --> 00:06:50.168
then I can find the beat frequency

00:06:50.168 --> 00:06:51.587
by just taking the difference.

00:06:51.587 --> 00:06:55.092
I can just take f1 and then subtract f2,

00:06:55.092 --> 00:06:56.189
and it's as simple as that.

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:57.713
That gives you the beat frequency.

00:06:57.713 --> 00:06:59.023
Now you might wonder like wait a minute,

00:06:59.023 --> 00:07:02.417
what if f1 has a smaller
frequency than f2?

00:07:02.417 --> 00:07:04.692
That would give me a
negative beat frequency?

00:07:04.692 --> 00:07:06.595
That doesn't make sense we
can't have a negative frequency

00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:09.786
so we typically put an absolute
value sign around this.

00:07:09.786 --> 00:07:12.764
You should take the higher
frequency minus the lower,

00:07:12.764 --> 00:07:14.353
but just in case you don't just stick

00:07:14.353 --> 00:07:16.255
an absolute value and that gives you

00:07:16.255 --> 00:07:18.132
the size of this beat frequency,

00:07:18.132 --> 00:07:22.002
which is basically the
number of wobbles per second,

00:07:22.002 --> 00:07:24.636
ie the number of times
it goes from constructive

00:07:24.636 --> 00:07:27.833
all the way back to
constructive per second.

00:07:27.833 --> 00:07:29.954
That's what this beat frequency means

00:07:29.954 --> 00:07:32.042
and this formula is how you can find it.

00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:33.505
Now I should say to be clear,

00:07:33.505 --> 00:07:35.329
we're playing two different sound waves,

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:38.777
our ears really just sort of
gonna hear one total wave.

00:07:38.777 --> 00:07:40.500
So these waves overlap.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.501
You can do this whole analysis
using wave interference.

00:07:43.501 --> 00:07:45.208
You write down the equation of one wave,

00:07:45.208 --> 00:07:46.989
you write down the
equation of the other wave,

00:07:46.989 --> 00:07:48.345
you add up the two, right?

00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:51.105
We know that the total wave is gonna equal

00:07:51.105 --> 00:07:54.973
the summation of each wave at
a particular point in time.

00:07:54.973 --> 00:07:56.271
So at one point in time if we take

00:07:56.271 --> 00:07:58.495
the value of each wave and add them up,

00:07:58.495 --> 00:08:00.521
we'd get the total wave,
what would that look like?

00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:02.594
What would the total wave look like?

00:08:02.594 --> 00:08:03.555
It would look like this.

00:08:03.555 --> 00:08:05.228
If we just add it up
you'd get a total wave

00:08:05.228 --> 00:08:07.608
that looks like this
green dashed wave here.

00:08:07.608 --> 00:08:10.216
Right over here, they
add up to twice the wave,

00:08:10.216 --> 00:08:12.684
and then in the middle they
cancel to almost nothing,

00:08:12.684 --> 00:08:15.212
and then back over here they add up again,

00:08:15.212 --> 00:08:17.481
and so if you just
looked at the total wave,

00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:18.701
it would look something like this.

00:08:18.701 --> 00:08:21.155
So the total wave would
start with a large amplitude,

00:08:21.155 --> 00:08:24.035
and then it would die out because
they'd become destructive,

00:08:24.035 --> 00:08:26.094
and then it would become
a large amplitude again.

00:08:26.094 --> 00:08:27.801
So you see this picture a lot

00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:29.446
when you're talking about beat frequency

00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:30.922
because it's showing what the total wave

00:08:30.922 --> 00:08:32.890
looks like as a function of time

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.311
when you add up those two individual waves

00:08:35.311 --> 00:08:36.700
since this is going from constructive

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.029
to destructive to constructive again,

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:40.874
and this is why it sounds loud

00:08:40.874 --> 00:08:43.509
and then soft and then
loud again to our ear.

00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:46.187
So what would an example
problem look like for beats?

00:08:46.187 --> 00:08:49.299
Let's say you were told
that there's a flute,

00:08:49.299 --> 00:08:51.494
and let's say this flute
is playing a frequency

00:08:51.494 --> 00:08:54.677
of 440 hertz like that
note we heard earlier,

00:08:54.677 --> 00:08:56.857
and let's say there's also a clarinet.

00:08:56.857 --> 00:08:58.429
They play it, they wanna
make sure they're in tune,

00:08:58.429 --> 00:09:00.928
they wanna make sure
they're jam sounds good

00:09:00.928 --> 00:09:02.404
for everyone in the audience,

00:09:02.404 --> 00:09:04.598
but when they both try to play the A note,

00:09:04.598 --> 00:09:07.298
this flute plays 440, this
clarinet plays a note,

00:09:07.298 --> 00:09:09.581
and let's say we hear a beat frequency,

00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:12.293
I'll write it in this color,
we hear a beat frequency

00:09:12.293 --> 00:09:16.075
of five hertz so we hear
five wobbles per second.

00:09:16.075 --> 00:09:18.617
In fact if you've ever
tried to tune an instrument

00:09:18.617 --> 00:09:20.781
you know that one way to tune it is to try

00:09:20.781 --> 00:09:23.189
to check two notes that are
supposed to be the same.

00:09:23.189 --> 00:09:25.033
You can tell immediately
if they're not the same

00:09:25.033 --> 00:09:26.741
cause you'll hear these wobbles,

00:09:26.741 --> 00:09:27.991
and so you keep tuning it until

00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:29.881
you don't hear the wobble anymore.

00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:31.875
As those notes get closer and closer,

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:34.160
there'll be less wobbles per second,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.263
and once you hear no wobble at all,

00:09:36.263 --> 00:09:38.441
you know you're at the
exact same frequency,

00:09:38.441 --> 00:09:39.999
but these aren't, these are off,

00:09:39.999 --> 00:09:41.504
and so the question might ask,

00:09:41.504 --> 00:09:46.000
what are the two possible
frequencies of the clarinet?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.979
Well we know that the beat frequency

00:09:47.979 --> 00:09:49.368
is equal to the absolute value

00:09:49.368 --> 00:09:51.699
of the difference in the two frequencies.

00:09:51.699 --> 00:09:54.182
So if there's a beat
frequency of five hertz

00:09:54.182 --> 00:09:57.156
and the flutes playing 440,
that means the clarinet

00:09:57.156 --> 00:09:59.595
is five hertz off from the flute.

00:09:59.595 --> 00:10:01.972
So the clarinet might
be a little too high,

00:10:01.972 --> 00:10:05.172
it might be 445 hertz,
playing a little sharp,

00:10:05.172 --> 00:10:09.347
or it might be 435 hertz,
might be playing a little flat.

00:10:09.347 --> 00:10:11.128
So we'd have to tune to figure out

00:10:11.128 --> 00:10:12.608
how it can get to the point where

00:10:12.608 --> 00:10:14.557
there'd be zero beat frequency,

00:10:14.557 --> 00:10:16.475
cause when there's zero
beat frequencies you know

00:10:16.475 --> 00:10:18.307
both of these frequencies are the same,

00:10:18.307 --> 00:10:19.435
but what do you do?

00:10:19.435 --> 00:10:20.271
How does it know?

00:10:20.271 --> 00:10:22.208
How does the clarinet
player know which one to do?

00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:23.485
You kind of don't sometimes.

00:10:23.485 --> 00:10:25.025
Sometimes you just have to test it out.

00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:26.962
Let's say the clarinet player assumed,

00:10:26.962 --> 00:10:29.627
all right maybe they were
a little too sharp 445,

00:10:29.627 --> 00:10:31.455
so they're gonna lower their note.

00:10:31.455 --> 00:10:34.198
So they start to tune down,
what will they listen for?

00:10:34.198 --> 00:10:36.667
They'll listen for less
wobbles per second.

00:10:36.667 --> 00:10:39.576
So if you become more in tune in stead of,

00:10:39.576 --> 00:10:41.134
(imitates wobbling tone)

00:10:41.134 --> 00:10:41.967
you would hear,

00:10:41.967 --> 00:10:44.425
(imitates slowing wobble)

00:10:44.425 --> 00:10:46.437
right, and then once
you're perfectly in tune,

00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:47.561
(hums tone)

00:10:47.561 --> 00:10:49.711
and it would be perfect,
there'd be no wobbles.

00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:51.684
If this person tried it and there were

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:54.182
more wobbles per second
then this person would know,

00:10:54.182 --> 00:10:55.990
"Oh, I was probably at this lower note.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:00.260
"cause if I'm at 435, and
I go to say 430 hertz,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.150
"that's gonna be more out of tune."

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.996
Now the beat frequency would be 10 hertz,

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:05.897
you'd hear 10 wobbles per second,

00:11:05.897 --> 00:11:07.252
and the person would know immediately,

00:11:07.252 --> 00:11:08.824
"Whoa, that was a bad idea.

00:11:08.824 --> 00:11:11.506
"I must not have been too sharp.

00:11:11.506 --> 00:11:12.834
"I must've been too flat."

00:11:12.834 --> 00:11:14.357
So now that you know
you're a little too flat

00:11:14.357 --> 00:11:16.156
you start tuning the other way,

00:11:16.156 --> 00:11:19.478
so you can raise this up to 440 hertz

00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:21.743
and then you would hear
zero beat frequency,

00:11:21.743 --> 00:11:24.232
zero wobbles per second, a nice tune,

00:11:24.232 --> 00:11:26.224
and you would be playing in harmony.

00:11:26.224 --> 00:11:28.573
So recapping beats or
beat frequency occurs

00:11:28.573 --> 00:11:31.864
when you overlap two waves that
have different frequencies.

00:11:31.864 --> 00:11:33.679
This causes the waves to go from being

00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:37.042
constructive to destructive
to constructive over and over,

00:11:37.042 --> 00:11:40.780
which we perceive as a wobble
in the loudness of the sound,

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.394
and the way you can
find the beat frequency

00:11:42.394 --> 00:11:45.139
is by taking the difference
of the two frequencies

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:47.160
of the waves that are overlapping.
