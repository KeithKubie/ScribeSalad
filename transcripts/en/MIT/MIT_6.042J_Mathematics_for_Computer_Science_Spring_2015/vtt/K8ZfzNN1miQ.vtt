00:00:00.987 --> 00:00:03.320
PROFESSOR: So we come to the
part that a lot of students

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.694
have been asking
about, but which

00:00:04.694 --> 00:00:06.820
in fact is entirely optional.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.200
So that if you care to skip
this little piece of video,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.950
you're welcome to.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.610
It's not going to appear
on any exam or anything.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.730
But people have
consistently asked

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.520
how they choose
which method of proof

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.290
to use among ordinary
induction or strong induction

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.470
or well-ordering.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.110
And the answer is that it's
hard to tell them apart,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.850
because in an easy
technical sense,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.210
they're really all equivalent.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.850
So let's look at
them one by one.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.390
First of all, it's clear
that ordinary induction

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.740
is a special case
of strong induction.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.020
In the ordinary
induction, you're

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.140
allowed to assume only p of n.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.550
In strong, you can assign
everything from p of 0

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.400
up to p of n to
prove p of n plus 1.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.910
But you don't have to use
all the extra assumptions.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.610
You could just use p of n so
that any ordinary induction

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.900
can be seen as just a special
case of a strong induction.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.400
It would be a little misleading
to call it strong induction,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.450
but it is strong induction.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.410
So why bother with it?

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.030
Well, the answers, basically,
it's an expository difference.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.370
It helps your reader to know
that the proof for n plus 1

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.120
is only going to depend on n not
on the k's that are less than n

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.170
as they would typically in a
genuine strong induction proof.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.415
Second, is some argument that an
ordinary induction going from n

00:01:32.415 --> 00:01:36.050
to n plus 1 is more intuitive
than strong induction that

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.510
goes from anywhere less than
or equal to n up to n plus 1.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.230
I'm not sure that I
subscribe to that,

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.800
but I've heard people
make that claim.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.050
All right.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.690
There's another
perspective, which

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.120
is interesting and maybe
surprising, which is,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.420
why not always use
ordinary induction?

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.480
Oh, wait a minute.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.220
How do you replace
strong induction

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.380
with ordinary induction?

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.960
Well it's easy.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.980
Suppose that you've
proved for all m P of m

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.990
using strong induction with
induction hypothesis P of m,

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.190
what have you done?

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.940
Well, it's the same
base case whether you're

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.840
using ordinary or strong.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.440
But in strong, you would
do an inductive step

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.020
where you actually assumed not
just p of n, but P of for all k

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.850
less than or equal to n.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.640
And then using all those
hypotheses about P of k,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.900
you prove P of n plus 1
in the strong induction.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.150
Well, how do you turn it
into an ordinary induction?

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.150
Just let Q of n be that
assumption, that for all k

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.526
less than or equal to n P of k.

00:02:43.526 --> 00:02:45.150
And if you think
about it for a moment,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.180
just revising the
induction hypothesis

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.420
to include that universal
quantifier, for all k less than

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.640
or equal to n, means that the
strong induction on P of k

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.770
becomes an ordinary
induction on Q of n.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.560
And we have a trivial
change decorating

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.390
a bunch of occurrences
of formulas

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.730
with for all we have
converted and strong induction

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.935
into an ordinary induction.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.600
So we see that strong
induction and no power

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.040
above and beyond
ordinary induction.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.596
It just lets you omit a bunch
of universal quantifiers

00:03:28.596 --> 00:03:31.220
that would otherwise have to be
made explicit if you were going

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.511
to do it by ordinary induction.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.940
Then why use strong?

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.920
Just precisely,
because it's cleaner.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.040
You don't have to write
those for all k less than

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.180
or equal to ends all over.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.990
And now we come to the
final question about,

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.730
what's the relation between
the well-ordering principle

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.280
in induction?

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.390
Well, it's basically
the same deal.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.220
You can easily rephrase
an induction proof.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.210
An induction proof,
just transform it's

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.010
template to fit the template of
a well-ordering proof and vice

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.780
versa.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.110
We're not going into the
details of exactly how,

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.880
because it's not important,
but it is routine.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.920
It follows that well-ordering
principle is not

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.519
adding any new power
or even new perspective

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.090
on the mathematics
of any given proof.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.680
It's just a different
way to organize and tell

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.465
the same story.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.070
And it also means
conceptually, which

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.930
is nice that these apparently
different inference rules,

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.129
strong induction,
ordinary induction,

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.170
well-ordering principle,
there's really only one.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.370
And the others can be
justified in terms of it

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.660
and explained as
variations of it.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.520
So that's intellectually
economical

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.440
to not have a proliferation
of different reasoning

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.300
principles, which brings us
to the question of which one

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.880
to use.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.460
And all I can say is that
it's a matter of taste.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.460
The truth is that when
I'm writing up proofs,

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.250
I will often try
different versions.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.325
I'll try it by
ordinary induction.

00:05:04.325 --> 00:05:06.000
And I'll try it
by well-ordering.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.590
And I'll read the two and
decide which one seems

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.650
to come out the more cleanly.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.740
And I'll go with that one.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.410
So there isn't any simple
rule about which to choose.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.450
But in a certain sense,
it really doesn't matter.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.486
Just pick one.

00:05:21.486 --> 00:05:23.110
The only exceptions
to that, of course,

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.300
is when on an exam
or similar setting,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.390
you're told to use one of
these particular methods

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.130
as a way to demonstrate that you
understand it, then, of course,

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.220
you can't pick and choose.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.580
So finally, we come to a
pedagogical question about,

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.700
why is it that in 6042 we taught
well-ordering and principal

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.850
first, in fact,
the second lecture,

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.160
and are only now at
the end of third week

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.220
getting to the induction
principle, which is much more

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.220
familiar, and people
argue they like it

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.940
better, at least most of them.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.520
Well, the answer is it's
a pedagogical strategy.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.980
And it's one, in fact, which
the authors disagree with, not

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.120
united on.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.640
My view is that we're better off
doing well-ordering principles

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.140
first.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.160
And the reason is that our
impression from conversations

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.860
with students, and surveys,
and from exam performance

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.310
shows that only about
20% of the students

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.260
get induction no matter how hard
we try to explain and teach it.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.760
They report worrying
about things

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.830
about that assuming P of
n to prove p of n plus 1

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.760
is somehow circular.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.750
And it's certainly measurable
that 20% or so of the class

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.680
just can't reliably do
proofs by induction.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.050
Now this baffles the
80% to whom it's obvious

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.700
and who know how
to do it easily.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.560
And it baffles us instructors.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.940
We can't figure out what the
problem is that those 20% have.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.990
And we've been trying
to teach induction

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.770
lots of different ways.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.680
On the other hand,
nobody has trouble

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.420
believing the well-ordering
principle and working with it.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.010
And they certainly don't
have any harder time using it

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:12.100
then they do using ordinary
induction or strong induction.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.877
And this conceptual
problem about is it safe

00:07:14.877 --> 00:07:16.960
and do I really believe
in it just doesn't come up

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.360
with a well-ordering principle.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.310
Everybody agrees
that it's obvious

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.370
that a non-negative
set of a non-empty set

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.650
of non-negative integers is
going to have at least one.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.450
And so we chose to do
well-ordering right away,

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.840
because there's no
overhead in explaining it.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.030
And it lets us get going
on interesting proofs

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.220
from the get go as
opposed to waiting a while

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.710
or spending a couple of lectures
working through induction

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.600
and get leaving that with
the main if only method

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.710
that people have
for proving things

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.520
about non-negative integers.
