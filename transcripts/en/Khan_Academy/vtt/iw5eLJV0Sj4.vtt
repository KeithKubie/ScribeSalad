00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.680
The goal of this video
is to try to figure out

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.600
the antiderivative of
the natural log of x.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.010
And it's not completely obvious
how to approach this at first,

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.360
even if I were to tell you
to use integration by parts,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.950
you'll say,
integration by parts,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.190
you're looking for the
antiderivative of something

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.590
that can be expressed as the
product of two functions.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.173
It looks like I only
have one function

00:00:19.173 --> 00:00:20.950
right over here, the
natural log of x.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.990
But it might become a
little bit more obvious

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.750
if I were to rewrite
this as the integral

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.740
of the natural log
of x times 1dx.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.040
Now, you do have the
product of two functions.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.910
One is a function,
a function of x.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.410
It's not actually dependent on
x, it's always going to be 1,

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.520
but you could have f
of x is equal to 1.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.020
And now it might
become a little bit

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.350
more obvious to use
integration by parts.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.800
Integration by parts
tells us that if we

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.980
have an integral that can be
viewed as the product of one

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.150
function, and the derivative
of another function,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.370
and this is really just
the reverse product rule,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.203
and we've shown that
multiple times already.

00:01:01.203 --> 00:01:04.420
This is going to be equal to
the product of both functions,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:13.470
f of x times g of x minus
the antiderivative of,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.270
instead of having f
and g prime, you're

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.230
going to have f prime and g.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:27.570
So f prime of x times g of x dx.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.060
And we've seen this
multiple times.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.476
So when you figure
out what should

00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:32.077
be f and what should
be g, for f you

00:01:32.077 --> 00:01:33.660
want to figure out
something that it's

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.740
easy to take the derivative
of and it simplifies things,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.950
possibly if you're taking
the derivative of it.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.370
And for g prime of x, you
want to find something

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.100
where it's easy to take
the antiderivative of it.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.522
So good candidate for f
of x is natural log of x.

00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:48.230
If you were to take
the derivative of it,

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.000
it's 1 over x.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.440
Let me write this down.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.140
So let's say that f of x is
equal to the natural log of x.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.230
Then f prime of x is
equal to 1 over x.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.810
And let's set g prime
of x is equal to 1.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.050
So g prime of x is equal to 1.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.340
That means that g of
x could be equal to x.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.500
And so let's go back
right over here.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.790
So this is going to be equal
to f of x times g of x.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.920
Well, f of x times g of
x is x natural log of x.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.354
So g of x is x, and f of
x is the natural log of x,

00:02:28.354 --> 00:02:29.770
I just like writing
the x in front

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.370
of the natural log of
x to avoid ambiguity.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.490
So this is x natural log of x
minus the antiderivative of f

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.800
prime of x, which
is 1 over x times g

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.028
of x, which is x, which is xdx.

00:02:48.865 --> 00:02:50.490
Well, what's this
going to be equal to?

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.080
Well, what we have inside
the integrand, this is just 1

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.450
over x times x, which
is just equal to 1.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.210
So this simplifies quite nicely.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:13.530
This is going to end up
equaling x natural log of x

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.530
minus the antiderivative
of, just dx,

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.870
or the antiderivative of
1dx, or the integral of 1dx,

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.009
or the antiderivative
of 1 is just minus x.

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:25.800
And this is just an
antiderivative of this.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.091
If we want to write the entire
class of antiderivatives

00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:33.910
we just have to add a plus
c here, and we are done.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.550
We figured out
the antiderivative

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.142
of the natural log of x.

00:03:38.142 --> 00:03:40.100
I encourage you to take
the derivative of this.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.380
For this part, you're going
to use the product rule

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.910
and verify that you do indeed
get natural log of x when

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.360
you take the derivative of this.
