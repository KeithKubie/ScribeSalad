00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.649
I think the main message of the forum is
not just my work but the work of people

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:36.659
not just my work but the work of people
 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.230
not just my work but the work of people
in the area of climate change economics

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240
in the area of climate change economics
 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.989
in the area of climate change economics
the integrated assessment modeling as

00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:41.999
the integrated assessment modeling as
 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:45.800
the integrated assessment modeling as
it's called a technical name is really

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810
it's called a technical name is really
 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.769
it's called a technical name is really
twofold one is it's to see the climate

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:48.779
twofold one is it's to see the climate
 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:52.999
twofold one is it's to see the climate
climate change problem as a byproduct an

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009
climate change problem as a byproduct an
 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.700
climate change problem as a byproduct an
unintended byproduct of economic growth

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710
unintended byproduct of economic growth
 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.070
unintended byproduct of economic growth
and then the second thing is to

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080
and then the second thing is to
 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.450
and then the second thing is to
understand that what we need to do is we

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460
understand that what we need to do is we
 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.089
understand that what we need to do is we
need to correct that by fixing the price

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099
need to correct that by fixing the price
 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:06.890
need to correct that by fixing the price
of emissions

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900
of emissions
 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.369
of emissions
so now emissions are free in most places

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:09.379
so now emissions are free in most places
 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.469
so now emissions are free in most places
not in Sweden but all everyplace else in

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479
not in Sweden but all everyplace else in
 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.749
not in Sweden but all everyplace else in
the world outside of Western Europe when

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759
the world outside of Western Europe when
 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.240
the world outside of Western Europe when
you emit a ton of carbon dioxide you

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250
you emit a ton of carbon dioxide you
 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.610
you emit a ton of carbon dioxide you
don't probably know you're doing it or

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620
don't probably know you're doing it or
 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.260
don't probably know you're doing it or
think of doing it probably and you drive

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270
think of doing it probably and you drive
 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.959
think of doing it probably and you drive
your car or you will have a product that

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:23.969
your car or you will have a product that
 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.050
your car or you will have a product that
has combustion behind it that you're

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060
has combustion behind it that you're
 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.189
has combustion behind it that you're
putting in the atmosphere and you're

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199
putting in the atmosphere and you're
 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.749
putting in the atmosphere and you're
causing damage but you're not paying

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759
causing damage but you're not paying
 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.909
causing damage but you're not paying
anything for it so the inside of

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919
anything for it so the inside of
 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.950
anything for it so the inside of
economics is what you go through that

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960
economics is what you go through that
 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.079
economics is what you go through that
and you analyze it it to say we need to

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:39.089
and you analyze it it to say we need to
 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:45.019
and you analyze it it to say we need to
put a price on these and that way you

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:45.029
put a price on these and that way you
 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:48.019
put a price on these and that way you
know give people incentives to reduce

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029
know give people incentives to reduce
 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:52.219
know give people incentives to reduce
their use of carbon fuels and or the

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229
their use of carbon fuels and or the
 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:53.839
their use of carbon fuels and or the
products that use carbon fuels and

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849
products that use carbon fuels and
 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:56.240
products that use carbon fuels and
thereby reduce their emissions so it's

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250
thereby reduce their emissions so it's
 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.260
thereby reduce their emissions so it's
the key messages of economics is that

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270
the key messages of economics is that
 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.999
the key messages of economics is that
this is this is a flaw in the market and

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009
this is this is a flaw in the market and
 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.149
this is this is a flaw in the market and
it's correctable if governments take

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159
it's correctable if governments take
 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.929
it's correctable if governments take
steps to change the price from zero to a

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:11.939
steps to change the price from zero to a
 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.929
steps to change the price from zero to a
high enough price that you can meet your

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:14.939
high enough price that you can meet your
 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:19.040
high enough price that you can meet your
targets so that data that a semantics is

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050
targets so that data that a semantics is
 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.070
targets so that data that a semantics is
pretty easy to explain but then the next

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080
pretty easy to explain but then the next
 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.209
pretty easy to explain but then the next
step is what is that price and I think

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:26.219
step is what is that price and I think
 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.559
step is what is that price and I think
the most interesting thing about all the

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:27.569
the most interesting thing about all the
 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:30.079
the most interesting thing about all the
work I've ever done is that in building

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.089
work I've ever done is that in building
 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:33.050
work I've ever done is that in building
models of this the price just comes out

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060
models of this the price just comes out
 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.240
models of this the price just comes out
of it it's just one of the byproducts of

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250
of it it's just one of the byproducts of
 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.329
of it it's just one of the byproducts of
of the it's called linear programming is

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:38.339
of the it's called linear programming is
 

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:38.559
of the it's called linear programming is
that

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:38.569
that
 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:40.600
that
technical name for it but it has another

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610
technical name for it but it has another
 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.309
technical name for it but it has another
technical thing called a dual variable

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319
technical thing called a dual variable
 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.309
technical thing called a dual variable
which is this is the price that you

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319
which is this is the price that you
 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:48.369
which is this is the price that you
should set on carbon dioxide emissions

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:48.379
should set on carbon dioxide emissions
 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:50.679
should set on carbon dioxide emissions
if you're going to meet your goal and

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:50.689
if you're going to meet your goal and
 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:52.359
if you're going to meet your goal and
it's a yeah I think of it as kind of a

00:06:52.359 --> 00:06:52.369
it's a yeah I think of it as kind of a
 

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:54.999
it's a yeah I think of it as kind of a
mathematical miracle in the sense that

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:55.009
mathematical miracle in the sense that
 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:58.179
mathematical miracle in the sense that
you can do this and then out pops the

00:06:58.179 --> 00:06:58.189
you can do this and then out pops the
 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:05.820
you can do this and then out pops the
price that the government should set

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830
 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.190
well my message is you by yourself can

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:09.200
well my message is you by yourself can
 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.010
well my message is you by yourself can
do nothing there are too many people

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020
do nothing there are too many people
 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.020
do nothing there are too many people
doing too much for too many generations

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030
doing too much for too many generations
 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:19.060
doing too much for too many generations
of people so even if I'm the most

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.070
of people so even if I'm the most
 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.820
of people so even if I'm the most
ethical person or even if I'm not just

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:21.830
ethical person or even if I'm not just
 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.170
ethical person or even if I'm not just
an ethical person that I'm going to

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180
an ethical person that I'm going to
 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.660
an ethical person that I'm going to
represent ten or a hundred other people

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:25.670
represent ten or a hundred other people
 

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.540
represent ten or a hundred other people
who are not so ethical or don't care

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.550
who are not so ethical or don't care
 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.430
who are not so ethical or don't care
about it the the effect I alone and I

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440
about it the the effect I alone and I
 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.270
about it the the effect I alone and I
want to emphasize the word

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280
want to emphasize the word
 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.890
want to emphasize the word
alone will have is insignificant it's

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:37.900
alone will have is insignificant it's
 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.560
alone will have is insignificant it's
like a billionth of a billionth or

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:41.570
like a billionth of a billionth or
 

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.430
like a billionth of a billionth or
trillionth of what is necessary so what

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440
trillionth of what is necessary so what
 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.630
trillionth of what is necessary so what
is necessary is that people act through

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:49.640
is necessary is that people act through
 

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.300
is necessary is that people act through
their governments and their government

to act together with other nations to to
take steps to solve this problem I don't

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:00.260
take steps to solve this problem I don't
 

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.330
take steps to solve this problem I don't
want to say there's a single step you

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:01.340
want to say there's a single step you
 

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.160
want to say there's a single step you
can take because there are multiple

can take because there are multiple
 

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.860
can take because there are multiple
things to do but I'd say the message is

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:05.870
things to do but I'd say the message is
 

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:10.360
things to do but I'd say the message is
you need to exercise your your duties

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:10.370
you need to exercise your your duties
 

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.490
you need to exercise your your duties

that we need to take steps to do this

that we need to take steps to do this
there's nothing wrong with taking the

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:32.030
there's nothing wrong with taking the

there's nothing wrong with taking the

the heat down or whatever there that's

the heat down or whatever there that's
 

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.580
the heat down or whatever there that's
fine but but that by itself is not

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:45.590
fine but but that by itself is not
 

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:54.030
fine but but that by itself is not
sufficient

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.040
 

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.220
well I've been working on this long

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:57.230
well I've been working on this long
 

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:01.180
well I've been working on this long
enough to see that things change and

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:01.190
enough to see that things change and
 

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.370
enough to see that things change and
change slowly I'd say over the period

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:03.380
change slowly I'd say over the period
 

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.720
change slowly I'd say over the period
since I've been working I started

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:04.730
since I've been working I started
 

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.830
since I've been working I started
working on this in the 1970s there's

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.340

often in a sensible way so it's what I
 

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.610
often in a sensible way so it's what I
like to say is two steps forward one

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:12.620

step backwards maybe it's a big step

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360
step backwards maybe it's a big step
 

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.520
step backwards maybe it's a big step
backward now but I I'm hopeful that we

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:18.530
backward now but I I'm hopeful that we
 

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.970
backward now but I I'm hopeful that we
will get over that and move forward

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:21.980
will get over that and move forward
 

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:22.310

well it didn't just come floating down

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:21.100
well it didn't just come floating down
 

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.060
well it didn't just come floating down
from some intellectual heaven but it was

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:24.070
from some intellectual heaven but it was
 

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.070
from some intellectual heaven but it was
invented by people but it wasn't in our

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:26.080
invented by people but it wasn't in our
 

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.340
invented by people but it wasn't in our
models and so this was this was we knew

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:29.350
models and so this was this was we knew
 

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:30.810
models and so this was this was we knew
this and we'd actually tried to I

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:30.820
this and we'd actually tried to I
 

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.700
this and we'd actually tried to I
actually tried to work on that myself as

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:32.710
actually tried to work on that myself as
 

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.980
actually tried to work on that myself as
I said it was too hard so I gave it up

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:34.990
I said it was too hard so I gave it up
 

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:36.930
I said it was too hard so I gave it up
but that was the problem that Paul Romer

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:36.940
but that was the problem that Paul Romer
 

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.020
but that was the problem that Paul Romer
tackled and saying it solved and and

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:40.030
tackled and saying it solved and and
 

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.450
tackled and saying it solved and and
produced this really brilliant new way

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:42.460
produced this really brilliant new way
 

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.180
produced this really brilliant new way
of thinking about technologies so I

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:45.190
of thinking about technologies so I
 

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.310
of thinking about technologies so I
think it's it's really nice for me to

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:47.320
think it's it's really nice for me to
 

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.550
think it's it's really nice for me to
share it with Paul partly because that

share it with Paul partly because that
 

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.140
share it with Paul partly because that
was a problem I thought about and worked

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:52.150
was a problem I thought about and worked
 

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.290
was a problem I thought about and worked
on and and failed at when and when I was

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:55.300
on and and failed at when and when I was
 

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.640
on and and failed at when and when I was
a graduate student and then partly also

00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:58.650
a graduate student and then partly also
 

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:03.450
a graduate student and then partly also
coming to today because it's clear that

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:03.460
coming to today because it's clear that
 

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.520
coming to today because it's clear that

thinking a problem obviously problems
 

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.850
thinking a problem obviously problems
and you see problems for example a woman

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860
and you see problems for example a woman
 

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:37.720

one an example of a problem was when in

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:37.730
one an example of a problem was when in
 

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:42.289
one an example of a problem was when in
2002 2003 when the US was about to go to

2002 2003 when the US was about to go to
 

00:18:42.299 --> 00:18:45.260
2002 2003 when the US was about to go to
war in Iraq and then we were just

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:45.270
war in Iraq and then we were just
 

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.180
war in Iraq and then we were just
marching marching on his back World War

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:47.190
marching marching on his back World War
 

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.700

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:50.840
one and a few Europeans will know the
history of World War one they're

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:50.850
history of World War one they're
 

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.930
history of World War one they're
marching much sleep walking into history

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940
marching much sleep walking into history
 

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.580
marching much sleep walking into history
so to speak and we were just marching

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:55.590
so to speak and we were just marching
 

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.440

along it wasn't a hundred percent but

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:57.450
along it wasn't a hundred percent but
 

00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.180
along it wasn't a hundred percent but
it's pretty clear and the question is

00:18:59.180 --> 00:18:59.190
it's pretty clear and the question is
 

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:01.779
it's pretty clear and the question is
how costly is this gonna be and so I

00:19:01.779 --> 00:19:01.789
how costly is this gonna be and so I
 

00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:04.190
how costly is this gonna be and so I
started working on the cost of the Iraq

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200
started working on the cost of the Iraq
 

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.580
started working on the cost of the Iraq
war did a pretty big study on that but

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:07.590
war did a pretty big study on that but
 

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.039
war did a pretty big study on that but
that's that was one where they you just

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:09.049
that's that was one where they you just
 

00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:11.180
that's that was one where they you just
there's a problem is right in front of

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:11.190
there's a problem is right in front of
 

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.610
there's a problem is right in front of
you and you say well how much is this

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.620
you and you say well how much is this
 

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.680
you and you say well how much is this
gonna cost do we yeah we thought about

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:15.690
gonna cost do we yeah we thought about
 

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.470
gonna cost do we yeah we thought about
the costs of this talk to people well

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480
the costs of this talk to people well
 

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.909
the costs of this talk to people well
yes it's not going to be very expensive

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919
yes it's not going to be very expensive
 

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:22.310
yes it's not going to be very expensive
but of course instead of fifty billion

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320
but of course instead of fifty billion
 

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.169
but of course instead of fifty billion
dollars it's like two three four

00:19:24.169 --> 00:19:24.179
dollars it's like two three four
 

00:19:24.179 --> 00:19:26.210
dollars it's like two three four
trillion dollars I'm just vastly vastly

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220
trillion dollars I'm just vastly vastly
 

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.520
trillion dollars I'm just vastly vastly
under estimating but that's something

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:28.530
under estimating but that's something
 

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.789
under estimating but that's something
where it's a problem Orion other times

00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799
where it's a problem Orion other times
 

00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:37.100
where it's a problem Orion other times
it's just curiosity just some the an

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:37.110
it's just curiosity just some the an
 

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.230
it's just curiosity just some the an
example of a curiosity was oh I was

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240
example of a curiosity was oh I was
 

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.600
example of a curiosity was oh I was
thinking about light and whether we're

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:41.610
thinking about light and whether we're
 

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:42.890
thinking about light and whether we're
measuring

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:42.900
measuring
 

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.480
measuring
life correctly and so they that just

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:47.490
life correctly and so they that just
 

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.710
life correctly and so they that just
something I thought about it and then I

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720
something I thought about it and then I
 

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.820
something I thought about it and then I
forgot about and then I thought about

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:49.830
forgot about and then I thought about
 

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.290
forgot about and then I thought about
another year later a fella

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:51.300
another year later a fella
 

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.240
another year later a fella
and then something would happen I'd see

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:53.250
and then something would happen I'd see
 

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.590
and then something would happen I'd see
something is they're all that's how to

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600
something is they're all that's how to
 

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.910
something is they're all that's how to
do that and and then I got interested in

00:19:58.910 --> 00:19:58.920
do that and and then I got interested in
 

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.910
do that and and then I got interested in
and worked intensive Lee on it so and

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:01.920
and worked intensive Lee on it so and
 

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.770
and worked intensive Lee on it so and
it's at you usually this sometimes the

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:03.780
it's at you usually this sometimes the
 

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.650
it's at you usually this sometimes the
problems have done just pure curiosity

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:05.660
problems have done just pure curiosity
 

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.780
problems have done just pure curiosity
about something when you want to was it

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:08.790
about something when you want to was it
 

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.940

lighting is a good example with lighting

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:12.900
lighting is a good example with lighting
 

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.360
lighting is a good example with lighting
there was a big it was there's the

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:14.370
there was a big it was there's the
 

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:15.860
there was a big it was there's the
background of lighting was it was a big

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:15.870
background of lighting was it was a big
 

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.410
background of lighting was it was a big
controversy about whether price indexes

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:18.420
controversy about whether price indexes
 

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.720
controversy about whether price indexes
were being measured correctly this was

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:20.730
were being measured correctly this was
 

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.280
were being measured correctly this was
particularly in the United States and

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:22.290
particularly in the United States and
 

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.690
particularly in the United States and
there was a big report by a Stanford

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:25.700
there was a big report by a Stanford
 

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.070
there was a big report by a Stanford
colleague named Mike Bosca and the

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080
colleague named Mike Bosca and the
 

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.680
colleague named Mike Bosca and the
Boston report and he are you that the

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:30.690
Boston report and he are you that the
 

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.360
Boston report and he are you that the
Consumer Price Index the United States

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:32.370
Consumer Price Index the United States
 

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:36.320
Consumer Price Index the United States
was seriously miss measured and that

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:36.330
was seriously miss measured and that
 

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.150
was seriously miss measured and that
looked right and part of the problem was

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:38.160
looked right and part of the problem was
 

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.740
looked right and part of the problem was
we weren't measuring quality change

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:39.750
we weren't measuring quality change
 

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:44.030
we weren't measuring quality change
correctly so that looks right and and I

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:44.040
correctly so that looks right and and I
 

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.440
correctly so that looks right and and I
looked at some other price indexes like

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:45.450
looked at some other price indexes like
 

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.300
looked at some other price indexes like
European price indexes are even worse

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:47.310
European price indexes are even worse
 

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:49.850
European price indexes are even worse
than the u.s. price indexes so then at

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:49.860
than the u.s. price indexes so then at
 

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.200
than the u.s. price indexes so then at
that point I said well what about light

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:51.210
that point I said well what about light
 

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:53.300
that point I said well what about light
I'll be measuring the price of light

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:53.310
I'll be measuring the price of light
 

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.210
I'll be measuring the price of light
correctly so at that point then I would

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:56.220
correctly so at that point then I would
 

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.560
correctly so at that point then I would
say well how are we gonna measure we've

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:57.570
say well how are we gonna measure we've
 

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.320
say well how are we gonna measure we've
got a you know we can look at different

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:00.330
got a you know we can look at different
 

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.780
got a you know we can look at different

fluorescent that was before the LED bulb
and then you say well we're measuring

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:06.630
and then you say well we're measuring
 

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.660
and then you say well we're measuring
incorrectly because we're measuring them

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:08.670
incorrectly because we're measuring them
 

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.550
incorrectly because we're measuring them
