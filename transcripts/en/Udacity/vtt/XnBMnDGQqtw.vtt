00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay. Now one thing to note here is we have our radio buttons

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and how is the user to know which is which?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
They're just 3 anonymous radio buttons.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Well, that is what the element is for,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and I'll show you how to use that in our Editor.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So to give the user a sense of what they're clicking on,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
rather than just clicking on random dots,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we're going to use the element--and it looks something like this.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'll add the element to each of these inputs.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So I've added one element.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The elements stay the same for this first one.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I wrapped it in a element that also has the text, "One" in it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This will cause the word "One" to appear next to the radio button.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'll go ahead and add it on these other two as well.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Okay. So I surrounded our other two s with a element.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I added some line breaks in here

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so it's a little bit easier to read,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but all that's really changed is I've added

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
opening , a closing , and then some text to each one of these.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Let's see how this looks in the browser.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
When I load this in the browser, now we can see

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the labels before our radio buttons.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And so when I select one of them--"One", "Two", "Three"--

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that makes it easier so the user can see what they're actually doing.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You know--you give the radio buttons a label.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And when I click Submit, as we expected:

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
q-three in the URL.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now, of course, the label doesn't have to match the value of the radio button

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but, generally, they're closely related.
