JEFFREY MARLOW:
<i>As a scientist, we often go to</i>

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:04.770
<i> some of the most extreme
 places on our planet,</i>

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.239
<i> to collect microbes,
 bring 'em back,</i>

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:09.775
<i> understand what they're
 doing and how they work.</i>

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:12.044
<i> These types of
 organisms can actually</i>

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.247
<i> broaden our search
 for life beyond earth.</i>

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:16.216
<i> By knowing what
 microbes are capable of,</i>

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.818
<i>we can think about other places
where this could be happening.</i>

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.924 line:0%
A little over a year ago,
I found myself camping

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:27.060
on the side of an
active volcano.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.395
<i> I was there as the
 chief scientist</i>

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:33.232
<i>of an expedition that went to
examine Vanuatu's Marum crater.</i>

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:37.302
<i>And it was unlike any other
camping experience I'd ever had.</i>

00:00:37.302 --> 00:00:38.404
<i>Right outside your tent window,</i>

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:41.474
<i>there is constantly a plume
 of toxic sulfur dioxide.</i>

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:44.577 line:0%
You had to go with a respirator
whenever you went outside.

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.746 line:0%
It was also smart to
wear long sleeves.

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:50.115 line:0%
There are tiny microscopic
basaltic needles

00:00:50.115 --> 00:00:51.750
that would fall down upon you.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.020
And when the rain was
water, it was acid,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.321
had a pH of about two.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.857
Despite all these hazards,
it actually turns out

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.659
that microbes can
survive in these places,

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.028
and we were there
to figure out why.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.130
We were there for this,
this is the crater.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.499
It's about a kilometer
across, 500 meters deep.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.803
<i>And at the very bottom of it,
in this pit of roiling lava,</i>

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.273
<i> is the world's most
 active lava lake.</i>

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.507
<i> We needed to get samples
 from the very bottom</i>

00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:17.476
<i> to understand how
 microbes can survive,</i>

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.246
<i>so we descended down the cliff,</i>

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:24.250
<i>went as close to the edge of
the lava lake as we dared.</i>

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:26.419
<i>All around us, lava was spewing,</i>

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:28.788
<i> sometimes going over
 the top of our heads,</i>

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:30.757
<i> raining down upon us.</i>

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.226
It wasn't a great place to
be for a very long time.

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:34.960
But we were there
just long enough

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.496
to get our critical samples.

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:39.165
<i> This is a place where
 the earth is forming.</i>

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.633
<i>This is how rocks come to be.</i>

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:43.369
<i>They are formed by volcanoes.</i>

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.504
<i> And everywhere on the
 surface of the planet,</i>

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:47.340
<i>microbes inhabit these rocks.</i>

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:49.642
<i> We wanted to see
 how this started.</i>

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.779
<i> We collected samples
that were 30 seconds old.</i>

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.181
<i> We saw them pop up,
 they were glowing red,</i>

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.283
<i> they finally cooled
 off, we picked 'em up.</i>

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.518
And we got a full
time series across

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:02.188
days, weeks, months,
years, across the island,

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:05.725
to figure out when microbes
colonized these rocks,

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.127
what that means in
terms of a longer term

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:11.096
succession of microbial
community inside these rocks,

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:14.600
and how that influences
elemental cycles on our planet.

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:18.537
<i> So, volcanoes are
enormous, planetary scale,</i>

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:20.139
<i>loud, very obvious features.</i>

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.142
<i>But they actually created
 these tiny micro-niches</i>

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.445
<i> that allow for distinct
 forms of life to exist.</i>

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:29.048
And as a geobiologist, my
interest is in these interfaces.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:31.250
It's kind of where these
planetary scale processes

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.618
meet on the micro scale.

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:34.887
Places like this have been
found all over the world.

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:37.323
And microbes typically
find a way to survive.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.726
<i>There are organisms in the Rio
Tinto in southwestern Spain,</i>

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:42.328
<i> that can breathe metal</i>

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:45.632
and create these acidic
pools of blood-red water.

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:47.600
The minerals that
are formed here

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.535
are actually found
on Mars as well.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:51.670 line:0%
<i>Recently off the coast of Japan,</i>

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.338 line:0%
<i>two and a half kilometers deep,</i>

00:02:53.338 --> 00:02:55.908 line:0%
<i>below the surface of the ocean,</i>

00:02:55.974 --> 00:02:57.977 line:0%
<i> there are
methane-producing microbes.</i>

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.146 line:0%
This is a whole different
class of organism.

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:03.016
These are the intra-terrestrials
living inside our planet.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.217
<i> And the lower
temperature limit of life</i>

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:06.452
<i>is still completely unknown.</i>

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:08.321
<i>Microbes can survive inside ice,</i>

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:10.757
down to negative
20 degrees Celsius,

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:12.192
and probably even cooler.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.360
When combined, these
forces really come together

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.694
to operate our planet.

00:03:15.694 --> 00:03:17.062
We're on a microbial world.

00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:18.530
Let's all just get used to it.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.033
These microbes create more than

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.868
half of the oxygen
that we breathe.

00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:24.603
They mobilize the
nutrients that supports

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:26.873
any sort of macroscopic life.

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:28.207
<i>And on my quest to understand</i>

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.343
<i> what the limits of
 this biology is,</i>

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:32.412
<i> I typically focus
 on the deep sea.</i>

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.379
<i> We can think of the
 earth as a battery.</i>

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:37.283
In the sub-surface, in those
liquids and those gases,

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:39.084
those chemicals are
said to be reduced.

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:40.586
There are a lot of electrons.

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:43.956
On the very thin rind of the
planet that we operate in,

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:46.726
the atmosphere, the
surface world, the ocean,

00:03:46.992 --> 00:03:48.027
that's said to be oxidized.

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:49.495
So where these places meet,

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:52.531
this pole and these
boundaries of the battery,

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:54.533
that's where energy
can be harvested.

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:56.468
So, the deep sea is
our best opportunity

00:03:56.468 --> 00:03:58.471
to find new types of metabolism.

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:01.007
And there are sort of
three canonical categories

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:02.375
over the last few decades

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.810
that have been carved out
within this deep sea realm.

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:06.778
<i>Black smoker hydrothermal vents</i>

00:04:06.778 --> 00:04:09.348
<i> are precipitating
 these metal sulfides,</i>

00:04:09.348 --> 00:04:11.183
<i>several hundred degrees Celsius.</i>

00:04:11.183 --> 00:04:13.119
<i> The Lost City
 hydrothermal system</i>

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.054
<i> forms from water
 rock interactions.</i>

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:16.255
<i> No magma needed.</i>

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:17.857
And this creates
an alkaline system

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:20.626
that leads to a whole
different type of microbes.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.128
<i> And methane seeps.</i>

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:24.997
<i>These are places typically
 where one tectonic plate</i>

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:26.699
<i> is subducting
 beneath another one,</i>

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.167
and the organic
goo that had kinda

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:31.303
fallen down on that first
plate is being broken down

00:04:31.303 --> 00:04:33.906
and streaming up through
the earth's surface.

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:36.743
<i>So, these methane seeps are
where I've done most of my work.</i>

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:38.878
<i> You can see the methane
 bubbles coming out.</i>

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:42.181
<i> Not as exciting as black
smoker vents on TV perhaps,</i>

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.449
<i> but more important.</i>

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:47.719
<i> Because they're able to
turn that methane into rock,</i>

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:51.324
<i>might be the most important
thermoregulators on the planet.</i>

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:53.659
<i> Methane is an extremely
 strong greenhouse gas,</i>

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:56.662
<i>so by soaking it up into this
rock, we can do a lot of good.</i>

00:04:56.795 --> 00:04:58.264
There are kinda those
three main flavors

00:04:58.264 --> 00:05:02.034
of deep sea chemosynthetic
oases that I described,

00:05:02.034 --> 00:05:03.502
but we're already sensing that

00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:05.538
there are other flavors as well.

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:08.073
<i> Recently in the
 Mid-Cayman Trough,</i>

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:10.176
<i> the deepest and hottest
 hydrothermal vent,</i>

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:12.778
<i>had ever been discovered.
And off the coast of Antarctica,</i>

00:05:13.078 --> 00:05:14.313
<i>this carpet of yeti crabs</i>

00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:16.282
<i> was found around
 hydrothermal vents.</i>

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.384
These crabs harvest
bacteria on their gills,

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:20.953
and eat those.

00:05:21.186 --> 00:05:23.021
It's the microbes, though,
that are making

00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:25.825
the food in the first place
from the chemicals in the vents.

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:29.428
Nonetheless, most of the deep
sea looks like this to us,

00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:30.863
we have no idea what's going on.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.531
( laughter )

00:05:32.798 --> 00:05:36.836
That's because less than
0.01% of the deep sea

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.571
has ever been seen
by human eyes.

00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:41.607
This is the equivalent
of Lewis and Clark

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:43.642
setting out on
their journey, 1804.

00:05:44.109 --> 00:05:46.779
They leave their fort on the
banks of the Missouri River,

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.814
they walk about a half
mile to their canoes.

00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:51.283
But instead of getting
in those canoes,

00:05:51.283 --> 00:05:53.152
exploring the rest
of the continent,

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:55.254
seeing bison,
seeing Yellowstone,

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:57.390
encountering new cultures,
seeing the Rockies,

00:05:57.656 --> 00:05:58.891
seeing a whole other ocean,

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:00.926
they spend the
rest of their lives

00:06:00.926 --> 00:06:03.296
walking that half mile
and studying that.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.132
<i> So, why do we really
 care about microbes?</i>

00:06:07.132 --> 00:06:09.068
<i> What does it mean
 to expand the realm</i>

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:10.269
<i>of metabolic possibility?</i>

00:06:10.836 --> 00:06:13.105
From a very
practical perspective,

00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:14.640
we can do a lot of good.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.109
The project I'm
working on right now

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:19.444
is taking these deep sea
methane-eating metabolism,

00:06:19.444 --> 00:06:22.581
and trying to import it into
E. coli through genetic means

00:06:23.215 --> 00:06:25.650
to turn methane into a bio-fuel.

00:06:25.984 --> 00:06:28.954
The drugs and
biotechnologies of the future

00:06:28.954 --> 00:06:30.823
will most likely come
from the deep sea,

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.727
or from the massive realm of
untapped genetic potential

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:36.228
in microbes around the world.

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:38.697
<i>By understanding the vast realm</i>

00:06:38.697 --> 00:06:40.232
<i>of possibility of microbiology,</i>

00:06:40.232 --> 00:06:42.401
<i>we're also expanding the realm</i>

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.870
<i> of potentially habitable
worlds beyond our planet.</i>

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:47.806
So other calculations that
our team had worked on

00:06:47.806 --> 00:06:50.409
showed that the
methane-eating metabolism

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:51.677
we see in the deep sea

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:54.346
would have actually been
energetically possible on Mars

00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:56.415
in the ancient past
when there was water.

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:58.617
But to me, most fundamentally,

00:06:58.617 --> 00:07:01.821
this search is really
getting to the center

00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:03.523
of what life is all about.

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:06.058
<i> What is this crazy,
 magical process</i>

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:07.693
<i>that moves electrons around,</i>

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.628
<i> and ends up creating
 these self-sustaining,</i>

00:07:09.628 --> 00:07:11.864
<i> self-replicating cells,</i>

00:07:12.164 --> 00:07:15.668
and ultimately leads to
civilization and culture?

00:07:16.635 --> 00:07:18.437
There's so much more to get to,

00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:20.205
and we're really just
starting this journey.

00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:22.508
I can't wait to see
what we find. Thank you.

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:24.710
( applause )
