&gt;&gt;Daniel Goleman: I know I've
said that children, to learn,

00:00:05.956 --> 00:00:09.386
need sustained, focused
attention, but there are limits

00:00:09.386 --> 00:00:14.366
to how long any brain can
sustain optimal attention.

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:18.346
And I think the school day should
be aware of this so that it's paced,

00:00:18.726 --> 00:00:22.306
so that children's brains
have a chance to recover

00:00:22.346 --> 00:00:24.446
for the next period of learning.

00:00:24.986 --> 00:00:29.166
And what's happening is that
glucose, the brain's energy,

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.206
gets used up, gets depleted.

00:00:31.426 --> 00:00:33.906
This is why recess is so important.

00:00:33.906 --> 00:00:36.696
This is why downtime is so important.

00:00:36.696 --> 00:00:41.046
We all need a period when
we do restore, for example,

00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:44.916
one thing that restores the brain, it
turns out, is focusing on the breath.

00:00:44.916 --> 00:00:47.816
It's a neutral thing, doesn't
take a lot of mental effort,

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:51.186
keeps us focused, but it's also
a time when the brain is resting.

00:00:51.276 --> 00:00:56.366
Going for walk, playing, all
of these activities are a part

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.196
of the human repertoire
for a good reason.

00:00:58.546 --> 00:01:02.756
They actually are helping the
brain restore itself, so teachers,

00:01:02.816 --> 00:01:06.396
and educators generally, I
think, would do well to be aware

00:01:06.396 --> 00:01:10.136
of how the brain needs to pace
itself and how important it is

00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:13.666
to schedule regular periods
of rest throughout the day.

00:01:13.786 --> 00:01:16.976
And it's not just kids that need
it, it's teachers and parents, too.
