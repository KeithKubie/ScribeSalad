00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.800
Long distance swimmer Ben Lecomte has his whole
heart invested in bringing attention to ocean health.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.680
But as he crosses the Pacific, medics are paying
close attention to the health of his actual heart.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.180
Researchers want to see how the body's hardest working 
muscle adapts over months of extreme exercise.

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.379
They're looking to see if the center of the heart
hardens through all this excessive training;

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.340
we'll see if there is a change in the EKG
actually happening;

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.009
we're also looking to see if Ben has
a low heart rate variability one day,

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:59.500
does that affect how he swims the next day?
His length, his output, his general well-being?

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.160
As with any other muscle, a more active heart 
will strengthen over time,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.760
enabling it to pump oxygenated blood
 throughout the body at a higher rate.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.000
This thickening process
and the resulting  change in blood flow

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.760
can be visualized with ultrasound.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.000
An ultrasound setup is not exactly portable,
and requires a professional to operate.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.420
That's why Ben's also sporting a small digital
body-worn monitor, developed by Lynda Cole,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.960
a longtime friend and supporter
of Ben and the crew.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.960
The heart rate monitor is composed of
the recorder and the electrode,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.240
and we want to be able to utilize that monitor 
in every type of environment.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.060
From the electrode, there's three parts
that have gel on the back of it.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.000
The signal coming from the body
goes to that gel,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.440
it goes up to the recorder, 
and it produces the EKG signal.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.820
Some of the challenges in creating a monitor 
that will work for athletes swimming

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.380
are sweat, water, body movement...

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.060
the newest device, the SL device, 
which is what Ben is wearing

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.720
is a compilation of everything we've learned.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.460
Lynda and her team are interested
in R to R variability,

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.920
a cardiovascular metric that essentially measures 
how adaptable the heart can be.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.140
When you exercise, your heart rate increases.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.720
If it's 60 beats per minute all day long, 
you probably have a pacemaker in

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.000
or that muscle and the arteries and everything 
are hardening around it.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.060
It's a muscle; you want it to have elasticity.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.560
To get heart rate variability of data from Ben, 
we measure the incident between each heartbeat.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.960
So the P wave is the very first part of the EKG signal,

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.160
and then you have the Q, the R, the S, and the T.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.140
So when you're measuring, you're looking for the
distance from the P to the Q, or the P to the T

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.500
or if you're looking for wide QRS.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.700
So those are some of the different things 
that we could measure.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.420
So right here, this is Ben, and his heart rate is

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.340
94 beats per minute, and he is not swimming here.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.720
The logbook that he keeps is a great thing, because it
tells us how the water is, how his emotional state is.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.920
We put that together with the data that we collect
and we're seeing if we can predict anything.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.280
The lightweight, waterproof technology
Lynda developed for Ben

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.360
has already solved challenges
in cardiovascular medicine.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.420
For instance, it can provide instant diagnostics for something called long QT syndrome in children,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.240
a potentially fatal condition where an erratic heartbeat
can cause fainting or seizures.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.940
They can tell if you have this syndrome immediately
by going into the water.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.320
By hitting in the cold water the measurements 
will totally show themselves.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.480
So I said to the doctor, 'well, you know, 
I have somebody in the water;

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.100
he's on prototype electrodes.'

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.240
I cut and pasted some of the strips together
and sent them to him that night

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.480
and I said 'look, you know, remember this is a prototype.'

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.160
and he came back and he says, 'I've never seen anything
so great. It's so easy to measure; it looks great.'

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.040
And now you can put those kids in the water,
and you could diagnose this syndrome.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.100
Why wouldn't you get excited about that?

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.400
That type of impact is exactly what Ben 
and the Seeker crew hoped this mission would create:

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.120
a tangible difference in the lives of others

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.760
showcasing how we can best monitor and care for
our planet, and our own bodies alike.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.340
The work that we've done with Ben is helping us

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.060
get these types of materials out into the industry today,

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.840
so that we can help diagnose these other illnesses.
