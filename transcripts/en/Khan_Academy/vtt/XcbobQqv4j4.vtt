00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:03.709
- The pH of the soft drink is 3.37

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:07.053
after the addition of
the potassium sorbate.

00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:11.546
Which species, the sorbic
acid or the sorbate ion,

00:00:11.546 --> 00:00:14.112
has a higher concentration
in the soft drink.

00:00:14.112 --> 00:00:17.477
Justify your answer.

00:00:17.477 --> 00:00:19.870
So, this is related to the
question we've been doing

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.075
because the sorbate ion,

00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:26.058
this is what happens when
you put potassium sorbate

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:28.021
and it dis-associates in a solution.

00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:30.367
So the concentration of the sorbate ion

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:31.817
is the same thing as the concentration.

00:00:31.817 --> 00:00:33.174
One way to think about it,

00:00:33.174 --> 00:00:34.910
is going to be the same as

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.977
the concentration of
your potassium sorbate.

00:00:37.897 --> 00:00:42.038
So if we're thinking about
titrating potassium sorbate,

00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:43.480
which we've been doing

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.331
in the last several parts of the problem.

00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:47.514
At what point do you have
an equal concentration

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:51.542
of potassium sorbate and sorbic acid.

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:53.888
Well you have equal concentrations

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:55.977
at the half-equivalence point.

00:00:55.977 --> 00:00:57.302
We marked that out

00:00:57.302 --> 00:00:58.845
when we figured it out

00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:00.331
in the last few parts of this problem.

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:03.500
And the half-equivalence
point happened at a pH of,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.647
we actually figured it out before, 4.77.

00:01:06.647 --> 00:01:08.296
So we could say...

00:01:10.206 --> 00:01:11.767
"half-equivalence point

00:01:20.737 --> 00:01:23.154
"of titration

00:01:25.804 --> 00:01:28.164
"of potassium sorbate

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:37.903
"with hydrochloric acid

00:01:41.793 --> 00:01:45.948
"happens at a pH of,"

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:52.890
let me write that pH of, "4.77."

00:01:53.796 --> 00:01:56.327
And that's the point at which
you have equal concentrations

00:01:56.327 --> 00:01:59.079
of, so we can put this in parentheses,

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.166
"can be viewed as point

00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:11.966
"where we have equal

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.921
"concentrations,

00:02:21.452 --> 00:02:25.596
"of C6H7O2 minus,"

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:31.784
and ascorbic acid, "HC6H7O2."

00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:42.318
"pH of 3.37 is lower

00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:50.268
and will thus," or we could say,

00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:54.179
"will happen beyond

00:02:56.212 --> 00:02:58.511
"half-equivalence point."

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:02.242
Beyond half-equivalence point.

00:03:08.652 --> 00:03:12.518
So, concentration of the
sorbic acid is higher.

00:03:12.518 --> 00:03:15.497
"So concentration

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.952
"of sorbic acid,

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.221
"HC6H7O2, is higher."

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.101
When you're starting off,

00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:34.724
if you're doing a titration.

00:03:34.724 --> 00:03:36.710
Your concentration of potassium sorbate,

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.520
it'll be higher then you keep titrating

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.006
and it keeps reacting with
the hydrochloric acid.

00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:41.736
You get to the half-equivalence point

00:03:41.736 --> 00:03:43.466
where these two things

00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:45.230
are going to have equal concentrations.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.902
Then if you keep titrating it,

00:03:46.902 --> 00:03:48.087
well then you're going to become

00:03:48.087 --> 00:03:50.839
more acidic and your going to
have a higher concentration

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:52.788
of the sorbic acid.

00:03:52.788 --> 00:03:54.309
So one way to think about,

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:56.179
actually let me underline that whole part,

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:58.606
"so concentration of
sorbic acid is higher."

00:03:58.606 --> 00:04:01.090
That's the main thing
that they're asking for.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.760
But the way to think about this soft drink

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.488
is something it might not have,

00:04:06.488 --> 00:04:07.940
and obviously people are sitting there

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.002
and titrating every soft drink.

00:04:09.002 --> 00:04:10.795
But you can kinda view this soft drink

00:04:10.795 --> 00:04:14.011
as well it got that point
after a theoretical titration

00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:15.498
that got us past the...

00:04:18.378 --> 00:04:19.741
half-equivalence point.

00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:20.956
And so therefore,

00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:25.153
most of our things that we care about

00:04:25.153 --> 00:04:26.999
is in the form, is in the acid form

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:28.985
versus the conjugate base.

00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:31.944
Most of the sorbic acid

00:04:31.944 --> 00:04:34.313
is in its acid form.

00:04:34.313 --> 00:04:35.997
Or I guess you could say it the other way.

00:04:35.997 --> 00:04:38.841
Most of the sorbate has
become the conjugate acid.
