00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:07.741
now we're going to create a 
sample application that 

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:12.445
takes our list of friends and 
allows us to give gifts to them

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.615
we start by making small 
modifications to the xml file

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:19.652
creating a form that has a list 
of friends and a list of gifts 

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:23.590
and a button to give 
the gift to the friend

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.393
next we modify our on Load 
friends function 

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.962
so instead of listing 
the friends on the page

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:32.499
it creates a menu out of them 
so we can pick one friend

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:35.101
next we create another function 
make options menu

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.303
which takes the list of gifts that 
we specify and creates

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:41.674
it into a menu so that we can 
select a gift to give to our friend.

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:43.843
then we modify our 
initialization function 

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.612
so that instead of just 
loading our friends

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:49.049
it also loads the gift menu when 
the gadget loads

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.419
the last and most important step 
is writing the give gift function.

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:56.556
this function takes the gift and 
the friend  we wish to send the  

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:59.092
gift to and saves them in to the 
persistent data storage 

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:00.760
of the open social API

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.696
we do that by creating 
a new data request object 

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:06.900
and passing into it a new 
update person APP data request

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.303
specifying to save the data 
under the viewer object.

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:12.639
then we send the request to the 
open social API 

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:14.107
which stores the data

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.942
Here you can see our gadget in 
action

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:17.444
specifying a list of gifts

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:21.347
a list of friends and a button 
to give a gift to the friend

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:23.249
