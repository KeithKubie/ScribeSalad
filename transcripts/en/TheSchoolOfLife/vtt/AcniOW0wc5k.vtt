00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.190
Dating brings us close to a particular strand
of philosophy that, the rest of the time,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.499
might not seem particularly relevant to our
lives: existentialism. One of the movement’s

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:17.119
major proponents – Jean-Paul Sartre – developed
a set of ideas that help explain, and give

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.599
dignity to, the anxiety, excitement and at
points vertigo we may experience as we go

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.589
through the dating ritual. A key concept of
Existentialism is expressed in Sartre’s

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:36.230
somewhat obscure but useful phrase: “Being
precedes essence”. What Sartre meant by

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.960
‘being’ are the bits of our life that
we are free to choose for ourselves: how we

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.949
live, what job we do, how we conceive of what
happens to us. And by ‘essence’, he refers

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.710
to things that lie outside our command: our
biological nature, the flow of history, the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.879
position of the stars… What Sartre wished
to point out to us, in a spirit of wanting

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.280
to liberate us from certain rigidities of
mind, is that ‘being’ should ultimately

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.270
be thought of as more important than ‘essence’.
However much we sometimes like to tell ourselves

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.930
that things have to be the way they are, there
are in fact many radically different possible

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.460
versions of ourselves available to us; we
can choose to an extraordinary extent how

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.120
things might be for us. But much of the time,
Sartre felt, we don’t give this open-ended

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.110
aspect of our identities enough space in our
minds. We assert that the way we live is inevitable

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.399
and fixed, and imply that we have no agency
over our stories. But Sartre argues that this

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.259
is an illusion: the kind of person we are
right now developed as a result of all sorts

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.899
of small and large decisions: it could have
been very different, and may be different

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.180
again in the future according to the way we
exercise of our will upon the raw material

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.579
of life. Surprisingly enough, it is dating
that can bring home some of the richness of

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.399
this dramatic existential insight. It is in
our dating years that we feel, perhaps more

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.880
than at any point before or since, how much
our future is undefined, how little is preordained,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.380
how many options there really are; how frighteningly
free and fluid things can be. With each date

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.510
we’re sketching – even if very lightly
– a possible future. If our date on Wednesday

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.840
goes well, we could conceivably be looking
at (for instance) a life in which we have

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.750
relatives in the highlands of Scotland, in
which a lot of the people we spend time with

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.080
are in the technology sector and in which
we’ll probably move country several times;

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.001
we might in time also have a child called
Hamish or Flora. Alternatively, if our date

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:43.480
on Friday evening goes very well, we could
be edging towards a life in which we’ll

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.900
be spending a lot of time in Amsterdam; we’ll
get drawn into the theatre world; if we have

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.070
a child they might be called Maartje or Rem
and they’ll have a former cycling champion

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.060
as a grandfather and an Indonesian grandmother.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.930
Once we make our choice, things may well start
to seem as if they always had to be, that

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.370
there was some essence that we were always
moving towards, that we had to end up with

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.010
little Maartje or sweet Flora crawling on
the carpet towards us. But in the dating period,

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.590
we are closer to a grander and more visceral
truth: that there is no single script. Sartre’s

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.590
second big point is that properly recognising
our freedom can lead us to a state of huge

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.260
but inevitable and in a way salutary anxiety.
Conscious of our real liberty, we take on

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.510
board that we have to make decisions and yet,
at the same time, that we will never have

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.210
the correct and full information upon which
to base them with the sort of perfect wisdom

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.260
and foresight we might desire. We are steering
largely blind, forced to make choices that

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.080
ideally we’d leave to the Gods but that
in a secular world, we have no option but

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.990
to take on for ourselves. As we date, we may
wonder: who should we settle for? For how

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.420
long do we keep going? How can we tell whether
this one or that one is right? Sartre’s

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.720
answer is that we can never properly know
but that we are never more properly alive

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.080
and authentic than when we are turning over
such enquiries: the fluidity of our destinies

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.890
is then palpable, with all the strangeness
and wonder this implies. Too often, the sense

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:22.020
of fluidity is lost. We assume that what is
had to be and that we have no further choices

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:30.310
left open to us. The dating years defy such
views. No wonder if they feel like high stakes.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.540
Sartre wished to embolden us for the sort
of challenges they present to us. Dating pushes

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.710
aside the veil of our normal complacency and
reveals the sublime, terrifying and, at the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.760
same time, thrilling uncertainty of existence.
We should, with a host of existential challenges

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.720
before us, at the very least, not be too bored.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:01.120
