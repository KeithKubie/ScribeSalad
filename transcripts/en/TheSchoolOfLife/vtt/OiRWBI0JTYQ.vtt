00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.440
Romanticism is one of the most important historical events of all time.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.340
Unlike a lot of what gets called history,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.080
romanticism isn't a war or a piece of technology or a political event.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.200
It refers to the birth of a new set of ideas. It is about a mindset and a way of feeling.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.160
Romanticism began in Western Europe in the mid-18 century, in the work of artists, poets and philosophers.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.780
And it subsequently spread all over the world.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.760
Changing how millions of people look at nature, children, love, sex, money and work.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.820
We are all now more or less in some aspect of our sensibilities romantics.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.180
Romanticism is best understood as a reaction to the birth of the modern world

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.860
and some of its key features: industrialization, urbanization, secularization and consumerism.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.740
What follows, are some of the central moments in the history of romanticism:

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.540
The Marais, Paris, May 1762.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.480
The Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau publishes a book about the raising of children: "Emile" or "On Education".

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.960
It contains diatribes against the oppressive world of adults.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.540
And praises the natural goodness, spontaneity and wisdom of little children.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.400
It is at points extremely anxious to get mothers to breast-feed their offspring.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.240
The first sustained argument for this practice in western civilization.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.200
The world around Rousseau is growing ever more, rational, scientific and technologically based.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.480
It is increasingly sensible, planned, sterile and bureaucratic. Against all of these, Rousseau emphasizes the child,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.860
the original rebel, the representative of everything that is pure, unschooled and outside of adult discipline.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.780
It is the seat of creativity and genius.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.460
For the first time in Western history, glamour is directed not at the attainment of reason and adult self control,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.580
But at the freedom from tradition and the natural, innocence and the sweetness of the child.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.080
Brook Street, London, August 1770

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.080
A precocious 17 year old poet called Thomas Chatterton

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.640
downs some arsenic and ends his life in a tiny attic apartment.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.120
He kills himself because no one wants to publish his poetry

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.120
which is concerned with beauty and wisdom.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.420
And because his uncomprehending family are applying pressure for him to become a lawyer.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.140
A cult soon grows up around the young beautiful poet

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.820
with shoulder length chestnut hair.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.200
He becomes an emblem of something that will become very important for romantics:

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.920
the idea of the sensitive, doomed person often an artist rejected by a cruel, vulgar world.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.560
Chatterton stands at the head of a long line of romantic heroes that will stretch from Byron to Keiths to Van Gogh,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.840
and eventually all the way to Jim Morris and Amy Winehouse.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.500
Romanticism borrows from Christianity.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.160
The romantic hero is a secularized Christ like figure.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.620
The loser who is in truth deeply noble in the eyes of the few who understand.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.900
Leipzig, Germany, 1774

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.740
The German author Goethe publishes the quintessential romantic love story:

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.220
The Sorrows of Young Werther.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.840
It tells the story of a passionate doomed love affair between a young poet called Werther and a beautiful clever young woman called Charlotte.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.470
Unfortunately for Werther, Charlotte is
married. So the love is impossible from

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.090
the very start but that doesn't stop
Werther, a dreamy and practical young man

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.680
who loves the arts above all else. Like
chatterton, Werther is under pressure to

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.310
have a sensible career and join
bourgeois life but he can think of only

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.420
one thing:

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.739
The impulses of his heart. Eventually
Werther can't take it anymore and

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.880
kills himself but rather than condemning
him as a lunatic and a hothead,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.930
Goethe one of the founding fathers of
Romanticism directs all our sympathies

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.950
towards Werther.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.540
We are supposed to be on his side admiring
his passionate and entirely impractical

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.130
attitude to love. The book becomes the
most popular novel of a generation. Three

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.810
million copies are printed.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.230
Napoleon declares it the greatest work
of European literature and it

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.459
dramatically changes how many people
think of love, privileging dramatic

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.690
outpourings of feeling over more
traditional rational concerns for class

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.630
lineage and money. For a romantic

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.269
it's always right and Noble

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.039
to follow your heart. The disastrous results
that follow aren't any argument that

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.160
just proof of how desiccated and
heartless the so-called adult sensible world can be.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.640
Madrid, spain, 1798

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.700
The artist Francisco Goya produces one of his most iconic images titled "The Sleep
of Reason Brings out Monsters".

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:45.319
It captures a quintessential romantic
interest in the limits of reason and the

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:50.240
power of the irrational over humans
fragile minds. To be romantic is to have

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.830
sympathy for madness and to hold an
almost vengeful attitude towards

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.990
bombastic claims as to the triumph of
rationality, science and logic.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.560
The Lake District, England, December 1799

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.060
A young English poet called William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy move into what set to become one of the most famous

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.840
residences in the history of English
literature: Dove cottage in Grasmere on the

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.240
edge of The Lake District.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.520
Here they will spend the next nine years and Wordsworth will write some of the greatest poetry
in english language,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.659
celebrating something that's very under threat: the
natural world.

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:31.069
He will write about daffodils, oak trees,
clouds, butterflies and rivers and his

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:35.659
work will charm and seduce Europe. Within a generation their will in Wordsworth

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.590
own estimation be more tourists than
sheep in The Lake District.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.400
Most importantly, running through
Wordsworth poetry is an abiding hatred

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.050
for everything mechanical and industrial.
When many years later a railway line

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.680
threatens to pass through the Lake
District Wordsworth and his followers do

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.820
everything they can to have the train, a
symbol of Wordsworth hated technology rerouted.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.120
To be a romantic is to take
the side of nature against industry.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.680
It is to prefer a daffodil to a viaduct, to
a tree to a factory. At the moment when

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.880
huge swaths of Britain are being covered
in the often monstrous new cities that

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.050
are making Europe rich, Wordsworth the
quintessential romantic speaks up for

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.330
the natural and a simple life.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.910
Niagara, United States, September 1829

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.300
The American painter Thomas Cole paints one of his most characteristic images of the mighty Niagara Falls with a couple of

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:28.889
Native Americans in the foreground.

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.960
Cole makes his name as a painter of
sublime scenes, vast landscapes of the

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.330
American interior showing nature at its
most dignified and impressive. Man looks

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.490
lost and puny by comparison. This too is
a typical romantic attitude, for

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.669
romantics don't believe in God but they
go in search of the emotions

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.389
one might once have had around
religion and locate them in a big

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:55.710
wide-open spaces of nature. To be a
romantic is to find relief from the

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.699
pressures of competitive city life in
the sort of natural grandeur that

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:03.000
transcends all human achievements and
concerns.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.320
Westminster, London, April 1847

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.920
14 years after some fairly incompetent officials destroy the British parliament with fire, a new building reopens designed by a

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.510
rising star architect: Augustus Pugin.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.939
Oddly even though the building is new

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:22.349
It is made to look old, very very old,
medieval in fact. It is full of suits of

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:26.339
armor and seated angels. When the
architect Pugin defends the building

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:29.610
he argues that is building is Noble
because it harks back to his country's

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.349
pre-industrial past, before it grew
obsessed, he is careful to add with money

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:35.849
or technology.

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:39.569
It begins a cult of the Middle Ages, a
big theme and romanticism which

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:43.949
identifies in the world of knights and
castles, a nobility that is thought missing

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:47.529
from the factories and shopping arcades
of the modern world.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.360
Saint-Germain, Paris, May 1863

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:59.820
The French poet Charles Baudelaire writes a prose poem celebrating an unusual character whom he calls a flâneur, a stroller or loafer.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.539
A casual wanderer who has no particular job to go to

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:07.409
and just spend this time observing busy
street life of a modern city,

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:11.361
threading his way through the crowds,
strolling instead of rushing, sampling

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.790
people's conversations and creating
narratives for others lives.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:20.520
Baudelaire, a typical romantic admires the flâneur's playfulness and lack of practicality.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.889
This person isn't a waste of time.

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:26.550
It doesn't matter that he doesn't have a
job for Baudelaire he is a prince,

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.379
unlike the boring wage slaves rushing to
the new offices of capitalism.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.940
Le Havre, April 1891

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:41.200
The french painter Paul Gauguin set sail for Tahiti, hoping to escape everything that is artificial and conventional.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.680
He lives in the Pacific South Seas on and off for the rest of his life, drawing young Native women

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.780
looking relaxed and natural without
anything on.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.280
They are in his eyes evidence that
civilization is what has made a sick,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.730
A core romantic belief.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.300
The Romantic movement has permanently
changed our sensibilities

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.810
as the world has grown ever more
technological and rational romanticism

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:07.310
has come to stick up for the irrational,
the untrained, the exotic, the childlike

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.779
and the naive.

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:12.759
There is naturally something a bit
adolescent and immature within Romanticism.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.209
But then again it can be something
rather heartless, cold, dogmatic and

00:09:17.209 --> 00:09:20.329
arrogant in many aspects of modernity.

00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:23.570
one hopes this isn't going to be the end
of the story that we may in the future

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.500
learn to soften the worst side of
modernity through the best sides of

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.399
romanticism, in order to create a more
evolved alternative,

00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:35.159
what one might term: an age of maturity.
