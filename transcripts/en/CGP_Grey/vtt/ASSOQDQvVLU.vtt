00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.556
The United States is, shockingly, a bunch of states that are united.

00:00:03.797 --> 00:00:05.197
It was just 13 to start with,

00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:07.221
but as time marched on, the border marked west,

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:11.245
bringing us to today and the 48 contiguous states
plus Alaska and Hawaii.

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.069
They're usually drawn in these little boxes,
not to to scale because Hawaii is in the middle of a

00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:18.593
vast ocean of deadly nothing-ness, 
and Alaska is monstrous.

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:22.167
Unlike other unions, where members can leave
if they so choose,

00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:23.991
statehood is eternal.

00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:25.515
Even for you, Texas.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.939
Now, how the federal government works 
is a story for another time,

00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:32.063
but at the moment, all you need know is that
Congress, where national laws are written

00:00:32.087 --> 00:00:34.787
is made of representatives who are sent 
from the states.

00:00:34.811 --> 00:00:38.311
Now, there are some non-state gaps not
visible on this map.

00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:41.535
The first is Washington D.C.,
the nation's capital.

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.854
which is a stateless limbo land
between Maryland and Virginia.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:49.773
As D.C. is a city without a state,
it puts her under the control of Congress.

00:00:49.797 --> 00:00:54.797
Meaning all the other states get the final
say on how D.C. is run,

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.821
while she doesn't get a vote in anything.

00:00:56.845 --> 00:00:59.840
It didn't matter when the District of Columbia
was basically uninhabited,

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:03.364
but since more people live in D.C. now
than do in a couple of states

00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:05.388
it's an uncomfortable arrangement.

00:01:05.412 --> 00:01:08.412
The other gaps on this map are the 
American Indian reservations.

00:01:08.436 --> 00:01:10.436
which are numerous.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.060
The United States kind of administers them
while sort of  treating them as foreign nations

00:01:14.084 --> 00:01:17.784
which means you could draw the state
boundaries to look like this

00:01:17.808 --> 00:01:21.408
because the reservations are kind of
apart from those states.

00:01:21.432 --> 00:01:24.932
But the American Indian reservations
are such a full of asterisks

00:01:24.956 --> 00:01:26.556
(O' so sensitive situation)

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.880
it's also better as a story for
another time.

00:01:28.904 --> 00:01:32.604
Gaps aside, the continent (and Hawaii) is
mostly straight-forward.

00:01:32.628 --> 00:01:36.128
But there's more than just these
United States.

00:01:36.152 --> 00:01:38.952
When the U.S. ran out of lands 
to manifest destiny,

00:01:38.976 --> 00:01:42.276
she learned from the best
and teritorified a whole bunch of islands.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.300
First up: Puerto Rico - 
an organized, unincorporated territory

00:01:45.324 --> 00:01:48.024
of the U.S.
This means she's self-governing(to some extent)

00:01:48.048 --> 00:01:52.048
and that all the U.S. constitution doesn't 
automatically apply

00:01:52.072 --> 00:01:55.872
on the island.
Now, 3.7 million people live in Puerto Rico

00:01:55.896 --> 00:02:00.106
which is 91% of the people living
on U.S. Territorial islands

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.230
and more people than live in
21 of the states.

00:02:04.254 --> 00:02:08.854
And, the U.S. treats Puerto Rico
as a state in almost all but name

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:10.978
which possibly soon
she will be anyway

00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:14.567
bringing the number of stars to a 
nice, even, 51?

00:02:14.591 --> 00:02:18.091
But Puerto Rico isn't the only
organized, unincorporated territory.

00:02:18.115 --> 00:02:21.015
There's also Guam, which was acquired
in the Spanish-American war,

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:24.039
along with Puerto Rico, there's 
the Northern Mariana Islands,

00:02:24.063 --> 00:02:26.063
taken from Japan during World War II,

00:02:26.087 --> 00:02:28.687
and the U.S. Virgin Islands taken from
nobody -- Denmark sold her.

00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:31.711
The people in these territories are 
American citizens.

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:34.835
In most ways, the territories are
just like D.C.

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.859
Congress can override their
local governments and they don't have

00:02:37.883 --> 00:02:40.583
representation because no state-tation.

00:02:40.607 --> 00:02:42.607
But otherwise, it's America.

00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:45.831
Actually, the territories and D.C. do 
get to elect congressional representatives

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:47.655
who attend all of the meetings

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:49.679
but just can't vote in any of them.

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:53.303
which is either the worst job in the world
or the best job in the world

00:02:53.327 --> 00:02:55.327
depending on the kind of person who gets it.

00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:59.051
Also, since votes for president are based
on state population,

00:02:59.075 --> 00:03:01.075
citizens in the territories can't vote.

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.599
Which as mentioned in a previous video
leads to the weird situation that

00:03:04.623 --> 00:03:08.123
Americans who live in foreign countries
can vote for president in the

00:03:08.147 --> 00:03:10.147
state where they last lived.

00:03:10.171 --> 00:03:12.971
While Americans who live in America,
just in a territory,

00:03:12.995 --> 00:03:13.895
cannot.

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.419
Along with these unincorporated organized
territories

00:03:16.443 --> 00:03:19.553
there are also unincorporated unorganized
territories.

00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:21.377
Actually, quite a few.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.201
They are Howland Island,
Navassa Island,

00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:24.625
Wake Island, Jarvis Island,

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:26.649
Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef,
Midway Reef,

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:28.473
Serranilla Bank and Bajo Nuevo Bank.

00:03:28.497 --> 00:03:31.897
Most of these were acquired under the 
delightfully named Guano Islands Act

00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:35.621
when the U.S. decided she wanted
a bunch of islands filled with bird poop.

00:03:35.645 --> 00:03:39.445
No, really, the U.S. just straight up
wrote a law to declare those islands

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.769
were now hers.

00:03:40.793 --> 00:03:44.388
Unorganized, in this system, means there's
no local government on these islands

00:03:44.412 --> 00:03:46.812
because no one lives in these places.

00:03:46.836 --> 00:03:49.536
Some of them are barley above the water line.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.860
Now, the weird category is unorganized 
incorporated territories

00:03:52.884 --> 00:03:55.484
of which there is one: the Palmyra Atoll.

00:03:55.508 --> 00:04:00.108
claimed by the U.S. after the totally
peaceful annexation of Hawaii.

00:04:00.132 --> 00:04:03.232
They're currently an uninhabited 
nature reserve.

00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:06.456
But, incorporated means the U.S.
constitution applies here.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.930
To who? The Palmyra Atoll is like that 
question about a tree falling in the forest.

00:04:10.954 --> 00:04:14.354
If there are no people for the constitution
to apply to,

00:04:14.378 --> 00:04:16.178
does the constitution still apply?

00:04:16.202 --> 00:04:16.602
Yes.

00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:20.026
This means if a foreigner gives birth
on this uninhabited strip

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.950
and doesn't die from the nature,

00:04:21.974 --> 00:04:23.974
their child would be an American citizen.

00:04:23.998 --> 00:04:25.998
Now, this category is empty.

00:04:26.022 --> 00:04:28.322
It's where territories go
before they become states.

00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:30.346
When basically the Constitution fully
applies

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.870
and it was last occupied by Hawaii.

00:04:32.894 --> 00:04:36.094
We've gone full circle but there is
one territory we've left out --

00:04:36.118 --> 00:04:40.218
American Samoa: home to 55,000 people.

00:04:40.242 --> 00:04:42.842
Uniquely, American Samoans 
don't get to be citizens

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:44.866
but instead are American Nationals.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.090
They can live in the states but can't vote
in presidential elections

00:04:48.114 --> 00:04:51.614
Unless they go through the immigration
process like any foreigner.

00:04:51.638 --> 00:04:55.738
Even though in all other ways,
they're indistinguishable from citizens.

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:59.262
This is unique to American Samoa
and there seems to be no reason for it

00:04:59.286 --> 00:05:03.386
other than that Congress has
gotten around to updating the system.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.310
American Samoa is in the 
no-government category, like it's lord of the flies

00:05:07.334 --> 00:05:09.334
over there, which it obviously isn't.

00:05:09.358 --> 00:05:13.358
So American Samoa with it's organized 
government needs to go over here and

00:05:13.382 --> 00:05:16.482
Puerto Rico, essentially a state, 
needs to go over here

00:05:16.506 --> 00:05:19.306
and the empty Palmyra Atoll needs to go
over here.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.930
But, don't hold your breath for the
paperwork to make it's way through Congress

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:23.654
any time soon.

00:05:23.678 --> 00:05:26.678
So, that's all the territories of the 
United States, but there is one final

00:05:26.702 --> 00:05:30.602
thing to talk about: three tiny nations --
Palu, the Marshall Islands and the

00:05:30.626 --> 00:05:32.626
Federated States of Micronesia.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.250
The last has a convenient domain name: .fm --
first choice of quality podcasts everywhere.

00:05:37.274 --> 00:05:38.374
*hint, hint; click, click*

00:05:38.398 --> 00:05:40.398
These are separate countries
with UN seats and everything

00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:43.422
but they have a 
"Compact of Free Association"

00:05:43.446 --> 00:05:45.046
with the United States.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.470
The deal is that the U.S. provide economic
support and military defense to the

00:05:49.494 --> 00:05:53.494
compact nations in return for being allowed
to build military bases there.

00:05:53.518 --> 00:05:57.518
Also, compact citizens can live and work
in the United States and vice versa.

00:05:57.542 --> 00:06:00.842
The Americans wanting to live abroad:
you have three easy options.

00:06:00.866 --> 00:06:04.466
So, that's America: 50 states,
many reservations, one district,

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.890
lots of islands territories, some even 
with people and three tiny associated countries.
