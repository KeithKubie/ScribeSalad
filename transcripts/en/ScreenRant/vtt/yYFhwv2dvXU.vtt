00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.720
There are websites dedicated to spotting mistakes
made in popular films and these mistakes are

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.340
usually inconsistencies between cuts.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.650
Did you know that inconsistencies could happen
in animated films too?

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.000
It’s a lot of fun catching these rare occurrences
and we would love to hear about the ones we

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.470
didn’t show you today.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.449
Add a comment for your favorite mistake in
a Disney films below and stick around to the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.769
end of the video for a Frozen fact that you
might not have known.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:38.640
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Disney
Animation Mistakes That Made The Final Cut.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.770
Wreck-It-Ralph

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.940
When Vanellope is taught to drive with the
help of Ralph, she looses a tooth.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.140
She spits it out and gives us a big smile
letting us know she lost that tooth but later

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.800
on it reappears.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.590
With all the sugar and candy throughout the
lands they are visiting we are certain there

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.170
must be at least one dentist.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.559
There was probably a deleted scene of her
going to the dentist and getting a crown.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.339
That’s why she has that adorable smile again.

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:03.809
The Little Mermaid

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.610
Working with kids or animals are difficult
and any director will agree with that statement.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.299
Before Prince Eric is presented with his unflattering
statue, his dog, Max heads over and licks

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:14.710
Ariel on the face.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.110
On the right check to be exact but when Max
is called back by Eric.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.490
Ariel turns around and touches her left check,
remembering the slobber just left there on

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.880
the wrong side.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.530
Animals can be a distraction on sets and even
a half fish, half women actresses can get

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.450
distracted by animals.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.450
Toy Story

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.030
Getting ready to be tortured by Sid, Woody
calls on Sid’s abused toys to help him save

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.330
his friend Buzz.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.380
On the wall behind him is a clock that reads
3:10.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.189
Moments later when the toys are getting ready
to execute Woody’s plan the clock reads

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.189
10:00.

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.560
You could say it was hours later but unless
they live in Alaska the sun should not be

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.560
shining still.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.619
We think one of the animators had a little
fun and changed the time on us to see if we

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.590
were watching.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.560
Lilo &amp; Stitch

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.379
In one of the opening scenes, Lilo takes hula
lessons as two men beat on drums for rhythm.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.300
It is quite impressive how they keep their
pace, especially impressive for the guy on

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.300
the right.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.530
In between shots he changes his drum.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.680
Originally they both had yellow drums but
then the guy on the right changes his drum

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.720
out for a Pahu.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.709
We are going to blame this one on the property
master on the set; he probably missed a day

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.231
of work for some surfing lessons.

00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:33.231
Frozen

00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:34.231
There is a lot of magic going on in Frozen.

00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:35.231
We have magic ice coming from fingertips and
a giant snowman that tries to eat people but

00:02:35.231 --> 00:02:36.231
not every character has magical powers.

00:02:36.231 --> 00:02:37.231
Hans doesn’t have magical powers but the
actor must have felt jealous of this oversight

00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:38.231
so he added his own.

00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:39.231
During the film he takes out a sword numerous
times to battle or to be threatening, but

00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:40.231
where is it coming from.

00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:41.231
It magically appears and disappears throughout
the film just like his love for Anna.

00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:42.231
Monsters Inc.

00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:43.231
When Monsters, Inc. scarer George exits a
kid's room he has a near-death experience.

00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:45.890
A human child’s sock is attached to his
back!

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.700
Code 23-19, alert the CDA!

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.950
As the Child Detection Agency arrives and
causes chaos the sock flips from pointing

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.470
to the middle of his back to pointing to his
shoulder.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.780
Maybe this mishap has to do with the same
sock Monster that steals my socks from the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.780
dryer.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.440
A mystery that will never be solved.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.620
Beauty and the Beast

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.310
If you are going to get into an argument with
a Disney character, make sure it isn’t the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.940
Beast from 1991’s Beauty and the Beast.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.010
He has a temper and in the beginning of the
film when he looses that temper he slashes

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.909
a painting of his human self, going downwards
from left to right.

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.099
Later on when Belle strolls into the forbidden
wing of the castle the painting has different

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.099
slashes.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.519
These slashes go down from right to left.

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:39.709
Maybe the Beast has numerous paintings of
himself and claws them frequently.

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:40.849
Toy Story 2

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.090
During the commercial for Al’s Toy Barn,
Rex stumbles with the remote to turn off the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.340
television, luckily Ham comes over and helps
before anyone hears the commercial.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.920
Strangely, when the TV is turned off there
is no reflection of Ham or Rex.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.560
Are Ham and Rex vampires and that’s why
we can’t see their reflection?

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.790
Rex has the teeth but Ham still looks too
innocent for us to believe that.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:09.310
Maybe we’ll find out in Toy Story 4.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.310
Aladdin

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.159
When Jafar holds Princess Jasmine captive
she has to try and convince him that she is

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.269
in love with him.

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.049
How could a woman not fall for his charm?

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.880
On her right arm is a gold bracelet as she
tries to seduce him.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.590
Once Jafar realizes it is a trick he pushes
her down and the bracelet is now on the left

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.590
arm.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.380
Was this magic from the Genie or did the animators
make a mistake?

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.850
We think it was the Genie, only because we
love Robin Williams and are hoping for a deleted

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:53.230
scene that explains 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:05:02.260
this one-day.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:11.170
Tangled

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.740
In the climactic scene when Flynn cuts off
Rapunzel’s outrageously long hair his right

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.790
wrist is visible and shackle free.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.300
Then in the next shot his wrist is bound again
in shackles.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.140
It looks like Flynn was having a hard time
deciding if he should be imprisoned or not.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.851
At least when Rapunzel’s hair changes colors
it was on purpose even though it would have

00:05:28.851 --> 00:05:30.780
been cool if it turned purple.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.160
