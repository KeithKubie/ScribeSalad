00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.730
A typical defense against DDoS, is for

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.490
a company to buy more servers or
bandwidth.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.920
However, DDoS attacks can be
amplified to make such defense very,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.070
very expensive.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.450
Here's one example.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.600
On the internet, there are many so
called open recursive DNS servers.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.290
These are DNS servers that any
machine on the internet can query.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.220
A typical DNS query is to look up
the IP address of a domain name.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.530
The DNS also allows query for
the so called large TXT record

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.650
of a domain that includes a lot
of details of the domain.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.250
Even including organization note,
description, information and so on.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.860
The point is that the size of the query
response can be more than 1,500 bytes.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.630
So, here's how this amplified
distributed reflective attack works.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.270
The attacker instructs the bots to query

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.030
the open recursive DNS
servers on the internet.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.840
And in the query, the source of
the query is spoofed as victim's IP.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.190
Meaning that the response will
be sent back to the victim

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.900
instead of to the bot.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.480
And the query itself is for
the Large TXT record.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.670
Because the query is for
the Large TXT record,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.280
the response will be
at least 1,500 bytes.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.350
And again, because the query is spoofed,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.180
as from the victim,
the response will be sent to the victim.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.710
Because there are many bots, and

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.180
each bot can query multiple
recursive DNS servers.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.760
The victim as a result will get
many many responses each with

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.910
at least 1500 bytes.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.050
Therefore with just a couple thousand
bots participating in the attack,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.270
the victim can get several
gigabytes of traffic.
