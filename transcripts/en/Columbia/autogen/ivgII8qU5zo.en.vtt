00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:14.990
both in nature and in in some of the
things we design and I think that's a

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000
things we design and I think that's a
 

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.490
things we design and I think that's a
good way to learn from these other

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500
good way to learn from these other
 

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.079
good way to learn from these other
systems which brings us to the actual

00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:18.089
systems which brings us to the actual
 

00:12:18.089 --> 00:12:24.650
systems which brings us to the actual
talk and it starts with I'm going to

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660
talk and it starts with I'm going to
 

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.900
talk and it starts with I'm going to
cheat here as well and try to do to

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:26.910
cheat here as well and try to do to
 

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.530
cheat here as well and try to do to
todds and put them side-by-side this is

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:30.540
todds and put them side-by-side this is
 

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.040
todds and put them side-by-side this is
a story about having a 22 lives I think

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.050
a story about having a 22 lives I think
 

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.860
a story about having a 22 lives I think
it's a really helpful for everybody to

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:36.870
it's a really helpful for everybody to
 

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.540
it's a really helpful for everybody to
get two things going on because they

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:38.550
get two things going on because they
 

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.160
get two things going on because they
really end up in forming each other and

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.170
really end up in forming each other and
 

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.650
really end up in forming each other and
for me that's been certainly true with

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660
for me that's been certainly true with
 

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.750
for me that's been certainly true with
the sustainable architecture side and

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760
the sustainable architecture side and
 

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.300
the sustainable architecture side and
also the parametric human project they

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:47.310
also the parametric human project they
 

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.980
also the parametric human project they
end up having these these things that

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:48.990
end up having these these things that
 

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.070
end up having these these things that
help each other along and they all

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:52.080
help each other along and they all
 

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.769
help each other along and they all
involve this multiscale aspect of going

00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:54.779
involve this multiscale aspect of going
 

00:12:54.779 --> 00:12:56.800
involve this multiscale aspect of going
from the macrocosm and microcosm

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:56.810
from the macrocosm and microcosm
 

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.750
from the macrocosm and microcosm
parametric design physically based or

00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760
parametric design physically based or
 

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.540
parametric design physically based or
anatomically based and my goal in both

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:02.550
anatomically based and my goal in both
 

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.120
anatomically based and my goal in both
of these to have an opus open model and

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:05.130
of these to have an opus open model and
 

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.360
of these to have an opus open model and
then so that both the research and the

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:08.370
then so that both the research and the
 

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.460
then so that both the research and the
the industrial community can participate

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:10.470
the industrial community can participate
 

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.449
the industrial community can participate
in these things they they started in a

00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:14.459
in these things they they started in a
 

00:13:14.459 --> 00:13:17.360
in these things they they started in a
funny way to we had a partner faro

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:17.370
funny way to we had a partner faro
 

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:18.769
funny way to we had a partner faro
technologies they make these scanners

00:13:18.769 --> 00:13:18.779
technologies they make these scanners
 

00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:21.199
technologies they make these scanners
these laser scanners and they they sent

00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:21.209
these laser scanners and they they sent
 

00:13:21.209 --> 00:13:22.940
these laser scanners and they they sent
to someone who looks like a like phaser

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:22.950
to someone who looks like a like phaser
 

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.329
to someone who looks like a like phaser
on a robot army and they wanted us to

00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:26.339
on a robot army and they wanted us to
 

00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:28.579
on a robot army and they wanted us to
scan stuff my said that's cool but I

00:13:28.579 --> 00:13:28.589
scan stuff my said that's cool but I
 

00:13:28.589 --> 00:13:29.990
scan stuff my said that's cool but I
really want the environment one I want

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000
really want the environment one I want
 

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.880
really want the environment one I want
to scan our building and so they said

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:31.890
to scan our building and so they said
 

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.319
to scan our building and so they said
okay the census one we scanned the

00:13:33.319 --> 00:13:33.329
okay the census one we scanned the
 

00:13:33.329 --> 00:13:37.220
okay the census one we scanned the
building there it's a combination of 53

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:37.230
building there it's a combination of 53
 

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.590
building there it's a combination of 53
scans actually totaling 1.3 billion

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600
scans actually totaling 1.3 billion
 

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.139
scans actually totaling 1.3 billion
points and we scanned the outside the

00:13:42.139 --> 00:13:42.149
points and we scanned the outside the
 

00:13:42.149 --> 00:13:43.850
points and we scanned the outside the
street and the fifth floor you can see

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860
street and the fifth floor you can see
 

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.590
street and the fifth floor you can see
there the reason you can see the fifth

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600
there the reason you can see the fifth
 

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.449
there the reason you can see the fifth
floors because we didn't scan the sixth

00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:47.459
floors because we didn't scan the sixth
 

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:49.970
floors because we didn't scan the sixth
floor or the roof and then later we

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:49.980
floor or the roof and then later we
 

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.190
floor or the roof and then later we
thought hey we have that stuff and we're

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.200
thought hey we have that stuff and we're
 

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.889
thought hey we have that stuff and we're
getting just low resolution models out

00:13:54.889 --> 00:13:54.899
getting just low resolution models out
 

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:57.620
getting just low resolution models out
of the MRIs for working on the

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:57.630
of the MRIs for working on the
 

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.970
of the MRIs for working on the
parametric human project so we thought

00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:58.980
parametric human project so we thought
 

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.319
parametric human project so we thought
maybe we can use the hand scanner for

00:14:00.319 --> 00:14:00.329
maybe we can use the hand scanner for
 

00:14:00.329 --> 00:14:02.060
maybe we can use the hand scanner for
scanning bones so we started working

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:02.070
scanning bones so we started working
 

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:03.410
scanning bones so we started working
with the department of anatomy at

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.420
with the department of anatomy at
 

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.210
with the department of anatomy at
University of Toronto to scan these

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220
University of Toronto to scan these
 

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.650
University of Toronto to scan these
bones and you can see we're getting very

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:06.660
bones and you can see we're getting very
 

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.470
bones and you can see we're getting very
detailed scan

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480
detailed scan
 

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.780
detailed scan
inside of that to the next step after

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:10.790
inside of that to the next step after
 

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.030
inside of that to the next step after
this starting from the physical because

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040
this starting from the physical because
 

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.800
this starting from the physical because
we're interested in the retrofit project

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:14.810
we're interested in the retrofit project
 

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:18.310
we're interested in the retrofit project
in the left we wanted to go to to a

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320
in the left we wanted to go to to a
 

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.610
in the left we wanted to go to to a
parametric model and this is an open

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:21.620
parametric model and this is an open
 

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.220
parametric model and this is an open
research project and hopefully some some

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:24.230
research project and hopefully some some
 

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.420
research project and hopefully some some
of you are interested working on this

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:25.430
of you are interested working on this
 

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.370
of you are interested working on this
but going from point cloud to geometry

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:27.380
but going from point cloud to geometry
 

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.920
but going from point cloud to geometry
and that's a parametric geometry is is

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:29.930
and that's a parametric geometry is is
 

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.350
and that's a parametric geometry is is
an open problem with I have a few ideas

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.360
an open problem with I have a few ideas
 

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.569
an open problem with I have a few ideas
about that be cool to work on if anybody

00:14:34.569 --> 00:14:34.579
about that be cool to work on if anybody
 

00:14:34.579 --> 00:14:38.319
about that be cool to work on if anybody
has needs a PhD topic but and then on

00:14:38.319 --> 00:14:38.329
has needs a PhD topic but and then on
 

00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:41.620
has needs a PhD topic but and then on
the other side there's more because of a

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:41.630
the other side there's more because of a
 

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.750
the other side there's more because of a
single bone is the tibia here is a

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760
single bone is the tibia here is a
 

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.980
single bone is the tibia here is a
fairly consistent object it's a single

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:47.990
fairly consistent object it's a single
 

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.720
fairly consistent object it's a single
object there's no it's not like the

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:49.730
object there's no it's not like the
 

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.550

building where this inside and outside a

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560
building where this inside and outside a
 

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.470
building where this inside and outside a
different components so there are some

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480
different components so there are some
 

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.090
different components so there are some
standard ways to create geometry out of

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:55.100
standard ways to create geometry out of
 

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.129
standard ways to create geometry out of
that and after a bit of work we've got a

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:57.139
that and after a bit of work we've got a
 

00:14:57.139 --> 00:14:59.139
that and after a bit of work we've got a
good tessellation on that one from the

00:14:59.139 --> 00:14:59.149
good tessellation on that one from the
 

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:02.170
good tessellation on that one from the
point cloud but while the building is

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:02.180
point cloud but while the building is
 

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.120

somewhat parametric the bone really is

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:04.130
somewhat parametric the bone really is
 

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.720
somewhat parametric the bone really is
not so we're continuing that research to

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:07.730
not so we're continuing that research to
 

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.360
not so we're continuing that research to

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:10.370
based on curvature to try to find some
 

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.250
based on curvature to try to find some
features that from which we can

determine what are the parameters to a
 

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.290
determine what are the parameters to a
tibia and hence the rest of the skeleton

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:17.300
tibia and hence the rest of the skeleton
 

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.930
tibia and hence the rest of the skeleton
and then eventually organs and

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:19.940
and then eventually organs and
 

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.920
and then eventually organs and
everything else in terms of again

and then we also bought a pile of these

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:32.630
and then we also bought a pile of these
 

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.829
and then we also bought a pile of these
little sensors called fidgets and we're

and so he's going to help us with that

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480
and so he's going to help us with that
 

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.370
and so he's going to help us with that

part of all of this is beyond the
 

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.840
part of all of this is beyond the
physics of the the input of the Sun or

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:44.850
physics of the the input of the Sun or
 

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.750

in the human it's just difficult we
really have explicit control because we

00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440
really have explicit control because we
 

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.830
really have explicit control because we
decide what we're going to do but in

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840
decide what we're going to do but in
 

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.200
decide what we're going to do but in
architecture we have an opportunity to

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:03.210
architecture we have an opportunity to
 

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.150
architecture we have an opportunity to
create like a natural system like a tree

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.160
create like a natural system like a tree
 

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.740

there's no control system in the tree

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:06.750
there's no control system in the tree
 

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.660
there's no control system in the tree
tree just grows and gets better over

building got better over time too if it

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200
building got better over time too if it
 

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.720
building got better over time too if it
didn't get worse over time right now

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:14.730
didn't get worse over time right now
 

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.880
didn't get worse over time right now
most buildings they're there and then

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:16.890
most buildings they're there and then
 

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.130
most buildings they're there and then
they just get worse over time but if we

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:19.140
they just get worse over time but if we
 

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.020
they just get worse over time but if we
could design implicit control into the

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:21.030
could design implicit control into the
 

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.700
could design implicit control into the
building into the actual geometry into

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:22.710
building into the actual geometry into
 

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.310
building into the actual geometry into
the system through thermal massing and

the system through thermal massing and
 

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.220
the system through thermal massing and
natural ventilation techniques then you

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:28.230
natural ventilation techniques then you
 

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.660
natural ventilation techniques then you
wouldn't need a control system it would

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:29.670
wouldn't need a control system it would
 

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.340
wouldn't need a control system it would
be right there in the building itself

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:31.350
be right there in the building itself
 

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:51.680
be right there in the building itself
and that is I believe money 15 thank you

00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:24.609
the reading writing phase of drawing so
 

00:36:24.609 --> 00:36:25.560
the reading writing phase of drawing so
I would say if you're going to take

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:25.570
I would say if you're going to take
 

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:28.140
I would say if you're going to take
anything away from you now from this

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:28.150
anything away from you now from this
 

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.329
anything away from you now from this
talk it would be to think about how

00:36:30.329 --> 00:36:30.339
talk it would be to think about how
 

00:36:30.339 --> 00:36:32.339
talk it would be to think about how
you're using drawing and how you might

00:36:32.339 --> 00:36:32.349
you're using drawing and how you might
 

00:36:32.349 --> 00:36:34.620
you're using drawing and how you might
be using drawing in some futuristic

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:34.630
be using drawing in some futuristic
 

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.030
be using drawing in some futuristic
world and those are going to be really

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.040
world and those are going to be really
 

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.920
world and those are going to be really
hard problems and we're just starting to

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:37.930
hard problems and we're just starting to
 

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:39.839
hard problems and we're just starting to
work on the mouth in our under-the-radar

00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:39.849
work on the mouth in our under-the-radar
 

00:36:39.849 --> 00:36:42.000

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760
years ago what would you use any idea
 

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.650

well here's a camera that did it for you

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:57.660
well here's a camera that did it for you
 

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:02.130
well here's a camera that did it for you
it weighed 1400 pounds so about 12 feet

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:02.140
it weighed 1400 pounds so about 12 feet
 

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.100
it weighed 1400 pounds so about 12 feet
long and it took about 15 people to

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:05.110
long and it took about 15 people to
 

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:07.770
long and it took about 15 people to
operate so the point that I'm trying to

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:07.780
operate so the point that I'm trying to
 

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.450
operate so the point that I'm trying to
make is that the evolution of the camera

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:09.460
make is that the evolution of the camera
 

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:12.180
make is that the evolution of the camera
in the last hundred years has been truly

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:12.190
in the last hundred years has been truly
 

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:15.960
in the last hundred years has been truly
remarkable on the other hand was also

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:15.970
remarkable on the other hand was also
 

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:18.480
remarkable on the other hand was also
fascinating is that the fundamental

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:18.490
fascinating is that the fundamental
 

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:20.940
fascinating is that the fundamental
model underlying the camera has remained

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:20.950
model underlying the camera has remained
 

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:23.490
model underlying the camera has remained
essentially the same which is the camera

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:23.500
essentially the same which is the camera
 

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.680
essentially the same which is the camera
obscura or what we refer to as the

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:25.690
obscura or what we refer to as the
 

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:28.770
obscura or what we refer to as the
pinhole camera model so that's what we

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:28.780
pinhole camera model so that's what we
 

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.150
pinhole camera model so that's what we
call the traditional camera the

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160
call the traditional camera the
 

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.910
call the traditional camera the
traditional camera uses a detector or

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:32.920
traditional camera uses a detector or
 

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.840
traditional camera uses a detector or
some sort and a lens and this lens is

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:36.850
some sort and a lens and this lens is
 

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:39.390
some sort and a lens and this lens is
what we refer to in computer vision as a

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.400
what we refer to in computer vision as a
 

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.390
what we refer to in computer vision as a
perspective lens and it essentially

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400
perspective lens and it essentially
 

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.910
perspective lens and it essentially
captures or accepts those rays of light

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:44.920
captures or accepts those rays of light
 

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.700
captures or accepts those rays of light
that pass through the effective pin hole

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:47.710
that pass through the effective pin hole
 

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:49.890
that pass through the effective pin hole
or the center of projection of the lens

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:49.900
or the center of projection of the lens
 

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.260
or the center of projection of the lens
to produce your familiar linear

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:52.270
to produce your familiar linear
 

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:54.810
to produce your familiar linear
perspective image so let's just think

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:54.820
perspective image so let's just think
 

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.330
perspective image so let's just think
about this for a second if you consider

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:57.340
about this for a second if you consider
 

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.920
about this for a second if you consider
this room right here you have an

00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:58.930
this room right here you have an
 

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:01.050
this room right here you have an
infinite number of light rays bouncing

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:01.060
infinite number of light rays bouncing
 

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.450
infinite number of light rays bouncing
around this is what we refer to as the

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:03.460
around this is what we refer to as the
 

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.550
around this is what we refer to as the
light field associated with this space

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560
light field associated with this space
 

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.100
light field associated with this space
it's actually a high-order entity a

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:08.110
it's actually a high-order entity a
 

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:10.650
it's actually a high-order entity a
high-dimensional entity and what the

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:10.660
high-dimensional entity and what the
 

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.630
high-dimensional entity and what the
traditional camera does is that it

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640
traditional camera does is that it
 

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.910
traditional camera does is that it
performs a very simple and restrictive

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920
performs a very simple and restrictive
 

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.670
performs a very simple and restrictive
sampling of this very complex light

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680
sampling of this very complex light
 

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.100
sampling of this very complex light
field that is from this infinite set of

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:20.110
field that is from this infinite set of
 

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:22.590
field that is from this infinite set of
light rays it accepts the only those

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:22.600
light rays it accepts the only those
 

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.740
light rays it accepts the only those
rays of light that

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:23.750
rays of light that
 

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:25.870
rays of light that
from the effective control of the camera

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880
from the effective control of the camera
 

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.480
from the effective control of the camera
so the point I'm trying to make is that

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:28.490
so the point I'm trying to make is that
 

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:31.570
so the point I'm trying to make is that
if you somehow manage to map seen raised

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:31.580
if you somehow manage to map seen raised
 

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.190
if you somehow manage to map seen raised
two pixels in some unconventional

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200
two pixels in some unconventional
 

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.190
two pixels in some unconventional
fashion maybe we can capture new types

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.200
fashion maybe we can capture new types
 

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.530
fashion maybe we can capture new types
of pictures and that's really the

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:38.540
of pictures and that's really the
 

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:40.300
of pictures and that's really the
motivation behind the computational

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:40.310
motivation behind the computational
 

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:44.380
motivation behind the computational
camera which uses new optics to map seen

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:44.390
camera which uses new optics to map seen
 

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:46.390
camera which uses new optics to map seen
raised two pixels in some unconventional

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400
raised two pixels in some unconventional
 

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.150
raised two pixels in some unconventional
fashion so here I'm showing this yellow

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:49.160
fashion so here I'm showing this yellow
 

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.440
fashion so here I'm showing this yellow
ray which should have gone all the way

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:50.450
ray which should have gone all the way
 

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:52.690
ray which should have gone all the way
down to the bottom of the detector but

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:52.700
down to the bottom of the detector but
 

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.500
down to the bottom of the detector but
it's been redirected to this pixel and

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:55.510
it's been redirected to this pixel and
 

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:59.170
it's been redirected to this pixel and
it came in as being a yellow ray but

00:41:59.170 --> 00:41:59.180
it came in as being a yellow ray but
 

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.390
it came in as being a yellow ray but
it's been altered to a red red before it

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:01.400
it's been altered to a red red before it
 

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.910
it's been altered to a red red before it
arrives in the pixel so in all cases the

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920
arrives in the pixel so in all cases the
 

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.760
arrives in the pixel so in all cases the
computational camera uses optics that

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:06.770
computational camera uses optics that
 

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:09.130
computational camera uses optics that
captures or producers and optically

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:09.140
captures or producers and optically
 

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.800
captures or producers and optically
coded image and the coding is done in

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:11.810
coded image and the coding is done in
 

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.350
coded image and the coding is done in
some meaningful fashion and that's where

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:14.360
some meaningful fashion and that's where
 

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.780
some meaningful fashion and that's where
the computational module comes in it

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:16.790
the computational module comes in it
 

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:18.790
the computational module comes in it
knows everything it needs to about the

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800
knows everything it needs to about the
 

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.700
knows everything it needs to about the
optics and this pepper is able to

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:20.710
optics and this pepper is able to
 

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:23.650
optics and this pepper is able to
computationally decode the image after

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:23.660
computationally decode the image after
 

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.320
computationally decode the image after
the fact after capture to produce

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:26.330
the fact after capture to produce
 

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.470
the fact after capture to produce
hopefully a new type of image so it's

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:29.480
hopefully a new type of image so it's
 

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.420
hopefully a new type of image so it's

i want to show you are just a couple of
 

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.990
i want to show you are just a couple of
examples of computational families so

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:41.000
examples of computational families so
 

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.630
examples of computational families so
here's one that allows you to capture a

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640
here's one that allows you to capture a
 

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.210
here's one that allows you to capture a
very large field of view we can all

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:46.220
very large field of view we can all
 

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:47.560
very large field of view we can all
agree that it's somehow if you can

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:47.570
agree that it's somehow if you can
 

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:50.200
agree that it's somehow if you can
capture the entire sphere around the

capture the entire sphere around the
 

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:51.940
capture the entire sphere around the
point that would have profound

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:51.950
point that would have profound
 

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:54.220
point that would have profound
implications not only for computer

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:54.230
implications not only for computer
 

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.050
implications not only for computer
vision but for a wide variety of

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:56.060
vision but for a wide variety of
 

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.510
vision but for a wide variety of
applications so here is a very early

00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:58.520
applications so here is a very early
 

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.580

close to the ground level you're able to

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400
close to the ground level you're able to
 

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.809
close to the ground level you're able to
capture the sky which is well above the

thing to note is that the image is

00:43:55.179 --> 00:43:55.189
thing to note is that the image is
 

00:43:55.189 --> 00:43:58.380
thing to note is that the image is
distorted or from our perspective it's

00:43:58.380 --> 00:43:58.390
distorted or from our perspective it's
 

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:01.870
distorted or from our perspective it's
optically coded and since we have

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880
optically coded and since we have
 

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.779
optically coded and since we have
satisfied some conditions in designing

the space exactly the same thing can be

00:44:18.999 --> 00:44:19.009
the space exactly the same thing can be
 

00:44:19.009 --> 00:44:20.920
the space exactly the same thing can be
done by using an array of cameras and

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:20.930
done by using an array of cameras and
 

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:22.630
done by using an array of cameras and
stitching the pictures together which is

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640
stitching the pictures together which is
 

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.759
stitching the pictures together which is
a very common practice but here we are

00:44:24.759 --> 00:44:24.769
a very common practice but here we are
 

00:44:24.769 --> 00:44:26.529
a very common practice but here we are

mirror let's take a look at what you can

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:51.270
mirror let's take a look at what you can
 

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:53.150
mirror let's take a look at what you can
do with a concave mirror so in this case

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160
do with a concave mirror so in this case
 

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.240
do with a concave mirror so in this case
you have an SLR camera placed in front

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:56.250
you have an SLR camera placed in front
 

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:59.000
you have an SLR camera placed in front
of it this time is a hollow cone that's

00:45:59.000 --> 00:45:59.010
of it this time is a hollow cone that's

an interesting thing happens if you're

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:03.540
an interesting thing happens if you're
 

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:06.410
an interesting thing happens if you're
looking at one point in the scene then

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.420
looking at one point in the scene then
 

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:07.910
looking at one point in the scene then
that point of course gets captured

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920
that point of course gets captured
 

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.820
that point of course gets captured
directly by the the lens of the camera

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:10.830
directly by the the lens of the camera
 

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:13.010
directly by the the lens of the camera
because it's a whole of corn but it

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020
because it's a whole of corn but it
 

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.170
because it's a whole of corn but it
turns out that it gets captured exactly

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:15.180
turns out that it gets captured exactly
 

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:18.200
turns out that it gets captured exactly
two more times via reflections by the

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:18.210
two more times via reflections by the
 

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:21.110
two more times via reflections by the

each point in the scene is captured

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:23.100
each point in the scene is captured
 

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:26.510
each point in the scene is captured
three times but in the same image but

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520
three times but in the same image but
 

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.790
three times but in the same image but
seen from three different viewpoints you

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800
seen from three different viewpoints you
 

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.530
seen from three different viewpoints you
see what I'm saying so you take this

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:30.540
see what I'm saying so you take this
 

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.680
see what I'm saying so you take this
contraption and if you point it at an

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:32.690
contraption and if you point it at an
 

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:35.390
contraption and if you point it at an
object for example a face in this case

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400
object for example a face in this case
 

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.660
object for example a face in this case
you get an image that looks like this in

you would love to do exactly the same

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:28.930
you would love to do exactly the same

here you have a chip this is your CCC CD

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:47.290
here you have a chip this is your CCC CD
 

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:49.560
here you have a chip this is your CCC CD
or CMOS chip that's sitting inside your

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:49.570
or CMOS chip that's sitting inside your
 

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:52.170
or CMOS chip that's sitting inside your
digital still camera and in any said

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:52.180
digital still camera and in any said
 

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:54.330
digital still camera and in any said
chip all pixels on the chip are made

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:54.340
chip all pixels on the chip are made
 

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:57.000
chip all pixels on the chip are made
equal in terms of sensitivity and so you

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:57.010
equal in terms of sensitivity and so you
 

00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:59.070
equal in terms of sensitivity and so you
could have a huge part of the sky washed

00:49:59.070 --> 00:49:59.080
could have a huge part of the sky washed
 

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.500
could have a huge part of the sky washed
out or you could have a huge part of the

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:01.510
out or you could have a huge part of the
 

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:03.630
out or you could have a huge part of the
person too dark and once this

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:03.640
person too dark and once this
 

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.700
person too dark and once this
information is lie lost you simply

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:05.710
information is lie lost you simply
 

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:08.520
information is lie lost you simply
cannot recover you can maybe you can

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:08.530
cannot recover you can maybe you can
 

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:09.870
cannot recover you can maybe you can
have this innate it but you can't

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:09.880
have this innate it but you can't
 

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.380
have this innate it but you can't
recover the real information so the idea

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:13.390
recover the real information so the idea
 

00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:16.470
recover the real information so the idea
is to create a chip with unequal pixels

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480
is to create a chip with unequal pixels
 

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.840
is to create a chip with unequal pixels
and one way to do it there are many

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:18.850
and one way to do it there are many
 

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:20.490
and one way to do it there are many
different ways to do this but one way to

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:20.500
different ways to do this but one way to
 

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.460
different ways to do this but one way to
do it is to place on top of the chip and

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:23.470
do it is to place on top of the chip and
 

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:25.920
do it is to place on top of the chip and
optical mask think about sun shades of

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:25.930
optical mask think about sun shades of
 

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:28.740
optical mask think about sun shades of
different transmittances or different

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:28.750
different transmittances or different
 

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:31.590
different transmittances or different
levels of darkness so here you see that

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:31.600
levels of darkness so here you see that
 

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:32.640
levels of darkness so here you see that
you have the sort of checkerboard

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:32.650
you have the sort of checkerboard
 

00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:35.610
you have the sort of checkerboard
pattern of sun shades and so now if you

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:35.620
pattern of sun shades and so now if you
 

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:37.950
pattern of sun shades and so now if you
have a pixel that's washed out too

00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:37.960
have a pixel that's washed out too
 

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:40.350
have a pixel that's washed out too
bright you likely have a neighbor that's

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:40.360
bright you likely have a neighbor that's

putting things together it's for kids to
put these pieces together and as you put

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:53.330
put these pieces together and as you put
 

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:55.240
put these pieces together and as you put
these pieces together for example it has

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:55.250
these pieces together for example it has

me as a furniture maker frequently think

01:05:59.039 --> 01:05:59.049
me as a furniture maker frequently think
 

01:05:59.049 --> 01:06:01.739
me as a furniture maker frequently think
about how designers actually connected

01:06:01.739 --> 01:06:01.749
about how designers actually connected
 

01:06:01.749 --> 01:06:03.420
about how designers actually connected
with their tools I mean whether their

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:03.430
with their tools I mean whether their
 

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:05.339
with their tools I mean whether their
interaction designers whether they're

01:06:05.339 --> 01:06:05.349

like frequently faced with the dilemma

01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720
like frequently faced with the dilemma
 

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.359
like frequently faced with the dilemma
is that do you build like a very

01:06:12.359 --> 01:06:12.369
is that do you build like a very
 

01:06:12.369 --> 01:06:14.700
is that do you build like a very
specialized tool like a chisel or like a

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:14.710
specialized tool like a chisel or like a
 

01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:16.559
specialized tool like a chisel or like a
very generalized tool like something

01:06:16.559 --> 01:06:16.569
very generalized tool like something
 

01:06:16.569 --> 01:06:19.259
very generalized tool like something
like this right and oh no so like what

01:06:19.259 --> 01:06:19.269
like this right and oh no so like what
 

01:06:19.269 --> 01:06:21.180
like this right and oh no so like what
happens if you build the generals too I

01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:21.190
happens if you build the generals too I
 

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:23.940
happens if you build the generals too I
mean what are the kinds of other tools

01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:23.950
mean what are the kinds of other tools
 

01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:26.789
mean what are the kinds of other tools
like rings right like this one here that

01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:26.799
like rings right like this one here that
 

01:06:26.799 --> 01:06:29.009
like rings right like this one here that
can like further push the tool from what

01:06:29.009 --> 01:06:29.019
can like further push the tool from what

actually ensure that the kinds of tools
 

01:08:39.610 --> 01:08:43.440
actually ensure that the kinds of tools
were doing are actually going to be more

that you can do it and then at this

01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:07.100
that you can do it and then at this
 

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:09.030
that you can do it and then at this
point you're ready to start designing

01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040
point you're ready to start designing
 

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.100
point you're ready to start designing
you still are not designing so what you

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:12.110
you still are not designing so what you
 

01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:13.870
you still are not designing so what you
do is you generate concept sketches this

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:13.880
do is you generate concept sketches this
 

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.910
do is you generate concept sketches this
is more probably like familiar to like

01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920
is more probably like familiar to like
 

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.260
is more probably like familiar to like

user research is just like you know this

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:35.000
user research is just like you know this
 

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.910
user research is just like you know this
part here you also are looking at what

01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920
part here you also are looking at what
 

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:38.320
part here you also are looking at what
is the current state of the stock for

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:38.330

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:41.390
how far can you push it with the idea
 

01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:43.330
how far can you push it with the idea
that you have had any other colleagues

01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:43.340
that you have had any other colleagues
 

01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:45.190
that you have had any other colleagues
done any work and also what are the

01:11:45.190 --> 01:11:45.200
done any work and also what are the
 

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:48.400

what we do next is may we make a lot of

01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960
what we do next is may we make a lot of
 

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:55.960
what we do next is may we make a lot of
paper prototypes the thing is that you

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:55.970
paper prototypes the thing is that you
 

01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:58.180
paper prototypes the thing is that you
can push paper prototypes only so far

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:58.190
can push paper prototypes only so far
 

01:11:58.190 --> 01:12:00.340

I'm either really not interactive enough

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:00.350
I'm either really not interactive enough
 

01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:02.470
I'm either really not interactive enough
but then when you are dealing with

01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480
but then when you are dealing with
 

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.120
but then when you are dealing with
interactive prototypes here's the

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:04.130
interactive prototypes here's the
 

01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:07.380
interactive prototypes here's the
dilemma this is like I've ever 2009 um

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:07.390
dilemma this is like I've ever 2009 um

time we were going through a major
redesign of the user interface which

01:12:14.650 --> 01:12:14.660
redesign of the user interface which
 

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:16.840
redesign of the user interface which
actually means that you can start

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:16.850
actually means that you can start
 

01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:18.850
actually means that you can start
understanding how many icons are there

01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:18.860
understanding how many icons are there
 

01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:20.560

so if you're going to be like working

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:20.570
so if you're going to be like working
 

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:22.420
so if you're going to be like working
with people that only you want to focus

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:22.430
with people that only you want to focus
 

01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:25.060
with people that only you want to focus
their attention on the conceptual design

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:25.070
their attention on the conceptual design
 

01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:27.250
their attention on the conceptual design

know rabbit I mean how do you you know

01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:29.180
know rabbit I mean how do you you know
 

01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:31.180
know rabbit I mean how do you you know
like masters I mean the number of

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:31.190
like masters I mean the number of
 

01:12:31.190 --> 01:12:32.560
like masters I mean the number of
commands you can think actually is the

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:32.570
commands you can think actually is the
 

01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:34.420
commands you can think actually is the
number of workflows and interactions and

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:34.430
number of workflows and interactions and
 

01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:35.920
number of workflows and interactions and
so please accept this is not all of the

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:35.930
so please accept this is not all of the
 

01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:37.120
so please accept this is not all of the
commands I mean this is what we're

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:37.130
commands I mean this is what we're
 

01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:39.520
commands I mean this is what we're
actually talking these are the number of

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:39.530
actually talking these are the number of
 

01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:40.990
actually talking these are the number of
commands that actually showed up and

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.000
commands that actually showed up and
 

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.730
commands that actually showed up and
what we started doing is we realized

01:12:42.730 --> 01:12:42.740
what we started doing is we realized
 

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:44.860
what we started doing is we realized
that we ought to simplify the user

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:44.870
that we ought to simplify the user
 

01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:46.570
that we ought to simplify the user
interface in order to be able to put it

01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:46.580
interface in order to be able to put it
 

01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:48.490
interface in order to be able to put it
in front of people who are going to be

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:48.500
in front of people who are going to be
 

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.560
in front of people who are going to be
focusing only on the conceptual design

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:50.570
focusing only on the conceptual design
 

01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:52.720
focusing only on the conceptual design
tasks and not on everything else and

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:52.730
tasks and not on everything else and
 

01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:54.940
tasks and not on everything else and
this is what we found actually we need

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:54.950
this is what we found actually we need
 

01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:57.790
this is what we found actually we need
and we arrived at this point by pretty

01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:57.800
and we arrived at this point by pretty
 

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.260
and we arrived at this point by pretty
much like outlining workflows for

01:12:59.260 --> 01:12:59.270
much like outlining workflows for
 

01:12:59.270 --> 01:13:02.110
much like outlining workflows for
example I want to make a cube right I

01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:02.120
example I want to make a cube right I
 

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:05.200
example I want to make a cube right I
want to like add parameters I maybe want

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:05.210
want to like add parameters I maybe want
 

01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:07.150
want to like add parameters I maybe want
to rationalize one side I want to like

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:07.160
to rationalize one side I want to like
 

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.640
to rationalize one side I want to like
good so we had like a whole log of

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:09.650
good so we had like a whole log of
 

01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:12.040
good so we had like a whole log of
workloads that actually helped us arrive

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:12.050
workloads that actually helped us arrive
 

01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:14.920
workloads that actually helped us arrive
to this that translated to this

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:14.930
to this that translated to this
 

01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:18.880
to this that translated to this
particular example the universe or

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:18.890
particular example the universe or
 

01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:20.680
particular example the universe or
interface that we took two people that

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:20.690
interface that we took two people that
 

01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:22.630
interface that we took two people that
were not familiar with rabbit and they

01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:22.640
were not familiar with rabbit and they
 

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.180
were not familiar with rabbit and they
were able to actually test this this is

01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:25.190
were able to actually test this this is
 

01:13:25.190 --> 01:13:27.850
were able to actually test this this is
the first prototype with a variable that

01:13:27.850 --> 01:13:27.860
the first prototype with a variable that
 

01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:29.800
the first prototype with a variable that
we made ourselves and then I don't need

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:29.810
we made ourselves and then I don't need
 

01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:32.200
we made ourselves and then I don't need
to go more into this but at this point

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:32.210
to go more into this but at this point
 

01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:33.090
to go more into this but at this point
on which is

01:13:33.090 --> 01:13:33.100
on which is
 

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:36.810
on which is
soon we were only six seven months in

01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:36.820
soon we were only six seven months in
 

01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:39.180
soon we were only six seven months in
the project and the first release which

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:39.190
the project and the first release which
 

01:13:39.190 --> 01:13:43.170
the project and the first release which
was the next early next spring Wars was

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:43.180
was the next early next spring Wars was
 

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:45.180
was the next early next spring Wars was
the work that we actually did in this

01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:45.190
the work that we actually did in this
 

01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:49.590
the work that we actually did in this
part of the project so while that was an

01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600
part of the project so while that was an
 

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:52.590
part of the project so while that was an
example of how we do work like release /

01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:52.600
example of how we do work like release /
 

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.120
example of how we do work like release /
release I mean the second part of the

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:54.130
release I mean the second part of the
 

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:55.500
release I mean the second part of the
presentation will be hard to actually

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:55.510
presentation will be hard to actually
 

01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:58.110
presentation will be hard to actually
like think I mean then actually research

01:13:58.110 --> 01:13:58.120
like think I mean then actually research
 

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.930
like think I mean then actually research
for what may happen after this is that

01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:00.940
for what may happen after this is that
 

01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:03.060
for what may happen after this is that
what happens like in 10 years so in the

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:03.070
what happens like in 10 years so in the
 

01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:05.010
what happens like in 10 years so in the
top part what you see oh it looks much

01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:05.020
top part what you see oh it looks much
 

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:06.780
top part what you see oh it looks much
better on my screen and their story is

01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:06.790
better on my screen and their story is
 

01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:09.210
better on my screen and their story is
that this is the short term so we work

01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:09.220
that this is the short term so we work
 

01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:12.000
that this is the short term so we work
like a by release cycle so we released

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:12.010
like a by release cycle so we released
 

01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.520
like a by release cycle so we released
the software once a year and the opera

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:14.530
the software once a year and the opera
 

01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:16.220
the software once a year and the opera
charge actually shows like this is like

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:16.230
charge actually shows like this is like
 

01:14:16.230 --> 01:14:19.290
charge actually shows like this is like
September gent october november december

01:14:19.290 --> 01:14:19.300
September gent october november december
 

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.810
September gent october november december
these are the months here and usually we

01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:21.820
these are the months here and usually we
 

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.820
these are the months here and usually we
do like requirements analysis like

01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:23.830
do like requirements analysis like
 

01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:25.620
do like requirements analysis like
understand what's happening at this time

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:25.630
understand what's happening at this time
 

01:14:25.630 --> 01:14:28.800

of the year a research you know like

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:28.810
of the year a research you know like
 

01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:30.750
of the year a research you know like
scope definition conceptual design the

scope definition conceptual design the
kinds of things that i told you about

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:32.290
kinds of things that i told you about
 

01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:34.860
kinds of things that i told you about
and i refer to that processes the

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:34.870
and i refer to that processes the
 

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:36.510
and i refer to that processes the
harvest processed except that our

01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:36.520
harvest processed except that our
 

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:39.450
harvest processed except that our
harvest is about nine months it's really

01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:39.460
harvest is about nine months it's really
 

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.490
harvest is about nine months it's really
very long but then what we started doing

01:14:41.490 --> 01:14:41.500
very long but then what we started doing
 

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:43.770
very long but then what we started doing
like exactly like this time

01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:43.780
like exactly like this time
 

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:45.900
like exactly like this time
approximately a year ago is like this

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:45.910
approximately a year ago is like this
 

01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:48.090
approximately a year ago is like this
exercise which we call beam futures and

01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:48.100
exercise which we call beam futures and
 

01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:51.890
exercise which we call beam futures and
the goal was that we engage with

01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:51.900
the goal was that we engage with
 

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:54.090
the goal was that we engage with
colleagues both colleagues and people

01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:54.100
colleagues both colleagues and people
 

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:56.100
colleagues both colleagues and people
that our end users whether their

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:56.110
that our end users whether their
 

01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:58.740
that our end users whether their
customers in architecture offices and so

01:14:58.740 --> 01:14:58.750
customers in architecture offices and so
 

01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:01.860
customers in architecture offices and so
forth or people in academia and we start

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:01.870
forth or people in academia and we start
 

01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:04.410
forth or people in academia and we start
asking them three questions and these

01:15:04.410 --> 01:15:04.420
asking them three questions and these
 

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:08.640
asking them three questions and these
questions are what is the core then what

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:08.650
questions are what is the core then what
 

01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:11.130
questions are what is the core then what
are the global trends that influence the

01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:11.140
are the global trends that influence the
 

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.020
are the global trends that influence the
architecture engineering and

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:13.030
architecture engineering and
 

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:14.970
architecture engineering and
construction industry and the third one

01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:14.980
construction industry and the third one
 

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:16.950
construction industry and the third one
is what do you think the architecture

01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960
is what do you think the architecture
 

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.090
is what do you think the architecture
engineering and construction in the

01:15:18.090 --> 01:15:18.100
engineering and construction in the
 

01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.460
engineering and construction in the
sphere like aacsb code is going to look

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:20.470
sphere like aacsb code is going to look
 

01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:22.380
sphere like aacsb code is going to look
like 10 years from now just like these

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:22.390
like 10 years from now just like these
 

01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:24.750
like 10 years from now just like these
three questions so we went all a bunch

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:24.760
three questions so we went all a bunch
 

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.340
three questions so we went all a bunch
of like him to design so we have the

01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:26.350
of like him to design so we have the
 

01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:28.440
of like him to design so we have the
numbers here and they're pretty crazy

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:28.450
numbers here and they're pretty crazy
 

01:15:28.450 --> 01:15:31.170
numbers here and they're pretty crazy
rear end I think actually I have a map

01:15:31.170 --> 01:15:31.180
rear end I think actually I have a map
 

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:33.830
rear end I think actually I have a map
uh-huh so this is not how we do like

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840
uh-huh so this is not how we do like
 

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:36.960
uh-huh so this is not how we do like
long-term use research this is also not

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:36.970
long-term use research this is also not
 

01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:38.730
long-term use research this is also not
cow how you do it but we almost do it

01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:38.740
cow how you do it but we almost do it
 

01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.380
cow how you do it but we almost do it
like this because we do it with cards

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:40.390
like this because we do it with cards
 

01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:43.050
like this because we do it with cards
and have the cards here right and it's a

01:15:43.050 --> 01:15:43.060
and have the cards here right and it's a
 

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:43.950
and have the cards here right and it's a
user

01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:43.960
user
 

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.720
user
methods which is fairly well known in

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:45.730
methods which is fairly well known in
 

01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:47.520
methods which is fairly well known in
the interaction design community has not

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:47.530
the interaction design community has not
 

01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:49.860
the interaction design community has not
been done in architecture very much so

01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:49.870
been done in architecture very much so
 

01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:51.390
been done in architecture very much so
this was the first you know the

01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:51.400
this was the first you know the
 

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.310
this was the first you know the
iteration of the cards in which were

01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:53.320
iteration of the cards in which were
 

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.880
iteration of the cards in which were
using very autodist centric thing this

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:56.890
using very autodist centric thing this
 

01:15:56.890 --> 01:15:59.130
using very autodist centric thing this
is the last iteration of the cards so we

01:15:59.130 --> 01:15:59.140
is the last iteration of the cards so we
 

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:01.950
is the last iteration of the cards so we
have this blue cards which we call theme

01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:01.960
have this blue cards which we call theme
 

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.350
have this blue cards which we call theme
cards and then this red cards which are

01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.360
cards and then this red cards which are
 

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.180
cards and then this red cards which are
trans card and explain like how they're

trans card and explain like how they're
 

01:16:06.190 --> 01:16:08.220
trans card and explain like how they're
being done and we have arrived at the

01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:08.230
being done and we have arrived at the
 

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.080
being done and we have arrived at the
point with approximately twenty-two

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:10.090
point with approximately twenty-two
 

01:16:10.090 --> 01:16:12.270

interviews with 29 participants we have

01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:12.280
interviews with 29 participants we have
 

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:15.300

the cards to a point that we have

01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:17.230
the cards to a point that we have
 

01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:19.110
the cards to a point that we have
actually added cards like this one like

01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120
actually added cards like this one like
 

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.420
actually added cards like this one like
life cycle for example and we have also

01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:21.430
life cycle for example and we have also
 

01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:23.790
life cycle for example and we have also
removed cards and we have made them

01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:23.800
removed cards and we have made them
 

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.400
removed cards and we have made them
completely productive Gnostic so we were

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:26.410
completely productive Gnostic so we were
 

01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:27.840
completely productive Gnostic so we were
able to interview people that have

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:27.850
able to interview people that have
 

01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:29.610

at like Autodesk University we also

01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:01.670
at like Autodesk University we also
 

01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:03.759
at like Autodesk University we also
developed a magnetic version of the

remote interviews so here is one in our

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:17.210
remote interviews so here is one in our
 

01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:20.500
remote interviews so here is one in our
telepresence room so you actually see

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:20.510
telepresence room so you actually see
 

01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:22.359
telepresence room so you actually see
the person and you just look Randy

01:18:22.359 --> 01:18:22.369
the person and you just look Randy
 

01:18:22.369 --> 01:18:25.600
the person and you just look Randy
interview as well and this generated a

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:25.610
interview as well and this generated a
 

01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:28.000
interview as well and this generated a
ton of data so I'll just go through what

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:28.010
ton of data so I'll just go through what
 

01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:29.770

your school or design school maybe to
 

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:08.990
your school or design school maybe to
build a little bit of that line of

01:32:12.109 --> 01:32:12.119
thinking I'm curious if if any of you
 

01:32:12.119 --> 01:32:14.990

have thoughts about collaboration which

01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000
have thoughts about collaboration which
 

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.709
have thoughts about collaboration which
has become a topic that I think Columbia

01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719
has become a topic that I think Columbia
 

01:32:18.719 --> 01:32:20.390

address more and more and it strikes me

01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:25.500
address more and more and it strikes me
 

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.919
address more and more and it strikes me
that there's there's examples of

01:32:27.919 --> 01:32:27.929
that there's there's examples of
 

01:32:27.929 --> 01:32:30.109
that there's there's examples of
collaboration within the development of

on the level of tool for example it's

01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:49.550
on the level of tool for example it's

but that some sort of specific approach
 

01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:57.220
but that some sort of specific approach
to the tool ended up changing the

and how you sort of designed to use that
 

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:05.320

they don't remember the first one have a
 

01:37:43.670 --> 01:37:46.570
they don't remember the first one have a
very short term memory so as in terms of

01:37:46.570 --> 01:37:46.580
very short term memory so as in terms of
 

01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:48.760
very short term memory so as in terms of
like what how we identified the work

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:48.770
like what how we identified the work
 

01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:51.460
like what how we identified the work
close to arrive to like the subset of

01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:51.470
close to arrive to like the subset of
 

01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:53.530
close to arrive to like the subset of
the tools we actually what we did is we

01:37:53.530 --> 01:37:53.540
the tools we actually what we did is we
 

01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:57.400
the tools we actually what we did is we
will in the interviews that we read with

01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:57.410
will in the interviews that we read with
 

01:37:57.410 --> 01:37:59.560
will in the interviews that we read with
the group that we call the teachers we

01:37:59.560 --> 01:37:59.570
the group that we call the teachers we
 

01:37:59.570 --> 01:38:02.290
the group that we call the teachers we
also got a lot of material like project

01:38:02.290 --> 01:38:02.300
also got a lot of material like project
 

01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:04.570
also got a lot of material like project
examples right so we would look at that

01:38:04.570 --> 01:38:04.580
examples right so we would look at that
 

01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:05.980
examples right so we would look at that
then we think okay this is the end

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:05.990
then we think okay this is the end
 

01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:08.620
then we think okay this is the end
product right and we have talked with

01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:08.630
product right and we have talked with
 

01:38:08.630 --> 01:38:10.960
product right and we have talked with
them we have isolated the faces in terms

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:10.970
them we have isolated the faces in terms
 

01:38:10.970 --> 01:38:12.490
them we have isolated the faces in terms
of like how they arrived to that product

01:38:12.490 --> 01:38:12.500
of like how they arrived to that product
 

01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:14.590
of like how they arrived to that product
so we actually I mean box was a very

01:38:14.590 --> 01:38:14.600
so we actually I mean box was a very
 

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.370
so we actually I mean box was a very
simple example that I

01:38:16.370 --> 01:38:16.380
simple example that I
 

01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:18.470
simple example that I
mentioned but we would look at like

01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480
mentioned but we would look at like
 

01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:20.689
mentioned but we would look at like
number of different end results you know

01:38:20.689 --> 01:38:20.699
number of different end results you know
 

01:38:20.699 --> 01:38:22.729

like reconstruct how they arrived there

01:38:22.729 --> 01:38:22.739
like reconstruct how they arrived there
 

01:38:22.739 --> 01:38:25.010
like reconstruct how they arrived there
and then go back and make those

01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:25.020
and then go back and make those
 

01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:27.140
and then go back and make those

the tool set that we identified is the

01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920
the tool set that we identified is the
 

01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:30.800
the tool set that we identified is the
one that needs to happen there there

visit a site like Disney or somebody and
you would sit down and you couldn't even

01:41:31.049 --> 01:41:31.059
you would sit down and you couldn't even
 

01:41:31.059 --> 01:41:32.549
you would sit down and you couldn't even
recognize that it was Maya because they

01:41:32.549 --> 01:41:32.559
recognize that it was Maya because they
 

01:41:32.559 --> 01:41:34.379

custom tools just remove one even one

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:40.570
custom tools just remove one even one
 

01:41:40.570 --> 01:41:42.000
custom tools just remove one even one
character or even one part of a

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:42.010
character or even one part of a
 

01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:44.160
character or even one part of a
character so that's in the long term

01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:44.170
character so that's in the long term
 

01:41:44.170 --> 01:41:45.779
character so that's in the long term
that's probably the trend little that'll

01:41:45.779 --> 01:41:45.789
that's probably the trend little that'll
 

01:41:45.789 --> 01:41:47.549
that's probably the trend little that'll

a couple of observations that I think
 

01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:28.229
a couple of observations that I think
are a little bit relevant although maybe

01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239
are a little bit relevant although maybe

worth noting in in this room you know to

01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:46.330
worth noting in in this room you know to
 

01:52:46.330 --> 01:52:48.720
worth noting in in this room you know to
it to a room of architects and people

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:48.730
it to a room of architects and people
 

01:52:48.730 --> 01:52:51.660
it to a room of architects and people
who think a lot about architecture which

01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:51.670
who think a lot about architecture which
 

01:52:51.670 --> 01:52:54.090

just came from a science conference and

01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520
just came from a science conference and
 

01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:01.260
just came from a science conference and
at this science conference almost all of

01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:01.270
at this science conference almost all of
 

01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:02.790
at this science conference almost all of
the presentations did something similar

01:53:02.790 --> 01:53:02.800
the presentations did something similar
 

01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:06.870
the presentations did something similar
to what Sri did which is show prior work

01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880
to what Sri did which is show prior work
 

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:09.419

than we often see in this room but
 

01:53:16.750 --> 01:53:18.660
than we often see in this room but
really build off of it and the the

01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:18.670
really build off of it and the the
 

01:53:18.670 --> 01:53:20.399
really build off of it and the the
