00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:22.110
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.190
Thoughts.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.499
Important concepts of the week?

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:25.540
AUDIENCE: Principal axes.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.520
PROFESSOR: Principal axes.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.020
Good one.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.770
Another one.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.706
AUDIENCE: Dynamic
versus static balances.

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:39.414
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.738
Another one.

00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:54.990
AUDIENCE: Symmetry.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.490
Symmetry.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.310
PROFESSOR: Symmetry.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.809
Right.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.100
This is in the context of things
like the mass moment of inertia

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.730
matrix.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.230
Yes?

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.605
AUDIENCE: Parallel axis theorem.

00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:10.980
PROFESSOR: Parallel
axis theorem.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.530
OK.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.280
We haven't done much
with it yet but we're

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.360
going to come back to it.

00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:26.800
All right.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.205
Pretty good list.

00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:28.204
We only had one lecture.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.632
Dynamic and static balancing.

00:01:33.632 --> 00:01:35.090
Let's talk about
that for a second.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.100
Let's talk about
static balancing.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.960
Tell me what are features
of static balancing?

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.700
How can you-- you
have a quiz problem,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.490
it's on the final-- you have an
object and an axis about which

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.770
its spinning and you're
asked, is this statically

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.570
balanced or not.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.570
What would you look for?

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.611
Christina.

00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:04.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.415
PROFESSOR: G needs to be--

00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:07.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] axis.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.920
PROFESSOR: So another way of
saying that is the axis must--

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.400
the axis of rotation
must pass through--

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.370
AUDIENCE: The center.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.530
PROFESSOR: --G. Is that
what you're trying to say?

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.140
The center of mass?

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.560
Everybody agree about that?

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.060
All right.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.650
Now, if I have
weird shaped object,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.820
I know where the
center of mass, and I

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.060
stick the axis of rotation at
any angle at all through it,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.280
is it statically
balance regardless

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.210
of where I have the
x-axis of rotation passing

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.612
through the center of mass?

00:02:39.612 --> 00:02:40.456
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:41.840
PROFESSOR: I hear a yes.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.860
How about the other people?

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.160
OK.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.740
So how do you-- I think
that's probably right.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.850
But how do you test it?

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.870
How do you test to see--
what's a simple test you

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.456
can form to see if something
is statically balanced?

00:02:54.456 --> 00:02:56.330
AUDIENCE: See if it goes
through a low point.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.038
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:02:57.038 --> 00:03:01.490
So you make the axis that
you're rotating about horizontal

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.720
and see if the thing
seeks a low point.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.430
Because if it does, it's
telling you that what

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.570
about the center of mass?

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.880
AUDIENCE: It's not
going through the--

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.430
PROFESSOR: It's not
going through the axis.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.471
To go to a low point, it
means the center of mass

00:03:15.471 --> 00:03:17.470
is somewhere below
the axis of spin.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.054
Right?

00:03:18.054 --> 00:03:19.970
But any axis at all, as
long as its through G,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.630
you are statically balanced.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.520
Dynamic balancing.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.060
What are the-- what would you
look for on an object to say

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.875
is this dynamically
balanced or not?

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:31.875
What kind of properties?

00:03:36.706 --> 00:03:38.622
AUDIENCE: There would
be no unbalanced torques

00:03:38.622 --> 00:03:41.590
if you decided to rotate it.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.990
PROFESSOR: So you're looking
for now unbalanced torques.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.766
AUDIENCE: Because I'm like if
it-- if the object is rotating

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:49.890
about the axis that
you have it on,

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:58.790
you won't need to supply an
extra torque to try and keep

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.447
it balanced.

00:04:00.447 --> 00:04:01.280
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.620
PROFESSOR: --pretty convincing.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.492
AUDIENCE: --the axis
it's rotating on.

00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:05.430
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.790
If you put in that
last caveat then

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.610
it's getting pretty correct.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.310
Can there be a torque on
it that's not balanced

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.646
and have it be
dynamically balanced?

00:04:14.646 --> 00:04:15.540
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.415
PROFESSOR: Which one?

00:04:18.706 --> 00:04:20.519
AUDIENCE: Within the
axis of rotation.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.030
PROFESSOR: If you have a torque
that's in the axis of spin

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.210
and around the axis of
rotation and that torque

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.755
will cause what to happen?

00:04:27.755 --> 00:04:29.030
AUDIENCE: Rotation.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.930
PROFESSOR: Cause the
rotation rate to?

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:31.320
AUDIENCE: Change.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.361
PROFESSOR: Change, right?

00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:35.330
That puts energy into the
system and accelerates it.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.390
And it's a torque that's in the
direction of spin that doesn't

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.700
cause dynamic imbalances.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.740
But a torque that is other
than in the direction of spin,

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.460
that's what a
dynamic imbalance is.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.470
So what are some other ways you
can say this in terms of things

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:58.330
like evidence of--
let's say I give you H

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.922
and I give you omega,
how can you just

00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:02.380
tell by looking at
those two thing?

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.755
I give you the angle of momentum
and I give you the spin,

00:05:04.755 --> 00:05:06.590
how can you tell
instantly whether or not

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.170
it is dynamically balanced?

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.078
AUDIENCE: If there--
each of the components

00:05:10.078 --> 00:05:11.510
in the same direction.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.928
PROFESSOR: So you're saying
if H and omega are in the--

00:05:16.928 --> 00:05:18.040
AUDIENCE: R line.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.790
PROFESSOR: A line.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.800
They just have to be parallel.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.465
If they're aligned, you do not
have any dynamic imbalance.

00:05:28.062 --> 00:05:28.770
That sound right?

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.555
Yeah?

00:05:29.555 --> 00:05:31.138
AUDIENCE: It doesn't
matter if they're

00:05:31.138 --> 00:05:32.617
parallel or
antiparallel, does it?

00:05:32.617 --> 00:05:34.325
PROFESSOR: You mean
just opposite senses?

00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:35.927
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:35.927 --> 00:05:37.885
PROFESSOR: I think that'd
be really hard to do.

00:05:37.885 --> 00:05:40.030
I don't know of
any-- I don't think

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.100
you can make that system that
has angular momentum that

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.980
is negative-- it's actually
opposite the direction

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.800
of the rotation rate.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.340
I don't think it-- I don't
think our universe supports

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.940
that physics.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.660
But anyway, in any case,
they're aligned, you're OK.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.520
All right?

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.900
Let's move on.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.987
So today we're
going actually just

00:06:09.987 --> 00:06:11.320
have you work a couple problems.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.000
And you really are going to work
in groups, and when you finish,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.916
one of the groups is
going to come up and fill

00:06:15.916 --> 00:06:18.370
in the blanks of the
answer to the problem

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.370
and we'll talk about it.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.300
And we're going to
work two problems.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.150
And they have to do
with things that spin.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:31.483
And as a quick review
just of information--

00:06:31.483 --> 00:06:32.465
I guess we can do this.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.475
So the problem is a simple one.

00:06:42.475 --> 00:06:44.530
It's basically this.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.150
And I decided to lubricate
it and it made the wood swell

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.966
and so now it won't spin at all.

00:06:50.966 --> 00:06:52.727
Actually, unless I
let the axis spin.

00:06:52.727 --> 00:06:53.810
So it's just this problem.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.830
The axis passes through
the center of mass

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.970
and it looks just like this.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:10.070
And I've got an x-axis aligned
with the axis of the rod.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.420
The Z is this way.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.000
And the spin is cap omega.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.890
And the mass moment
of inertia matrix

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.220
for this problem
about G-- and our axis

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.220
is passing through G-- so mass
moment of inertia matrix times

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.220
omega gives you H. So here's the
mass moment of inertia matrix.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.490
I claim is going to be diagonal.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.830
And the test of that, can
you tell me whether or not

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.520
I've chosen axes that, just
from symmetry, you know

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.060
will be principal axes?

00:07:45.425 --> 00:07:46.687
What do you think?

00:07:46.687 --> 00:07:49.104
AUDIENCE: Well, the rod is
circular now that [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:49.104 --> 00:07:49.770
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.939
So one axis-- that's an axis
of symmetry is down the shaft.

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:55.230
So that's guaranteed to be one.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.210
Have I chosen one like that?

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.335
And any other orthogonal
pair after that--

00:07:59.335 --> 00:08:01.860
doesn't matter which way I
orient them-- will also be.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.070
So I've got one up and
one into the board.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.340
So those are principal
axes for this object.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.020
So it's going to be diagonal.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.010
And in fact, it looks--
it's MR squared over 2,

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.970
ML squared over 12,
and ML squared over 12

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.710
when you work it out.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.320
And if you look up in the
book, most books for slen--

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.640
what they call
slender rods, will

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.986
say that this first term is 0.

00:08:25.986 --> 00:08:27.360
And that's because
they're saying

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.250
that L is a lot bigger than
R-- the radius of this thing.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.360
And so MR squared is
a pretty small number.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.450
So it's energy and
rotation spinning this way

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.860
is not very big for
its angular momentum.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.809
But its angular momentum
spinning like this

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:48.377
is much, much larger because you
have much greater MR squareds.

00:08:48.377 --> 00:08:50.460
So you can leave, for the
purpose of this problem,

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.460
you can't treat this as 0.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.990
And in your groups, I want
you to come up with the omega

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.740
vector, H and DHDT.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.480
So do get in groups,
talk about it.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.980
You've got a few
minutes to do this.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.760
This one's pretty
straightforward.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.337
And then you can do another
one that's harder so warm up

00:09:07.337 --> 00:09:08.920
and find a group to
work in and you're

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.720
going to work a couple
of problems this way.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.525
Got a group that feels pretty
good about they're answer?

00:09:12.525 --> 00:09:13.210
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.460
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.930
Write it up.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:23.830
Come up, fill in the
omega, H and DHDT.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:49.700
OK.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.750
Can everybody see it?

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:58.080
So you have a Z component only
for the omega, a Z component k

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.180
hat only for H, and its
i omega-- iZZ omega.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.600
And DHDT, the only
variable here is omega

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.470
and you get an omega dot.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:15.910
And there's no--
DKDT is 0 because it

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.980
doesn't change direction.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.620
Any questions about this?

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.140
Yes?

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.806
AUDIENCE: So I was a
little bit confused

00:10:23.806 --> 00:10:30.347
in lecture about how we knew
the i hat, j hat, k hat in the H

00:10:30.347 --> 00:10:30.847
term.

00:10:30.847 --> 00:10:32.755
Is it just because
it's only i hat

00:10:32.755 --> 00:10:35.140
on the top, j hat in the
middle, and k hat on the bottom?

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:35.640
Is that--

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.180
PROFESSOR: So the convention--
if I understand your question

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:44.630
correctly-- the convention
when you write out the H vector

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:52.220
is it's the result of
multiplying the three

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.220
components of the spin.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.290
This is the piece
in the i direction,

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.400
j direction, k direction.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:04.270
And you multiply these
out you get three results.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:08.846
Vector times-- and this one
is Hx and it is in the i.

00:11:08.846 --> 00:11:13.900
The second one from this times
the middle row gives you Hy

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.530
and it's in the j.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.670
And the third one, this
vector times these three

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.100
in the bottom row,
give you Hz in the k.

00:11:25.022 --> 00:11:26.970
AUDIENCE: So I thought
when-- I don't know,

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.405
I could be completely wrong--
but I thought when you did

00:11:29.405 --> 00:11:34.275
[INAUDIBLE] you multiplied this,
this, this and then this, this,

00:11:34.275 --> 00:11:37.320
this and then--

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:43.102
PROFESSOR: So we have a
capital A, capital B, capital C

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:44.060
terms in the first row?

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.620
AUDIENCE: So you
do, like, this and--

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.630
PROFESSOR: And you have
a capital-- little a,

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.370
little b, little c
terms in this one.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.140
When you multiply
this times this,

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:59.275
you get Aa plus Bb plus Cc.

00:11:59.275 --> 00:11:59.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.160
So that's my question.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.245
So if you have the
omega x is an i hat,

00:12:04.245 --> 00:12:06.875
omega y is a j hat,
omega z's a k hat,

00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:08.510
how, if you're
multiplying like this,

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:11.424
do you get only i hats
on the top of the thing.

00:12:11.424 --> 00:12:12.090
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.630
Well, it's because this
isn't just a matrix.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.400
This is actually a tensor.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.940
And we haven't gone into
messy tensor notation.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.880
So you're just being
told a convention here.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.140
And that is, because this
is a vector being multiplied

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.980
by a tensor, the result will--
even though this is i, j, k,

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.820
omega xi times this first
term in this tensor,

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.350
it gives you an i back.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.380
Omega yj times this one
gives you an i back.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.242
Omega zk times that
gives you an i back.

00:12:51.242 --> 00:12:51.783
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:12:51.783 --> 00:12:52.490
That's what I was
really confused --

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:53.160
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.409
And that's a great question
because it wasn't obvious.

00:12:55.409 --> 00:12:58.015
We didn't do the full
tensor mathematic.

00:12:58.015 --> 00:13:01.230
We just gave you a
result. By definition,

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:05.100
this row times that is in the
i direction, j direction, k

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:05.690
direction.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:06.550
Great question.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:09.340
OK.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.180
OK.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.720
So let's go on to
harder problem.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.886
So you're great at that one.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.940
We're going to do this one now.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.255
So we just did this problem.

00:13:22.699 --> 00:13:23.990
Now we want to do this problem.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:42.440
And so the same i
matrix is used here.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.460
It's this one and you
can let that term is 0

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.600
because the
coordinate system that

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:55.840
has been defined on this object
is x, z, y into the board.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.930
But the direction of
spin now is like that.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.210
And we'll call it
cap omega again.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:02.440
But it's in that direction.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.060
And these are 45 degree
angles for the purposes

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:05.820
of this problem.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:11.200
So that's sine cosine
of 45 root 2 over 2.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.160
So now, what's omega?

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.500
What's H?

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.870
And what's DHDT?

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.910
So work in groups and
sort that one out.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.442
You ready to go?

00:14:23.442 --> 00:14:24.477
AUDIENCE: We can be.

00:14:24.477 --> 00:14:25.060
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:25.810
Go for it.

00:14:36.736 --> 00:14:38.236
We'll probably do
this occasionally.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.520
I'll say it again.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.419
I have no intention of
embarrassing you at the board.

00:14:45.419 --> 00:14:47.960
So the practice will be, you
put your answer up, you sit down

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.330
and then we talk about it.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.170
It's not about you.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:51.340
It's about what's on the board.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:51.839
OK?

00:15:04.372 --> 00:15:06.080
AUDIENCE: Should I
keep going or should--

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:06.230
PROFESSOR: No.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.188
Put the whole thing up.

00:15:07.188 --> 00:15:08.540
Yep.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.579
And if you want to use that big
piece of chalk it shows better.

00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:12.370
Just to your right.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:55.400
OK.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.690
So let's talk about omega first.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:03.550
How do you figure-- we have
a minus root 2 over 2 here.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:04.310
Can't see that.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:09.330
Minus root 2 over 2 omega
i 0 root 2 over 2 omega k.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.350
Are people-- feel
good about that?

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:12.470
Any differences?

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.970
All right.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.670
So this thing-- this
omega-- that spin clearly

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.800
has components that are
like that and like this.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.650
So this is your z
piece and your i piece.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.490
And it is, indeed, in the
minus i hat direction.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:26.990
So that seems OK.

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:34.640
And H would be some
i-- the i times omega.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.210
And the first term, if you
take that upper left term as 0,

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.490
then you don't get anything.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.150
The second term you
don't get anything.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.790
So how do you feel about
the angular momentum?

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.350
Any differences?

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:50.040
OK.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.530
And the DHDT.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.110
You take the time
derivative of this thing--

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.100
and you got an omega dot.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.100
OK.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.562
That looks OK as far as it goes.

00:16:59.562 --> 00:17:00.520
But any other thoughts?

00:17:04.108 --> 00:17:07.077
AUDIENCE: So k hat dot is not 0.

00:17:07.077 --> 00:17:07.660
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.220
So you're saying k hat
is changing with time.

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:11.957
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:11.957 --> 00:17:13.540
PROFESSOR: And let's
think about that.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.290
So it's-- that's
this piece here.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.079
This is omega z k hat.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:25.940
And as this thing goes around
that unit vector is doing this.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.260
Right?

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.774
So you need a DkDT.

00:17:29.774 --> 00:17:31.690
So do you want to give--
somebody else give me

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.863
the second term here?

00:17:34.863 --> 00:17:35.488
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:45.627
ML squared times omega
squared because you

00:17:45.627 --> 00:17:52.298
have the changing directions
in your k hat principal axes.

00:17:52.298 --> 00:17:56.840
And that's going to
be-- well, times root 2.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.495
PROFESSOR: This is root--

00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:00.840
AUDIENCE: Well, omega squared.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.190
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.225
And then what about
the root 2 over 2?

00:18:04.225 --> 00:18:06.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.889
PROFESSOR: Got to
square that too, right?

00:18:07.889 --> 00:18:09.388
AUDIENCE: That'd
be squared as well.

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:11.136
PROFESSOR: That
gives you a half.

00:18:11.136 --> 00:18:11.635
OK.

00:18:11.635 --> 00:18:13.574
And--

00:18:13.574 --> 00:18:15.070
AUDIENCE: That's
over 12 as well.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.100
PROFESSOR: 12.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:16.980
And--

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.180
AUDIENCE: That would be
in the j hat direction.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:19.770
PROFESSOR: Positive--

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:20.160
AUDIENCE: Positive.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.659
Yes.

00:18:20.659 --> 00:18:21.330
In this case.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.876
PROFESSOR: Started out
with a negative but--

00:18:23.876 --> 00:18:25.500
AUDIENCE: Negative [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.680
PROFESSOR: i cross k is minus
j times a minus gives you

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.500
the plus, right?

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:35.740
So this looks-- this
comes out ML squared omega

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.930
squared j hat over 24 I think.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:40.640
Like that.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.960
That term.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.280
Now-- OK.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.190
And people good with that now?

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:53.150
So just to remind you, when
I was doing these problems--

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.485
when I first had to teach
this course a few years ago,

00:18:55.485 --> 00:18:58.110
and I was trying to figure
out an easy way to teach this

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.320
and how to do these problems,
I got myself all confused

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.790
trying to figure out which
components of the rotation

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:09.540
vector are rotating and what
do I have to cross into it

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.930
to get the answer.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.450
And in fact, you
don't have to make it

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:15.500
anywhere near that hard.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.730
And let's take a quick
look at something here.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:34.710
H is ML squared over
12 root 2 over 2--

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.890
where did H go-- root
2 over 2 omega k hat.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:49.030
H is a rotating vector.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:57.170
A derivative of a rotating
vector in an inertial frame

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:03.260
is the derivative of that
rotating vector in the rotating

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.160
frame.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.870
Which is the same
thing as saying

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.450
that omega is 0-- that's
the change in length

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:15.020
of the vector--
plus omega cross H.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.240
Let's test that and see if
that gives us the right answer.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.900
This derivative gives you-- all
it does is gives you the theta,

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.940
the omega dot back.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.440
Right?

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.980
That's that first term.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.050
And the second term
should just then

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:37.090
look like your omega, which
is root 2 minus root 2

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:47.420
over 2 cap omega i plus
root 2 over 2 cap omega k

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:54.270
cross a bunch of
constants times k.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.770
Right?

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:04.590
So the k cross k terms are?

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:05.200
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.150
PROFESSOR: 0.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.564
The i cross k--

00:21:08.564 --> 00:21:09.480
AUDIENCE: Minus j.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.950
PROFESSOR: --minus j.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.670
And so you get root 2 over
2 times root 2 over 2.

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:18.900
You get what's in
H here multiplied

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.630
by root 2 over 2 omega hat.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:27.200
And you get back
exactly these two terms.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.800
So it's that easy.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.940
It's just the derivative
of a rotating vector.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:35.560
Just doing omega
cross H is the easiest

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:41.190
way to deal with that derivative
of the rotating piece.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:46.650
Any rotating
vector, you can take

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.620
this time derivative that way.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.570
All right.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:51.982
We've got a few minutes.

00:21:51.982 --> 00:21:53.690
I want to-- actually,
any other questions

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.920
about this kind of problem?

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.910
In physics, most of the
problems you've worked before,

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.370
that involved rotation,
are planar-- what

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.090
we call planar motion problems.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:08.380
The axis of spin was always
perpendicular to the plane

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.090
and the rest the problem
was confined to the plane.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:15.300
So hockey pucks sliding
along and stuff like that.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.730
But it was always assumed
that the axis of rotation

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.880
was perpendicular to the
plane and that the angular

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.400
momentum was parallel.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.190
So this is actually--
this is 3D problem.

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:27.740
This is a 3D dynamics problem.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.890
As soon as that H and the
omega are different directions,

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:34.470
you can come up with torques
in all three directions.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:37.210
Right?

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.830
All right.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:43.544
So any other
questions about this?

00:22:43.544 --> 00:22:46.210
And if not, I want to talk about
something that was on the quiz.

00:22:49.606 --> 00:22:50.106
OK.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:23:00.060
So here's-- this is the one
problem on the quiz that gave

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:04.880
more conceptual difficulty
than any other single problem.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.580
People made mistakes
on other problems,

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.310
but got into conceptual
trouble with this problem.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:13.580
Remember, you had a
vehicle driving up a bridge

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:17.560
and the bridge could be
changing at some angular rate

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.110
and it has some
angular acceleration.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.554
And we said to keep
the problem simple,

00:23:23.554 --> 00:23:25.220
that you could treat
this as a particle.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.761
And that really
means you didn't have

00:23:26.761 --> 00:23:29.040
to deal with angular momentum.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.700
i omega for the object.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.570
You could just treat
it like a particle.

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:38.750
And one of the-- where
the confusion came from

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.594
was in figuring out
free body diagrams.

00:23:41.594 --> 00:23:43.760
You're told in the problem
the language is something

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:50.620
like, the action of the tires on
the road result in a net force

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:55.360
up the incline called t.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.850
We didn't call it friction,
we didn't say anything,

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:01.100
but people-- a number of people
got confused about what's

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.570
that have to do with friction.

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.960
How does friction
come into this?

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.570
So let's do the free body
diagram for this thing.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:11.586
So tell me what's--
here's my car,

00:24:11.586 --> 00:24:13.460
tell me what to put on
the free body diagram.

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:17.997
AUDIENCE: Weight.

00:24:17.997 --> 00:24:18.580
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.079
Mg?

00:24:19.079 --> 00:24:19.770
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:20.110
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:20.943
So you've got an Mg.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:24.320
Next.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.236
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:27.487 --> 00:24:28.570
PROFESSOR: A normal force?

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.070
OK.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:34.047
That's going this
way we'll call it.

00:24:34.047 --> 00:24:35.980
AUDIENCE: T.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.040
PROFESSOR: T. OK.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.800
Now, what about the
tires on the road?

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.582
What about friction?

00:24:42.582 --> 00:24:43.499
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:43.499 --> 00:24:44.248
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:24:44.248 --> 00:24:45.380
AUDIENCE: That is T.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.430
PROFESSOR: That is T. So you
think of the free body diagram,

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:52.650
you just say, what are
all the possible sources

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.960
of external force on this thing?

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.180
And they come from gravity--
a body force-- and then

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.650
other things that are
in contact with it.

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:05.180
And the wheels are in
contact with the road.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.580
And through the wheels
you get the normal force.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.370
And through the wheels you
get any active friction.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:13.310
So that is the-- that's
total net friction force.

00:25:17.982 --> 00:25:19.440
And then once you
got that far, you

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.440
were asked to come up
with an equation of motion

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.360
in this direction.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.379
In the direction up the bridge.

00:25:26.379 --> 00:25:28.920
And how do you-- so when you go
to get an equation of motion,

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.664
you say, the sum of the
external forces is equal to?

00:25:33.664 --> 00:25:35.183
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:35.183 --> 00:25:36.099
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.000
PROFESSOR: And we'll make
these in the x direction here.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.230
Is the mass times
the acceleration

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.660
in the x direction.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:50.447
And how would--
what terms appear?

00:25:50.447 --> 00:25:51.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.570
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:53.537
AUDIENCE: T.

00:25:53.537 --> 00:25:55.120
PROFESSOR: Well,
those are the forces.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.220
They're on the other side.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.140
I want you to come up
with the accelerations.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.500
You need to come up with
the acceleration terms.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.874
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:26:02.874 --> 00:26:03.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.230
PROFESSOR: So this problem
most easily to think through,

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.200
I think, in terms of
r and theta and polar

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.090
coordinates because you've
worked dozens of times

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:20.030
with a complete acceleration of
something in a rotating system.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.320
And this is a rotating system.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.790
Polar coordinates is a pretty
good way to do this problem.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:30.665
So what are the accelerations
in this direction?

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.732
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
r and theta?

00:26:38.732 --> 00:26:40.565
PROFESSOR: Well, I do
it in terms of-- well,

00:26:40.565 --> 00:26:42.210
I do it in terms of r and theta.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:47.160
Given a theta dot and a
theta double dot and x and r

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.100
mount up to the same thing.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.210
But I-- if you call it r,
you'll recognize the terms

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.140
in your acceleration equation.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:00.838
So what are the accelerations
in the direction up to bridge?

00:27:00.838 --> 00:27:02.332
AUDIENCE: r double dot?

00:27:02.332 --> 00:27:05.320
AUDIENCE: r double dot.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.308
AUDIENCE: Minus r theta dot.

00:27:11.296 --> 00:27:13.290
PROFESSOR: And those
are all in the-- you

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.910
get all of that in
the i direction.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.160
And then if you looked
at that, obviously,

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.990
you could replace r double
dot with x double dot.

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:25.212
r with x if you make
your origin here.

00:27:25.212 --> 00:27:26.280
Which you probably would.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.488
That's the point of rotation.

00:27:27.488 --> 00:27:31.160
So that is your-- that's the
mass times the acceleration

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.190
in the direction of travel.

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:36.810
And it's got to be
equal to T and minus

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:41.260
Mg sine theta probably.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.150
Right?

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.580
And that's one
equation of motion.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.621
And you're going to do
another equation of motion

00:27:45.621 --> 00:27:47.880
in the theta dot--
theta hat direction.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.150
Because what other--
what accelerations

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:54.060
are present in this direction?

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.218
In the y j hat?

00:27:57.218 --> 00:27:58.694
AUDIENCE: Theta double dot?

00:27:58.694 --> 00:27:59.860
PROFESSOR: Theta double dot.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.210
You're [INAUDIBLE] one.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.770
What else?

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:10.890
So the sum of the
forces in the y--

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:15.562
so they are, in terms of
polar coordinate terms?

00:28:15.562 --> 00:28:18.734
AUDIENCE: 2 omega-- 2 omega dot.

00:28:18.734 --> 00:28:20.400
PROFESSOR: Somebody
said this one first.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:25.985
Plus 2 theta dot is your--

00:28:25.985 --> 00:28:27.702
AUDIENCE: It's [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:27.702 --> 00:28:28.410
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:29.396
2 theta dot--

00:28:29.396 --> 00:28:30.062
AUDIENCE: r dot.

00:28:30.062 --> 00:28:31.420
PROFESSOR: r dot.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.720
And that's in the j direction.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.860
And now you've got-- now
you can work the problem.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:44.720
So how would you go about
doing this problem where

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.950
you can't treat it as
a particle any longer?

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:55.624
We've graduated to
that because we've

00:28:55.624 --> 00:28:57.540
been doing-- we've been
doing angular momentum

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.450
stuff with mass moment
of inertia matrices.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:06.110
So now you want to do this
more as a full fledged dynamics

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.910
problem, taking into
consideration that.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.230
So how do you-- what
is the mass-- what

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:16.320
do you have to modify-- do to
modify our free body diagram?

00:29:21.042 --> 00:29:22.250
Here's my simplified vehicle.

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.730
What are the forces on it
that you need to deal with?

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:34.304
AUDIENCE: Well, there
are two normal forces.

00:29:34.304 --> 00:29:35.470
There are two normal forces.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:35.806
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:29:35.806 --> 00:29:37.140
So you can add-- need
two because you've

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.590
got two wheels on this thing.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:43.320
And so there's axle one here- so
you get one here and one here.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.260
I call this one N1, N2.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.472
What else?

00:29:48.472 --> 00:29:50.892
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:50.892 --> 00:29:52.350
The same T and Mg.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:54.040
PROFESSOR: So you've
got a g somewhere.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.740
And so you still
have an Mg term.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.098
What other external forces?

00:30:00.098 --> 00:30:01.430
AUDIENCE: T?

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:04.100
PROFESSOR: T. But
now T's the problem.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.880
So as I gave you before,
T is the total net force.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.786
But that's not adequate in
this problem any longer.

00:30:09.786 --> 00:30:11.384
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:11.384 --> 00:30:12.050
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:17.440
So we're going to end up
having a friction force that's

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:25.105
supplied here-- f1-- and
another one applied here-- f2.

00:30:25.105 --> 00:30:31.250
And f1 plus f2 would be T. OK.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:34.968
So how many unknowns do we have?

00:30:40.584 --> 00:30:41.520
AUDIENCE: Four?

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.395
PROFESSOR: Well, it
looks like four are here.

00:30:43.395 --> 00:30:46.600
Plus any motion stuff that
you have to solve for.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:50.260
So how many equations
of motion can you write?

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.830
Remember, you get one equation
for every vector component

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:54.330
direction.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:57.360
So x, y, z gives
you three components

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.690
and you could conceivably
write three equations.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:02.060
So tell me the relevant
equations of motion

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.930
that we could come up
with for this problem.

00:31:09.738 --> 00:31:12.650
AUDIENCE: Sum forces
in x, sum forces in y.

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:13.390
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.550
I argue-- sum of
the forces in x.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.110
That's still true.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.250
Yep.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:23.970
Sum of the forces in y you said.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.591
Is this 0?

00:31:29.591 --> 00:31:30.090
No.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:32.170
Because that bridge is moving.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:33.010
OK.

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:33.978
What else?

00:31:33.978 --> 00:31:36.120
AUDIENCE: Torque.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.330
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.640
And how do you do that?

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.746
Sum of the torques
in what direction?

00:31:42.746 --> 00:31:44.520
AUDIENCE: Theta hat.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.400
PROFESSOR: Well, no.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:47.900
Yeah.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.470
Well, you could.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:49.000
Excuse me.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.759
I shouldn't say that.

00:31:51.759 --> 00:31:53.300
Do you have more
than one torque term

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.100
that you can work with here?

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.350
More than one torque equation?

00:32:04.637 --> 00:32:05.220
AUDIENCE: Yes?

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:05.955
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:05.955 --> 00:32:08.172
PROFESSOR: How's that?

00:32:08.172 --> 00:32:09.880
So let's just think
through these things.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.340
You could have a torque--
you could have a torque in,

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.560
this is x, y, z
out of the board.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.150
You could have a z torque
making this thing trying

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:22.110
to pitch up and down.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.575
You could have an x torque
making it trying to rollover.

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:26.700
But we don't have any
information in that direction

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.150
and its constrained.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:32.890
And we could have a y torque
making it try to go like that.

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:34.800
And we don't have much
information there.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.580
So it seems like
we've got a z torque

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.940
equation that we could write.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.450
And that's one-- seems like
we got three equations.

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:51.420
Sum of the forces x,
sum of the forces y,

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.210
and a torque in the z.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:59.162
And doesn't seem
like quite enough.

00:32:59.162 --> 00:33:00.870
And that's as far as
I've gotten with it.

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:04.190
I just thought of this
on the way over here.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.950
So I'd sit down and start
working this out and trying

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:08.950
to figure out, where is
my fourth equation going

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:09.491
to come from?

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.884
And I'm not exactly
sure quite yet.

00:33:17.884 --> 00:33:20.457
But, generally, I'd go about
setting it up like that

00:33:20.457 --> 00:33:21.915
and start working
those things out.

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:27.170
OK.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:29.210
Any other questions or
questions about the quiz?

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.210
We're done early.
