interesting explanation for why we have
 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.600
interesting explanation for why we have
this capacity not only to make

and many of us in high school hated this

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689
and many of us in high school hated this
 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.050
and many of us in high school hated this
type of dilemma or not to do the work

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060
type of dilemma or not to do the work
 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.000
type of dilemma or not to do the work
and also defect and maybe get a bad

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010
and also defect and maybe get a bad
 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.399

grade so if you're choosing whether to

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409
grade so if you're choosing whether to
 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.230
grade so if you're choosing whether to
cooperate or defect with someone who's

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240
cooperate or defect with someone who's
 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.670
cooperate or defect with someone who's
defecting and all you can do is choose

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680
defecting and all you can do is choose
 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.649

find is that ultimately most people wind

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400
find is that ultimately most people wind
 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.700
find is that ultimately most people wind
up defecting so in a rigid social

up defecting so in a rigid social
 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.340
up defecting so in a rigid social
structure in which people are stuck with

structure in which people are stuck with
 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.649
structure in which people are stuck with
particular other individuals when those

taking advantage of you if you're stuck
 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.789
taking advantage of you if you're stuck
with them then you wind up not doing

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799
with them then you wind up not doing
 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.710
with them then you wind up not doing
your job either and the whole group

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720
your job either and the whole group
 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.260
your job either and the whole group
collapses and descends into a kind of

collapses and descends into a kind of
 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.410
collapses and descends into a kind of
you know Anarchy a kind of awfulness in

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420
you know Anarchy a kind of awfulness in
 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.179
you know Anarchy a kind of awfulness in
which everyone is mean to each other but

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189
which everyone is mean to each other but
 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.100
which everyone is mean to each other but
if you allow people the capacity to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110
if you allow people the capacity to
 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.020
if you allow people the capacity to
leave the group to say you know I don't

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030
leave the group to say you know I don't
 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.920
leave the group to say you know I don't
want to hang out with you anymore I

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930
want to hang out with you anymore I
 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.850
want to hang out with you anymore I
don't want to be connected with you

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860
don't want to be connected with you
 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.109
don't want to be connected with you
anymore I don't want to be your friend

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119
anymore I don't want to be your friend
 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.370
anymore I don't want to be your friend
anymore because you're taking advantage

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380
anymore because you're taking advantage
 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.940
anymore because you're taking advantage
of me that capacity actually supports

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950
of me that capacity actually supports
 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.280
of me that capacity actually supports
cooperation within a group if you allow

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290
cooperation within a group if you allow
 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.340
cooperation within a group if you allow
people to switch friendships it makes it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350
people to switch friendships it makes it
 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.170
people to switch friendships it makes it
easier to sustain cooperation because

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180
easier to sustain cooperation because
 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.300
easier to sustain cooperation because
now people have a second way of

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310
now people have a second way of
 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.460
now people have a second way of
communicating their dissatisfaction with

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470
communicating their dissatisfaction with
 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.339
communicating their dissatisfaction with
someone who's taking advantage of them

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349
someone who's taking advantage of them
 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.230
someone who's taking advantage of them
but you don't want too much of that

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240
but you don't want too much of that
 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.030
but you don't want too much of that
you don't want too much social fluidity

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040
you don't want too much social fluidity
 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.160
you don't want too much social fluidity
so the relationship between the ability

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170
so the relationship between the ability
 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.570
so the relationship between the ability
of groups to work together or

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580
of groups to work together or
 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.930
of groups to work together or
cooperation on the y-axis and the social

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940
cooperation on the y-axis and the social
 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.450
cooperation on the y-axis and the social
fluidity on the x-axis with total

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460
fluidity on the x-axis with total
 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.790
fluidity on the x-axis with total
rigidity being here and total fluidity

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800
rigidity being here and total fluidity
 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.130
rigidity being here and total fluidity
being here gives you a parabolic curve

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140
being here gives you a parabolic curve
 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.260
being here gives you a parabolic curve
because if you have too much fluidity

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270
because if you have too much fluidity
 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.120
because if you have too much fluidity
you also don't make an investment in

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130
you also don't make an investment in
 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.890
you also don't make an investment in
your friendships if every day you have

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900
your friendships if every day you have
 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.080
your friendships if every day you have
new friends why would you invest in that

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090
new friends why would you invest in that
 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.220
new friends why would you invest in that
person they're here today they'll be

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230
person they're here today they'll be
 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.210
person they're here today they'll be
gone tomorrow

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220
gone tomorrow
 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.160
gone tomorrow
and if you think about it there are many

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170
and if you think about it there are many
 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.070
and if you think about it there are many
institutions in our society which have

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080
institutions in our society which have
 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.530
institutions in our society which have
evolved to put you in that middle range

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540
evolved to put you in that middle range
 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.840
evolved to put you in that middle range
we have an institution of marriage which

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850
we have an institution of marriage which
 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.780
we have an institution of marriage which
kind of makes it so that you declare

kind of makes it so that you declare
that you are getting married to this

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020
that you are getting married to this
