00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.210
There are 1000s of videos on YouTube of people
whispering, eating, tapping on surfaces -- all

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.970
with the goal of giving you....BRAIN TINGLES.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.990
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.930
I have a weird confession for you.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.850
Since I was a little kid, I've had this strong
sensation from certain peoples' voices.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.820
Most often the person is soft spoken, maybe
a little breathy, and the way they pronounce

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.260
certain sounds like "k", "d", and "t" is sort
of.......crisp sounding?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.570
Bob Ross would be the most well known one.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.950
I also have the reaction from sounds -- like
when someone is rummaging through makeup or

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.230
crinkling plastic baggies.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.810
These are some of MY triggers, but there are
lots out there: the sound of someone writing,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.020
polishing shoes, or brushing hair.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.460
The sensation is incredibly challenging to
describe -- like a tingling in my head and

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.360
scalp, but it's not a PHYSICAL tingling.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.330
Some people call it a "braingasm".

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.630
The sounds can almost instantly make me relax
and my mind zone out.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.060
It's hypnotic and it's very euphoric -- but
not in a sexual way.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.060
It's not a fetish, and it's not erotic.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.060
Common misunderstanding.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.960
The pleasant tingling sensation has recently
been widely referred to as "ASMR", or Autonomous

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.400
Sensory Meridian Response.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.610
The subreddit for ASMR now boasts over 60,000
regular members who all experience the same

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.610
response.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.610
Other internet groups before Reddit referred
to it as "The Unnamed Sensation".

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.979
It's all veeeeery mysterious.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.240
What's going on with this strange sensation?

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.540
Sadly, only ONE scientist has formally studied
ASMR - at least as identified by that name.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.950
Someone else may have studied it but the name
of the phenomenon is unknown and therefore

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.950
unsearchable.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.490
The scientist at Dartmouth who did study it
looked at fMRI scans of people experiencing

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.390
an ASMR episode - which could be very telling
about what's going on in the brain....buuuut

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.330
the publication of his results are still in
process.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.470
There have been many theories posed, however.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.890
One comes from ethnobotanists -- that ASMR
could be the conscious experience of serotonin

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.890
release.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.630
From neurologists is the theory that ASMR
is a type of muted seizure.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.330
I didn't know this, but apparently seizures
can be quite pleasurable and triggered by

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.860
simple sounds like this.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.930
Another theory posed by Dr. Steven Novella,
a neurologist at Yale, is that these sounds

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.360
are activating a pleasure response, which
is an evolutionary response that occurs when

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.280
we do things that increase our probability
of survival.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.900
Dr. Novella also theorized that it's possible
that those with ASMR have a particular neural

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.360
hard wiring that amplifies the pleasure they
get from things that are normally quietly

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.360
satisfying.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.290
There's a lot we don't know, but what we do
know is that this response is uncommon but

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.019
still widely experienced.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.910
We also know that the response is not the
same as tinglies you might get while listening

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.230
to music, which can cause physical effects
like goosebumps.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.720
Similarly, it's not the same effect as binaural
sounds either.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.319
So, do any of you experience ASMR?

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.600
If you don't, how much of a weirdo do I sound
like right now? :P

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.141
Let me know down below and check out our new
Testtube app so you can get updates on the

00:03:04.141 --> 00:03:05.141
go.

00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:06.090
Thanks for joining me, I'll cya next time.
