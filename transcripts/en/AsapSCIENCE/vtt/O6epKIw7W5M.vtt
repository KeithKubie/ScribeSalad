00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.370
Whether it’s to fuel your late night study
session, or trying to stay alert on the job

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.539
energy drinks are very popular with 76% of
young adults consuming them, but what would

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.539
happen if you ONLY drank energy drinks?

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.619
One sip and the feel-good effect is almost
immediate.

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.780
When the sugar molecules hit your taste buds,
it triggers your brain to release dopamine,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.140
the hormone responsible for feelings of happiness
and well-being.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.460
This makes sense, considering the sugar content
of ONE can ranges from two teaspoons to a

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.120
whopping 14 teaspoons per serving depending
on the brand.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.059
Within 10 minutes, both your heart rate and
blood pressure increase in response to adrenaline

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.399
release, caused by the introduction of caffeine
into your body.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.960
How much caffeine depends on the brand and
ranges anywhere from 6 mg to as high as 242

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.960
mg per serving.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.510
To compare, a serving of brewed coffee contains
95 to 165 mg of caffeine, brewed black tea

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.930
contains 25 to 38 mg, and a bottle of Coke
contains 34 mg of caffeine.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.960
But unlike soda, coffee and tea, energy drinks
add in guarana extract.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.470
The guarana plant which is native to South
America, produces seeds which are about the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.560
same size as a coffee bean, but yields twice
the caffeine content.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.040
Spread out over the course of a day 400mg
of caffeine appears to be safe, but having

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.890
more than 200mg in a single sitting can lead
to caffeine intoxication.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.020
In 2011, it is estimated that nearly 20,000
visits to the emergency room in the United

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.560
States are directly related to the effects
of energy drink consumption.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.200
Most of these visits involved those between
the ages of 18 to 25, and the second largest

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.970
age group being 26 to 39 years old.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.970
An observational study reviewed 7 years of
data from calls to Australian poison information

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.970
centre related to energy drink toxicity.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.970
Of the 297 calls analyzed the most common
symptoms of caffeine toxicity included palpitations,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.970
agitation, tremor and gastrointestinal upset.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.970
Twenty one cases had signs of serious cardiac
or neurological toxicity, including hallucinations,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.970
seizures, arrhythmias or cardiac ischaemia,
and at least 128 subjects required hospitalisation.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:43.970
So if you started subbing your 8 glasses of
water for equivalent amounts of energy drinks,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.400
the constant increases in heart rate and blood
pressure might lead to an increased risk of

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.360
developing a bunch of cardiovascular conditions,
including hypertension or high blood pressure.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.680
You could also become dehydrated.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.330
Though there is there is debate about whether
caffeinated drinks are dehydrating, researchers

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.610
have found that urine volume was increased
by caffeinated beverages, but only when they

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.960
exceeded 360 mg.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.239
A separate study also found that though energy
drinks cause you to urinate significantly

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.079
more than non caffeinated beverages, they
were no more a diuretic than coffee.

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:25.709
However, a cup of black coffee has less than
5 calories, but the high sugar content of

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.120
energy drinks means a calorie count of about
850 calories in 8 cups of Red Bull.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.849
This increase your risk for obesity and developing
Type 2 diabetes.

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.879
But some of the risks are unpredictable, such
as a 26 year old man who drank at least two

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.620
cans of energy drinks daily for a decade.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.190
With no prior significant health issues, he
had a seizure and fell into a three day coma.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.520
Doctors ultimately attributed this to chronic
sleep deprivation and over-consumption of

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.269
caffeine.

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.389
Energy drink consumption has even been linked
to insomnia and disrupted sleep patterns.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:05.599
It is reported that 45% of American military
personnel consume one can daily while on active

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.750
duty, and 14% drink three or more cans daily.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.049
Interestingly enough, those who drank three
or more cans were more likely to fall asleep

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.400
on duty, compared to those who only drank
one can.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.090
These “three plus” drinkers also reported
fewer overall hours of sleep, and sleep disruption

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.099
even after their duty had ended.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.779
Overall, energy drinks are relatively safe
for infrequent consumption, butttttt you may

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:29.329
not want to drink them on a regular basis.
