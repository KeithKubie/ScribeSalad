00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:12.790
In 
its early days, “meme”, which incidentally

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.800
is often mispronounced as “me-me” or “meh-meh”,
but in fact should be pronounced “meem”,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.110
primarily was only known and used by certain
academics, but today this neologism is beginning

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.840
to reach widespread use thanks to describing
the viral spread of jokes, ideas, etc. via

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:39.300
the internet.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:52.289
“Meme” was coined by the often controversial
evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.390
his 1976 book, The Selfish Gene.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.719
In it, he states the following:

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.399
We need a name for the new replicator, a noun
that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.690
transmission, or a unit of imitation.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.400
‘Mimeme’ comes from a suitable Greek root,
but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.400
like ‘gene’.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.330
I hope my classicist friends will forgive
me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.790
If it is any consolation, it could alternatively
be thought of as being related to ‘memory’,

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.890
or to the French word même.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.660
It should be pronounced to rhyme with ‘cream’.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.130
The French word même that he references means
“same” or “alike” (though the meaning

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.560
changes somewhat depending on how it is used).

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.910
The Greek word “mimeme” he derives “meme”
from comes from the Ancient Greek μίμημα

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.240
(mīmēma), meaning “that which is imitated”
/ “something imitated” / “something

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.240
copied”.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.260
As stated, Dawkins was hoping that the word
would be used as a unit of human cultural

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.400
transmission, such as a melody, fashion, or
catch-phrase, with the idea evolving as it

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.030
spreads and time passes.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.090
This evolution is primarily spurred by the
fact that people refine the memes or simply

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.280
don’t “copy” the information exactly
when they transmit it to another human.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.270
This has since given rise to other derivative
words or phrases including:

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.439
Memetics: which explores the transmission
and evolution of cultural ideas in a scientific

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.769
manner, though often somewhat unsuccessfully
with the “scientific” part.

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.489
Meme Complex or memeplex: memes that have
evolved into a symbiotic relationship with

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.489
other memes.

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.159
In terms of internet memes, this would be
like the relationship between a meme such

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.939
as “Herp/Derp” and various other meme
elements that make up rage comics.

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:33.749
In “real life” memes, this would be like
the combined ideas that together form a certain

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:34.749
religion.

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:37.400
Memotype: the information-content of the meme.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.319
Memeoid: people who are so ingrained with
some meme that they are willing to sacrifice

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.247
themselves as a result of it, such as suicide
bombers and the like.

00:02:43.247 --> 00:02:44.247
In a less extreme sense, it could be argued
that every single person on the planet is

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:45.247
a memeoid of one type or another.

00:02:45.247 --> 00:02:48.300
Memetic Marketing: the use of memes to virally
market some product or business, often using

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.609
internet memes.

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:56.549
German biologist Richard Semon in 1904 suggested
a word to mean not only similar to Dawkins’

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.060
idea of a meme, but the actual spelling of
the word itself was nearly the same.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:17.249
In his case, he called it 
a Mneme.
