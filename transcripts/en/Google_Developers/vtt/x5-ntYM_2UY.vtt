CHRIS BANES: Hi,
I'm Chris, and I

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.010
work at the Developer
Relations team at Google.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.100
How would you like to
improve the look of your app

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.450
using the new Material
styler in Android L?

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.530
I'm going to show you how to do
this, along with my Banesy Top

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.020
Tips.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.570
But first, here's
an introduction

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.660
to the new Material
design principles.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.660
They've been created to
work across all devices,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.280
from Android to the web.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.100
And they're our comprehensive
guide for the visual, motion,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.030
and interaction design for apps.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.540
Now, to go on this journey,
we need a sample app.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.500
We'll be using XYZ
Reader, which you

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.710
may remember from the show,
Android Design Action.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.210
Now this app already
utilizes some

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.797
of things which you associate
with a good Android app.

00:00:38.797 --> 00:00:40.630
Things like branding
for color on the action

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.260
bar, responsive touch feedback,
the use of standard type sizes,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.190
prominent use of imagery,
both on the list,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.780
and the detail UIs.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.250
Now, our goal is to
make it look like this.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.220
So let's get started.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.514
Now, the first step
is to change its theme

00:00:58.514 --> 00:01:00.430
to inherit from one of
the new Material themes

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.400
available in Android L.
There are equivalent Material

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.410
themes for the majority
of the Holo themes

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.300
which your apps are using.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.220
Our sample app uses
DarkActionBar as its base

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.570
theme, so here we will
create a new styles XML file

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.185
in the values v21
folder, redefining

00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:18.330
our existing Theme.Bacon theme
to inherit from the Material

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.270
version of the
DarkActionBar theme.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.935
And after we've done
that, we'll have

00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:23.415
something that looks like this.

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:25.665
Now, there are a number of
things you may notice here.

00:01:25.665 --> 00:01:27.950
The action bar is now
more colorful by default,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.450
and this ties in
with the encouraged

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.130
use of color in your UIs.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.520
Clickable items now receive
the new infill touch feedback.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.380
And overall, the
metrics have changed,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.750
as space is now
treated differently.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.750
So we haven't yet customized
the Material theme,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.791
so let's go ahead and add
our branding color back

00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:44.120
into the app.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.370
But before we do that, let's
take a step back, and see

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.994
what we need to do
with Holo to achieve

00:01:47.994 --> 00:01:50.070
this color customization.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.985
Here is a small section
of our styles file.

00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:53.590
We're only customizing
the action bar,

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.602
and you can already see that the
main theme is pretty complex.

00:01:56.602 --> 00:01:59.060
If you also start customizing
any of the standard widgets--

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.655
such as Button or Any
Text, your styles file

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:04.165
can easily become
hundreds of lines long.

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:06.250
Now, there are obvious
downsides to this.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.609
The fact that it's hard
to maintain and update,

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:10.150
but you also need
to bundle colorized

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.691
Drawables in your
app, such as these,

00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:14.151
which adds unnecessary bloat.

00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:16.500
Now luckily, there are tools
such as Action Bar Style

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.240
Generator, and
Android Holo Colors,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.329
which can make this pretty easy.

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.120
But wouldn't it be nice
if it could do this

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.297
without having to put
so much work into it?

00:02:24.297 --> 00:02:26.630
Now, the good news is that
the new theming functionality

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.990
in Android L allows
you to accomplish this

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.560
without needing to bundle those
Drawables or style definitions.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.920
This new functionality allows
you to declare your color

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.940
scheme in your main style.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.790
And this is done by setting new
attributes, the most important

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.130
two being colorPrimary
and colorPrimaryDark.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.450
colorPrimary is your
app's main branding color,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.130
and is used by the app bar,
scrolling edge effects,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.020
and other built-in widgets.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.670
colorPrimaryDark, as
the name suggests,

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.300
is a darker variant
of colorPrimary,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.050
and is used to color
the contextual action

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.750
bar, amongst other things.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.655
So back to our sample
app, our styles file

00:02:59.655 --> 00:03:01.370
becomes the following,
with colorPrimary

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.230
and colorPrimaryDark
set to two colors

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.065
from resources-- bacon
and crispy bacon.

00:03:06.065 --> 00:03:08.916
And after that, our sample
app looks like this.

00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:10.915
You can see that the
action bar and edge effects

00:03:10.915 --> 00:03:12.885
have changed color to
fit our color scheme.

00:03:12.885 --> 00:03:14.300
MALE SPEAKER: Banesy's Top Tip.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.147
[BANG]

00:03:16.147 --> 00:03:17.730
CHRIS BANES: Internally,
a lot of this

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.335
is allowed for the new
Drawable tinting functionality.

00:03:20.335 --> 00:03:21.990
This is a great
new feature, which

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.340
allows you to easily recolor
Drawables at run time.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.710
Here's a Drawable defined XML,
which specifies a red tint,

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.247
using another Drawable
as the source.

00:03:31.247 --> 00:03:33.080
There's also the setTint
method on Drawable,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.536
to achieve the same thing.

00:03:34.536 --> 00:03:37.287
Now, the next step is to look
at the layout of the app.

00:03:37.287 --> 00:03:39.370
The Material design
principles introduce a new way

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.250
to think about the
space in your app,

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.560
using baseline grids and
keylines to promote consistency

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.610
across the system as a whole.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.410
A level down from
that, we will now

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.990
also provide detailed
guides about space, padding,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.040
and overall metrics.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.230
The most commonly used
containers and elements,

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.297
things such as lists,
grids, and buttons.

00:03:56.297 --> 00:03:58.380
Now it's important to note
that for the most part,

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.140
these metrics are not
provided by the framework,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.570
meaning that you
need to implement

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.730
them yourselves in your layouts.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.810
We also now have a set
of standard type styles

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.945
and scales.

00:04:07.945 --> 00:04:09.320
Each one of these
has been chosen

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.230
to balance content density with
reading comfort for the user.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.940
Combined with the
new Roboto font,

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.769
used in Android L-- which
is rounder and wider--

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.700
these styles should give your
text content greater clarity.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.902
So back to our sample app.

00:04:22.902 --> 00:04:24.985
We're going to convert our
list into a grid, which

00:04:24.985 --> 00:04:26.850
will allow our imagery
to be more prominent

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.916
and add quick visual
comprehension.

00:04:28.916 --> 00:04:31.290
To do that, we're going to
take the grid container guide,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.830
and apply it to
our list of meats.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.320
Each container
guide tends to have

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.970
a number of different
variants, to allow flexibility

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.420
for the type of content
you're trying to show.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.592
Here, we are going to use
the two long variants.

00:04:42.592 --> 00:04:45.050
There are other variants in
the grid component guide, which

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.466
differ on the
number lines of text

00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:49.280
or graphics each item displays.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.900
So let's look more in
depth at the guide.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.580
Each item displays
a square image,

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.730
along with two lines of
text, which can either

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.120
overlay the image, or be inline.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.020
It specifies the type
of fonts and sizes,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.380
along with your four div
spacing for all items.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.350
In this variant, we have
two options for text sizes.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.630
You have a 16 sp for the first
line, and 12 for the second,

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.176
or 14 sp for both.

00:05:11.176 --> 00:05:13.550
Now, which one you use depends
on the relative importance

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.106
of your text.

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:18.172
And after doing that, this
is what it will look like.

00:05:18.172 --> 00:05:20.005
Each item is issued a
pass for the increased

00:05:20.005 --> 00:05:22.463
size of the imagery, and we've
minimized the amount of text

00:05:22.463 --> 00:05:24.582
which needs to be displayed.

00:05:24.582 --> 00:05:27.010
Now obviously, we have only
gone through one screen here,

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.665
and most apps will
have more than this.

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:30.830
You will need to read
through the design guide,

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.500
applying all of the appropriate
layout guides to your app's UI.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.980
MALE SPEAKER: Banesy's Top Tip.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.190
[BANG]

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.690
CHRIS BANES: You are going to
be using the standard keylines

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.780
a lot in your apps, so instead
of hard coding the values

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.030
in your layouts, make sure
you are declaring them

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.050
in your dimension resources.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.640
Here are three to
get you started,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.770
but there are many more
which can be added here.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.185
And now we move on to imagery.

00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:52.740
Now, imagery is one of the key
principles in the new design

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.060
language.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.393
It should be used to show
relevance, convey information,

00:05:55.393 --> 00:05:57.444
and generally delight the user.

00:05:57.444 --> 00:05:58.860
Now, for this
section, we're going

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.986
to focus on the detail
screen of the app.

00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:02.610
The current layout
ought to use imagery

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.325
of its full bleed banner image.

00:06:04.325 --> 00:06:05.700
But we're going
to improve things

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.946
by making it more immersive.

00:06:06.946 --> 00:06:08.727
The way we're
going to do that is

00:06:08.727 --> 00:06:11.060
by using the translucent
status bar functionality, which

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.050
was added in Android KitKat.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.470
Now, doing this allows us to
make the app bar translucent

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.730
when the content is scrolled
all the way to the top.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.229
And this allows the
imagery to bleed

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:20.684
into the outer [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:20.684 --> 00:06:22.350
We then bring the app
bar back into view

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.710
when the image and title
have scrolled out of view.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.810
Now, this technique
is not reliant

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.393
on any new functionality
in Android L,

00:06:27.393 --> 00:06:29.380
so you can use it
on past versions.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.030
And indeed, many apps in
Google Play already do this,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.000
you may have seen it in
the Google Play Music app.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.250
We have also brought the
title and subtitle into view,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.010
or move them out of the image,
and into their own contrasting

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.760
layout, again, using
the app's primary color

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.590
to emphasize our brand.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.240
And finally, the
body text has been

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.930
tweaked to match
the body topographic

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.360
style from the design guide.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.370
So finally, here's
our end result again.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.315
As a quick recap, our
branding color is now

00:06:54.315 --> 00:06:56.400
used throughout the
app, both of the screens

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.825
are using the new base
grids and keylines,

00:06:58.825 --> 00:07:00.950
and we have emphasized our
imagery on the detail UI

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.116
by making it more immersive.

00:07:02.116 --> 00:07:03.507
MALE SPEAKER: Banesy's Top Tip.

00:07:03.507 --> 00:07:04.714
[BANG]

00:07:04.714 --> 00:07:06.130
CHRIS BANES: Are
you wondering how

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.504
to implement a fade-in action
bar with translucent status

00:07:08.504 --> 00:07:09.160
bar?

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.125
Well, Roman Nurik posted a
great Android developers protip

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:14.230
on exactly this recently.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.710
As part of that, he wrote
the DrawInsetsFrameLayout,

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.270
which makes it really easy.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.410
You can grab the code
from his GitHub gist.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.930
But the fun doesn't
stop there, so

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.775
to help your app
reach the sky, here

00:07:24.775 --> 00:07:27.540
are some more things we
have added for this release.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.090
Activity scene
transitions, which

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.881
allows you to use the
scene and transitions

00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:34.050
API when you're transitioning
from activity to activity.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.070
RecyclerView is our next
generation adaptive view,

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.930
intended to replace
ListView and GridView.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.305
RecyclerView has
been designed so

00:07:41.305 --> 00:07:43.645
that the logic for laying
out items is pluggable,

00:07:43.645 --> 00:07:45.770
meaning that you now have
complete control over how

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.775
your items are laid out.

00:07:47.775 --> 00:07:49.900
Android has gone 3D, with
elevation and translation

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.265
Z. So as well as being to move
views in the x- and y-axis,

00:07:53.265 --> 00:07:54.820
you can now move in the z-axis.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.350
And this allows your views
to come away from the screen,

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.020
casting a real time shadow
to create depth to UIs.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.570
And finally, floating
action buttons

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.361
are a new type of button
which are reserved

00:08:04.361 --> 00:08:06.360
for your most important actions.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.250
They're recognizable
as a circular icon

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.372
which floats above your UI.

00:08:10.372 --> 00:08:14.100
So thanks for watching, now
show us what you can do.
