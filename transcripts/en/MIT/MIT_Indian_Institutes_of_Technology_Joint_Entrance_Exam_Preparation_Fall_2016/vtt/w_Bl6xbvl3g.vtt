00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.510
Hi everyone, welcome to this series of videos
for the topic of vectors.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.970
This chapter is important for mathematics
and it also forms the basis for the next chapter,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.800
that is 3-Dimensional Geometry.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.940
There will be series of videos for this topic.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.190
In this first video, I will just like to talk
about very basic stuff.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.460
I will try to define vectors.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.789
I believe that there is a lot of confusion
among students about even basic things like

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.319
position vector, line vector, unit vector
and magnitude.

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:36.060
I think if you can really focus on this video,
and try to understand the different between

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.120
position vector, line vector — that will
clarify a lot of things for you.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.100
Let me start by defining the position vector.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.100
First, before I go into position vector, let
me just briefly summarize vectors for you

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.600
in case you are not familiar.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:05.449
I believe you have already learned about vectors
in chapter of physics like kinematics, forces.

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.899
You should know that vectors are quantities
that have both magnitude and direction.

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.700
And they are very important for scientific
studies in general.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.270
Let me start by defining position vector.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:43.119
So position vector, is a vector connecting
origin to a point.

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.549
And as the names suggest, basically this position
vector is about position of one point.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:56.569
I think this is where a lot of students get
confused.

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:04.350
A good thing about vectors is that they will
be always be in 3 dimensions and they will

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.330
be really helpful in the next chapter of 3
dimensional geometry.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.250
It is important for you to understand position
vectors and like line vector, unit vector.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.900
So let us just initially focus on position
vector.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.840
So what is the definition: a position vector
is a vector connecting origin to a point.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.930
Let us say we have a point P with coordinates
Px Py Pz.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:40.000
Let us call this x axis, y axis and z axis.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.370
Position vector is a vector connecting origin,
which is O to the point P, and pointing in

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.370
direction on P.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.590
This direction is very important because if
it is in the opposite direction, then the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.750
vector will be opposite.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:05.060
When we write OP vector (this is called OP
vector), the first letter is from where the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.220
arrow line connects to second point (or the
second alphabet, which is P in this case).

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.950
OP vector also signifies the direction of
the vector.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:26.880
What I am trying to say is that if you have
OP vector then the vector will start from

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.120
O and end at P.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.470
In this case, OP vector means Px \i_cap .. (I
hope you are familiar with \i_cap: \i_cap

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:45.070
means the direction of x-axis) .. + Py \j_cap
+ Pz \k_cap.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.890
So x axis, y axis and z axis.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:04:09.670
Another point you might want to note is that
magnitude of OP vector is (Px^2+Py^2+Pz^2)^(1/2).

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:20.760
Let us do a quick example.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:34.530
If we have a point
A with coordinates (3,2,1).

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:58.500
What is position vector and its magnitude?

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:19.070
And the answer is: OA vector = 3 \i_cap +
2 \j_cap + \k_cap and OA vector magnitude

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:35.080
= (3^2+2^2+1^2)^(1/2) = 14^(1.2).

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.780
Position vector is always for a point.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.110
Please do not forget this basic definition
of position vector.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.800
Trust me that it will happen sometimes during
the chapter of vector that you will get confused

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.290
if you forget this definition.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.480
So please try to remember that position vector
is always and always for a point.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.780
Now let us try to move to new type of vectors
called the line vector.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.190
Position vector is for a point.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.660
Line vector is for a line.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.830
As simple as that.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:16.190
If you have a line, let us say connecting
two points A and B.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:23.910
If I write a vector here and b vector here,
what does this mean?

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.600
a vector is for point A and b vector is for
point B.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.920
Whenever you see something like this in brackets,
it means it is for a point, or it is a position

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.920
vector.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:43.690
In other words, a vector is OA vector and
b vector is OB vector.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:50.690
And OA vectors and OB vector are position
vectors of point A and B.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.270
Even this basic definition gets people really
confused.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.520
So whenever you see a point and something
written in the bracket, that always means

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.090
a position vector.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.860
So what does line vector mean?

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.580
Line vector means connecting two points.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:13.610
If we have AB vector: starting from A and
ending at B.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.580
Arrow goes from A to B.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.070
This vector is defined as b vector - a vector.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:28.310
Or in other words, AB = OB - OA.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:42.570
Let us try to take one quick example to help
us understand this concept.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:08:07.860
What is the vector
joining \sin(\theta) \i_cap + \cos(\theta)

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:19.949
\j_cap and (0,0,1).

00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:36.070
What is its magnitude?

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:41.610
Let us try to find the answer.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:45.430
It might be little confusing because of the
way it is written here.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:50.130
\sin(\theta) \i_cap + \cos(\theta) \j_cap
is basically a point for which you have been

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.440
given a position vector.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:09:04.020
\theta can be any parameter basically — \theta
is an angle and a parameter here.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:11.149
We have not been given a value but we can
still calculate the answer.

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:14.770
b vector is \k_cap.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:30.200
What will be b - a? It will be, \k_cap - \sin(\theta)
\i_cap - \cos(\theta) \j_cap.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:37.640
And thus magnitude of AB vector would be similar
to the way we defined vector magnitude: squaring

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:50.660
all the components i.e. ( -\sin(\theta) ) ^2
+ ( - \cos (\theta) )^2 + 1^2 )^(1.2). And

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:57.520
\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1. So AB
vector magnitude is 2^(1/2).

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:05.460
In this part I just wanted to emphasize that
line vector is for a line and position vector

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.700
is for a point.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:12.700
Now there are also vectors which people get
confused about.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:18.480
Here, both the vectors were fixed i.e. the
vectors started from A and went to B.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.640
This started from O and went to P.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:28.880
However, you should realize that sometimes
vectors are not fixed. They are only fixed in the

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.680
magnitude and the direction but aren’t fixed
in the position.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:52.000
For instance, if I have been given a vector
a and I have been told that it is \i_cap +

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:58.720
\j_cap + \k_cap and I have not been given
any other information about this.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.490
What would this vector represent? This vector
could represent a lot of things.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:13.070
For instance, it can represent a point such
that OA vector for a point (1,1,1) would be

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.480
\i_cap + \j_cap + \k_cap.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:21.760
Similarly, this can also represent a line
vector which it can be (b_vector - a_vector).

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:28.520
It can join two points and the difference
can come as \i_cap + \j_cap + \k_cap.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:35.280
By free vector I just know the direction and
magnitude. It is free to translate in 3-D

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.280
space.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:42.940
Let us say this is the vector. If this vector
freely translates — it is not changing its

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.649
direction and it is not changing its magnitude.

00:11:46.649 --> 00:11:54.470
If you have not been specified whether a vector
starts from origin or a position, or it joins

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:57.959
two points, it can also be a free vector.

00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:07.040
I want to emphasize this you will see later
in this chapter that many times people get

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:13.120
confused about free vectors as they are not
able to understand it. They also get confused

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:20.040
about the vector connecting two points, and
when they see notation — a_vector in the

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.630
brackets and b_vector in the brackets.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:31.980
Just to summarize: whenever you see a point,
it always means a position vector.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.660
Whenever you see a vector joining two points,
it means a line vector which can be calculated

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.370
like this.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:42.130
Whenever you see something just written like
this and not specified whether it is a point

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.550
or whether it is a line vector, that means
it is a free vector which only has a fix magnitude

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.980
and a direction and can move freely around
the space.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:57.199
Till now I have only talked about the magnitude
of the vector here: you can just take x_component

00:12:57.199 --> 00:13:00.420
^ 2 + y_component^2 + z_component^3 and take
a square root of that.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:07.480
However, there is something that is also important
for a vector and that is its direction.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.530
So let me start by defining unit vector.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:21.200
Whenever I write a vector_a, I can also write
vector_a as magnitude of vector_a into unit

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.850
vector.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:24.990
What does this mean?

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:34.000
This means that a vector has some magnitude
which you can calculate by squaring x_component,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.350
y_component, z_component, and adding them
and taking a square root. And this a_cap is

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.790
nothing but a unit vector.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:53.589
Something which I really prefer to use is
to call it “direction”.

00:13:53.589 --> 00:13:56.310
Unit vector and direction are synonymous.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:01.190
So whenever you see a vector: it is multiplication
of its magnitude and its direction (or its

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:02.190
unit vectors).

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:18.209
For instance, if we have to calculate unit
vector of a_vector. Then you can write a_cap

00:14:18.209 --> 00:14:19.460
as vector_a / | a |

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:31.470
Vector_a in this case is \i_cap + \j_cap +
\k_cap.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:39.040
And | a | = (1^2+1^2+1^2)^(1/2), and this
means (\i_cap + j_cap + \k_cap)/3^(1/2).

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:51.670
In other words I can also write that a_vector
= 3^(1/2) ( \i_cap + \j_cap + \k_cap )/3^(1/2).

00:14:51.670 --> 00:15:05.750
This is the direction, this is the unit vector
and this is the magnitude.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:10.070
Let us write another question.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:22.360
What is the direction of x-axis?

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:31.540
Direction means a unit vector. So in that
case a_cap would be direction or something

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:37.880
with the magnitude of 1. We know the direction
of x-axis is \i_cap and it also has a magnitude

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.779
of 1. So it is just \i_cap. \i_cap is nothing
but a direction.

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:49.820
So whenever I write Px \i_cap + Py \j_cap
+ Pz \k_cap, it means I have moved Px in the

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:57.750
x direction, and then I have moved Py in the
y direction, and then I have moved Pz in the

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.889
k direction.

00:15:59.889 --> 00:16:04.300
That is how you define direction by unit vectors.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.510
In this video we covered very basic stuff.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.750
Position vector refers to a point.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.730
Line vector refers to vector joining two points.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:15.290
Free vectors refers to a vector which is neither
a point nor a line, and something that can

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:19.590
move freely around the space though it has
a fixed magnitude and fixed direction.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:25.140
Unit vector means the direction where you
divide the vector by its magnitude. We did

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.470
a quick calculation to see that.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:33.250
I hope this was clear. Just take some time
and digest these things. And in the next video

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.360
we will talk about addition of vectors and
section formula. Thank you.
