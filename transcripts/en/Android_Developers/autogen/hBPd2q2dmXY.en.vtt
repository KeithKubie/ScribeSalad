simply hide all of the views that aren't
 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.220
simply hide all of the views that aren't
relevant to the overlay for example if

when designing for pip overlays have a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
when designing for pip overlays have a
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.670
when designing for pip overlays have a
fixed aspect ratio you configure in code

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680
fixed aspect ratio you configure in code
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.250
fixed aspect ratio you configure in code
this lets you specify the perfect aspect

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
this lets you specify the perfect aspect
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.340

video when in pip mode your activity
 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.580
video when in pip mode your activity
won't get any touch events instead you

pip mode and there's one more detail to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
pip mode and there's one more detail to
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.580
pip mode and there's one more detail to
note when an activity enters pip mode it

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
note when an activity enters pip mode it
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.620
note when an activity enters pip mode it
starts a new task without a back stack

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
starts a new task without a back stack
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.109

when it exits pip mode it does not bring

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
when it exits pip mode it does not bring
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.999
when it exits pip mode it does not bring
back the original task so by default

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009
back the original task so by default
 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.670
back the original task so by default
back will leave your app your users

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680
