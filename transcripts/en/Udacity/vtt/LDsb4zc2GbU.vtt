00:00:00.106 --> 00:00:01.014
To sum this exercise.

00:00:01.014 --> 00:00:04.542
First, I'll want to check out the most recent commit again using the commit ID

00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:05.910
that I noted down.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.610
This is in the instructor's notes in case you forgot it.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.160
Then I'll do a git log.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.360
And I want to check out each of these commits one at a time until I

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.130
find the one with the bug.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:15.830
If I do that,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.920
I'll find that this commit has the bug and the previous commit does not.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.870
That means that the commit starting with 25ed is the one that

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.640
introduced the bug and this commit ID is the answer to the quiz.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.936
If we want to know exactly how the bug got introduced,

00:00:30.936 --> 00:00:33.530
we can use git diff to compare the commits.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.880
I'll do that now so git diff.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.910
Then the first commit ID.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.340
Then the second.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.748
As you can see in addition to some other changes, this commit removed the line,

00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:46.280
delayBeforeBullet equals 10.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.830
It's not surprising that this removal would cause the problem we saw.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.160
My guess is that the line was removed accidentally,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.700
while making these other changes
