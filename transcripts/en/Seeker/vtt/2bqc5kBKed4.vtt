00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.959
Hard or Soft?

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:02.959
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW?

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:05.600
THEY BOTH LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME!

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.280
Hey there, Sapna here for Dnews.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.180
From the outside, all water is seemingly the
same: clear, mostly flavorless, two hydrogens,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.230
one oxygen.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.240
But once you get past the basics, water is
actually pretty versatile.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.270
It can be distilled, filtered, tap, bottled,
and if you’re real fancy, there’s water

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.890
marketed as kosher, organic or kabbalah.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.540
But did you know water can also be hard or
soft?

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.720
No, this isn’t to describe how the water
actually feels.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.030
It actually has to do with its mineral content.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.440
Water becomes ‘hard’ when it has a higher
than normal concentration of minerals, primarily

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.530
calcium and magnesium.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.810
Water picks up these minerals from rocks and
soil as it flows through rivers, wells or

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.900
other waterways.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.000
Soft water, on the other hand, has a low mineral
content, either because it has not yet flowed

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.360
through rocks or wells - like rain water - or
because the rocks it has come in contact with

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.670
have little to no soluble minerals.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.700
But that isn’t to say that there is a set
amount of hard and soft water on earth.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.079
Because of the hydrologic cycle, our water
fluctuates between hard and soft.

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.799
For instance, water that lives in oceans or
streams tends to be hard, because it has already

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.229
picked up minerals.

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.270
But when this water evaporates and later becomes
rain, it leaves these minerals behind and

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.369
becomes soft.

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.770
It’s important to note that water is not
just ‘hard’ or ‘soft’.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.110
It’s a spectrum, with water becoming more
hard as its mineral concentration increases.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.469
The United States Geological Survey classifies
soft water as anything with less than 61 mg

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.749
of calcium carbonate per liter.

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:44.930
Above that is moderately hard water, then
hard water, and very hard water.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.919
According to the US Department of Energy,
almost 75 percent of US homes have water that

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:52.079
is at least moderately hard.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.649
Probably the best place to see the difference
between hard and soft water is in the bathtub.

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.819
Soap is primarily made of a white solid called
sodium stearate, which, with the help of water,

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.929
carries away dirt and oil.

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.560
Normally the components of soap dissolve in
water, causing a really good lather, but in

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.700
hard water, the soap reacts with the minerals,
forming insoluble compounds.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.640
For example, the magnesium in hard water reacts
with the stearate to form magnesium stearate..This

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.060
makes it more difficult to get a good lather
in hard water.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.530
It also cause the soap= scum you see on the
sides of tub..

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.080
Hard water can also leave behind limescale,
which occurs when water is heated or when

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.430
it sits for too long, and the minerals solidify
as the water evaporates.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.230
As you may have noticed in your own home,
limescale looks gross and is really difficult

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.030
to get off of pots and faucets.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.390
To avoid this, a lot of people choose to ‘soften’
their water.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.380
An easy way to do this is by boiling water,
which causes the calcium carbonate to evaporate,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.800
leaving the remaining water soft.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.800
Some cities also choose to soften their water,
removing some of these minerals at the water

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.800
treatment plant before it goes out to consumers.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.200
However there is another type of hardness
called ‘permanent hardness’ that cannot

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.620
be boiled away.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.010
Water becomes permanently hard when it flows
through rocks with calcium sulfate, also known

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.020
as gypsum, which cannot be removed through
boiling.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.820
But despite its name, water with permanent
hardness can be made soft.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.380
The most common way of doing this is adding
a chemical softener that filters out many

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.540
of the minerals.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.670
But you may not be compelled to do this.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.590
Because beyond difficulties with bathing and
some household chores like laundry and dishes,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.710
both hard and soft water are generally thought
to be safe to drink, cook with and bathe in

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.060
especially if the water has gone through a
treatment plant, at least in the United States.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.710
However some cities do choose to soften their
water, removing some of these minerals at

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.830
the water treatment plant before it goes out
to consumers.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.280
If you’re curious whether the stuff coming
out of your tap is hard or soft, take a swig.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.930
You can usually taste the minerals in hard
water, whereas soft water is a bit more flat,

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.890
and can sometimes taste slightly salty.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.340
So that covers fresh water, but what about
salt water?

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.680
Why can’t we drink it?

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.190
Trace answers that question here.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.830
Got any more questions about water?
