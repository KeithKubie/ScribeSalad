00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.110
Pete.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.170
This is really annoying.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.600
&gt;&gt; What's that?

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.440
&gt;&gt; Well I'm on google.com/finance and
this is ridiculous.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.120
I have to pinch and

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.850
zoom like crazy and look my fingers
take up like half the screen.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.219
How am I supposed to hit a button
that's only ten pixels tall?

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and try and look at that same
site on your TV and it's just as bad.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.490
&gt;&gt; Come on.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.640
People don't actually do
that to themselves do they?

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.440
&gt;&gt; It's crazy.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.710
They do.
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.550
&gt;&gt; The mobile market is growing
faster than any other market.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.130
And if you're a web developer and
not building for mobile devices,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.050
you're just going to
lose all of your users.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.900
That's the core concept
behind responsive design.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.510
Make your content work
across any device.
