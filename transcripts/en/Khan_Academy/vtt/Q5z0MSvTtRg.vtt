00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.540
We're on problem 16.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.225
They draw the axes.

00:00:07.225 --> 00:00:10.880
x-axis, that's the y-axis.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.250
I wish there was the parabola
drawing tool

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.430
here, but there isn't.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.240
There's the parabola, it looks
something like this.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.840
They tell us that this
is the point 1.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.450
Fair enough.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.460
This is, of course, the y-axis,
this is the x-axis.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.870
The figure above show that the
graph of a quadratic function

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.000
h who's maximum value
is h of 2.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.560
So this is its maximum
value right here.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.760
When x is equal to 2, its
maximum is h of 2.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.510
If h of a is equal to 0--
so where does this

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.400
function equal 0?

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.630
It equals 0 two places.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.540
Here and here, right?

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.950
Its y value is 0 in
those two places.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.610
So this could be a or that could
be a, we don't know.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.150
Which of the following
could be a?

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.050
So we're saying this could
be a or this could

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.420
be a, we don't know.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.780
And we know that this is 2,
so a is either going to be

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.260
greater than 2 or less than 0.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.340
Or actually, we can actually
figure out what a is, right?

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.620
Because if this is the maximum
point, it's going to be

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.070
symmetric around the point 2.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.990
So the distance from 2 to a on
this side has to be the same

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.810
as the distance from 2 to a on
this one-- Actually that

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.740
doesn't help.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.960
So let's look at the choices.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.040
It could be negative 1--
that looks fair because

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.060
it's less than 0.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.290
a can't be 0-- 0
is this point.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.990
Let me pick a color.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.840
That's 0.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.330
That's definitely not where you
inter-- they draw it so

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.710
that you can't be there.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.120
It can't be 2 because that's
actually where the maximum

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.800
point is, so a definitely
isn't 2.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.730
Can a be 3?

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.280
And this is where the symmetry
comes into play.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.220
We know that it does not
intersect the x-axis for at

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.850
least-- on the left-hand side
you go 1, 2, and then some

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.250
distance which we don't really
know, but you're going more

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.930
than 2 on this side.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.060
So you're also going
to have to go more

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.760
than two on this side.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.140
You're going to have to go 1,
2, and then some distance.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.860
So this is 2, 3, 4.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.940
So you know that a has to be
less than 0, or a has to be

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.430
greater than 4.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.550
And if you look at all of the
choices, the only-- negative 1

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.500
is less than 0.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.880
None of the other ones
are greater than 4.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.020
And how did I know
greater than 4?

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.440
Because it's symmetric.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.190
If this is the maximum point
at 2, and one of the places

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.660
where I intersect the x-axis
is more than 2 to the left,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.050
the other place where I
intersect the x-axis has to be

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.380
more than 2 to the right.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.860
So it has to be greater
than 4.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.850
This has to be less than 0, this
has to be greater than 4.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.480
And that's the answer.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.120
Negative 1.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.770
Next problem.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.750
And you really didn't have to--
once you felt comfortable

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.330
with negative 1 you could have
just said well that's the

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.970
answer because it can very
easily have intersected the

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.400
x-axis at x equals negative 1.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.490
Problem 17-- and that was the
first choice, which tends to

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.900
be convenient.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.330
Let me get a brighter color.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.850
Problem 17.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:19.870
If k and h are constants and
x squared plus kx plus 7 is

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:28.100
equivalent to, equals, x plus 1
times x plus h, what is the

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.500
value of k?

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.330
Well at first sight it doesn't
seem like we could solve this,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.950
but maybe we can, let's try.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:45.470
x squared plus kx plus 7 is
equal to x squared plus x

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.800
plus hx plus h.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.100
And so this equals x squared.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.350
What's 1x-- right, x is
the same thing as 1x--

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.420
what's 1x plus xh?

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:08.810
Well that's 1 plus hx plus h,
right, I just combined these

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.610
two terms, added their
coefficients.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.780
And we say x squared plus kx
plus-- oh, well actually,

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.209
maybe we can solve this because
we can just match up

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:26.840
terms. We say this term matches
up to this term.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.130
This term matches
up to that term.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.590
So we know, h is equal to 7.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.790
And if h is equal to 7, what
is this term equal to?

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.860
That term is going to be
equal to 7 plus 1 is 8.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.570
And this term, what does
this term match up to?

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.270
It matches up to this.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.970
We're just kind of matching
coefficients.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.870
If this is 8 than
k is equal to 8.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.650
And that's choice D.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.430
At first I was like how am
I going to solve this?

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.710
That's why you should always
just move forward and see if

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.340
you see any patterns.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.590
Next problem.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:22.530
Problem 18.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:29.590
y, x, and then they
draw a line here,

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.840
something like that.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:45.440
You go from A to C-- oh, the
line keeps going, and then

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.010
there's the point up here,
which is the point

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.510
here, this is 4,10.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.740
So this is 10 and this is 4.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.080
This is A, B, C.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.700
In the figure above if the
legs of triangle ABC are

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.540
parallel to the axes-- this is
parallel to that, this is

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.620
parallel to that, so this is
going to be a right angle.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.950
Which of the following could
be the lengths of

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.230
the sides of ABC.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.110
Interesting.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.200
So this is really just a slope
problem because what they want

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.990
you do is figure out the ratio
of this side to this side.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.270
So what is the slope
of this line?

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:33.470
Well it rose 10-- change in y
over change in x is equal to

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.520
10 minus 0, which is 10 over
4 minus 0, which is 4.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.300
That equals 5 over 2.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.640
So for every one it moved
to the right, it's going

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.030
to go 5 over 2 up.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.220
So if this is x, this is
going to be 5 over 2x.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.510
So first we should look for--
the two shorter sides are

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.000
going to have this ratio.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.030
1 to 5 over 2.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.000
So if you look at the first
choice, choice A, 2 and 5, if

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.760
this is 2, if x is equal to 2,
then what's 2 times 5 or 2?

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.210
Well this will be 5, right?

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.370
That'll be 5.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.240
So that satisfies that ratio.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.300
And you could even figure out
rise is 5 when run is 2, which

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.870
is the slope of 5 over 2.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.400
Now you just have to confirm
that they gave the right

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.960
length for this longer side.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.830
So we just us Pythagorean
Theorem.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.050
The length of that side's going
to be the square root of

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.490
this squared plus
this squared.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.980
The square root of 4 plus
25, which equals the

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.310
square root of 29.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.370
So the sides could be
2, 5 squared to 29.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.270
And that is choice A.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.405
Choice B has 2 and 5, but then
it gives 7, assuming that you

00:07:44.405 --> 00:07:46.360
didn't know how to do the
Pythagorean Theorem.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.610
Next problem.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.760
Problem 19.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:08:00.140
Let f be defined by f of x
is equal to 2x minus 1.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:08.020
If 1/2 times f of the square
root of t is equal to 4, what

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.200
is the value of t?

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.490
So let's just evaluate
this expression.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.620
So it's 1/2 times what?

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.265
f of the square root of t-- so
everywhere we see x we stick

00:08:17.265 --> 00:08:18.870
in a square root of t.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.570
So 1/2-- that 1/2 is
just this 1/2.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.960
f of the square root of t
is 2 times the square

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.570
root of t minus 1.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.040
I just replaced x with
the square root of t.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.930
And we know that
this equals 4.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.280
Let's multiply both sides by 1/2
and you get-- or multiply

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.510
both sides by 2-- the 1/2
gets canceled out here.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.429
So you get 2 square root of
t minus 1 is equal to 8.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:45.480
And you get 2 square root of 5,
adding 1 to both sides is

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.420
equal to 9.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.010
Let me continue it here.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.960
Divide both sides by 2 you get
the square root of t is equal

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.140
to 9 over 2.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.130
And now we can square
both sides of this.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.220
So you get t is equal to--
what's 9 over 2 squared?

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.910
It's 81 over 4, and
that is choice E.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.610
And then let's see
if I have time.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:09.520
I have 50 seconds.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.040
Let me see if I can squeeze
in video 20 in here.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.450
If k is a positive integer,
which of the following must

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.330
represent an even integer
that is twice the

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.260
value of an odd integer.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.840
So k is any positive integer.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.060
So I want an even number
that is twice the

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.930
value of an odd integer.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.920
So an odd integer-- if this is
any integer, an odd integer

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.080
can be represented this--
2 times k plus 1.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.970
This is definitely going
to be odd integer.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.580
You can try it out with
k is 1, 2 or 3.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.840
So if I want double this,
I just multiply it by 2,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:50.110
I get 4k plus 2.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:51.590
And that is choice E.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.330
And you could try it out
with some numbers.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.380
You just have to take my word
that that has to be an odd
