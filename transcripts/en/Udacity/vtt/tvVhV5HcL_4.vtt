All right, Andy. That was a lot of clicking.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.490
What did you think your first approval on workflow?

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.780
&gt;&gt; It was a lot of clicking. I thought it was

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.610
pretty cool. I really liked that workflows, you know, add so much

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.770
efficiency. This one event causes this, causes that, causes that. That's

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.470
very cool. the benefits for approval processes was a little less clear.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.370
&gt;&gt; Approval processes are really similar to workflow,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.440
but, it was a little bit inauthentic in

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.890
the way that we built it, because, you

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.690
know, we were the submitter and the approver.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.800
&gt;&gt; Right. I guess you're right. If this were a

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.130
real music festival, we'd have, you know, however many hundreds

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.560
of people and they're all depending on each other and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.190
things need to get done and need to get done quickly.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.716
&gt;&gt; And they might not know who they're sending stuff to.

00:00:37.716 --> 00:00:37.869
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:39.770
&gt;&gt; Because you don't know everyone that you work with at a huge

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.480
company. So it really helps you

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.250
streamline the process of getting things approved.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.600
&gt;&gt; So, I'm a huge fan of all this efficiency improvements we've gained.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.750
The only thing that would make this even cooler is if I could

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.350
do it on my phone.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.210
&gt;&gt; And we can. So let's, let's do it.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.910
&gt;&gt; Cool.
