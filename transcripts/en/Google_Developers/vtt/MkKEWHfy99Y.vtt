00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:10.301
Modern apps are highly asynchronous.

00:00:10.307 --> 00:00:14.107
Anything can happen
at any time, in any order.

00:00:14.108 --> 00:00:17.488
You can think of these events
as streams of data.

00:00:17.488 --> 00:00:20.944
Dart has great support
for asynchronous streams of data,

00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:23.044
using streams.

00:00:23.044 --> 00:00:25.777
How do you use streams in a Flutter app?

00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:28.321
Use the <i>StreamBuilder</i> widget.

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:32.701
<i>StreamBuilder</i> will listen to events
flowing from the stream.

00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:36.781
For every new event,
it will rebuild the sentence,

00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:39.351
giving them the latest event to work with.

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:42.485
Start by giving <i>StreamBuilder</i> a stream.

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:43.885
Just plug it in.

00:00:43.885 --> 00:00:45.635
Then write the builder.

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:47.818
Given a snapshot,

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:50.828
declare what should this part
of your app look like.

00:00:51.221 --> 00:00:53.121
You can provide initial data

00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:55.731
so that your widget has something to show

00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:58.057
while it's waiting for the first event.

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:02.767
Otherwise, make sure you're checking
if the snapshot has data.

00:01:03.097 --> 00:01:06.627
If it doesn't yet,
you can show a loading indicator.

00:01:07.048 --> 00:01:10.508
For more granularity,
check ConnectionState.

00:01:11.062 --> 00:01:13.102
As always, check for errors.

00:01:13.722 --> 00:01:16.722
<i>snapshot.hasError</i> is your friend.

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:21.172
You can use <i>StreamBuilder</i>
with data from Firebase, sensor events,

00:01:21.172 --> 00:01:23.872
even network connection status.

00:01:23.872 --> 00:01:27.453

and all the other widgets,
