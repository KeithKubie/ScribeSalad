00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
*COMMENTS EXPLODE ON SCREEN*

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.720
From the film maker behind the movie about the jazz guy

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.080
Who likes jazz SO much he ends up alone!

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.720
Comes a movie about a jazz guy who likes jazz SO much he ends up alone!

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.140
MAN!

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.780
What did jazz do to Damien Chazelle?

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.660
LA LA LAND

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.760
Witness one of the most Oscar-nominated films

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.440
of ALL time!

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.560
That will have future generations saying:

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.560
Musical about show buisness?

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.160
Well no wonder the academy left it up!

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.440
And this tale of passion

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.940
Love

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.040
and ditching all that nonsense when your career takes off!

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.140
As two ambitious people follow their Hollywood dreams

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.360
Until the romance almost gets in the way

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.340
PHEW!

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.620
Dodged that bullet!

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.080
You two almost had a compromise!

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.640
Journey to a fantasy version of Los Angeles

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.140
Where the landmarks are never crowded

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500
No one takes their phones out before jumping in the pool

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.540
And gridlock is just a chance to free a jazz quartet from human traffickers

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.500
Don't start playing!

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.900
NOWS YOUR CHANCE!

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.660
RUN!

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.800
Meet Sebastian &amp; Mia

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.780
She loves acting!

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.180
And wants to be an actress (duh)

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.520
He loves jazz and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.140
wants to be a...

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.880
uh

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.940
Jazz-isist?

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.940
Watch as these two hotties pursue their goals with single-minded ambition

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.480
And complete disregard for anything that isn't them

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.620
whether its their neighbors

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.880
theater audiences

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.520
DOWN IN FRONT!

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.820
This buisness

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.960
the jobs that pay them to live

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.100
the 14 people on this email change she didn't BCC

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.080
or these guys trying to put on a concert

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.480
"It's brand new every night. Very, very exciting"

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.280
Then if you wanted to like jazz,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.040
YOU SHOULDN'T TALK THE WHOLE TIME THEY ARE PLAYING!!!

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.080
God, your so lucky you look like Ryan Gosling!

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.680
Settle in for a film that *clears throat* borrows

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.620
from the great musicals from the past

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.660
that proves it's easier to teach a world-class singer how to act than two world-class actors how to sing

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.080
as Ryan and Emma's relationship radiates with effortless chemistry

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.920
and their dancing radiates with the general lack of effort

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.660
C'MON JAKE! THERE WERE SIMILAR OTHER HITS! THEY'RE RUSHING! THEY'RE DRAGGING!

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.520
THEY'RE..

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.400
doing whatever that is...

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.700
so sing along

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.820
for a beautiful looking film

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.600
that goes down sweeter than a cake made entirely out of frosting

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.400
featuring unforgettable songs like

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.840
The Los Angeles song

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.140
Guys, GUYS! Ugh, I'm sorry. No. There... There's been a huge mistake...I..

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.940
MOONLIGHT!

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.040
You guys are this week's honest trailer!

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.180
This is not a joke guys!

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.400
Moonlight, this is your honest trailer!

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.240
but...all we have left is another La La Land song!

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.280
are we seriously gonna do this? C; (yas)

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.620
uh.. uh oh... ok

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.740
Starring

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.540
Did I say it right? SCORE!

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.380
You know, it's frustrating that these two great movies will always be stuck together

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.780
Wait... we're not helping are we?
