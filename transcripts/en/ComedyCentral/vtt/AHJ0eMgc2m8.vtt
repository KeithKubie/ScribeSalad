was supposed to be

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:08.341
a romantic summer getaway.

you say about staying

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.344

place is perfect, dear.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.215

parties, no old people.

don't go in that closet

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.848

nothing in there.

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.550

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.700
- [Voiceover] If something
seems too good to be true,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.935
it probably is.
