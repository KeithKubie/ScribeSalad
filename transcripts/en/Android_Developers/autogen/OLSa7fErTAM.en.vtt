00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250
design yeah I think you know that I
 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.860
design yeah I think you know that I
think the two major things for me was

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870
think the two major things for me was
 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.020
think the two major things for me was
the kind of inconsistent styling which

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030
the kind of inconsistent styling which
 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.360
the kind of inconsistent styling which
wasn't really you know the Android holo

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370
wasn't really you know the Android holo
 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.220
wasn't really you know the Android holo
type theme that you would expect perhaps

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230
type theme that you would expect perhaps
 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.330
type theme that you would expect perhaps
and coupled with just some unclarity

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340
and coupled with just some unclarity
 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.670
and coupled with just some unclarity
about what the iconography meant and how

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680
about what the iconography meant and how
 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.110
about what the iconography meant and how
to actually use the app I kind of found

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120
to actually use the app I kind of found
 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.250
to actually use the app I kind of found
that if you just look at the screen

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260
that if you just look at the screen
 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.860
that if you just look at the screen
isn't too intuitive how to go about it

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870
isn't too intuitive how to go about it
 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.320
isn't too intuitive how to go about it
so let's see what see what we did with

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330
so let's see what see what we did with
 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.690
so let's see what see what we did with
it okay so let's look at the redesign

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700
it okay so let's look at the redesign
 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.230
it okay so let's look at the redesign
and you can see here that most of the

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240
and you can see here that most of the
 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.690
and you can see here that most of the
the placement I guess the the general

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700
the placement I guess the the general
 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.159
the placement I guess the the general
placement having controls on the left

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169
placement having controls on the left
 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.130
placement having controls on the left
and the right of the screen we kept but

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140
and the right of the screen we kept but
 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.630
and the right of the screen we kept but
we did do a couple of things differently

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640
we did do a couple of things differently
 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.650
we did do a couple of things differently
and let me talk through all those

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660
and let me talk through all those
 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.290
and let me talk through all those
individual points so the first thing is

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300
individual points so the first thing is
 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.940
individual points so the first thing is
that we wanted to simplify the the

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950
that we wanted to simplify the the
 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.790
that we wanted to simplify the the
mental model for users we basically put

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800
mental model for users we basically put
 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.640
mental model for users we basically put
camera and camera related settings on

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650
camera and camera related settings on
 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.010
camera and camera related settings on
the right so you see all on the right

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020
the right so you see all on the right
 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.409
the right so you see all on the right
you see things like you know focus

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419
you see things like you know focus
 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.320
you see things like you know focus
change the camera you know from front to

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330
change the camera you know from front to
 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.860
change the camera you know from front to
back

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870
back
 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.740
back
take a photo settings and then zoom and

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750
take a photo settings and then zoom and
 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.500
take a photo settings and then zoom and
then on the Left we just put effects so

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510
then on the Left we just put effects so
 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.719
then on the Left we just put effects so
everything that is kind of the special

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729
everything that is kind of the special
 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.780
everything that is kind of the special
sauce of this app you know the effects

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790
sauce of this app you know the effects
 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.280
sauce of this app you know the effects
and the cool you know things you can do

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290
and the cool you know things you can do
 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.350
and the cool you know things you can do
to your photos we put on the left so it

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360
to your photos we put on the left so it
 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.740
to your photos we put on the left so it
simplifies the model for users the other

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750
simplifies the model for users the other
 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.969
simplifies the model for users the other
thing that we did and you'll see this

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979
thing that we did and you'll see this
 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.300
thing that we did and you'll see this
later on is that we combined the

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310
later on is that we combined the
 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.060
later on is that we combined the
settings here this kind of shutter type

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070
settings here this kind of shutter type
 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.420
settings here this kind of shutter type
setting with other camera settings that

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430
setting with other camera settings that
 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.969
setting with other camera settings that
were I think under this button we

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979
were I think under this button we
 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.890
were I think under this button we
combined that into a single affordance

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900
combined that into a single affordance
 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.420
combined that into a single affordance
here and we'll see an example of that in

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430
here and we'll see an example of that in
 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.620
here and we'll see an example of that in
a bit

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630
a bit
 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.880
a bit
the other thing I wanted to point out is

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890
the other thing I wanted to point out is
 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.830
the other thing I wanted to point out is
that we we made the actual shutter

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840
that we we made the actual shutter
 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.780
that we we made the actual shutter
button larger and this is actually

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790
button larger and this is actually
 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.900
button larger and this is actually
coming from feedback that Ian mentioned

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910
coming from feedback that Ian mentioned
 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.930
coming from feedback that Ian mentioned
in the app clinic last week is that

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940
in the app clinic last week is that
 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.790
in the app clinic last week is that
basically if you don't have I mean if

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800
basically if you don't have I mean if
 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.469
basically if you don't have I mean if
you place something very close to a

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479
you place something very close to a
 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.450
you place something very close to a
system button like the home button users

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460
system button like the home button users
 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.400
system button like the home button users
are very likely to hit that button

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410
are very likely to hit that button
 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.770
are very likely to hit that button
accidentally and so here what we did was

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780
accidentally and so here what we did was
 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.920
accidentally and so here what we did was
we made the camera button larger both

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930
we made the camera button larger both
 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.810
we made the camera button larger both
horizontally and vertically so the tap

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820
horizontally and vertically so the tap
 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.900
horizontally and vertically so the tap
target is much more obvious we also put

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910
target is much more obvious we also put
 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.360
target is much more obvious we also put
up lights out modes that you hide the

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370
up lights out modes that you hide the
 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.180
up lights out modes that you hide the
the home button the back button in the

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190
the home button the back button in the
 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.219
the home button the back button in the
recent button so that it kind of doesn't

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229
recent button so that it kind of doesn't
 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.420
recent button so that it kind of doesn't
crowd your your vision and another thing

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430
crowd your your vision and another thing
 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.550
crowd your your vision and another thing
I'll mention is that we created where we

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560
I'll mention is that we created where we
 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.290
I'll mention is that we created where we
used more standard iconography

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300
used more standard iconography
 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.360
used more standard iconography
throughout in a standard style we use

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370
throughout in a standard style we use
 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.719
throughout in a standard style we use
the holo holo light star actually holo

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:19.729
the holo holo light star actually holo
 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.960
the holo holo light star actually holo
dark style on a semi-transparent action

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:22.970
dark style on a semi-transparent action
 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.480
dark style on a semi-transparent action
bar so you'll see here that a lot of

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490
bar so you'll see here that a lot of
 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.760
bar so you'll see here that a lot of
these icons are more common icons I do

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770
these icons are more common icons I do
 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.810
these icons are more common icons I do
want to point out that some of these

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820
want to point out that some of these
 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.630
want to point out that some of these
icons are actually from Android icons

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640
icons are actually from Android icons
 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.540
icons are actually from Android icons

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890
and couldn't throw his work on the first
 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.950
and couldn't throw his work on the first
episode of the show so a lot of these

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960
episode of the show so a lot of these
 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.690
episode of the show so a lot of these
icons are from there as well so thanks

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700
icons are from there as well so thanks
 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.110
icons are from there as well so thanks
good they're the last thing I want to

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120
good they're the last thing I want to
 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.220
good they're the last thing I want to
mention is I guess about actually

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230
mention is I guess about actually
 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.980
mention is I guess about actually
there's a caveat here you'll notice that

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990
there's a caveat here you'll notice that
 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.110
there's a caveat here you'll notice that
you know there's there's these action

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120
you know there's there's these action
 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.490
you know there's there's these action
but or not really action bars there are

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500
but or not really action bars there are
 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.220
but or not really action bars there are
these control bars on the left and the

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230
these control bars on the left and the
 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.080
these control bars on the left and the
right and they're semi-transparent now

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090
right and they're semi-transparent now
 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.490
right and they're semi-transparent now
if you've developed a camera app before

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500
if you've developed a camera app before
 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.680
if you've developed a camera app before
you may think oh you know it's not

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690
you may think oh you know it's not
 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.360
you may think oh you know it's not
always the case that I can get a full

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:03.370
always the case that I can get a full
 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.700
always the case that I can get a full
screen you know picture a full screen

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710
screen you know picture a full screen
 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.970
screen you know picture a full screen
view so in those cases you know when you

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:08.980
view so in those cases you know when you
 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.080
view so in those cases you know when you
don't have a full screen view there are

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090
don't have a full screen view there are
 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.520
don't have a full screen view there are
a couple of options you can do

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:11.530
a couple of options you can do
 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.280
a couple of options you can do
letterboxing you can also choose to make

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:14.290
letterboxing you can also choose to make
 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.320
letterboxing you can also choose to make
either the left or the right control bar

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330
either the left or the right control bar
 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.880
either the left or the right control bar
fully black instead of semi-transparent

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:19.890
fully black instead of semi-transparent
 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.170
fully black instead of semi-transparent
and there's lots of other options that

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:22.180
and there's lots of other options that
 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.000
and there's lots of other options that
you could you I mean I think in in a

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.010
you could you I mean I think in in a
 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.620
you could you I mean I think in in a
very fancy case you could even kind of

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:25.630
very fancy case you could even kind of
 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.650
very fancy case you could even kind of
start kind of mirroring the edges of the

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:28.660
start kind of mirroring the edges of the
 

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.630
start kind of mirroring the edges of the
screen or mirroring the edges of the

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:30.640
screen or mirroring the edges of the
 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.030
screen or mirroring the edges of the
preview around the borders things like

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:33.040
preview around the borders things like
 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.340
preview around the borders things like
that anyway so that's that's the design

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:35.350
that anyway so that's that's the design
 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.410
that anyway so that's that's the design
at a glance Nick you have any comments

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:37.420
at a glance Nick you have any comments
 

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.140
at a glance Nick you have any comments
on the difference between the two yeah I

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.150
on the difference between the two yeah I
 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.690
on the difference between the two yeah I
instantly loved their improvements on

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:42.700
instantly loved their improvements on
 

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.680
instantly loved their improvements on
the shutter button because you've

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:43.690
the shutter button because you've
 

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.010
the shutter button because you've
managed to marry the kind of visual

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020
managed to marry the kind of visual
 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.120
managed to marry the kind of visual
identity of the application and so if

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.130
identity of the application and so if
 

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.620
identity of the application and so if
you go to these applications listing on

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:49.630
you go to these applications listing on
 

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.790
you go to these applications listing on
the Play Store it has these kind of

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800
the Play Store it has these kind of
 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.550
the Play Store it has these kind of
colorful elements which you've you've

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560
colorful elements which you've you've
 

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.290
colorful elements which you've you've
picked out in the shutter button really

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:55.300
picked out in the shutter button really
 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.030
picked out in the shutter button really
really nicely and I'm also a big fan of

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:57.040
really nicely and I'm also a big fan of
 

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.770
really nicely and I'm also a big fan of
using the the overlay style the

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:58.780
using the the overlay style the
 

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.870
using the the overlay style the
semi-transparent kind of button bars as

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:00.880
semi-transparent kind of button bars as
 

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.700
semi-transparent kind of button bars as
well because it makes it makes you feel

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:02.710
well because it makes it makes you feel
 

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.440
well because it makes it makes you feel
like the picture is filling the whole

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:04.450
like the picture is filling the whole
 

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.970
like the picture is filling the whole
window and which is you know it's a

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:05.980
window and which is you know it's a
 

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.110
window and which is you know it's a
camera app this is what it's all about

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120
camera app this is what it's all about
 

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.000
camera app this is what it's all about
taking a photo so I love the way that

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.010
taking a photo so I love the way that
 

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.010
taking a photo so I love the way that
we've extended that photo tip to fill

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:11.020
we've extended that photo tip to fill
 

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.840
we've extended that photo tip to fill
the edges where possible so that's one

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:12.850
the edges where possible so that's one
 

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.510
the edges where possible so that's one
of my to my favorites yeah and like I

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520
of my to my favorites yeah and like I
 

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.650
of my to my favorites yeah and like I
mentioned before I mean one of the

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:16.660
mentioned before I mean one of the
 

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.360
mentioned before I mean one of the
hardest things is getting a photo to

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:18.370
hardest things is getting a photo to
 

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.630
hardest things is getting a photo to
fill I actually don't know about Ice

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:21.640
fill I actually don't know about Ice
 

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.850
fill I actually don't know about Ice
Cream Sandwich or jelly bean if we have

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:23.860
Cream Sandwich or jelly bean if we have
 

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.740
Cream Sandwich or jelly bean if we have
this but I mean one option is you know

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:25.750
this but I mean one option is you know
 

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.960
this but I mean one option is you know
if you if you can maybe even kind of

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:27.970
if you if you can maybe even kind of
 

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.640
if you if you can maybe even kind of
crop the image that you don't see the

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:29.650
crop the image that you don't see the
 

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.060
crop the image that you don't see the
top and the bottom or you know there's

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:33.070
top and the bottom or you know there's
 

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.200
top and the bottom or you know there's
lots of different options but that's

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:34.210
lots of different options but that's
 

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.030
lots of different options but that's
just as somebody that's worked on a

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:36.040
just as somebody that's worked on a
 

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.370
just as somebody that's worked on a
camera before it's definitely something

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:38.380
camera before it's definitely something
 

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.870
camera before it's definitely something
that that comes up like it is kind of

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880
that that comes up like it is kind of
 

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.820
that that comes up like it is kind of
difficult to do but if you can do it

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:41.830
difficult to do but if you can do it
 

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.060
difficult to do but if you can do it
your app can look really great

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:43.070
your app can look really great
 

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.810
your app can look really great
so let's move on to the next screen in

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:46.820
so let's move on to the next screen in
 

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.370
so let's move on to the next screen in
this next screen you'll notice that we

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:48.380
this next screen you'll notice that we
 

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.889
this next screen you'll notice that we
moved these some of these kind of deeper

00:08:50.889 --> 00:08:50.899
moved these some of these kind of deeper
 

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:54.639
moved these some of these kind of deeper
nested effects pop-ups again we moved

00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:54.649
nested effects pop-ups again we moved
 

00:08:54.649 --> 00:08:55.990
nested effects pop-ups again we moved
effects from the right to the left to

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000
effects from the right to the left to
 

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.030
effects from the right to the left to
simplify the model for users we moved

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.040
simplify the model for users we moved
 

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.960
simplify the model for users we moved
this kind of panel to the left and so

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:01.970
this kind of panel to the left and so
 

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.600
this kind of panel to the left and so
when you select when you select this

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:04.610
when you select when you select this
 

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:09.129
when you select when you select this
kind of this edit control you see you

00:09:09.129 --> 00:09:09.139
kind of this edit control you see you
 

00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:10.960
kind of this edit control you see you
see the basically this kind of secondary

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:10.970
see the basically this kind of secondary
 

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.509
see the basically this kind of secondary
set of controls to its right and in the

00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519
set of controls to its right and in the
 

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:14.949
set of controls to its right and in the
in the original lab there's actually a

00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959
in the original lab there's actually a
 

00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:17.050
in the original lab there's actually a
third set so you can imagine having you

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:17.060
third set so you can imagine having you
 

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.850
third set so you can imagine having you
know three sets here and at that point

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:18.860
know three sets here and at that point
 

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.040
know three sets here and at that point
you know you're really kind of thinking

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:21.050
you know you're really kind of thinking
 

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.980
you know you're really kind of thinking
more about the controls and like kind of

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:23.990
more about the controls and like kind of
 

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.439
more about the controls and like kind of
finding the thing you want then the

00:09:26.439 --> 00:09:26.449
finding the thing you want then the
 

00:09:26.449 --> 00:09:28.509
finding the thing you want then the
photo so maybe potentially kind of

00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519
photo so maybe potentially kind of
 

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:29.889
photo so maybe potentially kind of
overlaying on top of the photo maybe

00:09:29.889 --> 00:09:29.899
overlaying on top of the photo maybe
 

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:32.559
overlaying on top of the photo maybe
okay but yeah we didn't like go too much

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:32.569
okay but yeah we didn't like go too much
 

00:09:32.569 --> 00:09:33.790
okay but yeah we didn't like go too much
in depth there because at that point

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:33.800
in depth there because at that point
 

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.050
in depth there because at that point
it's really up to the developer what

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:35.060
it's really up to the developer what
 

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.290
it's really up to the developer what
they want to do and I just want to you

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:38.300
they want to do and I just want to you
 

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.610
they want to do and I just want to you
know the interest of time when I switch

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:39.620
know the interest of time when I switch
 

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.490
know the interest of time when I switch
over to this screen and this is where

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:42.500
over to this screen and this is where
 

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.759
over to this screen and this is where
you basically select a shutter type so

00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:45.769
you basically select a shutter type so
 

00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:49.629
you basically select a shutter type so
you can go from a normal to a timer tool

00:09:49.629 --> 00:09:49.639
you can go from a normal to a timer tool
 

00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:50.980
you can go from a normal to a timer tool
I think I actually don't know what a

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:50.990
I think I actually don't know what a
 

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.990
I think I actually don't know what a
collage does but stable shot lots of

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000
collage does but stable shot lots of
 

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.759
collage does but stable shot lots of
different shutter types and that's

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:54.769
different shutter types and that's
 

00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:56.290
different shutter types and that's
really awesome this is a pretty unique

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:56.300
really awesome this is a pretty unique
 

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.699
really awesome this is a pretty unique
feature that it has all these different

00:09:57.699 --> 00:09:57.709
feature that it has all these different
 

00:09:57.709 --> 00:10:00.879
feature that it has all these different
types but again we decided to move that

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:00.889
types but again we decided to move that
 

00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:03.759
types but again we decided to move that
into settings so basically you touch

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:03.769
into settings so basically you touch
 

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:07.300
into settings so basically you touch
settings and then touch normal shutter

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:07.310
settings and then touch normal shutter
 

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.129
settings and then touch normal shutter
type and select which one you want you

00:10:09.129 --> 00:10:09.139
type and select which one you want you
 

00:10:09.139 --> 00:10:10.569
type and select which one you want you
can probably even improve that flow

00:10:10.569 --> 00:10:10.579
can probably even improve that flow
 

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:12.910
can probably even improve that flow
faster by having a special widget at the

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:12.920
faster by having a special widget at the
 

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.860
faster by having a special widget at the
top maybe one that horizontally Scrolls

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:14.870
top maybe one that horizontally Scrolls
 

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.170
top maybe one that horizontally Scrolls
but that's just you know one way to do

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:17.180
but that's just you know one way to do
 

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.329
but that's just you know one way to do
things like that and the reason we did

00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:19.339
things like that and the reason we did
 

00:10:19.339 --> 00:10:21.100
things like that and the reason we did
this was to really just simplify again

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:21.110
this was to really just simplify again
 

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.340
this was to really just simplify again
really simplify this fairly complex app

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:24.350
really simplify this fairly complex app
 

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.920
really simplify this fairly complex app
so that any types of settings related to

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:26.930
so that any types of settings related to
 

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.740
so that any types of settings related to
camera go into one place Nick any

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:29.750
camera go into one place Nick any
 

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.740
camera go into one place Nick any
parting thoughts for camera zoom effects

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:31.750
parting thoughts for camera zoom effects
 

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.030
parting thoughts for camera zoom effects
yeah I love what you've done with this I

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.040
yeah I love what you've done with this I
 

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.650
yeah I love what you've done with this I
think there's a it's a very powerful app

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:35.660
think there's a it's a very powerful app
 

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.759
think there's a it's a very powerful app
which lets you do a lot of different

00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:36.769
which lets you do a lot of different
 

00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:39.340
which lets you do a lot of different
things with images and but having it's

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:39.350
things with images and but having it's
 

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.199
things with images and but having it's
fairly kind of custom UI it means it's

00:10:41.199 --> 00:10:41.209
fairly kind of custom UI it means it's
 

00:10:41.209 --> 00:10:42.670
fairly kind of custom UI it means it's

contacts so I've pulled out the sets and
 

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.590

screen here because as you can see on

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:10.600
screen here because as you can see on
 

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.019
screen here because as you can see on
the tablet you get these kind of

00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:13.029
the tablet you get these kind of
 

00:15:13.029 --> 00:15:15.389
the tablet you get these kind of
horizontal for full width images which

00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:15.399
horizontal for full width images which
 

00:15:15.399 --> 00:15:16.800
horizontal for full width images which
just really don't

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:16.810
just really don't
 

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:18.900
just really don't
scale up to well to err to a larger

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:18.910
scale up to well to err to a larger
 

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.500
scale up to well to err to a larger
device so we've looked at that and we've

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:22.510
device so we've looked at that and we've
 

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:26.360
device so we've looked at that and we've
we've applied a different kind of layout

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:26.370
we've applied a different kind of layout
 

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.680
we've applied a different kind of layout
to really take advantage of the real

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:28.690
to really take advantage of the real
 

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.840
to really take advantage of the real
estate available to you so yeah so I've

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:30.850
estate available to you so yeah so I've
 

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.300
estate available to you so yeah so I've
just moved over to to the redesign

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:33.310
just moved over to to the redesign
 

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.040
just moved over to to the redesign
screen I just want to also point out

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:35.050
screen I just want to also point out
 

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.620
screen I just want to also point out
regarding those full with widgets

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:37.630
regarding those full with widgets
 

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.150
regarding those full with widgets
basically anytime you have anything

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160
basically anytime you have anything
 

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.460
basically anytime you have anything
that's full width on a tablet you have

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:41.470
that's full width on a tablet you have
 

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.170
that's full width on a tablet you have
to you know think twice about it

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:43.180
to you know think twice about it
 

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.850
to you know think twice about it
basically because I mean that's just a

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:44.860
basically because I mean that's just a
 

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.150
basically because I mean that's just a
lot of space you know not even for four

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160
lot of space you know not even for four
 

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.640
lot of space you know not even for four
lines of text but even photos photos are

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:50.650
lines of text but even photos photos are
 

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.230
lines of text but even photos photos are
very very rich right but when you have

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240
very very rich right but when you have
 

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.600
very very rich right but when you have
such an awkward aspect ratio like you

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:54.610
such an awkward aspect ratio like you
 

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.500
such an awkward aspect ratio like you
know a fixed height and a full width row

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:57.510
know a fixed height and a full width row
 

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.450
know a fixed height and a full width row
you don't really kind of get as much out

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:00.460
you don't really kind of get as much out
 

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.640
you don't really kind of get as much out
of it so yeah so I think you want to

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:02.650
of it so yeah so I think you want to
 

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.710
of it so yeah so I think you want to
talk about the redesign yes it's a few

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720
talk about the redesign yes it's a few
 

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.630
talk about the redesign yes it's a few
things we've done here and firstly we

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:06.640
things we've done here and firstly we
 

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.340
things we've done here and firstly we
switched over to a dark theme as well

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:08.350
switched over to a dark theme as well
 

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.850
switched over to a dark theme as well
and as we showed on the login screen the

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:11.860
and as we showed on the login screen the
 

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.710
and as we showed on the login screen the
thinking here is really that as we say

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:13.720
thinking here is really that as we say
 

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.180
thinking here is really that as we say
before we want this to be all about the

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:15.190
before we want this to be all about the
 

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.390
before we want this to be all about the
photos all about the imagery and having

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:18.400
photos all about the imagery and having
 

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.160
photos all about the imagery and having
a darker background really lets those

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:20.170
a darker background really lets those
 

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.990
a darker background really lets those
images kind of stand out really makes

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000
images kind of stand out really makes
 

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.750
images kind of stand out really makes
them pop so that's the reasoning for

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:24.760
them pop so that's the reasoning for
 

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.430
them pop so that's the reasoning for
switching over to the fully dark rather

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:26.440
switching over to the fully dark rather
 

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.200
switching over to the fully dark rather
than the the like thing with dark action

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:28.210
than the the like thing with dark action
 

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.050
than the the like thing with dark action
bars we saw before I've also moved away

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:31.060
bars we saw before I've also moved away
 

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.020
bars we saw before I've also moved away
from the horizontal swiping taps the

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:34.030
from the horizontal swiping taps the
 

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.840
from the horizontal swiping taps the
swiping tabs because that kind of very

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:36.850
swiping tabs because that kind of very
 

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:39.390
swiping tabs because that kind of very
long gesture on a tablet device is it's

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:39.400
long gesture on a tablet device is it's
 

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.820
long gesture on a tablet device is it's
kind of a bit harder isn't as intuitive

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:41.830
kind of a bit harder isn't as intuitive
 

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.920
kind of a bit harder isn't as intuitive
I find for switching between pages of

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:43.930
I find for switching between pages of
 

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:45.750
I find for switching between pages of
content and by putting the tabs out

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:45.760
content and by putting the tabs out
 

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.060
content and by putting the tabs out
right into the action bar where we have

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:48.070
right into the action bar where we have
 

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.610
right into the action bar where we have
more space now and this in this this

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:50.620
more space now and this in this this
 

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.620
more space now and this in this this
size it gives you instant access to

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:52.630
size it gives you instant access to
 

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.930
size it gives you instant access to
switch between those four major views of

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:54.940
switch between those four major views of
 

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.570
switch between those four major views of
your data yeah so the other thing we've

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:57.580
your data yeah so the other thing we've
 

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.340
your data yeah so the other thing we've
already done there we is we've gone for

00:16:59.340 --> 00:16:59.350
already done there we is we've gone for
 

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.590
already done there we is we've gone for
a grid view to get more and to make

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600
a grid view to get more and to make
 

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.120
a grid view to get more and to make
better use of the real estate and

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:03.130
better use of the real estate and
 

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.520
better use of the real estate and
switched it up from vertical to

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:05.530
switched it up from vertical to
 

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.350
switched it up from vertical to
horizontal scrolling so as you can see

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360
horizontal scrolling so as you can see
 

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.420
horizontal scrolling so as you can see
the images are kind of going off to the

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:09.430
the images are kind of going off to the
 

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:09.840
the images are kind of going off to the
right

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:09.850
right
 

00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:11.370
right
so we can scroll horizontally and see

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:11.380
so we can scroll horizontally and see
 

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.800
so we can scroll horizontally and see
more this greens quite heavily I guess

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:13.810
more this greens quite heavily I guess
 

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.930
more this greens quite heavily I guess

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.130
but we really hope we've them we've kind
of captured the spirit of Flickr and

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:23.140
of captured the spirit of Flickr and
 

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.360
of captured the spirit of Flickr and
married it with like a really rich kind

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:24.370
married it with like a really rich kind
 

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:25.370
married it with like a really rich kind
of viewing

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:25.380
of viewing
 

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.960
of viewing
some other minor details that I wanted

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:26.970
some other minor details that I wanted
 

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.480
some other minor details that I wanted
to call out as well as he D emphasized

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:29.490
to call out as well as he D emphasized
 

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.250
to call out as well as he D emphasized
some of the visual information I found

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260
some of the visual information I found
 

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.710
some of the visual information I found
using the glimmer application that there

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720
using the glimmer application that there
 

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.149
using the glimmer application that there
was a lot of information jumping out at

00:17:35.149 --> 00:17:35.159
was a lot of information jumping out at
 

00:17:35.159 --> 00:17:36.830
was a lot of information jumping out at
you competing for my attention from the

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840
you competing for my attention from the
 

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.289
you competing for my attention from the
photos so for example if you look at the

00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299
photos so for example if you look at the
 

00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:41.779
photos so for example if you look at the
visual treatment of an individual set

00:17:41.779 --> 00:17:41.789
visual treatment of an individual set
 

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:45.139
visual treatment of an individual set
here like a folder we've made it you

00:17:45.139 --> 00:17:45.149
here like a folder we've made it you
 

00:17:45.149 --> 00:17:47.779
here like a folder we've made it you
know 90% almost about the picture and

00:17:47.779 --> 00:17:47.789
know 90% almost about the picture and
 

00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:49.310
know 90% almost about the picture and
then there's a very small kind of

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320
then there's a very small kind of
 

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.380
then there's a very small kind of
call-out saying the name of the set and

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:51.390
call-out saying the name of the set and
 

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.690
call-out saying the name of the set and
then less important secondary importance

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:53.700
then less important secondary importance
 

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.549
then less important secondary importance
we kind of like de-emphasize the number

00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559
we kind of like de-emphasize the number
 

00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:57.320
we kind of like de-emphasize the number
of photos in the set so we've used this

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:57.330
of photos in the set so we've used this
 

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.039
of photos in the set so we've used this
kind of relative size and kind of weight

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:01.049
kind of relative size and kind of weight
 

00:18:01.049 --> 00:18:05.149
kind of relative size and kind of weight
of text to show the relative importance

00:18:05.149 --> 00:18:05.159
of text to show the relative importance
 

00:18:05.159 --> 00:18:06.830
of text to show the relative importance
of the information there so I think this

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840
of the information there so I think this
 

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.899
of the information there so I think this
really makes the photo stand out and

00:18:08.899 --> 00:18:08.909
really makes the photo stand out and
 

00:18:08.909 --> 00:18:10.070
really makes the photo stand out and
then if you really want to know how many

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080
then if you really want to know how many
 

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.080
then if you really want to know how many
photos it it's easily accessible but it

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:12.090
photos it it's easily accessible but it
 

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.760
photos it it's easily accessible but it
doesn't compete to your attention to

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:13.770
doesn't compete to your attention to
 

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.930
doesn't compete to your attention to
things I just want to call out

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:14.940
things I just want to call out
 

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.299
things I just want to call out
specifically that I like about the the

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:17.309
specifically that I like about the the
 

00:18:17.309 --> 00:18:20.269
specifically that I like about the the
changes here Nick is just in terms of

00:18:20.269 --> 00:18:20.279
changes here Nick is just in terms of
 

00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:22.669
changes here Nick is just in terms of
just in terms of padding and font

00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679
just in terms of padding and font
 

00:18:22.679 --> 00:18:25.100
just in terms of padding and font
treatment or text treatment you've given

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:25.110
treatment or text treatment you've given
 

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.990
treatment or text treatment you've given
the text like in this case waves right

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000
the text like in this case waves right
 

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.310
the text like in this case waves right
that's the title of this set you've

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320
that's the title of this set you've
 

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.139
that's the title of this set you've
given it slightly more padding around

00:18:30.139 --> 00:18:30.149
given it slightly more padding around
 

00:18:30.149 --> 00:18:31.970
given it slightly more padding around
the table bottom and especially the left

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:31.980
the table bottom and especially the left
 

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.700
the table bottom and especially the left
and using you know either four eight or

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:34.710
and using you know either four eight or
 

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.950
and using you know either four eight or
sixteen dips of padding is usually a

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960
sixteen dips of padding is usually a
 

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.139
sixteen dips of padding is usually a
good idea and I think that that just

00:18:39.139 --> 00:18:39.149
good idea and I think that that just
 

00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:41.720
good idea and I think that that just
helps clean it up a bit in the previous

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:41.730
helps clean it up a bit in the previous
 

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.210
helps clean it up a bit in the previous
or in the current version of the app

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:43.220
or in the current version of the app
 

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.250
or in the current version of the app
you'll notice that these text labels and

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260
you'll notice that these text labels and
 

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.570
you'll notice that these text labels and
it's very hard to see I apologize for

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:47.580
it's very hard to see I apologize for
 

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.850
it's very hard to see I apologize for
that but these text labels they're kind

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:49.860
that but these text labels they're kind
 

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.580
that but these text labels they're kind
of scrunched over to the side

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:52.590
of scrunched over to the side
 

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.919
of scrunched over to the side
and kind of squeezed by the top and

00:18:54.919 --> 00:18:54.929
and kind of squeezed by the top and
 

00:18:54.929 --> 00:18:57.139
and kind of squeezed by the top and
bottom borders of that semi-transparent

00:18:57.139 --> 00:18:57.149
bottom borders of that semi-transparent
 

00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:59.360
bottom borders of that semi-transparent
black box so giving it some more spacing

00:18:59.360 --> 00:18:59.370
black box so giving it some more spacing
 

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.610
black box so giving it some more spacing
just helps bring it out ever so slightly

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:01.620
just helps bring it out ever so slightly
 

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.789
just helps bring it out ever so slightly
so that it's a little more legible okay

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799
so that it's a little more legible okay
 

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:07.970
so that it's a little more legible okay
so let's look at the last screen and

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980
so let's look at the last screen and
 

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.340
so let's look at the last screen and
this is the this is the photo detail

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:10.350
this is the this is the photo detail
 

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.870
this is the this is the photo detail
screen basically when you touch a photo

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880
screen basically when you touch a photo
 

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.110
screen basically when you touch a photo
you jump into this into this screen and

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120
you jump into this into this screen and
 

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.639
you jump into this into this screen and
there it's basically a full screen photo

00:19:16.639 --> 00:19:16.649
there it's basically a full screen photo
 

00:19:16.649 --> 00:19:18.110
there it's basically a full screen photo
and gives you a couple of actions at the

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120
and gives you a couple of actions at the
 

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.630
and gives you a couple of actions at the
top Nick do you want to jump into your

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640
top Nick do you want to jump into your
 

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.389
top Nick do you want to jump into your
analysis yeah you could probably skip

00:19:23.389 --> 00:19:23.399
analysis yeah you could probably skip
 

00:19:23.399 --> 00:19:24.980
analysis yeah you could probably skip
onto the next slide well there's a it's

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:24.990
onto the next slide well there's a it's
 

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.710
onto the next slide well there's a it's
quite a simple screen really it's

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720
quite a simple screen really it's
 

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.970
quite a simple screen really it's
showing you the photo but there's a few

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980
showing you the photo but there's a few
 

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.070
showing you the photo but there's a few
things that I wanted to change about the

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080
things that I wanted to change about the
 

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.830
things that I wanted to change about the
screen really firstly I changed over to

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840
screen really firstly I changed over to
 

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.659
screen really firstly I changed over to
using an overlay action but I hope it

00:19:35.659 --> 00:19:35.669
using an overlay action but I hope it
 

00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:36.310
using an overlay action but I hope it
comes out in

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320
comes out in
 

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.550
comes out in
and screwing it up here so that's

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:38.560
and screwing it up here so that's
 

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.780
and screwing it up here so that's
basically I wanted the screen to be all

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:40.790
basically I wanted the screen to be all
 

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:41.860
basically I wanted the screen to be all
about the picture I didn't want the

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:41.870
about the picture I didn't want the
 

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:43.450
about the picture I didn't want the
border at the top I wanted to feel like

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:43.460
border at the top I wanted to feel like
 

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.040
border at the top I wanted to feel like
the photo was the most important thing

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:45.050
the photo was the most important thing
 

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.440
the photo was the most important thing
if you've used the application as well

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:46.450
if you've used the application as well
 

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.970
if you've used the application as well
you can tap the tap on the main picture

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:48.980
you can tap the tap on the main picture
 

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.500
you can tap the tap on the main picture
and it will hide the action bar but it

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:50.510
and it will hide the action bar but it
 

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.670
and it will hide the action bar but it
actually has a slightly jarring

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:51.680
actually has a slightly jarring
 

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.130
actually has a slightly jarring
animation where it readjusts the size of

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:54.140
animation where it readjusts the size of
 

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.540
animation where it readjusts the size of
the image is doing another layout pass

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:55.550
the image is doing another layout pass
 

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.700
the image is doing another layout pass
and so using an overlay action bar well

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:57.710
and so using an overlay action bar well
 

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.780
and so using an overlay action bar well
well and they gave that issue as well

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:00.790
well and they gave that issue as well
 

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.680
well and they gave that issue as well
the other thing is if you look at the

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:02.690
the other thing is if you look at the
 

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:03.940
the other thing is if you look at the
title of other folks it was going to

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:03.950
title of other folks it was going to
 

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.060
title of other folks it was going to
burned onto the photo in the image so

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:07.070
burned onto the photo in the image so
 

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.640
burned onto the photo in the image so
even if you go into the kind of the

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:08.650
even if you go into the kind of the
 

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.930
even if you go into the kind of the
viewing mode where you hide the action

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:10.940
viewing mode where you hide the action
 

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.460
viewing mode where you hide the action
bar there the title was still going to

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:12.470
bar there the title was still going to
 

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:13.930
bar there the title was still going to
part of the image so I've changed that

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:13.940
part of the image so I've changed that
 

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.840
part of the image so I've changed that
kind of remove the glimmer name and from

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:16.850
kind of remove the glimmer name and from
 

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.550
kind of remove the glimmer name and from
the action bar crisper I think by this

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:18.560
the action bar crisper I think by this
 

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.780
the action bar crisper I think by this
point you're using the app you have the

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:19.790
point you're using the app you have the
 

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.520
point you're using the app you have the
icon you kind of know which application

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:21.530
icon you kind of know which application
 

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.410
icon you kind of know which application
you're in and just replace the title

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:23.420
you're in and just replace the title
 

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.530
you're in and just replace the title
worthy photo title there yeah absolutely

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:26.540
worthy photo title there yeah absolutely
 

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.930
worthy photo title there yeah absolutely
I think I think providing that kind of

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:28.940
I think I think providing that kind of

and so you know the action bar does have
 

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:44.830
and so you know the action bar does have
a built in the action bar does have a

distractions away from the photo then
 

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.930

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:28.940
just simplified yeah absolutely so let's
 

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.870
just simplified yeah absolutely so let's
look at the the other facet of the

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:31.880
look at the the other facet of the
 

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.580
look at the the other facet of the
screen comment you want to talk about

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:33.590
screen comment you want to talk about
 

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.580

overlaid the photo kind of obscuring it

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:43.070
overlaid the photo kind of obscuring it
 

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.590
overlaid the photo kind of obscuring it
other way and I decide just to give that

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600
other way and I decide just to give that
 

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.210
other way and I decide just to give that
a bit of a treatment I wanted to carry

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:46.220
a bit of a treatment I wanted to carry
 

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.800
a bit of a treatment I wanted to carry
on that theme that content is king here

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:47.810
on that theme that content is king here
 

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:49.120
on that theme that content is king here
it's all about the photograph so I went

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.130
it's all about the photograph so I went
 

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.160
it's all about the photograph so I went
for an overlay style

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:50.170
for an overlay style
 

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:51.930
for an overlay style
so if it comes out of this is supposed

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:51.940
so if it comes out of this is supposed
 

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.630
so if it comes out of this is supposed
to be like a semi-transparent pop-up box

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640
to be like a semi-transparent pop-up box
 

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.580
to be like a semi-transparent pop-up box
that comes up and it's almost like it's

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:56.590
that comes up and it's almost like it's
 

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.320
that comes up and it's almost like it's
a bubble mode so you can see here when

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:58.330
a bubble mode so you can see here when
 

00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.670
a bubble mode so you can see here when
you've hit the comment button this panel

00:21:59.670 --> 00:21:59.680
you've hit the comment button this panel
 

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.320
you've hit the comment button this panel
will pop up and the idea here is that

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:01.330
will pop up and the idea here is that
 

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.150
will pop up and the idea here is that
that'll stay up so as you kind of keep

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:03.160
that'll stay up so as you kind of keep
 

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.920
that'll stay up so as you kind of keep
one horizontally swiping to the next

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:04.930
one horizontally swiping to the next
 

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.110
one horizontally swiping to the next
photo it's in the cassette that'll stay

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120
photo it's in the cassette that'll stay
 

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.360
photo it's in the cassette that'll stay
up not just kind of switch over simply

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:09.370
up not just kind of switch over simply
 

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.130
up not just kind of switch over simply
if you hit the info icon next to the

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:11.140
if you hit the info icon next to the
 

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.330
if you hit the info icon next to the
idea is it will occupy the same space

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:12.340
idea is it will occupy the same space
 

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.040
idea is it will occupy the same space
you could have the fun animation of it

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:14.050
you could have the fun animation of it
 

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.110
you could have the fun animation of it
perhaps rotating around showing you some

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.120
perhaps rotating around showing you some
 

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.050
perhaps rotating around showing you some
information about about a photo and what

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:19.060
information about about a photo and what
 

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.330
information about about a photo and what
we've done here is I feel like having

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:21.340
we've done here is I feel like having
 

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.650
we've done here is I feel like having
this overlay information rather than

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:22.660
this overlay information rather than
 

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.950
this overlay information rather than
obscuring pop-up it really takes better

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960
obscuring pop-up it really takes better
 

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.540
obscuring pop-up it really takes better
advantage of the screen real estate

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:27.550
advantage of the screen real estate
 

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.130
advantage of the screen real estate
available on the tablet because you can

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:29.140
available on the tablet because you can
 

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.540
available on the tablet because you can
still see a large amount of the image

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:30.550
still see a large amount of the image
 

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:32.310
still see a large amount of the image
which is what this is all about and

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320
which is what this is all about and
 

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.290
which is what this is all about and
still and then any comments experience

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:34.300
still and then any comments experience
 

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.110
still and then any comments experience
as well yeah awesome and I especially

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120
as well yeah awesome and I especially
 

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.530

like just the treatment of comments and

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:40.540
like just the treatment of comments and
 

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.680
like just the treatment of comments and
text so basically within the comment you

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:43.690
text so basically within the comment you
 

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.630
text so basically within the comment you
have you know the author of the comment

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:45.640
have you know the author of the comment
 

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.490
have you know the author of the comment
author and you know there's lots of

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:47.500
author and you know there's lots of
 

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.080
author and you know there's lots of
different things you can do to make text

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.090
different things you can do to make text
 

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.540
different things you can do to make text
seen clickable or touchable or

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:51.550
seen clickable or touchable or
 

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.670
seen clickable or touchable or
interactive and basically giving it

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:53.680
interactive and basically giving it
 

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.400
interactive and basically giving it
having it stand out you know giving it

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:56.410
having it stand out you know giving it
 

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.160
having it stand out you know giving it
some color is one sign one indication

00:22:59.160 --> 00:22:59.170
some color is one sign one indication
 

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.840
some color is one sign one indication
but another thing you do is you could

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:00.850
but another thing you do is you could
 

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:02.940
but another thing you do is you could
potentially use underlines you could

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:02.950
potentially use underlines you could
 

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:06.240
potentially use underlines you could
also just have if you choose instead of

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:06.250
also just have if you choose instead of
 

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:08.700
also just have if you choose instead of
having the kind of the quick contacts

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:08.710
having the kind of the quick contacts
 

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.830
having the kind of the quick contacts
you can have the profile icon actually

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:10.840
you can have the profile icon actually
 

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.330
you can have the profile icon actually
jumpy there as well if you decide that

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:12.340
jumpy there as well if you decide that
 

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.430
jumpy there as well if you decide that
quick contact isn't for you but yeah so

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:14.440
quick contact isn't for you but yeah so
 

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.590
quick contact isn't for you but yeah so
it if the author's watching this is also

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.600
it if the author's watching this is also
 

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.150
it if the author's watching this is also
a subtle hint that this application

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:18.160
a subtle hint that this application
 

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.530
a subtle hint that this application
already kind of like in the background

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:19.540
already kind of like in the background
 

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.300

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:25.300
contact sync adapter so that it joins up
 

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.160
contact sync adapter so that it joins up
between between contacts and a Flickr

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:29.170
between between contacts and a Flickr
 

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.810
between between contacts and a Flickr
profile so that you can use these quick

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:30.820
profile so that you can use these quick
 

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.670
profile so that you can use these quick
contact badges to quickly pivot from you

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:32.680
contact badges to quickly pivot from you
 

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.960
contact badges to quickly pivot from you
