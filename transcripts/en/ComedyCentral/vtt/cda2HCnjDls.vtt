AXL ROSE AND TYRESE

00:00:09.243 --> 00:00:11.044
ONTO OUR PLANE,
AND THEY DID SOME "DERMAGE."

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:12.379
- YAR.

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.214
- WELL, I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR PLANE,

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:16.850
BUT WE DON'T SELL WHOLE PLANES.
WE JUST SELL SEATS.

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:20.087

ONE FLIGHT LEFT OUT TO DUBAI.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.667

AND A HALF.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.636
AND I HAVE TWO SEATS

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:37.204

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:39.373
[dramatic crescendo]

TO THE MIDDLE EAST,

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:44.378
BECAUSE I "DERFINITELY"
FEEL LIKE A MARTYR.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:47.247

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:50.350
GO THROUGH SECURITY.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:51.985
- I'M SORRY,
DO WE STILL HAVE TO DO THIS

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.820
IF WE <i>KNOW</i> GOD IS DEAD?

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:55.856
- YOU KNOW WHAT, WENDALLS?
WE'VE GOTTA GET RID

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.791
OF A FEW THINGS.

IT WOULD BE RESPECTFUL.

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:06.333
BYE-BURR.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.235
- FUN GUN.
- NOW, WAIT.

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:09.703
IS THAT OUR ACTUAL GUN,
OR IS THAT GUN WE USE

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.405
TO SHOOT SCHNEEF
RIGHT INTO OUR BLOODSTREAM?

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:15.275
- NO, THIS IS SUPER HEAVY.
I THINK IT'S REAL.

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:16.944

ARE YOU WILLING
AND ABLE TO ASSIST

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:48.308
