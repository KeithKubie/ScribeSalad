- Hi, guys.

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:03.469 line:0%
Welcome to my channel.

00:00:03.502 --> 00:00:04.470 line:0%
I'm Dr. Sandra Lee,

00:00:04.503 --> 00:00:06.506 line:0%
also known as Dr. Pimple Popper.

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:09.909 line:0%
I'm gonna post
blackhead extractions...

00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:11.477 line:0%
Look at that.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.912 line:0%
That's pretty cool.

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:14.180 line:0%
Cysts being popped...

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:15.415 line:0%
Not hurting you too much?

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:16.716 line:0%
I know I'm starting to push--
push around.

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:17.784 line:0%
I'm sorry.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:19.118 line:0%
I made you yell.
I know. That's why.

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:20.153 line:0%
It squirts on you.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.088 line:0%
Lipomas being removed
from the skin...

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:24.123 line:0%
[speaking indistinctly]

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:25.525 line:0%
<i> 'Cause I know
 you guys love them,</i>

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:27.660 line:0%
<i> and I love that you love them.</i>

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:28.694 line:0%
Enjoy.

00:00:28.727 --> 00:00:29.962
- Like I tell my eldest son,

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:31.931
the more it hurts,
the more it squirts.

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:33.699
That's Sandra Lee, M.D.,

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:36.402
better known on the Internet
as Dr. Pimple Popper.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:39.705
Her videos have
over 1/2 billion views,

00:00:39.738 --> 00:00:41.107
proving to women everywhere

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.309
that showing off
your ass and titties

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:45.845
isn't the only way
to become Instagram famous.

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:48.381
All you have to do
is go to med school,

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:51.117
then violate doctor-
filthy-patient confidentiality

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.554
by posting videos of you
squeezing gallons of hummus

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.422
out of their disgusting bodies.

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:58.825
And it doesn't hurt
to be an attractive Asian.

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:02.528
Acne is just nature's way
of keeping teenagers ugly

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:03.830
so their teachers and preachers

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:06.132
are less tempted
to penetrate them.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:07.800
No one wants to date someone

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:10.036
with Mount Pimplemanjaro
on their nose.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.304
So just do what I do.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:12.672
Have your personal makeup artist

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.373
shellac your face
with an airbrush.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:15.908
VoilÃ .

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:18.244
Blackheads and whiteheads
are identical,

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:20.546
except blackheads
are 20 times more likely

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.715
to be choked to death
by the police.

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:25.451
Along with puke, exposed bones,
and Russians,

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:28.855
gross extraction videos are one
of the pillars of this show.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:32.058
And I'm dying for Dr. Lee
to give my pores a happy ending.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:33.726
That's why I invited
the Princess of Pus

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.129
to join me for this week's
Ce-web-rity Profile.

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:41.434
Hey, what are you in here for?

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:43.970
Augh!

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:46.439
[laughs] Ooh-hoo.

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:48.207
Ugh.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.009
I think the chiropractor's
down the hall.

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:52.111 align:start position:0%
- I'm not a hunchback.
It's a cyst.

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:53.479
- Huh.

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:56.616
<i> - Daniel, Dr. Pimple Popper
 will see you now.</i>

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.719
- When did you realize you had
a passion for popping pimples?

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:01.487 align:end position:100%
- I started to post
popping videos

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.556 align:end position:100%
or blackhead extractions
about a year ago

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:05.958 align:end position:100%
on my Instagram
and on my YouTube channel,

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:07.593 align:end position:100%
and they just got
more interest.

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:09.295 align:end position:100%
So I went and--
I went and looked,

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:11.497 align:end position:100%
and I saw that there's
a whole community.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.498 align:end position:100%
There's a subculture
of people...

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:13.499 align:start position:0%
- There always is.

00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:14.901 align:end position:100%
- Who just post
popping videos

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.002 align:end position:100%
and share them
with each other.

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:17.336 align:start position:0%
- Although your Instagram
is very confusing

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.404
'cause you have, like, normal,

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:20.006
<i> everyday, like,
 "Hey, this is me</i>

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.407
<i> out and about," sexy photos.</i>

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.677 align:start position:0%
Next thing is the most horrific
extraction I've ever seen.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.947
- The goal is to try to get this
out of a smaller little area.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.951
So if I try to tease
around it...

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:34.086
So a little tightness here,
okay?

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:35.821
How's that? Okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:36.822
- Not bad, right?

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.024
[speaking indistinctly]

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:40.226
I think it might be coming.

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:41.727
[groans]

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.596
<i> I'm showing that I'm
 a real person, you know,</i>

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.265
<i> that I may be a physician
 and I do all these surgeries</i>

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:47.366 align:start size:59% position:41%
but I'm a girl too.

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:48.668 align:end position:100%
Like, you know,
all my girlfriends,

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.236 align:end position:100%
I like to hang out with them;
I have a husband.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.771
- And does he work--
- He's a dermatologist.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.206 align:start position:0%
- Do patients get upset

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
when they get your husband
and not you?

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:55.975 align:start size:56% position:44%
- Yeah, sometimes.

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:57.009 align:start position:0%
- [laughs]

00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:58.811 align:start position:0%
What type of person
likes to watch?

00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:01.314 align:end position:100%
- Most of them are women,
I will have to say, I think.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.815 size:81% position:41%
- Women love popping zits.

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:03.816 align:start size:47% position:53%
- Yes, they do.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.518 size:81% position:41%
- I had two older sisters.

00:03:05.551 --> 00:03:08.821 size:88% position:44%
As a kid, aw, they couldn't
be happier getting in on me.

00:03:08.854 --> 00:03:10.823 align:start size:63% position:38%
- I do know, though,
that a lot of people

00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:13.326 align:end position:100%
like these videos
because they relax them.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.428 align:end position:100%
They help decrease
their anxiety.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.063 align:end position:100%
They watch them
during panic attacks.

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.664 align:end position:100%
They watch them
before they go to sleep, and--

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:20.066 align:start position:0%
- No, that's not--
none of this is true.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.100 align:start position:0%
You're making that up.

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:23.436
That is complete horse [bleep].

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.305 align:start position:0%
Nobody watches that video
and then takes a nap.

00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:27.907
- All right,
give me some traction.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.177
[speaking indistinctly]

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.413
It's, like, ready to come.

00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:37.650
It's like I need a suction,
like they do with babies.

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:39.619 align:start position:0%
- What race of people
has the best skin?

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:40.987 align:end position:100%
- It's true
that the darker you are,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.489 align:end position:100%
the less likely you are
to develop wrinkles over time.

00:03:43.522 --> 00:03:45.024 align:end position:100%
Lighter-complected people
are gonna have more

00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:46.459 align:end position:100%
of those fine lines
and wrinkles,

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:50.329 align:end position:100%
so they look older
probably sooner than Asians,

00:03:50.362 --> 00:03:53.099 align:end position:100%
African-Americans, Hispanics,
all of us darker.

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
- So you guys win
that one category.

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:55.701 align:start size:44% position:56%
- We do, yeah.

00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:56.836 align:end position:100%
Well, we win in a couple
other ones too.

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.070 align:start position:0%
- Eh...

00:03:58.103 --> 00:03:59.138 align:start position:0%
[laughs]

00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:00.906 align:start position:0%
Do you have to talk
your patients into this?

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.608 align:start size:56% position:44%
- No, not usually.

00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:04.677 align:end position:100%
In fact, now people come
from around the world.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.246 align:end position:100%
I've had people come
from London, from Saudi Arabia

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.181 align:start size:78% position:22%
for me to pop their zits.

00:04:09.214 --> 00:04:11.384 align:start position:0%
- Are you making more money
off your videos now

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:14.186 size:84% position:42%
than you are your practice?

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.789 align:start size:16% position:84%
- No.

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:18.391 align:start position:0%
- Are there people
that are watching it

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:20.493 align:start position:0%
for pleasure, sexual?

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.662 align:end position:100%
- I'm sure there's people
that watch anything,

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:23.829 align:start size:63% position:38%
everything for that.

00:04:23.862 --> 00:04:24.864 align:end position:100%
But I think they're in
the minority.

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:26.432 align:start size:78% position:22%
It's not really a fetish.

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:28.301 align:end position:100%
It's more--you know, it's like
riding a roller coaster

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:29.769 align:start size:81% position:19%
or watching a scary movie.

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:30.870
I think it makes people happy.

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:31.937 align:start position:0%
- I don't know.
I think fetish might--

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.172 size:88% position:56%
- It doesn't make you happy?

00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
- I think there's more
fetish people in there too.

00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:36.208 align:start position:0%
Combined with the fact
that you're Asian,

00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:38.044 align:start position:0%
that's a double whammy
for a lot of people.

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:39.111 align:start size:25% position:75%
- Maybe.

00:04:39.144 --> 00:04:42.081 align:start position:0%
- I want to know how nasty
these people are.

00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:43.382 align:start size:63% position:38%
- They aren't nasty.

00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:44.450 align:start size:63% position:38%
They're my patients,

00:04:44.483 --> 00:04:45.985
and they're absolutely lovely.

00:04:46.018 --> 00:04:46.986 align:start position:0%
- Filthy monsters.

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:48.054 align:start size:66% position:34%
- No, not at all, no.

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:49.789
- Why is it getting that bad?

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:52.425
<i> - You know,
 the biggest blackheads</i>

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:55.895
<i> come from older patients
 who have poor eyesight,</i>

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.496
<i> who have arthritis
 in their hands,</i>

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:58.764
<i> and they just are not aware</i>

00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:00.633
<i> that these things
 are even on their skin.</i>

00:05:00.666 --> 00:05:03.602 align:end position:100%
The big, like, growths
that we usually see,

00:05:03.635 --> 00:05:06.138 align:end position:100%
especially in the nether areas,
tend to be men.

00:05:06.171 --> 00:05:07.340 align:end position:100%
And I tell them,
"Don't worry about it.

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:08.341
I've seen a lot of skin tags."

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:09.842 align:end position:100%
And then they pull down
their pants.

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:11.077
And I had one guy with, like,

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.545 align:end position:100%
the size of a racquetball
on his butt,

00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:13.846
<i> like, on a piece of his butt.</i>

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.948
This has been growing
for how long?

00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:17.316
- Oh, a number of years.

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:18.484
- Yeah.

00:05:18.517 --> 00:05:21.387
Okay, good.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.922
All gone.

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.557
<i> - What'd you do
 with that disgusting skin tag</i>

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.825
<i> after you cut it off?</i>

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:28.627
- I made it into a key chain.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.096 align:start position:0%
- Oh, you nasty bitch.

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.931 size:88% position:44%
Does anything gross you out?

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:34.834 size:88% position:56%
- Recently I had this woman
who we removed a pilar cyst,

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:36.669
<i> a big benign cyst,
 like, about this big,</i>

00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:37.803
<i> you know, on her head.</i>

00:05:37.836 --> 00:05:39.138
<i> And it was soft.</i>

00:05:39.171 --> 00:05:40.773
<i> Like, it was kind of like

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:47.246

Talk about the smell.

00:05:50.382 --> 00:05:51.517 align:end position:100%
- You know what it smells like
in general?

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.653 align:end position:100%
It smells like some of those
more strong cheeses.

00:05:54.686 --> 00:05:55.955 align:end position:100%
That's exactly
what it smells like.

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:57.156 size:75% position:38%
- Okay, that's not good.

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:58.858
What's the worst bodily fluid?

00:05:58.891 --> 00:05:59.859 align:start size:47% position:53%
- I don't know.

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:02.094 align:start size:72% position:28%
The worst bodily fluid?

00:06:02.127 --> 00:06:03.629 align:start size:28% position:72%
Diarrhea.

00:06:03.662 --> 00:06:06.031
[both laugh]

00:06:06.064 --> 00:06:07.833 align:start position:0%
- Diarrhea's bad.

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:09.201
What are those [bleep] beans?

00:06:09.234 --> 00:06:12.338
<i> When the beans come out
 of people, I lose my mind.</i>

00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:14.039
<i> - No, you just say,
 "Oh, well, look at that."</i>

00:06:14.072 --> 00:06:15.107
<i> You know, that kind of thing.</i>

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.542

00:06:16.575 --> 00:06:18.711 align:start position:0%
And what's the closest

00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
that you've ever had to do
an extraction?

00:06:20.512 --> 00:06:22.014 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I don't do the butthole.

00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:23.349 align:start position:0%
- What, do you--
you just let them die?

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:24.517 align:start size:56% position:44%
- I don't do that.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.818
There's, like, pilonidal cysts,

00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:28.387 align:end position:100%
which occur, like,
right above the rectum there.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.189 size:88% position:56%
But I--that's not my domain.

00:06:30.222 --> 00:06:31.457 align:end position:100%
I don't do that.
I'm out.

[both laugh]

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:35.561 align:start position:0%

all the time...

00:06:35.594 --> 00:06:36.562 align:start size:19% position:81%
- Yes.

00:06:36.595 --> 00:06:38.497 align:start position:0%
- Is it uncomfortable for you
at all?

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.132
- No, it's not uncomfortable,

00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:41.567 align:end position:100%
but I will tell you
something funny.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.970 align:end position:100%
That I used to work with--
I worked with a dermatologist

00:06:45.003 --> 00:06:48.441 align:end position:100%
who said that if they were
examining a guy and he got...

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:49.875
- Aroused.
- A hard-on--yeah, aroused...

00:06:49.908 --> 00:06:51.477 align:start position:0%
- You don't say "hard-on."
You're a doctor.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.446 align:end position:100%
- Oh, sorry.
You're supposed to flick it.

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:54.647 size:88% position:56%
That's what they were doing.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.648 align:start size:69% position:31%
They were flicking it.

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:56.849 align:start size:81% position:19%
I've never had to do that.

00:06:56.882 --> 00:06:58.117 size:84% position:42%
- If you flicked my dong...

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.118 align:start size:28% position:72%
- I know.

00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:00.252
- Oh, I would be so into that.

00:07:00.285 --> 00:07:01.787
[both laugh]

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.422 align:start position:0%
Yeah, if you flick a weenie
like that, like,

00:07:03.455 --> 00:07:04.824 align:start position:0%
do one of those,
those pops,

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:06.659 align:start position:0%
oh, if you tuck it
back behind,

00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:07.693 align:start position:0%
oh, that'll hurt them.

00:07:07.726 --> 00:07:08.928 align:end position:100%
- Oh, okay.
I'll try that out.

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:10.729 align:start position:0%
- Or make them finish.

00:07:10.762 --> 00:07:13.132 align:start position:0%
