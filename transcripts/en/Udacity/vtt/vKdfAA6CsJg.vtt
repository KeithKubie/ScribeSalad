00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is 79.74.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The way you get that is divide the 6618 by 83. How about the variance?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The variance is about 11.1 in approximation.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You might remember that we can calculate that is exportation or the mean of the xÂ²

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
minus the mean of the x to the square, which I just did here.

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, give me the standard deviation. That is 3.33, the square root of the variance.
