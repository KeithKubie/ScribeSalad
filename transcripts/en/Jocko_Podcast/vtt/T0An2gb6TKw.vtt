1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.200
Trying to keep in shape while traveling long term and not use,

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.350
not having gym access as an excuse for letting my standards slip.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.590
Best pieces of kit training styles from maintaining conditioning and adding mass

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.570
while living out of the bat.
Pattern.
Get rings.
Yeah.

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.220
Gymnastics Ward.
Gymnastic rings.

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.510
Why wood plastic or metal will make you get sweaty and slept in.

7
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.180
You have to bring a ton of chalk.
You need a little bit of chocolate would rings.

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.330
It's a little will resorb there's the best thing to grab onto get would

9
00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:31.260
gymnastic rings.

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.650
You can carry them anywhere and then just do a bunch of calisthenics.
I mean,

11
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:38.190
come on man.
Just on knows what adding mass,

12
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.030
how do you add Mascara?
Oh,
you gotta get creative.
Yeah,
you gotta get creative,

13
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.290
but it's,
do you know,
instead of doing squats,

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.000
you know air squats do jump squats or doing some dynamic dro one plyometrics.

15
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.590
Yeah.
Do one legged pistols.
Yeah.
All that stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the key.

16
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.920
I got to do that right now.
Like I can't,
you can drill.

17
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:01.740
The hole inlay is called the owner.

18
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.030
So they drilled a hole in the attached to the tendon nut in the hole.
They go,

19
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.800
they pushed the tendon through the hole,

20
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.880
they put an anchor at the end of the school.
Boom.
Anyway,

21
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.090
a lot of swelling in the forearm.
You can't grab nothing,

22
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.870
you can't grab anything and have weight.

23
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.470
So calisthenics you got to kind of make your position,
your wrists in a position,

24
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.400
in a comfortable position and you can do the dead anyway.

25
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.930
Point there is I'm in that boat or lifting weights is not an option at this very

26
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:35.100
moment for me.
So you got to kind of get creative.

27
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.730
So like a push up,
you can make the pushups harder.

28
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.100
If you put your feet up in the high,
he put your feet,

29
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.600
you know the harder it becomes or you do like a one arm pushups situation and

30
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:49.410
then you can do like a d client like um,
you know you go on a counter first.

31
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:52.650
Right?
Okay.
How many of these one arm pushups?
You can do more than 20.
Okay.

32
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:55.350
Maybe go for like a chair or something like this.
Something,

33
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.700
something a shorter boom,
you can do more than 20 of those.
Okay.

34
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:02.070
Now I can go to the ground,
see what I'm saying?

35
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.850
And then you can go raise your feet up as time goes on.
Boom.
There you go.

36
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.250
Good for.
And actually body weight through space is the best way to build size.

37
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.870
Um,
in your muscles there as far as like exercises go,

38
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.190
that's good information.
It is better than dead lifting and squatting.
Well,
okay,

39
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:24.840
so that dead lifting,
squatting,
that's going to be um,

40
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.630
is going to depend on the weight.
But think about this.

41
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:31.050
Dead lifting and squatting is moving your body through space.

42
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.960
So doing an air squat,

43
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.860
you're moving your body through space as opposed to med squatting with weight.

44
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.880
Right?
And still come back squat.
Right,
right,
right.
But what on squat?
Yeah,

45
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.110
getting help you with squats yet.
But again,
like I said,

46
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.570
moving your body through space is the,

47
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.420
are the best exercises for mass and what is,

48
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:59.300
what is not moving your body through selects squat compared to a leg press.
Yay.

49
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.740
Why haven't even,
those aren't even in my,
those aren't even in my mind.

50
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.690
I know brow,
but this guy asking the question,
okay,
it might be cool.

51
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.830
I'm trying to help him out.
I don't want to help you out.

52
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.410
You got the whole exercise thing figured out.
I get it.

53
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.160
You know you're an expert in your boring workouts.

54
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.540
Talk about that later.
None.

55
00:03:17.541 --> 00:03:22.270
The less body weight or body moving your body through space is the best

56
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:22.811
exercise.

57
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:27.490
The problem is or tends to be that your body has a fixed amount of weight more

58
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:31.570
or less so you can't adjust the weight and usually you can move your body

59
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:33.790
through space a bunch of times.
If you do air squats,

60
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:37.660
you can do a bunch of air squats so it doesn't provide the quote unquote tension

61
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.200
that you need to build mass.
That's why you go one at a time.

62
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.340
Create more tension on your muscles while still moving your body through space,

63
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.480
which could wind up to be a better exercise for you.
That's what I'm saying.

64
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.190
That's good advice,
man.

65
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.770
Whatever Brad don't act like is crazy that I'm saying this stuff.

66
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:54.610
That's the question.

67
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.880
Really the question you were talking about with this whole moving your body

68
00:03:57.881 --> 00:04:00.640
through space thing.
Yeah,
that's external information.

69
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.690
No idea what that I kind of get it now when you were saying it as if it was some

70
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.510
unknown.
It is unknown.
Even your body through space.
Okay.

71
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:16.990
So you know what a hammer strength machine is.
Okay.
So it's all,
you know,

72
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.900
it's like a,
it's like a,
I don't know,
like a lever kind of thing.

73
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:23.260
Technically it's like,
you know,
you put some plates on it,
you push it,

74
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:24.670
there's no pulley or nothing,
but you know,

75
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.570
you're not moving your body through space,
you know,

76
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.800
moving your body through space.
So I'm kind of creating the spectrum here,

77
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:31.120
so could just consider that.

78
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.990
Then it's kind of far down this other movement or things that are further down

79
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:38.440
the spectrum,
but that's fixed movement.
There's no balance required.

80
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.450
There's no whatever.
It's just like you're just pushing weight.
It's isolation.

81
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.090
Isolated.
Yeah.
Plane.
The plane is isolated.
All this to the plane of movement.

82
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.200
Cool.
Right.

83
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.060
So that we'll have less neural muscular activity when you push it.

84
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:56.520
Even if you're pushing heavy weights than something like graduate to like a Bar

85
00:04:56.521 --> 00:05:00.460
Bell,
bench press,
right,
for example.
But even that,

86
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.700
even that you do have to balance.
So that's a big step up.

87
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.150
But even that you don't have to balance in certain planes,

88
00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:09.160
certain planes of movement,
you don't have to balance like the,

89
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.350
what do you call this one lateral whatever,

90
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.920
the lateral movement and a bar bell bench press,
which is the bar.

91
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.470
You don't have to balance,
it's fixed,

92
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.890
but front and back or forward and forward and back,
whatever.

93
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:25.570
You do have to balance.
So you know,
still good.
Now go to dumbbells.

94
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.600
Now you have 360 degree plane of movement that you have to balance more neuro

95
00:05:32.661 --> 00:05:35.440
muscular activity.
So dumbbells are better than barbells in that way.

96
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.320
No muscular activity and you can adjust the weight.

97
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:40.720
So you can do things where you can only do three reps,
you can do things,

98
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:43.630
you can do 20 reps if you want.
So boom,
great exercise.

99
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.500
I can't really do it in a hotel room,
but just saying generally speaking,

100
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.410
good exercise.
But now you go the tip top.

101
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.440
The best exercise for neural muscular activity would be pushups because same

102
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.030
you're moving your body through space.
You're not balancing weight.

103
00:06:00.031 --> 00:06:04.190
Your balance on the rings even better.
Now you're going like creative,

104
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:07.580
which is good.
That's like beyond the spectrum which is good.
Totally good.

105
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.500
But so yeah,
keep these things in mind.
I think when you,
when you do a thing,

106
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.280
so if he can add or window workouts.
So when you,
if you can add weight,

107
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.300
that's the challenge.

108
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:21.620
If you can add weight to these moving your body through space exercises,

109
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.600
that's when you get again that exercise.

110
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.000
Now I'm just going to take this one step further.

111
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.950
Do it cause you don't necessarily have to add weight as you stated earlier.

112
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.520
Yes.

113
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.520
You can adjust how you're moving your body through space and then you can get

114
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.730
the,

115
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.340
you can get additional and I'll tell you what really makes us obviously is if

116
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:42.380
you do any gymnastics training,

117
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.630
if you do a pull up,
that's hard.
If you do a talk,

118
00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:50.570
pull up where your knees are pulled up,
that's even harder.

119
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.100
If you do an l sit,
pull up where your knees are up,

120
00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:58.700
put your feet are pointed straight forward,
that's even harder.

121
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.030
Each one of those things is a little bit harder.
Same thing with a dip,

122
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.910
like just a regular dip.
If you've got your feet hang,

123
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:08.240
it's easier if you bring it up to a talk is a little harder.

124
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.240
If you bring it up to an l it's even harder.

125
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.350
So you can keep doing these things and there's squats you can do,

126
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:19.040
I mean just doing pistols alone,
that's a lot harder.

127
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.920
Some people can't even do pistols.
Yeah.

128
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.430
And so you might have to do an assisted pistol.
We'll start off.
Yeah.
So yeah,

129
00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:27.910
you can make it happen.
His little Kinda Hardman is,

130
00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:29.180
especially if you've never done them before this,

131
00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:34.181
it's hard because the balance balance back and side to side balance 360 degree

132
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:37.340
plane of balancing.
That's what this whole thing's about.

133
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.890
Moving your body through space.
Is that what it is?

134
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.630
Where did you read that?
Uh,

135
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.730
old school Bulgarian Phil Philosophy Workout Program called is the old school

136
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.150
never deviated from much the core.
Really good too,
by the way.
Um,

137
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.980
it's called what it's called.

138
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.310
I remember the serious growth is what it's called weird,
right?

139
00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:05.480
Like that's such a lame name,
but man,
I was in high school and I was like,

140
00:08:05.481 --> 00:08:07.490
all right,
you know,
you read all these things right.
And you know,

141
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:09.200
in the back of the,
uh,
you know,

142
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.900
Muscle magazine or whatever and the little article,

143
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.580
I remember all the Bulgari and kind of like,
uh,

144
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.720
that was a big thing.
No kidding.
Well,
yeah,

145
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.660
because the Bulgarians were doing really good at weight lifting at the time.

146
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:26.120
No one knew it was weird and these guys were like,
yeah,
five weeks or four weeks,

147
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:29.440
my bench went up to this and you know,
when you're in high school band tech yet,

148
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.330
but I'll get that or whatever.
So you get the permanents his book,

149
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.840
it's just got serious growth and it explains everything really in detail too.

150
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.250
I was like,
Dang,
this is pretty good,

151
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.010
real plain English to not elders rule science or whatever.

152
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.540
And maybe there's hope.
And they were doing Quito too,
by the way.

153
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.110
That's where I learned about this 90.
That's crazy.

154
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.080
It's been around for a long time for Nickelback.

155
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.080
Ken's book came out in the sixties or seventies.
Yeah.

156
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.350
That's way different though.
It's not,
it's not a way different.
Yeah,

157
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.700
it's different.
Way Different.
Yeah.
This was,

158
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.280
this guy has just been around for a long time.
Yeah.
Mark,

159
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.080
Dr Mario or Morro de Pasquale [inaudible].

160
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.720
That's who was the Quito Gut.
And again,
back in [inaudible] 94 he's still around.

161
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.020
Yeah,
no kidding.
So yeah,
so we did this thing,

162
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:16.770
we get this book and it's like laying it out and you know,
I'm down.

163
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.030
I'm 15,
16 years old.
I'm down to lift five days a week.

164
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:24.690
Let's do this and brow.
We did it.
And you eat good.

165
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.980
Not like crazy.
I didn't do the Quito.
Never did.
Um,
but you know,

166
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:32.070
they have it as an option and so we did it or whatever.
And we,

167
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.790
it was weird since I gained like 20 pounds and I just,

168
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.650
we just kept doing it.
So,
you know,
you play football,
you can't really gain,

169
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.230
there's also this whole thing that you're 15 and your body's just filled with

170
00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:47.670
testosterone.
You going to gain 16 pounds anyways,

171
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.550
I'm telling you,
I'll tell you this right now.

172
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.970
I was talking to Jody Mitic about this briefly too.
I'll tell you this right now.

173
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:58.950
If even at 40 you go on this thing,
it depends on how you train.
No,
no.

174
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.080
Go on this,
this type of work,

175
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:03.120
and I'm not even like selling this work on it or nothing like that.

176
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.490
I'm just saying this'll people will think and think.
You know what though?
Okay.

177
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.020
People will think you're on steroids.
If you do this workout for like six weeks,

178
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.090
that's it.
Six weeks they'll think you're on steroids.

179
00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:16.440
Straight up like my whole life when I'd like go on a on a like a six week thing.

180
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.540
They're all,
he's on steroids.
Obviously.
He's uncertain.
No steroids.

181
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.980
You don't even have to take supplements.
That's the weird thing.
But here,

182
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.000
let me say this though,

183
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.360
now that I'm thinking of it as or about it when I'm a grown adult,

184
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.730
most programs,

185
00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:33.810
if you actually do the whole program exactly how it works,

186
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.690
it works really good.
That's the thing.
People just don't do the workout.
Oh,

187
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.650
what do you need to do?
Lift heavy weights a lot.
Eat good in rest.
Good.

188
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:49.260
Yeah,
you'll get,
and let's,
and let's face it,
it's not,

189
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.740
is like if someone says,
oh yeah,
it's easy.
Here's the thing,
it's not easy.

190
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.780
This is why it's not easy.
It's not just the workout.

191
00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:56.130
That's why you have to do the workout.

192
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.890
Then you have to eat enough of the right things too,
by the way.

193
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.510
And then you have to rest enough.

194
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.570
That's basically you have to change your whole life.
So if you're like,
hey,

195
00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:07.110
it's easy,
just change your whole life.
It's not easy.
So,
and not that,

196
00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:09.030
I'm not saying that that's a good excuse or anything,

197
00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:12.480
but I'm just saying it's not quote unquote easy,
but yet there it is.
Jack,

198
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:17.190
do a diet,
exercise,
eat good workout,
good and rest good.

199
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:21.330
You'd be good hotel or Jim,
actually,
here's what you can do.

200
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.640
Here's what I do want to go to the muster or wherever.

201
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.060
Even if I'm there for like a week,
like the last muster,

202
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:32.250
all like go on Google maps and find like all the gyms and be like,
all right,

203
00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:35.490
I'm going to,
that's kind of the commitment.
Obviously.
You know,

204
00:11:35.491 --> 00:11:38.250
that's an interest.
That's your commitment.
Like you want to stay in shape,

205
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.800
add mass,
as you say,
conditioning,
adding mass,

206
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.900
whatever it look for the gym near Your House.
Commit to pay that Jim feeds.

207
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.090
She's like,
what,
10 bucks?
Or something like that,
and boom.

208
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.350
That's the commitment right.
