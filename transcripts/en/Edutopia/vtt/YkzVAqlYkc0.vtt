00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:04.276
&gt;&gt;Culture at this school
is not something

00:00:04.276 --> 00:00:07.836
that adults steward for kids.

00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:13.336
Culture at King is something
kids do for all of us.

00:00:13.336 --> 00:00:19.046
Kate is our assistant
principal of student support.

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.916
She facilitates culture
in this building.

00:00:22.916 --> 00:00:26.876
And Kate's in charge of everything
that leverages the critical thinking

00:00:26.876 --> 00:00:29.736
that our kids have
developed, and focuses them

00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:33.276
on our virtues as kind of a filter.

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:36.276
&gt;&gt;Kate: So the four virtues
that we focus on here

00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:40.206
at our school are wisdom,
justice, courage and humanity.

00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:44.016
In leadership we talk a lot
about just how we can build

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:45.996
and foster those virtues
within the school.

00:00:47.076 --> 00:00:50.096
They watched a film last week,
the movie 'Pay It Forward.'

00:00:50.526 --> 00:00:53.256
And so they're gonna be kinda using
that film as a jumping off ground

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.656
to discuss those concepts.

00:00:56.106 --> 00:00:57.886
&gt;&gt;My name is Gabriela Ballesteros.

00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:00.016
I'm in eleventh grade.

00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:02.506
I'm a junior and I go to Kipp
King Collegiate High School.

00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:05.186
&gt;&gt;Kate: So Gabi came to us from
a traditional middle school,

00:01:05.226 --> 00:01:06.436
so a non Kipp middle school.

00:01:06.686 --> 00:01:07.886
&gt;&gt;Gabriela: It was horrible.

00:01:08.916 --> 00:01:14.916
It was a lotta gangs and a lot of bad
things and drugs and all that stuff.

00:01:14.956 --> 00:01:17.186
Like everywhere, you would
just see it everywhere.

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:19.596
&gt;&gt;Kate: In the ninth grade year,
really struggled academically.

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:21.216
She's also an English
language learner.

00:01:21.216 --> 00:01:23.526
&gt;&gt;When I first came here,
it was totally different.

00:01:23.526 --> 00:01:24.726
I didn't expect it to be this way.

00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:25.986
It was like really strict.

00:01:26.256 --> 00:01:30.756
&gt;&gt;And this year has been, you
know, really-- doing really well.

00:01:31.276 --> 00:01:34.276
She's stepping up in her
leadership all the time.

00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:37.826
&gt;&gt;Gabriela: -- the idea of 'Pay It
Forward' is more powerful than him,

00:01:38.076 --> 00:01:41.086
because even when he
chose to take on his--

00:01:41.086 --> 00:01:43.506
&gt;&gt;Kate: The last two years, she's
really just started to own who she is

00:01:43.506 --> 00:01:45.536
as a person, who she
can be as a leader,

00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:50.426
and I think that's been pretty
transformative for her too.

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:53.106
&gt;&gt;I'm mostly proud of
everything I've accomplished here.

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:56.976
Like just all the hard work.

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:03.956
&gt;&gt;I have accomplished so much.

00:02:04.806 --> 00:02:08.686
I used to like just not care,
but they say it'll be worth it,

00:02:08.686 --> 00:02:13.966
and now I realize that
it is worth it.

00:02:14.056 --> 00:02:17.496
&gt;&gt;Jason: I think what makes
these transformation predictable,

00:02:17.496 --> 00:02:22.736
I think what is kind of the
foundation of what happens at King,

00:02:22.846 --> 00:02:27.226
is that every day that our kids walk
through those double doors and come

00:02:27.226 --> 00:02:32.166
into the school, they know every
adult they see throughout the day is

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:37.686
someone who knows that they're
capable of succeeding at the level

00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:39.576
of expectation that's held for them.

00:02:40.116 --> 00:02:43.436
&gt;&gt;Kate: I think that when
every teacher believes truly

00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:45.816
that all the students in the
building can and will learn,

00:02:46.106 --> 00:02:48.576
and they're devoted to doing
that, day in and day out,

00:02:49.056 --> 00:02:51.996
not only is it more fun and more
joyful to be in the building

00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:54.616
and to learn and to
teach, but it works.

00:02:56.346 --> 00:02:58.216
&gt;&gt;Gabriela: Well, going to
college for me, it means a lot,

00:02:58.486 --> 00:03:01.386
'cause I'll be the first
one in my family to go.

00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:03.756
It'll mean a lot to my mom.

00:03:03.756 --> 00:03:07.366
She struggled so much with
me, and just even for me,

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:09.756
'cause I know what
I wanna do in life.

00:03:10.096 --> 00:03:11.976
But I just-- I don't know
how to get there yet.

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:17.016
&gt;&gt;Kate: I mean, I definitely
see Gabi going to college.

00:03:17.016 --> 00:03:19.526
I think she would be-- I think
Gabi would be a great teacher.

00:03:19.836 --> 00:03:24.136
&gt;&gt;Gabriela: I wanna be a teacher.

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:27.146
&gt;&gt;It lightens up my heart
how much they do for us,

00:03:27.196 --> 00:03:28.736
that I wanna do the same.

00:03:28.946 --> 00:03:30.566
Help people that are like me.
