much about GM crops and I think what we

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489
much about GM crops and I think what we
 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.699
much about GM crops and I think what we
should do as scientists is explained

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709
should do as scientists is explained
 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.039
should do as scientists is explained
exactly these details so the issue of

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049
exactly these details so the issue of
 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.520
exactly these details so the issue of
risk in other ways really has to be

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530
risk in other ways really has to be
 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.449
risk in other ways really has to be
communicated in a much more detailed

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459
communicated in a much more detailed
 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.209
communicated in a much more detailed
fashion how many of you would like to

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:27.219
fashion how many of you would like to
 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:29.759
fashion how many of you would like to
have your genome sequenced this is about

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769
have your genome sequenced this is about
 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.149

out in the developing well and let them

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870
out in the developing well and let them
 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.720
out in the developing well and let them
decide their own risk they're the ones

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730
decide their own risk they're the ones
 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.750

higher dose and are aware of the risks
why not give it to them yeah how far

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230
why not give it to them yeah how far
 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.860

from a med student in Israel so he's

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040
from a med student in Israel so he's
 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.100
from a med student in Israel so he's
asking what kind of drugs do you think

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110
asking what kind of drugs do you think
 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.659

normally scientific conferences where

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510
normally scientific conferences where
 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.960
