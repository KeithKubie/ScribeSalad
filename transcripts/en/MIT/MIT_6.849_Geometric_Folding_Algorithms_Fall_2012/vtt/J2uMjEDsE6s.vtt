00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.770
PROFESSOR: This class is talking
about two lectures, both about

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.760
protein folding, fixed angled
chains, things like that.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.610
There's a few
questions about them.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.330
One is mostly about
these open problems,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.660
equilateral, equiangular,
obtuse 3D chains,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.270
fixed angle open problem
is, are they locked?

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.850
So the question is about,
what about any subset

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.030
of those combinations?

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.050
So this originally comes
from an open problem

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.800
I think posed in 1999, one of
the first 3D linkage papers,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.980
and it asked whether equilateral
universal joints can lock,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.140
and that's still open.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.830
For universal joints,
these two constraints

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.481
don't make a lot of
sense because who

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:50.980
cares if it's
initially equiangular.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.140
As soon as you move it, it
will no longer be equiangular.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.070
And obtuseness I don't
think matters too much,

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.310
although it potentially could.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.310
So for that problem, equilateral
seems to be the core.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.470
For fixed angle,
though, we conjecture

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.800
that fixed angle equilateral is
not enough from this example.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.750
It's still not
proved to be locked.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.290
I don't know if it's hard,
but it's probably tedious,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.630
so it hasn't been done.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.040
This was the crossed
legs example.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.630
All the edge lengths
are the same,

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.670
and if you don't allow
the touching part,

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.500
then all the angles
are also the same.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.220
So this is everything
except the obtuse property

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.470
and it's probably locked, so
dropping obtuse is no good.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.330
The other things you could drop
are equilateral or equiangular.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.950
This is if you drop equiangular.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.160
Fixed angle equilateral is
not terribly constraining

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.010
because you can
simulate a long bar

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.500
by having a lot of
180 degree angles.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.086
This is obtuse and
it's equilateral

00:02:05.086 --> 00:02:06.460
but it's not
equiangular and it's

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.790
locked for a trivial reason.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.040
So this is dropping equiangular.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.120
If I drop equilateral,
I can also

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.930
just make a knitting
needles example.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.152
I take a really long link, and
this thing is basically string,

00:02:23.152 --> 00:02:24.110
so I don't really care.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.220
This connection can be done
with a lot of obtuse angles,

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.870
and then have a
really long link.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.090
So dropping any of
the three constraints

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.860
makes it easy to lock, so
for fixed angle chains,

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.330
you need equilateral,
equiangular, and obtuse.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.699
All these things
together potentially mean

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:41.240
you're not locked,
but we don't know.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.510
That's the open problem.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.010
Of course, we don't
necessarily need

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.440
exactly equilateral
or equiangular.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.790
Hopefully, within some small min
to max ratio would be enough,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.050
but we don't know.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.480
Next question is, why did we
model the ribosome as a cone?

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.090
That seems rather simple.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.550
Is this realistic?

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.330
And partly, when I
taught the class in 2010,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.030
I didn't use any images I
couldn't get permission for.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.580
This year I'm more lax.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.780
We'll ask for forgiveness
instead of permission.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.880
This is a paper
from Science 2000.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.910
This is what the ribosome
actually looks like.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.680
There's many different
figures of it,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.075
but I particularly like this
one because it highlights

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:31.570
a tunnel in the center
of the ribosome.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.710
And so the idea is this is a
machine for converting MRNA

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.489
into your proteins,
and the idea is

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.780
the protein comes through here.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.100
There's a little
bump in the tunnel.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.590
Some people conjecture this
is where the amino acid gets

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.670
attached, and then
it feeds through here

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.670
and starts spitting out.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.020
And as I said, there's
barely enough room

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.760
here for an alpha helix, so
probably not too much folding

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.510
happens inside and the folding
should just happen over here.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.730
And the observation is if
you have a reasonable size

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.960
protein that's only going
to be about this big,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.120
then there's this big,
flat wall at the exit,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.640
so you have a plane
there and this half space

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.649
is more or less a big obstacle.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:23.090
It's the alpha cone model
where alpha is 180, I think,

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.110
if alpha is the half angle.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.500
So it's not really a cone.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.140
It's a cone that's been opened
up all the way to a plane,

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.490
but that's one of the situations
that's handled by the theorems

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.160
that we talked about.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.067
So that's why the cone model.

00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:38.650
We generalize to
cones just because it

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.390
works for general
cones, but the real one

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.462
is a sort of flat cone.

00:04:44.462 --> 00:04:45.670
That's where that comes from.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.500
I think actually we proved the
theorem before we knew this,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.600
but then we looked it
up and it was true.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.940
And the last question
is about the lecture 21,

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.660
which some of you may not have
watched because it's optional,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.570
but there's this model
called the HP model

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.660
for protein folding.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.020
It's a model of
protein energy and it

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.230
says you have a chain
of H and P nodes,

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.850
and basically, the H nodes
are attracted to each other

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.280
and the P nodes don't care.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.570
And the model is that the H
nodes are hydrophobic so they

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.470
want to be next to each other
so they're not next to water,

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.200
which is surrounding
the whole molecule,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.720
and the P nodes don't care,
or they're hydrophilic.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.070
And it's known that if
you have an HP string

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.210
and you want to find the optimal
folding into a 2D or a 3D

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.370
structure, that's NP-hard,
which is kind of weird

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.970
because somehow
nature does it, maybe

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.100
because it found the easy
instances by evolution,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.340
or maybe there's
something we're missing.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.870
This model doesn't
capture reality.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.020
We don't know.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.820
But it captures part of reality,
as least as we observe it.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.320
Unfortunately, these
hardness proofs

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.270
are a little too
complicated to cover here,

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.360
but I can at least answer
what are they reducing from.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.990
There's two proofs.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.242
I guess they were basically the
same time, I think around 2001.

00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:11.600
The first one here
is in 3D, and these

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.280
are by two MIT professors.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.360
There's this big construction
but the reduction

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.570
is from bin packing.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.490
So you have a bunch
of fixed size bins

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.975
and you have a bunch of
items of varying sizes

00:06:23.975 --> 00:06:25.350
and you just want
to fit them all

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.750
in using the fewest
bins possible.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.720
And the rough idea of the
construction of this one, this

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.220
is how an individual
number is represented.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.215
The rough idea is you
have this big cube.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.590
You fill the sides
with stuff to protect

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.930
from the outside boundary.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.840
The insides are just
used for connections,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.650
and then the front face
here is this stuff.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.964
You construct
these bins, and you

00:06:57.964 --> 00:07:00.130
construct numbers which
have to fit inside the bins.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.900
That's the rough idea.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.230
The details are complicated.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:10.330
The 2D proof by
several people is

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.660
from Hamiltonicity in
maximum degree-4 graphs.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.450
So you have a graph
for every vertex that

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.783
has at most four incident edges.

00:07:16.783 --> 00:07:19.610
You want to find a
Hamiltonian cycle, I think.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.960
It's much harder to see
this picture, I would say.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.530
There's no one diagram
that summarizes it.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.630
This is roughly
the construction,

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.265
which is quite complicated,
and I'll just leave it at that.

00:07:36.265 --> 00:07:37.640
That's what they're
reduced from.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.098
I think an interesting
open problem

00:07:39.098 --> 00:07:42.730
would be to find a simple or
cleaner proof of these results.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.460
Now that it's known
that they're hard,

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.120
it's probably easy
or hardness proofs.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.036
There's also some open
questions from lecture,

00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:51.880
like is it APX hard?

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.380
Is it approximable to a 1
plus epsilon factor or 1 minus

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.130
epsilon factor for any
epsilon or is there

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.910
some limit to approximability?

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:04.930
We saw a nice approximation
4/3 whatever, 3/4 whatever,

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.990
but can you do better?

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.410
Still open.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:16.367
So that was the questions,
and then this is a question

00:08:16.367 --> 00:08:17.950
that you usually ask
in every lecture.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.574
You didn't actually
ask it on this one,

00:08:19.574 --> 00:08:21.820
but I copied and pasted.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.810
So there's some
interesting progress

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.220
from this class two years ago,
and I think in the open problem

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.559
session initially, probably
also a class project

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.789
related to this part.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:39.220
So this is back in lecture 20.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.539
We had this proof,
which is kind of fun,

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.540
that flattening a
fixed angle chain,

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.500
deciding whether there
was a flat folded state,

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.860
is weakly NP hard,
weakly meaning

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.560
it depended a lot on what
these numbers look like

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.410
and it was a reduction
from partitions.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.940
You had to split up the
numbers into two equal parts,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.360
and if you did, then this
key would fit in the slot

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.610
and you're OK.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:08.840
If you didn't, the key would
collide with something here.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.400
So this means the
problem is hard

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.100
if your edge lengths
are vastly different.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.810
They would have to differ
by a ratio of exponential

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.709
in the number of edges for
this to really be hard.

00:09:20.709 --> 00:09:23.000
So a natural question is,
well, what if all the lengths

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.970
are equal, equilateral chains?

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:30.410
Turns out that is still hard,
and this is a paper just

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.330
published last year with
Sarah Eisenstadt, who

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.340
took the class then.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.140
And there's a bunch
of results here.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.770
All of these are NP hardness
results, strong NP hardness,

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.890
so it doesn't depend
on the numbers.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.070
We've got flattening results.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.027
There's also min flat
span and max flat span.

00:09:48.027 --> 00:09:49.610
Once you have that
flattening is hard,

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.090
these are pretty
easy to show hard,

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.090
so I won't talk
about them so much.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.890
But basically, we consider
different ranges of angles

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.850
and what you might allow.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.780
In some cases, we can get
perfect equilateral chains.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.400
In some cases, they have to
range between, say, 1 and 2

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.010
in length.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.760
A natural question
is obtuse angles.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.920
We don't quite know that.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.580
The best we have is 60 degrees
minus epsilon and larger.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.240
This is nice for
orthogonal chains,

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.560
but it's not for
chains, it's for trees.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:33.421
So still some open questions
here, but lots of hardness

00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:33.920
results.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.419
I thought I'd show you roughly
what the hardness proofs look

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:38.340
like because
they're kind of fun.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.030
They all follow this
kind of structure.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.839
This is a gadget, and
it's a fixed angle chain.

00:10:42.839 --> 00:10:44.880
Here I'm going to show
everything with 90 degrees

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.510
because it's easier
to think about.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:54.210
And it's kind of like--
I'm thinking plunger,

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.810
but it's something like that.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.475
You can decide which
parts get pushed in

00:10:58.475 --> 00:11:04.310
and which parts get popped out,
and this L shape can basically

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.450
shift left and right to
three different places

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:14.190
if I did it right-- this
one, this one, and this one.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.850
So that's a useful construction,
as you might imagine,

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:26.170
and the idea is you take that
and you add on these guys.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:31.750
So I've got another kind
of plungey thing like this,

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:37.890
and this guy can move left
and right to various extents.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.410
That's not very intuitive.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.920
So then this connects
to these little guys,

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.320
and these can just
flip up or down

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.400
if it's a flat embedding
of a fixed angle chain.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:00.120
And so the idea is you have
three of these pokey elements

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.560
and they can attach.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.800
They bump into these
different things.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.490
And if it's up,
then this can be up,

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:12.130
but when they're down-- like
this guy is currently down,

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.250
but it could be pushed
up-- then this guy

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.100
must be flipped down like that.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.000
That's the rough idea of how
these parts fit together.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.050
And so then this is how you end
up building some kind of three

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.020
sat problem.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.880
So you have some variables.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.810
They can either
be true or false.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.720
And the idea is that the
true guys are on the top,

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.680
the bottom guys
are on the bottom,

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.740
and there's some complicated
interaction between them

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.232
to make sure that they can't
both be true and false.

00:12:44.232 --> 00:12:45.940
Basically, you want
these things to point

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.160
in whenever possible because
then these guys can go down.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.140
Otherwise, you would collide.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.500
And if this guy's in,
the corresponding guys

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.770
in the bottom must
be down, and that's

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.550
enforced by this long
thing, which is either

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.254
completely down
or completely up.

00:13:00.254 --> 00:13:01.920
So when it's completely
down, these guys

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.378
all have to be
down, which is going

00:13:03.378 --> 00:13:06.994
to be a problem down below
if things aren't satisfied.

00:13:06.994 --> 00:13:09.160
When it's up, all of these
guys would have to be up.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.182
Some of them could be
up if you feel like it,

00:13:11.182 --> 00:13:12.640
but really, you'd
probably put them

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.590
all down whenever you
can because then you

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.536
can take these guys
and stick them down.

00:13:17.536 --> 00:13:18.910
So this is how
you set variables,

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.640
and then the other
things I showed

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.340
were clauses, essentially.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.100
At least one of those
pins had to be pushed down

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.470
and you don't know which one,
and that's the hard part.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.930
Rough sketch of how
this proof looks.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:40.740
One thing is here,
for this to work,

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.360
these edges can't be spinnable.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.670
When I go here, I must
immediately go back down.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.939
I can't flip it.

00:13:50.939 --> 00:13:51.980
So these are rigid edges.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.900
That's not really
the original problem,

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.330
but you can simulate
rigid edges,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.310
and this is where
the angles get small.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.160
You can simulate rigid edges
with a very sharp zigzag

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.260
because if you ever
flipped one of these,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.450
it would collide with
the previous edge.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.680
So for sufficiently
sharp angles,

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.390
you can force parts to stay
straight in this funny way,

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.650
which is not great, but
it's one way to force it.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:19.160
We can also do it with trees
or various other techniques,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.370
but that's how the proof looks.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:28.750
So that is flattening fixed
angle chains, strongly NP hard.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:34.870
We go next to one
more topic for fun.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.335
This is the topic of flips.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.590
I guess I have an
image for this.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.500
This is a problem
posed by Paul Erdos,

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.670
I think when he was a student.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.190
He was a very famous
mathematician.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.500
1935, he asked this question.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.950
This is the whole question
as originally written.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:01.049
You have a polygon and you take
the convex hull of the polygon,

00:15:01.049 --> 00:15:03.340
and you take these regions
which are in the convex hull

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.339
but outside the polygon.

00:15:04.339 --> 00:15:05.720
We call those pockets.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.140
And you imagine
flipping those outside,

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.430
reflecting through
that supporting line,

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.520
that tangent on the outside,
so then you get this polygon.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.440
Here you get two pockets.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.430
Maybe you flip both of them, and
then you get a convex polygon.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.970
Now you have no pockets,
and so you're done.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.040
And the question is as posed.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.950
Prove that after a finite
number of such steps,

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.770
the polygon would become convex.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.980
So you might call this
a conjecture by Erdos

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.240
that it is finite.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.920
He'd never published a proof.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.120
There's one issue with
the problem as stated.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.860
You can't actually
flip both pockets

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.940
at once if you want
to avoid collisions.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.860
The relation to
linkages is we imagine

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.910
these flips could actually
happen by a rotation,

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.410
but you could also
just imagine them

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:57.350
as reflecting instantaneously.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:58.520
There's this issue.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.870
If you flip two
pockets at once, you

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.730
might have collisions
afterwards.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.580
The way this problem has been
interpreted by most people

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.810
is don't flip them all at once.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.400
Just flip them one
at a time, and then

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.420
you guarantee, because
this is a supporting line,

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.970
a tangent line, of
the convex hull,

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:18.060
when you flip one pocket out,
it will go to the other side

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.000
so it can't intersect
the rest of the polygon.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.940
So you would avoid collision
if you do one flip at a time.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:30.420
Now, this was observed, I
guess, a few years later

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.020
by Bela de Sz.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:40.980
Nagy, and he also
published the first proof.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.390
Before we get there,
a weird property

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.760
and why you might worry about
this being finite or infinite

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.740
is if you take
this quadrilateral

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.270
and make this very narrow,
this edge very small

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.980
relative to the
horizontal edge, then

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:01.410
you can require arbitrarily
many flips to convexify.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.479
Even for n equals 4, you
could require a million flips.

00:17:05.479 --> 00:17:07.020
So definitely there's
some dependence

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.223
on the ratio between the longest
length and the smallest length,

00:17:11.223 --> 00:17:12.764
though in open
problem, what we still

00:17:12.764 --> 00:17:15.210
don't know is whether you
can bound the number of flips

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.380
in terms of n and that ratio.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.380
Is it pseudo-polynomial?

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.119
Who knows?

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.670
So it turns out
it's always finite,

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.020
and there have been many proofs
over the years of this result.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.700
It's kind of been
rediscovered many times.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:40.360
Nagy solved it originally
in 1939, and he cited Erdos.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.110
These two guys
didn't cite anyone,

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.590
so they may have come up with
the problem independently.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.770
This paper, these are
two Russian proofs.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:53.175
Then this paper cited--
they knew about everything.

00:17:53.175 --> 00:17:55.000
They cited all of them.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.737
They cited Reshetnyak.

00:17:56.737 --> 00:17:58.820
I don't think they necessarily
knew about Yusupov.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.230
Independently, Kaluza
posed the problem in 1981

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:08.720
and Wegner solved it, and
then to finally clean it up,

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.740
Grunbaum, who we saw
from un-un-unfoldable,

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.519
knew about everything.

00:18:15.519 --> 00:18:16.810
Presumably, this is everything.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.860
Of course, we might
have missed one.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:23.290
But he knew all the above,
came up with his own proof.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:26.250
And then Godfried
Touissant, father

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.100
of computational geometry,
one of them, knew about these

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.420
and came up with yet
another, simpler proof.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.900
So the story of
this is kind of fun.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:42.070
When I taught this class for
the very first time, 2003 or so,

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.710
I thought, OK, cool.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.170
This is a classic theorem.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.140
Everyone should know it.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.680
So I thought I'd cover the
latest proof that's presumably

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.490
the best, so I covered
Godfried's proof.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.655
I was a little unhappy with
it, but I finished writing down

00:18:58.655 --> 00:19:01.030
the proof, and then one of
the students raised their hand

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.420
and asked, is that really right?

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.120
Can you do that in step two?

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.080
And the answer was
no, you can't do that.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.130
It basically skipped a step.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.200
And so I thought, oh gee.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.900
And so I corresponded
with O'Rourke and Godfried

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.665
that weekend and was like,
is something missing here?

00:19:16.665 --> 00:19:18.790
Maybe we should go back to
some of the other proofs

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.780
because we've got
lots to choose from.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:25.110
So we went to the original,
which is a very short proof.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.410
It's only one page long,
maybe one and a half pages.

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:29.620
And so this is fun.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:33.160
This is 1939, the way
mathematics used to be done.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.009
And it's funny because
Grunbaum's proof was based

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:38.550
on Nagy's proof and
Toussaint's proof

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.250
was based on Grunbaum's
proof, so in the end,

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.680
these proofs were very similar.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.370
In fact, they differed
exactly in the one step,

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:46.690
which was kind of omitted here.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:47.990
So I thought, OK great.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:52.010
Here we have a fill-in
on how to do it.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.710
And so the next class, I
went up and I presented it.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:55.790
I was really happy.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:58.350
Isn't this cool,
1939 mathematics?

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.650
It's really awesome,
and it's one line

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.230
that filled in this step.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:05.450
The same student raises
his hand and is like,

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.660
I don't think that's true.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.675
So now the step was filled
in but it was wrong.

00:20:10.675 --> 00:20:12.550
So it turns out actually
most of these proofs

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:16.000
are wrong, but not all
of them, fortunately,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.830
so the theorem is still true.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:21.900
So that one was wrong, this one
was wrong, this one was wrong,

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.620
this one skipped a
step that was key,

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:27.310
this one essentially also
skipped the step that was key.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:31.130
So in the end, there's two
correct proofs, Reshetnyak

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:37.260
and Bing and Kazarinoff,
which was surprising.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:43.860
So I thought I'd show you one
of the errors in the Nagy proof.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.940
There's one other
interesting feature here,

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.710
which is, why wasn't this
discovered until our class?

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:52.650
The student was Blaise Gassand,
and so then we wrote a paper

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:56.510
about it and we have our
own proof, of course.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.280
Now, some people
may have realized

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.400
there was an error in
some of the proofs.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.370
Bing and Kazarinoff, one of
the correct proofs, a very nice

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:08.565
one, wrote-- here's the
original Russian sentence.

00:21:08.565 --> 00:21:10.340
The English translation
is, "the proof

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.930
of this theorem given
by Nagy is incorrect,"

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.280
which leaves something
to be desired.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.890
And Grunbaum, who
can read Russian--

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.680
we had to get them
translated-- mentioned this.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.380
So he noticed that point. "They
remarked that Nagy's proof is

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.680
invalid but there's no
basis for this claim."

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:37.920
Then it remained undiscovered
until 2005 or something.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.690
Kind of funny.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.790
Good thing there's so many
proofs to choose from.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:44.000
So this is Nagy's
original proof.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.150
You can see the example
where flipping two pockets

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.555
simultaneously
causes a crossing.

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:53.310
Don't read the whole
thing, obviously,

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.760
but there's one
sentence here which is,

00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:00.270
if you take a polygon, call
it p0, and you flip a pocket

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.810
and you get p1, and you flip
a pocket and you get p2,

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.010
and you take the convex
hull of p and you get c0,

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:09.640
and you take the convex hull
of p1 and you get c1, p2,

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.520
you get c2.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.215
And then you interleave
these polygons

00:22:13.215 --> 00:22:16.020
so that the polygon is a convex
hull, next polygon is a convex

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.910
hull, because you're
always flipping out,

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:24.680
each of these polygons obviously
contains the foregoing ones.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.825
And so that seemed really
nice and we thought,

00:22:26.825 --> 00:22:28.230
oh, this is so elegant.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:32.076
They used this to prove that
the limit of the p's is convex

00:22:32.076 --> 00:22:33.450
because the limit
of the p's then

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:36.760
would be the limit of the c's
because it was interleaving.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.670
But it's not true
that these things

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:42.490
contain the previous ones
because if you have two pockets

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.640
and you flip one of
them, it's this one

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.270
pocket versus multiple
pockets issue.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.036
If you flip one of
them, that will not

00:22:48.036 --> 00:22:49.660
contain the convex
hull of the original

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.940
because you haven't
flipped them all.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.300
If you flipped all the
pockets, than you would contain

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.560
the convex hull of
the original, but that

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.030
would end up arguing
that some flip

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:01.030
sequences work, not all of them.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.010
So this is annoying,
and I think this

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:07.310
is where I run out of slides.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:15.520
But we have some time, so I can
give you a sketch of the proof.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.660
This is the Bing and Kazarinoff
proof or our version of it.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.890
Give you an idea
of how this works.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.730
It's an easy proof, it's just
easy also to get it wrong

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.080
or to skip one of the steps.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.281
I will just do a proof
by picture, I think.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:41.580
So suppose you have a
polygon on the plane,

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.980
and let's say you flip a pocket.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:59.210
So this would look
something like that.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.850
A little hard to
do a reflection.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:04.360
So this is the
reflective polygon,

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:09.850
and if we look at each of
the vertices over here,

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:15.570
these guys don't move,
these guys moved over here,

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.590
reflecting through that line.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.000
Observation one.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.340
If I take some point x
interior to the polygon,

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:31.470
then these points that move
get farther away from x.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.330
Why?

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:37.980
Because if you look
at this line here,

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.830
let's say you look at a
vertex and where it goes.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.444
This line is the Voronoi
diagram of those two points.

00:24:43.444 --> 00:24:45.610
This is the perpendicular
bisector of this and this.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.580
That's the meaning
of reflection.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.580
So that means everything
to the left of the line

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.332
here is closer to this
point than that point.

00:24:52.332 --> 00:24:53.790
Everything to the
right of the line

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.960
is closer to this
point than that point.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.856
Now x, which is
interior to the polygon,

00:24:57.856 --> 00:25:00.230
must be to the left of the
line because the whole polygon

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.190
is to the left of the line.

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:05.705
So distance from x to
this vertex increases.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:12.180
I mean, x will remain
inside because as you flip,

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.900
you only get bigger.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.970
So if I take a point x
and I look at the distance

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:18.340
to some vertex, it can only
monotonically increase.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.390
It also can't get
arbitrarily large

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.790
because the maximum
it could possibly be

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.632
is half the perimeter
of the polygon.

00:25:26.632 --> 00:25:28.340
The perimeter of the
polygon is preserved

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.260
so it can only stretch so far.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:35.170
So if you look at this distance,
it's monotonically increasing

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.170
and it's bounded because
it can never get bigger

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.727
than the perimeter
of the polygon.

00:25:38.727 --> 00:25:39.810
Therefore, it has a limit.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.340
That distance has
a limit because

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:47.070
monotone bounded sequences
always have a unique limit.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.680
So cool.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.120
Distance from x to some
vertex has a limit.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.100
Well, I'm going to do this for
three different points, x, that

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:58.330
lie on some non-degenerate
triangle, so not all on a line.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.960
That means the three
distances from these points

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.150
to this vertex all
converge to some limit.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.210
And therefore, that
point converges

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:08.300
to a limit, namely the
intersection of those three

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.290
circles centered
at those points.

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:12.890
So this proves that
the polygon has

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:16.800
a limit because every
vertex has a limiting point.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.880
Cool.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.270
Now the tricky part is to
argue that limit is convex,

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:24.140
and this is where
everyone had an issue.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:32.770
The first thing we argue is that
the angles converge to a limit.

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:35.230
This is kind of a
technicality because we

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:36.730
know the points
converge to a limit,

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:39.390
so surely the angle does.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:43.476
The only issue is, well,
if all the points converge

00:26:43.476 --> 00:26:45.850
to the same point, then the
angle would not have a limit,

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:47.510
but that's easy to
argue can't happen

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:49.670
because these edge
links are preserved.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:53.059
So I will just skip that one.

00:26:53.059 --> 00:26:54.850
It follows from some
of the things we said.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.860
Now we get to the fun part.

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.060
This polygon has a limit.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.380
The angles have limits.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.010
So I want to look at
the limiting angles.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.070
I want to in particular
look at the vertices that

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:13.900
move because if you flip an
infinite number of times, that

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.280
means some vertex must move
an infinite number of times,

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.330
because every time you
flip, somebody moves.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:20.830
These guys are
considered not moving

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.070
even though they're kind
of involved in the flip.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:28.470
So if you look at the moved
guys, what is their angle?

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.380
So before, there
was some angle here,

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:36.170
and afterwards, the interior
angle is the reverse.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.040
If this was reflex
before, it's convex now.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.990
If there were a convex
angle over here like this,

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:48.220
it would become
reflex over here.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.450
You alternate between
being less than 180

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:55.620
and greater than 180
every time you move.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:01.230
So if you have a vertex that is
moving infinitely many times,

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:05.830
its angle must alternate
between less than 180 convex

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:08.960
and greater than 180 reflex
infinitely many times.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.760
If that happens and you
have a unique limit angle,

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.570
your limit angle must be 180.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.550
That's interesting.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:26.110
If our vertex moves
infinitely many times,

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:42.317
then its limit angle
equals 180, must be flat.

00:28:42.317 --> 00:28:44.150
Very close to a
contradiction at this point.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:52.930
These guys are going to
end up looking like this.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:56.690
Well, let's look
at the other guys.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.425
So we have some limit polygon.

00:28:58.425 --> 00:29:00.550
In the limit polygon, there
are some flat vertices,

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:03.020
but there must also be
some non-flat vertices.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.720
You can't just go straight
and hope to close a cycle.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.920
So there's maybe some
convex ones like this.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.350
There may be some reflex ones.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.570
At some point,
these vertices must

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:19.300
stop moving because everyone
who moves infinitely many times

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.890
has a limit angle flat.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:23.154
So anybody who is--
we call it "pointed"

00:29:23.154 --> 00:29:25.570
here, although it's a little
different from pointed pseudo

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:26.810
triangulations.

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:29.200
Anyone who's not
a flat angle must

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.040
stop moving after finite time.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.810
So let's go to that time
when all of these guys

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:35.680
have stopped moving.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.590
So your limit
polygon is something.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.960
We don't know whether
it's convex or whatever.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.830
It could have many flat angles.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.750
It's got to have at
least one of them

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:50.590
if we assume there's
something infinite here.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.180
This is the limit polygon.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.880
Now, at finite time,
we know that these guys

00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.320
have stopped moving, meaning
we're done with those guys.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:07.170
I've drawn the limit here, but
also the finite thing, which

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:08.910
must be on the inside, right?

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:14.490
This must be
something like this.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:18.810
Somehow it's going to flip and
reach the infinitely many times

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:21.980
and reach this in the limit.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.500
Hm.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.270
That looks weird.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:30.770
So the way to argue
this in the clean way

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:36.210
is if you look at the
convex hull of the limit,

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:39.355
let's say, convex hull
of the limit is this.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.120
And look at the convex
hull of this finite time

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.750
when the squared vertices
have stopped moving.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.950
Convex hull will
be-- well, it's got

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:52.650
to be at least this because
these guys are already there.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:55.666
The convex hull is defined
by the square points.

00:30:55.666 --> 00:30:57.290
You don't care about
the flat vertices.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:58.930
That won't affect
the convex hull.

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:02.000
So that means the convex
hull equals the limit convex

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.850
hull at this finite time.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:06.887
Now you're about to
do another flip, which

00:31:06.887 --> 00:31:08.720
means you're going to
go outside that convex

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.500
hull and contradiction.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.920
Is that clear?

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.430
Maybe go through that
part one more time.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:19.750
After finite time, when all
of the non-flat vertices

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:23.400
have stopped moving, we have
reached the final convex hull.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.120
That means you can't do any more
flips because every flip makes

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.440
the convex hull
bigger, so you actually

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.706
had to stop at that time.

00:31:30.706 --> 00:31:31.830
That's kind of a fun proof.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.300
The key is really this
part, that if a vertex flips

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.377
infinitely many times, then
that limit angle must be flat,

00:31:37.377 --> 00:31:39.710
and so they really don't
participate in the convex hull.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:43.170
This is the Bing and
Kazarinoff key idea.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.170
AUDIENCE: Two questions.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.470
Does anyone do this for 3D?

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.320
PROFESSOR: 3D is a good.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.040
People have tried to
define flips for 3D,

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:56.380
and I think there's never really
been a successful definition.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:00.024
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and
exactly how to flip it.

00:32:00.024 --> 00:32:01.940
I mean, you can define
pocket in the same way,

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.960
but then the boundary
won't be a single plane.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.180
It'll be some convex
cap, and so flipping, you

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.100
can't really just reflect.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.820
It's kind of annoying.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.380
AUDIENCE: The
other question was,

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.145
you have a sequence
of simple operations

00:32:18.145 --> 00:32:21.120
that takes you from
non-convex to convex.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.489
Does anybody use that
in a proof to say,

00:32:23.489 --> 00:32:25.530
these things are preserved
across the operations?

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:27.805
You said perimeter
was preserved.

00:32:27.805 --> 00:32:32.000
What about shortest paths?

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.080
PROFESSOR: So is this
useful for something?

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.650
Shortest paths are
certainly not preserved.

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:38.020
Edge lengths are preserved.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.478
Of course, we know how to do
that with the carpenter's rule

00:32:40.478 --> 00:32:42.900
theorem, just staying in 2D,
so it's not that exciting.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:46.594
But the operations are
definitely a lot simpler.

00:32:46.594 --> 00:32:48.260
I think the easy
answer to your question

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:52.760
is there are many
natural, simple moves,

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.810
and this is the first one
that people considered,

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:56.268
but actually, there
are a lot more,

00:32:56.268 --> 00:32:58.300
and I'm going to
talk about those.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:03.110
The main application I know
for this stuff is basically,

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:07.900
people wanted to generate random
closed walks in 3D typically,

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.200
and so they wanted to find
a small set of operations

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.190
they could just perform
randomly and hope

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:14.220
that that was a rapidly
mixing Markov chain,

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.600
so eventually, you'd have
a kind of random thing.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.830
I don't think there
are any rapid mixing

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.410
results, at least
that I'm aware of.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.500
In order to hope to
get the space randomly,

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.850
you would at least have to
be able to make anything.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:32.044
So for that, the question is,
can you convexify anything,

00:33:32.044 --> 00:33:34.210
because if you can convexify
anything, then at least

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:37.000
you can make anything,
more or less.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.680
So that's where these
questions come from.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.240
We focus more on
the universality,

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.750
but I think what people care
about is this random generation

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:44.250
business.

00:33:46.704 --> 00:33:48.620
To that end, of course,
for random generation,

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.670
you don't really
care about crossings.

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:52.510
And so another fun
extension which

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.880
was in, I think, our
paper for the first time,

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.860
although there's a weaker
version in Grunbaum's paper,

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.570
if you start with a
non-crossing, this proof

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.200
still works.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.640
You need to add a little
more to the argument.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.199
Either you decrease the number
of crossings, which can only

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:15.901
happen a finite number of times,
or this kind of stuff works.

00:34:15.901 --> 00:34:18.359
You can make crossing polygons,
too, which is kind of cool.

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:24.989
So that's the end
of basic flips.

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:31.620
Then we have something called a
flip turn, which is kind of fun

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.040
and in some ways better behaved,
and gets to your question

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.560
of what else is preserved.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.590
So let's say you have
a pocket like this.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:42.460
So normally with a
flip, we would reflect.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:46.679
With a flip turn, you reflect
and then also flip this way,

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:54.810
so it's the same as rotating
180 degrees about the center.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.139
In addition to
preserving perimeter,

00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:00.310
this preserves the
edge directions.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:03.040
This matches this, this matches
this, this matches this.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.050
It does not preserve
the edge order, however.

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:06.630
Here, we preserve
the edge order.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:09.970
Here, we've reversed the
order of those three edges.

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.190
So all this is really
doing is permuting

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.270
the sequence of edges.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:17.150
The edge directions and the
edge lengths are all the same.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:21.900
So this means you could make
at most n factorial moves here.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.220
Immediately, it's different
from this situation

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.124
where even for n
equals 4, you could

00:35:26.124 --> 00:35:27.290
have arbitrarily many moves.

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:28.760
Here, it's at most n factorial.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.320
That was the original bound.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.040
It turns out every
polygon convexifies

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:37.640
after order n
squared flip turns.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.630
It's a fun proof but I don't
have time to cover it here.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:46.040
That's flip turns.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:50.550
Then we go to deflations.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.470
This is the inverse of a flip.

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:56.070
So suppose you take a polygon
and you do an operation

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:59.310
that, if flipped, would result
in the original polygon,

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:01.960
exactly the opposite of a flip.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.420
This was conjectured to also
finish after finite time,

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:06.715
but in fact it doesn't.

00:36:06.715 --> 00:36:10.880
If you take any quadrilateral
satisfying Kawasaki,

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.110
so if you add up the
opposite edge lengths

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:18.170
and they're equal-- so 6
plus 3 is 9, 4 plus 5 is 9--

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:22.070
then there it is at least
a flat limit possibly.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:24.410
That's the Kawasaki thing.

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:27.710
And in fact, it will
converge to that flat limit

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:30.334
and it will take infinite
time to get there.

00:36:30.334 --> 00:36:31.250
So that's kind of fun.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.600
It gets very hard to
draw the pictures.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.950
This is really the main example
of an infinitely deflating

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:38.770
polygon.

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:43.710
We have a paper called
"Deflating the Pentagon," which

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:50.050
got some fun political
views at some point.

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:53.780
It's about a
pentagon, five sides.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.560
And essentially, unless you have
a flat vertex, in which case

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.365
you are quadrilateral, there
is no infinitely deflating

00:36:59.365 --> 00:37:01.740
pentagon, which means you can
deflate the pentagon always

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:02.620
in finite time.

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:06.920
It is open for
hexagons and higher

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.820
whether there is another
example different

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:11.060
from the quadrilateral.

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.950
Then there's the idea of a pop.

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:15.500
This is an even simpler
operation than a flip.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.350
You just take two
edges, like here we're

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:24.680
taking these two edges,
and, ignoring crossings,

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.890
you just flip as if
that were a pocket lid,

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:28.260
so if this were a pocket.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.380
Then you get this polygon.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.150
Now here, you can be
forced to get crossings.

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:33.220
No matter how you flip,
you might get a crossing.

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:36.320
Still, we're wondering--
who cares about crossings--

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.840
are pops enough to make
anything, or to convexify?

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.350
And the answer is no.

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.750
There's this set of polygons
called alternating polygons

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:46.040
where the vertices
alternate between the x-axis

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.370
and the y-axis.

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:50.320
And you can prove that no
matter what pop you do,

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:53.270
you are still an
alternating polygon,

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.270
and alternating polygons,
you can also prove,

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:57.900
are never convex,
so you're stuck.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:03.280
This was open for many years but
finally solved a few years ago.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.690
There's also pop turns, which
is where you take two edges

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:11.320
and you do a 180 degree
rotation like this.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.910
And there, we can prove
if you allow crossings,

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:15.870
you can convexify any polygon.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:18.420
I don't have a figure of that
because it's just an algorithm.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:21.840
We haven't actually run
it on a nice example.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.560
If you avoid crossings, we can
characterize when it's possible

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.160
and when it's impossible.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.557
And those are pretty much
all the simple operations

00:38:28.557 --> 00:38:29.890
that at least have been studied.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:34.330
There's probably more to
think about, but that's it,

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:37.530
and that's the end of
my part of the class.
