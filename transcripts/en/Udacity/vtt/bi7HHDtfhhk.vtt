00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.948
So here's, here's one way of kind of combining the things that we eventually got

00:00:04.948 --> 00:00:10.550
around to with, with Jared. Given is a vector of integers named X. Produced is

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.024
a vector of integers named Y. The output vector Y must be ordered, in order,

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:21.450
okay? And the contents of Y must be somehow the same as. The contents of X.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.430
That is everything in X must be in Y, everything in Y must come from X, and

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.000
the number of occurrences of each item in Y must be the same as the number of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.330
occurrences of each item in X. Even that seems a little a little long and

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.760
so we'd like to now take this same problem and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.970
see what it looks like when we express it in a precise mathematical notation.
