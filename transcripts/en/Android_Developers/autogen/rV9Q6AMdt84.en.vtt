to continue the story and build the game
around when we saw the success of Dan

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769
around when we saw the success of Dan
 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.060
around when we saw the success of Dan
escapes it was very logical for us to to

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070
escapes it was very logical for us to to
 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.699
escapes it was very logical for us to to
build a game around around renovating a

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709
build a game around around renovating a
 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.420
build a game around around renovating a
house so so we were pretty sure that the

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430
house so so we were pretty sure that the
 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.670
house so so we were pretty sure that the
concept will work so that's why we made

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680
concept will work so that's why we made
 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.479
concept will work so that's why we made
the decision and talking about resources

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489
the decision and talking about resources
 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.009
the decision and talking about resources
the interesting thing that we didn't

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019
the interesting thing that we didn't
 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.259
the interesting thing that we didn't
remove anyone from garden escapes to

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269
remove anyone from garden escapes to
 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.719
remove anyone from garden escapes to
home escapes and we collected the team

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729
home escapes and we collected the team
 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.580
home escapes and we collected the team
behind home escapes from scratch so we

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590
behind home escapes from scratch so we
 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.980
behind home escapes from scratch so we
were developing the game for one and a

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990
were developing the game for one and a
 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.560
were developing the game for one and a
half year

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570
half year
 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.100
half year
and initially it was ten people just

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110
and initially it was ten people just
 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.260
and initially it was ten people just
from scratch and then they came rapidly

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270
from scratch and then they came rapidly
 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.470
from scratch and then they came rapidly
grew to more than 60 people and right

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480
grew to more than 60 people and right
 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.970
grew to more than 60 people and right
now it's growing even more so yeah so we

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980
now it's growing even more so yeah so we
 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.950
now it's growing even more so yeah so we
didn't move any resources and we just

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960
didn't move any resources and we just
 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.860
didn't move any resources and we just
seek for top talent and we have the

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870
seek for top talent and we have the
 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.230
seek for top talent and we have the
knowledge and we had very good

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240
knowledge and we had very good
 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.290
knowledge and we had very good
experience with garden scapes and when

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300
experience with garden scapes and when
 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.110
experience with garden scapes and when
we when we were making home scapes we we

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120
we when we were making home scapes we we
 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.940
we when we were making home scapes we we
tried to make a game which is which is

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950
tried to make a game which is which is
 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.580
tried to make a game which is which is
not kind of a sequel but we wanted to

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590
not kind of a sequel but we wanted to
 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.050
not kind of a sequel but we wanted to
create a game which was interesting to

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060
create a game which was interesting to
 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.380
create a game which was interesting to
play in parallel with Geron scapes so we

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390
play in parallel with Geron scapes so we
 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.830
play in parallel with Geron scapes so we
wanted to do to change some mechanics

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840
wanted to do to change some mechanics
 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.850
wanted to do to change some mechanics
but we wanted to do like to stay in the

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860
but we wanted to do like to stay in the
 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.000
but we wanted to do like to stay in the
same universe we wanted to expand the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010

utility now for people you know they
come back and they play this even if

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:18.649
come back and they play this even if
 

00:08:18.649 --> 00:08:19.809
come back and they play this even if
they may have lapped for two or three

00:08:19.809 --> 00:08:19.819
they may have lapped for two or three
 

00:08:19.819 --> 00:08:22.240
they may have lapped for two or three
months they they will come back and then

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.250
months they they will come back and then
 

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.860
months they they will come back and then
play it for a you know kind of the

play it for a you know kind of the
 

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.480
play it for a you know kind of the
regular session kind of lanes that we

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:25.490
regular session kind of lanes that we
 

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.769
regular session kind of lanes that we
would expect to see when they first

00:08:26.769 --> 00:08:26.779
would expect to see when they first
 

00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:30.129
would expect to see when they first
started so we we really spend a lot of

00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:30.139
started so we we really spend a lot of
 

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:32.889
started so we we really spend a lot of
time on on on that aspect of our of our

00:08:32.889 --> 00:08:32.899
time on on on that aspect of our of our
 

00:08:32.899 --> 00:08:34.709
time on on on that aspect of our of our
launch strategy and our you know

00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719
launch strategy and our you know
 

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:36.759
launch strategy and our you know
relaunching games sometimes as well

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:36.769
relaunching games sometimes as well
 

00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:39.189
relaunching games sometimes as well
running eight ball as a utility it's

00:08:39.189 --> 00:08:39.199
running eight ball as a utility it's
 

00:08:39.199 --> 00:08:42.790
running eight ball as a utility it's
there everybody plays ball right I know

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800
there everybody plays ball right I know
 

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.410

it's yeah pretty tricky to get off yes
you've just launched a turns journey and

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:53.890
you've just launched a turns journey and
 

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.519
you've just launched a turns journey and
with a really massive launch and

00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:56.529

00:08:56.529 --> 00:08:58.500
with a really massive launch and
congratulations on this first day yeah

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:58.510
congratulations on this first day yeah
 

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.930

talked you mentioned that you've you
kind of created a really long production

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:04.990
kind of created a really long production
 

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.990
kind of created a really long production
cycle with a pretty long roadmap of

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.000
cycle with a pretty long roadmap of
 

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.660
cycle with a pretty long roadmap of
content updates live ops and activities

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:09.670
content updates live ops and activities
 

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.310
content updates live ops and activities
that you're doing in order to reduce the

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:11.320
that you're doing in order to reduce the
 

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.199
that you're doing in order to reduce the
original risk at launch I wanted to to

00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:13.209
original risk at launch I wanted to to
 

00:09:13.209 --> 00:09:15.060
original risk at launch I wanted to to
ask a little bit about that yeah yes

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:15.070
ask a little bit about that yeah yes
 

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.069
ask a little bit about that yeah yes
so June's journeys our latest hidden

00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:17.079
so June's journeys our latest hidden
 

00:09:17.079 --> 00:09:18.810
so June's journeys our latest hidden
object game and came out two weeks ago

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:18.820
object game and came out two weeks ago
 

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.710
object game and came out two weeks ago
and there was really two phases during

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720
and there was really two phases during
 

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.800
and there was really two phases during
the soft launch the first phase was okay

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:25.810
the soft launch the first phase was okay
 

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.210
the soft launch the first phase was okay
does this have the retention metrics

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:27.220
does this have the retention metrics
 

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.610
does this have the retention metrics
that we need to have a successful game

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:29.620
that we need to have a successful game
 

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.410
that we need to have a successful game
long-term that was something we looked

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:31.420
long-term that was something we looked
 

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.960
long-term that was something we looked
at between January and April and because

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:33.970
at between January and April and because
 

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.400
at between January and April and because
we had a previous hidden object game

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:35.410
we had a previous hidden object game
 

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.139
we had a previous hidden object game
before that was a big success we could

00:09:37.139 --> 00:09:37.149
before that was a big success we could
 

00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:39.630
before that was a big success we could
compare apples to apples and we saw very

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:39.640
compare apples to apples and we saw very
 

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.490
compare apples to apples and we saw very
early okay this will work right

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:41.500
early okay this will work right
 

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.290
early okay this will work right
retention is good but then we had

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:43.300
retention is good but then we had
 

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.329
retention is good but then we had
another six months period from from

00:09:45.329 --> 00:09:45.339
another six months period from from
 

00:09:45.339 --> 00:09:47.370
another six months period from from
April to October where it was really

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:47.380
April to October where it was really
 

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.370
April to October where it was really
about de-risking the launch because life

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:50.380
about de-risking the launch because life
 

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.769
about de-risking the launch because life
operations and content are so critical

00:09:52.769 --> 00:09:52.779
operations and content are so critical
 

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:54.560
operations and content are so critical
so it's our highest production value a

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:54.570
so it's our highest production value a
 

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.780
so it's our highest production value a
game ever it's our biggest content

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:57.790
game ever it's our biggest content
 

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.280
game ever it's our biggest content
effort game ever it's it's pretty

00:09:59.280 --> 00:09:59.290
effort game ever it's it's pretty
 

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.220
effort game ever it's it's pretty
ridiculous so we release a new chapter

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:02.230
ridiculous so we release a new chapter
 

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.319
ridiculous so we release a new chapter
every every single week every Friday and

00:10:04.319 --> 00:10:04.329
every every single week every Friday and
 

00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:08.240
every every single week every Friday and
every chapter is 1600 man-hours of work

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:08.250
every chapter is 1600 man-hours of work
 

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.889
every chapter is 1600 man-hours of work
so every Friday there's basically a

00:10:10.889 --> 00:10:10.899
so every Friday there's basically a
 

00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:13.680
so every Friday there's basically a
chapter that would take 40 people or 40

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:13.690
chapter that would take 40 people or 40
 

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.240
chapter that would take 40 people or 40
hours a week to produce every single

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:15.250
hours a week to produce every single
 

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:15.630
hours a week to produce every single
Friday

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640
Friday
 

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.210
Friday
and with people internally without

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:18.220
and with people internally without
 

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.460
and with people internally without
sourcing and and that's I mean it's

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:20.470
sourcing and and that's I mean it's
 

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.579
sourcing and and that's I mean it's
ridiculous but we think it will work the

00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:23.589
ridiculous but we think it will work the
 

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:25.260
ridiculous but we think it will work the
first two weeks of data indicate that

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:25.270
first two weeks of data indicate that
 

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.490
first two weeks of data indicate that
this will work our previous

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:26.500
this will work our previous
 

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.990
this will work our previous
hidden-object game indicates that that

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000
hidden-object game indicates that that
 

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.050
hidden-object game indicates that that
will work and we really needed the

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:31.060
will work and we really needed the
 

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.490
will work and we really needed the
preparation time because we have an

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:32.500
preparation time because we have an
 

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.560
preparation time because we have an
author author team like a writing team

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:34.570
author author team like a writing team
 

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.019
author author team like a writing team
of three authors they write about a year

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:37.029
of three authors they write about a year
 

00:10:37.029 --> 00:10:38.670
of three authors they write about a year
in advance so they are currently writing

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:38.680
in advance so they are currently writing
 

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.199
in advance so they are currently writing
the story that will appear in the game

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:40.209
the story that will appear in the game
 

00:10:40.209 --> 00:10:42.000
the story that will appear in the game
in one year next October

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.010
in one year next October
 

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.829
in one year next October
there's graphic production in between

00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839
there's graphic production in between
 

00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:46.920
there's graphic production in between
etc so what we really did is we went to

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:46.930
etc so what we really did is we went to
 

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.050
etc so what we really did is we went to
the UK and we did something we called

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:49.060
the UK and we did something we called
 

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.840
the UK and we did something we called
dress rehearsal so we we pretend that we

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:51.850
dress rehearsal so we we pretend that we
 

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.449
dress rehearsal so we we pretend that we
were live so we had weekly content

00:10:54.449 --> 00:10:54.459
were live so we had weekly content
 

00:10:54.459 --> 00:10:57.510
were live so we had weekly content
releases we had our weekly reviews on

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:57.520
releases we had our weekly reviews on
 

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.010
releases we had our weekly reviews on
marketing spend with it so

00:10:59.010 --> 00:10:59.020
marketing spend with it so
 

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.930
marketing spend with it so
for media customer care we did

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:00.940
for media customer care we did
 

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.699
for media customer care we did
everything as if we were live globally

00:11:02.699 --> 00:11:02.709
everything as if we were live globally
 

00:11:02.709 --> 00:11:04.920
everything as if we were live globally
just limited to the UK across all

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:04.930
just limited to the UK across all
 

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.220
just limited to the UK across all
platforms and we didn't do that to

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:08.230
platforms and we didn't do that to
 

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.199
platforms and we didn't do that to
evaluate if the game would work from a

00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:10.209
evaluate if the game would work from a
 

00:11:10.209 --> 00:11:11.400
evaluate if the game would work from a
retention perspective we had already

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:11.410
retention perspective we had already
 

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.100
retention perspective we had already
done that before but to practice if we

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:14.110
done that before but to practice if we
 

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.050
done that before but to practice if we
could run life operations if we could

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:16.060
could run life operations if we could
 

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.470
could run life operations if we could
run counter production if we could run

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480
run counter production if we could run
 

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.810
run counter production if we could run
localization and all of those things and

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:20.820
localization and all of those things and
 

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.160
localization and all of those things and
yeah that was really really key but it's

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.170
yeah that was really really key but it's
 

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.579
yeah that was really really key but it's
a huge bet it seems to pay off but I had

00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:26.589
a huge bet it seems to pay off but I had
 

00:11:26.589 --> 00:11:29.730
a huge bet it seems to pay off but I had
some sleepless nights I can imagine so

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:29.740
some sleepless nights I can imagine so
 

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.370
some sleepless nights I can imagine so
at what stage then during that dress

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:32.380
at what stage then during that dress
 

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.320
at what stage then during that dress
rehearsal did you make that go or no-go

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:34.330
rehearsal did you make that go or no-go
 

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.300
rehearsal did you make that go or no-go
decision was that like a set threshold

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:36.310
decision was that like a set threshold
 

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.010
decision was that like a set threshold
that you have sent or was it mostly so

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:38.020
that you have sent or was it mostly so
 

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.710
that you have sent or was it mostly so
so yeah we already made the we will

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720
so yeah we already made the we will
 

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.710
so yeah we already made the we will
launch decision in April and in April we

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:43.720
launch decision in April and in April we
 

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.660
launch decision in April and in April we
said we will launch on October 5th so

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:45.670
said we will launch on October 5th so
 

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.519
said we will launch on October 5th so
half a year in advance we set a specific

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:47.529
half a year in advance we set a specific
 

00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:49.949
half a year in advance we set a specific
launch date and we work backwards from

00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:49.959
launch date and we work backwards from
 

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.980
launch date and we work backwards from
that and we would have only diverted

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:52.990
that and we would have only diverted
 

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.120
that and we would have only diverted
from this if we would have seen

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:54.130
from this if we would have seen
 

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.280
from this if we would have seen
something unexpected so we really used

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:56.290
something unexpected so we really used
 

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.470
something unexpected so we really used
that half year to see is there something

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480
that half year to see is there something
 

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.320
that half year to see is there something
unexpected coming and to have those

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:01.330
unexpected coming and to have those
 

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.180
unexpected coming and to have those
dozens of people who are involved to

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:03.190
dozens of people who are involved to
 

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.069
dozens of people who are involved to
basically prepare them and train them

00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079
basically prepare them and train them
 

00:12:05.079 --> 00:12:07.290
basically prepare them and train them
and get them into them into the rhythm

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:07.300
and get them into them into the rhythm
 

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.540
and get them into them into the rhythm
of what it means to run a game with life

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:09.550
of what it means to run a game with life
 

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.340
of what it means to run a game with life
operations and content because that's I

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:11.350
operations and content because that's I
 

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.560
operations and content because that's I
mean the five years after launch are so

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:13.570
mean the five years after launch are so
 

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.210
mean the five years after launch are so
much more important now than the two

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:15.220
much more important now than the two
 

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.610
much more important now than the two
years before yeah and that's that's what

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:17.620
years before yeah and that's that's what
 

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.900
years before yeah and that's that's what
we basically prepared for in the last

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:18.910
we basically prepared for in the last
 

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:19.560
we basically prepared for in the last
half-year

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:19.570
half-year
 

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.660
half-year
that's a new opt-in optimized during

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:21.670
that's a new opt-in optimized during
 

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.490
that's a new opt-in optimized during
that period for for long term retention

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:23.500
that period for for long term retention
 

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.190
that period for for long term retention
we optimized for long term retention so

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:26.200
we optimized for long term retention so
 

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.500
we optimized for long term retention so
I mean one one sentence I I say is okay

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:28.510
I mean one one sentence I I say is okay
 

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.360
I mean one one sentence I I say is okay
you will lose a certain amount of people

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:30.370
you will lose a certain amount of people
 

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.010
you will lose a certain amount of people
during the first week they may not like

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:32.020
during the first week they may not like
 

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.780
during the first week they may not like
theme they may look like the Jorah

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:33.790
theme they may look like the Jorah
 

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.730
theme they may look like the Jorah
but those who are still with you after

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:35.740
but those who are still with you after
 

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.060
but those who are still with you after
week you really want to keep in the long

week you really want to keep in the long
 

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.500
week you really want to keep in the long
run you really still want to have them

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:40.510
run you really still want to have them
 

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.030

after year that was the mindset on

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.040
after year that was the mindset on
 

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.340
after year that was the mindset on
counter production so from day seven to

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:44.350
counter production so from day seven to
 

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.260
counter production so from day seven to
day 28 retention you expect a minimal

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:46.270
day 28 retention you expect a minimal
 

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.090
day 28 retention you expect a minimal
drop-off in order to justify and

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:48.100
drop-off in order to justify and
 

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.800
drop-off in order to justify and
actually with our hidden object games

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:49.810
actually with our hidden object games
 

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.110
actually with our hidden object games
we've now changed our reporting system

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:52.120
we've now changed our reporting system
 

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.300
we've now changed our reporting system
to measure day 720 retention because

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:54.310
to measure day 720 retention because
 

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.000
to measure day 720 retention because
these games are really about a 720 yes

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.010
these games are really about a 720 yes
 

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.829
these games are really about a 720 yes
two year retention so we measure two

00:12:58.829 --> 00:12:58.839
two year retention so we measure two
 

00:12:58.839 --> 00:13:01.260
two year retention so we measure two
year retention for cohorts because

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:01.270
year retention for cohorts because
 

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.090
year retention for cohorts because
long-term retention is everything for

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:03.100
long-term retention is everything for
 

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.550
long-term retention is everything for
these games that's a good segue action

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:05.560
these games that's a good segue action
 

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.150
these games that's a good segue action
to move on to George you've been running

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160
to move on to George you've been running
 

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.380
to move on to George you've been running

famous candy crush and saga and the
hotel franchise and so at at figure

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:19.220
hotel franchise and so at at figure
 

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.890
hotel franchise and so at at figure
you'd also optimize for the long-term

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:20.900
you'd also optimize for the long-term
 

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.230
you'd also optimize for the long-term
retention oh yeah and I'm wondering how

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:23.240
retention oh yeah and I'm wondering how
 

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.450
retention oh yeah and I'm wondering how
you guys make the decision between

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:25.460
you guys make the decision between
 

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.060
you guys make the decision between
launching a new franchise to launching a

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:28.070
launching a new franchise to launching a
 

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.380
launching a new franchise to launching a
Content update on one of your existing

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:29.390
Content update on one of your existing
 

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:33.310
Content update on one of your existing
titles okay and basically we had to

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.320
titles okay and basically we had to
 

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.430
titles okay and basically we had to
rethink this strategy around a few years

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.440
rethink this strategy around a few years
 

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.440
rethink this strategy around a few years
ago when we realized that candy crush is

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:38.450
ago when we realized that candy crush is
 

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.740
ago when we realized that candy crush is
here to stay for a long time and we

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:41.750
here to stay for a long time and we
 

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.620
here to stay for a long time and we
decided to go to parallel tracks and one

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:44.630
decided to go to parallel tracks and one
 

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.870
decided to go to parallel tracks and one
is keep working on candy crush and

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880
is keep working on candy crush and
 

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.730
is keep working on candy crush and
improve the game and keep it fresh we

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:48.740
improve the game and keep it fresh we
 

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.190
improve the game and keep it fresh we
are adding new life of upsetting big

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:51.200
are adding new life of upsetting big
 

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.020

investing in existing games and also

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160
investing in existing games and also
 

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.610
investing in existing games and also
working on launching new ones like can

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:06.620
working on launching new ones like can
 

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.410

the original one but also new IDs as
 

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.300
the original one but also new IDs as
well and when you do launch a sequel do

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:13.310
well and when you do launch a sequel do
 

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.220
well and when you do launch a sequel do
you prefer essentially are you taking

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:15.230
you prefer essentially are you taking
 

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.380
you prefer essentially are you taking

we actually hired a completely separate

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:23.840
we actually hired a completely separate
 

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.290
we actually hired a completely separate
team to continue that it's a mix we also

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:26.300
team to continue that it's a mix we also
 

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.150
team to continue that it's a mix we also
like we need to use the expertise for

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160
like we need to use the expertise for
 

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.560
like we need to use the expertise for
from the people that worked on previous

from the people that worked on previous
 

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.390
from the people that worked on previous
games some of them already know how to

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:31.400
games some of them already know how to
 

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.090
games some of them already know how to
build certain stuff right and yeah they

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:34.100
build certain stuff right and yeah they
 

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.950
build certain stuff right and yeah they
are needed in the new team but also yeah

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:35.960
are needed in the new team but also yeah
 

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.550
are needed in the new team but also yeah

yeah that's working clearly that is Bart

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560
yeah that's working clearly that is Bart
 

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.100
yeah that's working clearly that is Bart
so yeah definitely something we can we

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:45.110
so yeah definitely something we can we
 

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:49.540
so yeah definitely something we can we
can learn from and back back to new ends

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:49.550
can learn from and back back to new ends
 

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.250
can learn from and back back to new ends
actually I wanted to ask specifically

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:51.260
actually I wanted to ask specifically
 

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.490
actually I wanted to ask specifically
and about kind of the inverse of tunes

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:54.500
and about kind of the inverse of tunes
 

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.200
and about kind of the inverse of tunes
journey of what we just discussed of an

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:56.210
journey of what we just discussed of an
 

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.570
journey of what we just discussed of an
experience you've had as developing a

00:14:58.570 --> 00:14:58.580
experience you've had as developing a
 

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.860
experience you've had as developing a
game with a relatively long and

00:14:59.860 --> 00:14:59.870
game with a relatively long and
 

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:03.040
game with a relatively long and
scheduled and production cycle and where

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:03.050
scheduled and production cycle and where
 

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.510
scheduled and production cycle and where
you ended up with a decision of saying

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:04.520
you ended up with a decision of saying
 

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.950
you ended up with a decision of saying
this is not worth it we should actually

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:05.960
this is not worth it we should actually
 

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.840
this is not worth it we should actually
roll back and change and move the

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:07.850
roll back and change and move the
 

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:09.070
roll back and change and move the
research to something else so kind of

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:09.080
research to something else so kind of
 

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.740
research to something else so kind of
you know decide to kill no roadmap yeah

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:11.750
you know decide to kill no roadmap yeah
 

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.870
you know decide to kill no roadmap yeah
yeah we we we we question our

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:13.880
yeah we we we we question our
 

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.670
yeah we we we we question our
productions all the time and we actually

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680
productions all the time and we actually
 

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.290
productions all the time and we actually
stopped games at different stages so

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:17.300
stopped games at different stages so
 

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.290
stopped games at different stages so
just a couple of days ago we stopped the

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:20.300
just a couple of days ago we stopped the
 

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.020
just a couple of days ago we stopped the
project that was already full scale into

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:23.030
project that was already full scale into
 

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.790
project that was already full scale into
production

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:23.800
production
 

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.949
production
over 20 people team but it was still

00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:25.959
over 20 people team but it was still
 

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:29.250
over 20 people team but it was still
over a year away from launch and we saw

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:29.260
over a year away from launch and we saw
 

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.430
over a year away from launch and we saw
too many risks and and in the end

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:32.440
too many risks and and in the end
 

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.620
too many risks and and in the end
decided okay we stopped this because of

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:34.630
decided okay we stopped this because of
 

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.900
decided okay we stopped this because of
not everything was shaping up to give a

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:36.910
not everything was shaping up to give a
 

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.699
not everything was shaping up to give a
very clear picture of this will be

00:15:38.699 --> 00:15:38.709
very clear picture of this will be
 

00:15:38.709 --> 00:15:40.680
very clear picture of this will be
awesome because just good is not enough

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:40.690
awesome because just good is not enough
 

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.150
awesome because just good is not enough
anymore right on this market you have to

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160
anymore right on this market you have to
 

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.550
anymore right on this market you have to
be one of the best or maybe the best in

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560
be one of the best or maybe the best in
 

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.650
be one of the best or maybe the best in
your drama to have a chance so that was

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:46.660
your drama to have a chance so that was
 

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.750
your drama to have a chance so that was
really based on early stage relatively

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:48.760
really based on early stage relatively
 

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.360
really based on early stage relatively
early stage and based on play tests and

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:51.370
early stage and based on play tests and
 

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.690
early stage and based on play tests and
and subjective evaluation but we also

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:54.700
and subjective evaluation but we also
 

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.940
and subjective evaluation but we also
stopped the project in May that was in

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:56.950
stopped the project in May that was in
 

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:58.650
stopped the project in May that was in
soft launch based on retention metrics

00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:58.660
soft launch based on retention metrics
 

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.319
soft launch based on retention metrics
so we day one day three retention was

00:16:01.319 --> 00:16:01.329
so we day one day three retention was
 

00:16:01.329 --> 00:16:03.900
so we day one day three retention was
good but then day seven the drop-off of

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:03.910
good but then day seven the drop-off of
 

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.750
good but then day seven the drop-off of
retention was too strong and and we just

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:06.760
retention was too strong and and we just
 

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.630
retention was too strong and and we just
stopped that in relatively early stages

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:09.640
stopped that in relatively early stages
 

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.920
stopped that in relatively early stages
of soft launch so those were two

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:10.930
of soft launch so those were two
 

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.990
of soft launch so those were two
separate cycles if you will one a

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.000
separate cycles if you will one a
 

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.519
separate cycles if you will one a
subjects latency I wanted very

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:14.529
subjects latency I wanted very
 

00:16:14.529 --> 00:16:17.280
subjects latency I wanted very
subjective play test over a year away

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:17.290
subjective play test over a year away
 

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.530
subjective play test over a year away
from launch the second one was after

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:19.540
from launch the second one was after
 

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.569
from launch the second one was after
after a couple of months of soft launch

00:16:21.569 --> 00:16:21.579
after a couple of months of soft launch
 

00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:23.790
after a couple of months of soft launch
based on metrics so even after the

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:23.800
based on metrics so even after the
 

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.949
based on metrics so even after the
subjective measure that we figured out

00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:25.959
subjective measure that we figured out
 

00:16:25.959 --> 00:16:27.420
subjective measure that we figured out
it might not you know hold up the

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:27.430
it might not you know hold up the
 

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:31.170
it might not you know hold up the
quality still right I don't need any

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:31.180
quality still right I don't need any
 

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.710
quality still right I don't need any
developer who says oh it's easy right I

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720
developer who says oh it's easy right I
 

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.569
developer who says oh it's easy right I
never meet them so it's super super

00:16:36.569 --> 00:16:36.579
never meet them so it's super super
 

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:37.769
never meet them so it's super super
tough you have to be one of the best

00:16:37.769 --> 00:16:37.779
tough you have to be one of the best
 

00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:40.319
tough you have to be one of the best
yeah and and therefore the bar is crazy

00:16:40.319 --> 00:16:40.329
yeah and and therefore the bar is crazy
 

00:16:40.329 --> 00:16:42.600
yeah and and therefore the bar is crazy
high and you have to be quite ruthless

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:42.610
high and you have to be quite ruthless
 

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.449
high and you have to be quite ruthless
yeah and only if you're completely

00:16:45.449 --> 00:16:45.459
yeah and only if you're completely
 

00:16:45.459 --> 00:16:47.400
yeah and only if you're completely
convinced that this will be great you

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:47.410
convinced that this will be great you
 

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.590
convinced that this will be great you
should continue and and if it's oh this

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600
should continue and and if it's oh this
 

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.180
should continue and and if it's oh this
is pretty good that's not enough that's

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:51.190
is pretty good that's not enough that's
 

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.280
is pretty good that's not enough that's
that's not acceptable can I ask a

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:53.290
that's not acceptable can I ask a
 

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.850
that's not acceptable can I ask a
question because you guys it's probably

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:56.860
question because you guys it's probably
 

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.829
question because you guys it's probably
more relevant for the room but everyone

00:16:58.829 --> 00:16:58.839
more relevant for the room but everyone
 

00:16:58.839 --> 00:17:01.199
more relevant for the room but everyone
talks about the retention metrics what

00:17:01.199 --> 00:17:01.209
talks about the retention metrics what
 

00:17:01.209 --> 00:17:03.510
talks about the retention metrics what
is your bar you said you guys set a bar

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:03.520
is your bar you said you guys set a bar
 

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.610
is your bar you said you guys set a bar
what's your bar above the forty twenty

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:05.620
what's your bar above the forty twenty
 

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:06.960
what's your bar above the forty twenty
ten like what are you going out looking

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:06.970
ten like what are you going out looking
 

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.829
ten like what are you going out looking
at so what we do is we look at days play

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:10.839
at so what we do is we look at days play
 

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.799
at so what we do is we look at days play
so for every install how many days on

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:13.809
so for every install how many days on
 

00:17:13.809 --> 00:17:16.500
so for every install how many days on
average does a person play over the year

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:16.510
average does a person play over the year
 

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.659
average does a person play over the year
right over the next year and and that

00:17:18.659 --> 00:17:18.669
right over the next year and and that
 

00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:20.850
right over the next year and and that
that number can be high because the

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:20.860
that number can be high because the
 

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:22.350
that number can be high because the
long-term retention is amazing or that

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:22.360
long-term retention is amazing or that
 

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.059
long-term retention is amazing or that
number can be high because everybody

00:17:24.059 --> 00:17:24.069
number can be high because everybody
 

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:25.679
number can be high because everybody
plays for the first few weeks and then

00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:25.689
plays for the first few weeks and then
 

00:17:25.689 --> 00:17:28.409
plays for the first few weeks and then
drops off and there something in the

00:17:28.409 --> 00:17:28.419
drops off and there something in the
 

00:17:28.419 --> 00:17:30.840
drops off and there something in the
ballpark of days played of thirty to

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:30.850
ballpark of days played of thirty to
 

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.060
ballpark of days played of thirty to
forty is good right so you have 100

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.070
forty is good right so you have 100
 

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.390
forty is good right so you have 100
installs and

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400
installs and
 

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.490
installs and
then on average they play 30 or 40 days

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:36.500
then on average they play 30 or 40 days
 

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.780
then on average they play 30 or 40 days
during the year but obviously

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:37.790
during the year but obviously
 

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.610
during the year but obviously
monetization is also important 30 to 40

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:39.620
monetization is also important 30 to 40
 

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.120
monetization is also important 30 to 40
sessions no no no 34 it's like separate

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:43.130
sessions no no no 34 it's like separate
 

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.850
sessions no no no 34 it's like separate
days and separate days obviously out of

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:45.860
days and separate days obviously out of
 

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.950
days and separate days obviously out of
those hundred installs most of them play

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:47.960
those hundred installs most of them play
 

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.200
those hundred installs most of them play
one right right because you if you have

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:50.210
one right right because you if you have
 

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:53.230
one right right because you if you have
50% day 1 retention right that's already

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:53.240
50% day 1 retention right that's already
 

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.050
50% day 1 retention right that's already
cutting it so yeah that's the way we

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:56.060
cutting it so yeah that's the way we
 

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.090
cutting it so yeah that's the way we
look at it now because we think numbers

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:58.100
look at it now because we think numbers
 

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.860
look at it now because we think numbers
like a day 30 retention needs to be

00:17:59.860 --> 00:17:59.870
like a day 30 retention needs to be
 

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.780
like a day 30 retention needs to be
about 15 percent or they 30 rate and she

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:01.790
about 15 percent or they 30 rate and she
 

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.640
about 15 percent or they 30 rate and she
needs to be 20 percent that that's

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:03.650
needs to be 20 percent that that's
 

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:06.640
needs to be 20 percent that that's
that's it's just a number it's just one

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:06.650
that's it's just a number it's just one
 

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.670
that's it's just a number it's just one
number you use a whole yeah you know

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:09.680
number you use a whole yeah you know
 

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.900
number you use a whole yeah you know
above you is the amount of days that

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:10.910
above you is the amount of days that
 

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:12.270
above you is the amount of days that
people play to figure out your

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:12.280
people play to figure out your
 

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.500
people play to figure out your
calculator right okay I think a lot of

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:14.510
calculator right okay I think a lot of
 

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.910
calculator right okay I think a lot of
people are moving towards that yeah we

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:15.920
people are moving towards that yeah we
 

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.790
people are moving towards that yeah we
make LTV predictions basically yeah okay

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:18.800
make LTV predictions basically yeah okay
 

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.340
make LTV predictions basically yeah okay
I think that's what many I hope many

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:21.350
I think that's what many I hope many
 

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.050
I think that's what many I hope many
people doing ya know you have to predict

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:23.060
people doing ya know you have to predict
 

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.450
people doing ya know you have to predict
LTV during soft launch and see where the

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:25.460
LTV during soft launch and see where the
 

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.090
LTV during soft launch and see where the
ends up that actually brings up a really

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:28.100
ends up that actually brings up a really
 

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.880
ends up that actually brings up a really
good point that and specifically to you

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:30.890
good point that and specifically to you
 

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:35.380
good point that and specifically to you
and do recent launch of of war wings and

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:35.390
and do recent launch of of war wings and
 

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.420
and do recent launch of of war wings and
I've just got a little bit surprised

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:37.430
I've just got a little bit surprised
 

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:38.650
I've just got a little bit surprised
that if we have that we're almost

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:38.660
that if we have that we're almost
 

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.630
that if we have that we're almost
running out of time but just to quickly

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640
running out of time but just to quickly
 

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.490
running out of time but just to quickly
cuz talk about the war wings launch

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:42.500
cuz talk about the war wings launch
 

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.690
cuz talk about the war wings launch
because you really have some done

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:43.700
because you really have some done
 

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.890
because you really have some done
something different from from your

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:44.900
something different from from your
 

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.310
something different from from your
recent launches yeah so we we went a

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320
recent launches yeah so we we went a
 

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.740
recent launches yeah so we we went a
little bit outside of our what people

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:50.750
little bit outside of our what people
 

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.360
little bit outside of our what people
perceive as our traditional comfort zone

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:52.370
perceive as our traditional comfort zone
 

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.820
perceive as our traditional comfort zone
where we really launched a fully 3d

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:54.830
where we really launched a fully 3d
 

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:59.350
where we really launched a fully 3d
dogfighting game and we kind of like

00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360
dogfighting game and we kind of like
 

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.820
dogfighting game and we kind of like
yen's has talked about the dress

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:00.830
yen's has talked about the dress
 

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.010
yen's has talked about the dress
rehearsal in in one territory so we'd

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:03.020
rehearsal in in one territory so we'd
 

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.390
rehearsal in in one territory so we'd
already done the soft launch and then we

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400
already done the soft launch and then we
 

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.880
already done the soft launch and then we
essentially focused on doing a full

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:06.890
essentially focused on doing a full
 

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:11.050
essentially focused on doing a full
almost global launch esque kind of

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:11.060
almost global launch esque kind of
 

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.390
almost global launch esque kind of
campaign in one territory so we did that

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:13.400
campaign in one territory so we did that
 

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.910
campaign in one territory so we did that
in the UK so we did you know you're full

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:15.920
in the UK so we did you know you're full
 

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.300
in the UK so we did you know you're full
you a that you would do we did TV we did

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:19.310
you a that you would do we did TV we did
 

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.840
you a that you would do we did TV we did
cinema we did a lot of things we worked

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:22.850
cinema we did a lot of things we worked
 

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.730
cinema we did a lot of things we worked
with the platforms who supported us on

this endeavor to try and see what that

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:26.780
this endeavor to try and see what that
 

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.410
this endeavor to try and see what that
would do and that really gave us you

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:29.420
would do and that really gave us you
 

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.870
would do and that really gave us you
know cuz soft launch can give you a

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:31.880
know cuz soft launch can give you a
 

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.480
know cuz soft launch can give you a
false sense of security sometimes yes I

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:34.490
false sense of security sometimes yes I
 

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.610
false sense of security sometimes yes I
think a lot of people in and a lot of

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:36.620
think a lot of people in and a lot of
 

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.050

product managers and all the you egg

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:38.060
product managers and all the you egg
 

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:42.760
product managers and all the you egg
teams will almost do too well in soft

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:42.770
teams will almost do too well in soft
 

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.260
teams will almost do too well in soft
launch because they'll have targeting

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:44.270
launch because they'll have targeting
 

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.910
launch because they'll have targeting
the users that they really want and the

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:45.920
the users that they really want and the

start looking good and then so you'd

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:47.580
start looking good and then so you'd
 

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.070
start looking good and then so you'd
wonder why they haven't scaled when you

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080
wonder why they haven't scaled when you
 

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.140
wonder why they haven't scaled when you
go into global and they'll be like oh

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:51.150
go into global and they'll be like oh
 

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.240
go into global and they'll be like oh
you know you get it it's the featuring

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:53.250
you know you get it it's the featuring
 

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.159
you know you get it it's the featuring
no you get those are these casual

00:19:55.159 --> 00:19:55.169
no you get those are these casual
 

00:19:55.169 --> 00:19:56.690
no you get those are these casual
audiences guys I know you guys hear it

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700
audiences guys I know you guys hear it
 

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.240
audiences guys I know you guys hear it
we might as well talk about it so what

00:19:59.240 --> 00:19:59.250
we might as well talk about it so what
 

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.890
we might as well talk about it so what
why we did that is just to really get a

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900
why we did that is just to really get a
 

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.620
why we did that is just to really get a
good sense of what that would do on a

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:03.630
good sense of what that would do on a
 

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.870
good sense of what that would do on a
global stage and it's been it's proven

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880
global stage and it's been it's proven
 

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.610
global stage and it's been it's proven
to be successful because it it kind of

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:07.620
to be successful because it it kind of
 

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.320
to be successful because it it kind of
then replicated into the global launch

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:09.330
then replicated into the global launch
 

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.909
then replicated into the global launch
when we when we pushed in our line would

00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919
when we when we pushed in our line would
 

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:12.409
when we when we pushed in our line would
that work for home scape or would that

00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419
that work for home scape or would that
 

00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:14.030
that work for home scape or would that
have been a good strategy for home

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:14.040
have been a good strategy for home
 

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.680
have been a good strategy for home
escapes as well like doubling down on

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:15.690
escapes as well like doubling down on
 

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:18.200
escapes as well like doubling down on
one country and going all-in or do you

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:18.210
one country and going all-in or do you
 

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.030
one country and going all-in or do you
rather go for a global launch and then

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:20.040
rather go for a global launch and then
 

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.680
rather go for a global launch and then
really see down the line where you need

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:21.690
really see down the line where you need
 

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:22.130
really see down the line where you need
to focus

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.140
to focus
 

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:26.960
to focus
it's a good question so we think that

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:26.970
it's a good question so we think that
 

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.789
it's a good question so we think that
the definition for soft launch should be

00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799
the definition for soft launch should be
 

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:30.710
the definition for soft launch should be
different depending on the context so if

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720
different depending on the context so if
 

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.930
different depending on the context so if
you go to the very competitive crowded

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:32.940
you go to the very competitive crowded
 

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.539
you go to the very competitive crowded
space like merge three general then I

00:20:35.539 --> 00:20:35.549
space like merge three general then I
 

00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:38.510
space like merge three general then I
should you should release on the

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520
should you should release on the
 

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.520
should you should release on the
software a very highly polished and

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:40.530
software a very highly polished and
 

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.590
software a very highly polished and
highly polished product which is which

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.600
highly polished product which is which
 

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.990
highly polished product which is which
is pretty ready for for the commercial

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000
is pretty ready for for the commercial
 

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.909
is pretty ready for for the commercial
launch because if you are missing any of

00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919
launch because if you are missing any of
 

00:20:46.919 --> 00:20:48.740
launch because if you are missing any of
the features that other competitors have

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:48.750
the features that other competitors have
 

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.010
the features that other competitors have
in the market then you just don't will

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.020
in the market then you just don't will
 

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.020
in the market then you just don't will
not make it you will not make it and on

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.030
not make it you will not make it and on
 

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.299
not make it you will not make it and on
the soft launch we don't like test any

00:20:56.299 --> 00:20:56.309
the soft launch we don't like test any
 

00:20:56.309 --> 00:20:59.120
the soft launch we don't like test any
mechanics or concepts we we already we

00:20:59.120 --> 00:20:59.130
mechanics or concepts we we already we
 

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.520
mechanics or concepts we we already we
already sure that the game is in a good

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:01.530
already sure that the game is in a good
 

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.909
already sure that the game is in a good
shape but what what we're testing is

00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919
shape but what what we're testing is
 

00:21:03.919 --> 00:21:08.180
shape but what what we're testing is
retentions monetization technical side

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:08.190
retentions monetization technical side
 

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:11.780
retentions monetization technical side
of that nothing crushes and there that

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:11.790
of that nothing crushes and there that
 

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.360
of that nothing crushes and there that
we also test like the difficulty curve

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:14.370
we also test like the difficulty curve
 

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.299
we also test like the difficulty curve
with there which is like general

00:21:17.299 --> 00:21:17.309
with there which is like general
 

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:21.799
with there which is like general
piquillo tea so so yeah and we we soft

00:21:21.799 --> 00:21:21.809
piquillo tea so so yeah and we we soft
 

00:21:21.809 --> 00:21:24.440
piquillo tea so so yeah and we we soft
launch in in Canada usually and

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:24.450
launch in in Canada usually and
 

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:28.130
launch in in Canada usually and
Australia and we believe that this

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:28.140
Australia and we believe that this
 

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.900
Australia and we believe that this
metrics are pretty reliable for the

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:29.910
metrics are pretty reliable for the
 

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:35.180
metrics are pretty reliable for the
commercial launch so yeah so so the

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:35.190
commercial launch so yeah so so the
 

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.460
commercial launch so yeah so so the
period for which we soft launch it

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:37.470
period for which we soft launch it
 

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.130
period for which we soft launch it
depends on the game and for for garden

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140
depends on the game and for for garden
 

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.500
depends on the game and for for garden
escapes we had we soft launch it for for

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:42.510
escapes we had we soft launch it for for
 

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:46.039
escapes we had we soft launch it for for
several month and home escapes we we

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:46.049
several month and home escapes we we
 

00:21:46.049 --> 00:21:48.230
several month and home escapes we we
keep we kept it in soft ones for for one

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240
keep we kept it in soft ones for for one
 

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:53.450
keep we kept it in soft ones for for one
month and yeah so cool we can't rely on

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:53.460
month and yeah so cool we can't rely on
 

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.180
month and yeah so cool we can't rely on
these numbers but it clearly worked I

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:56.190
these numbers but it clearly worked I
 

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.430
these numbers but it clearly worked I
mean all of you guys have been really

00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440
mean all of you guys have been really
 

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.960
mean all of you guys have been really
successful in launching this game

00:21:59.960 --> 00:21:59.970
successful in launching this game
 

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.300
successful in launching this game
this year so we've we've taken a lot of

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:02.310
this year so we've we've taken a lot of
 

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.590
this year so we've we've taken a lot of
learnings from you guys and really want

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600
learnings from you guys and really want
 

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.730
learnings from you guys and really want
to share as much as we can

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.740
to share as much as we can
 

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.650

good right or 10% B 30 would be good but
that's kind of crazy if you think about

that's kind of crazy if you think about
 

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:02.400
