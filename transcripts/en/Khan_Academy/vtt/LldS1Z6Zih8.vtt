00:00:00.306 --> 00:00:01.705
Neal: The scene is indelibly imprinted

00:00:01.705 --> 00:00:03.031
on anyone who's been to college:

00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:05.530
row after row of students gazing down

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.389
as a professor or a TA drones on

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.503
about chemical bonds or
the Byzantine Empire.

00:00:11.503 --> 00:00:13.370
The long lecture is widely accepted

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.843
as an economical and effective way

00:00:14.843 --> 00:00:16.260
to educate large groups of students,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.874
but in a piece for Time Magazine,

00:00:17.874 --> 00:00:20.885
Salman Khan argues that even
the most brilliant speaker

00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:22.176
and the most compelling subject

00:00:22.176 --> 00:00:25.010
won't hold students' attention
for more than 18 minutes.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.383
So, call and tell us about
the lecture you remember best;

00:00:28.383 --> 00:00:32.634
800-989-8255; email us talk@npr.org.

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:35.261
You could also join the
conversation on our website,

that's at npr.org, click
on "Talk of the Nation."

00:00:38.014 --> 00:00:40.683
Salman Khan is founder
of the Khan Academy,

00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:43.985
author of "The One World
Schoolhouse: Education Reimagined,"

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:46.544
and joins us now from his
studio in Stanford, California.

00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:47.639
Nice to have you with us today.

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:48.793
Salman: Great to be here.

00:00:48.793 --> 00:00:50.884
Neal: What is it that makes
those lectures so boring?

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:54.134
Salman: (chuckles) Well, I think all of us

00:00:54.134 --> 00:00:56.634
could answer that in a very anecdotal way,

00:00:56.634 --> 00:00:59.882
but what I think a lot
of people don't realize

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:02.551
is that there's actually
been research in this base,

00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:06.046
to study the lecture,
and it's pretty decisive,

00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:07.715
it's never been really contradicted,

00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:10.739
that people can pay attention
for about 10-18 minutes,

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:12.632
after which they start zoning out.

00:01:12.632 --> 00:01:16.044
Then they can kind of re-check
in for about 10 minutes,

00:01:16.044 --> 00:01:18.006
then they zone out for an
even longer period of time,

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:19.758
and that keeps going on.

00:01:19.758 --> 00:01:23.045
Studies have shown that when
you do lecture at someone,

00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:25.214
that you actually retain some
of the early information,

00:01:25.214 --> 00:01:27.633
you retain very little of
the latter information.

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:30.298
Just as you described,
a lot of the reason why

00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:32.796
we do it this way is really logistics;

00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:35.967
logistics coming from a
reality where we didn't have

00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:38.298
any other technologies to
deliver the information,

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:41.796
so we, for the most part,
in colleges and K through 12

00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:44.988
around the world, we still
have a bunch of students

00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:47.766
sitting there for 60-90
minutes being lectured at.

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:51.632
Neal: That vacillating
attention span you talk about,

00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:54.382
you could miss out on
entire pharaonic dynasties.

00:01:54.382 --> 00:01:58.049
Salman: (laughs) No, no,
that's exactly right.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.137
It hasn't gone completely unrecognized.

00:02:01.137 --> 00:02:04.051
There have been attempts
to address this issue.

00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:08.503
I talk about it in the book,
that there have been professors

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:09.856
that try to do these change-ups,

00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:11.225
try to ask questions,

00:02:11.225 --> 00:02:14.377
try to do little group
things every 10 or 15 minutes

00:02:14.377 --> 00:02:15.498
to address this issue,

00:02:15.498 --> 00:02:19.265
but what I point out is that
that's a bit of a half-way fix.

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:22.515
What we really should think
is well, is this class time,

00:02:22.515 --> 00:02:24.523
this time that all these
human beings get together,

00:02:24.523 --> 00:02:27.491
is lecture even the best use of that?

00:02:27.491 --> 00:02:30.015
Neal: Well, you've got to convey a certain

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:33.943
amount of information
to, certainly in the case

00:02:33.943 --> 00:02:36.943
of college introduction
courses, a whole bunch

00:02:36.943 --> 00:02:38.128
of people at the same time.

00:02:38.128 --> 00:02:41.765
Salman. That's right, and
200 years ago I probably

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:44.188
couldn't have come up with
a better way of doing that.

00:02:44.188 --> 00:02:49.362
Now we have very on-demand
ways to access media,

00:02:49.362 --> 00:02:50.520
obviously things like YouTube,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.492
obviously things like Khan
Academy what I work on,

00:02:52.492 --> 00:02:53.600
but there's other efforts.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.522
There's EdEx that MIT
and Harvard are doing.

00:02:55.522 --> 00:02:57.313
A lot of med schools have actually

00:02:57.313 --> 00:02:58.253
been doing this for a little while,

00:02:58.253 --> 00:03:00.752
where students are getting
the information delivery,

00:03:00.752 --> 00:03:02.374
the lecture, at their own time and pace.

00:03:02.374 --> 00:03:05.999
There are benefits to that
because you can pause.

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:07.408
If there's a word you don't understand,

00:03:07.408 --> 00:03:09.003
you could look it up on the internet.

00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:10.158
You can go ask a friend.

00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:12.858
If you forgot a little bit
of your review material

00:03:12.858 --> 00:03:15.477
from a couple of years ago,
no need to be embarrassed

00:03:15.477 --> 00:03:16.912
and raise your hand in the middle of class

00:03:16.912 --> 00:03:18.004
and stop everyone's learning.

00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:19.420
You can go review that material,

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.504
and you don't have to take notes

00:03:20.504 --> 00:03:21.754
because it's always there.

00:03:21.754 --> 00:03:23.670
Then when you go to class time,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.505
you can use that for
something more valuable

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.417
like a conversation or a project

00:03:27.417 --> 00:03:29.042
or some type of peer-to-peer learning.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.638
Neal: But isn't it also the
student's responsibility

00:03:31.638 --> 00:03:34.281
to absorb some of this knowledge?

00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:37.391
Salman: It is, it is, and
it's always going to be

00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:38.886
the student's responsibility.

00:03:38.886 --> 00:03:42.360
In fact, I think that's
why lecture misses,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.804
is that at the end of the
day, learning is something

00:03:44.804 --> 00:03:46.386
that the student has to decide to do.

00:03:46.386 --> 00:03:48.556
At the university level, especially,

00:03:48.556 --> 00:03:51.307
I've always said it would
be interesting to administer

00:03:51.307 --> 00:03:53.373
a final exam 2 days
before students thought

00:03:53.373 --> 00:03:54.628
that they were going to get the final exam

00:03:54.628 --> 00:03:56.553
and see what the delta is.

00:03:56.553 --> 00:03:58.010
You'll see that very
little of the learning,

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.009
or at least as measured by the final exam,

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.009
occurs in the first 90% of the class.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.748
It's really the last 2-3
days before the exam,

00:04:05.748 --> 00:04:07.888
students are cramming
and teaching each other

00:04:07.888 --> 00:04:11.000
and that's what's really
moving the dial on their exams.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.308
Neal: I wonder, you said
you don't have to take notes

00:04:13.308 --> 00:04:16.397
if you can have electronic
copies of the lectures,

00:04:16.397 --> 00:04:19.139
digital copies that you
can go back and refer to.

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.404
Doesn't the act of taking
notes help you learn?

00:04:23.404 --> 00:04:26.227
Salman: The act of doing
anything does help you learn.

00:04:26.227 --> 00:04:29.181
Fundamentally, if you
are passive in anything

00:04:29.181 --> 00:04:31.129
you're probably not that engaged.

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:33.260
I think a lot of students do take notes

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.883
literally just to stay awake,

00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:36.270
literally to be engaged.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.764
A lot of students say they
don't use the notes later on,

00:04:38.764 --> 00:04:40.432
it's just really to somewhat stay engaged.

00:04:40.432 --> 00:04:42.015
That's the whole point.

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:44.381
If we want students to stay engaged,

00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:46.633
going through this
exercise of taking notes

00:04:46.633 --> 00:04:48.685
while listening to a lecture,

00:04:48.685 --> 00:04:50.016
and oftentimes not being able to listen

00:04:50.016 --> 00:04:51.014
because they're taking notes,

00:04:51.014 --> 00:04:53.132
let's just make it more active.

00:04:53.132 --> 00:04:55.518
Instead of doing these change-ups
every 10 or 15 minutes,

00:04:55.518 --> 00:04:57.366
let's make the whole classroom change-ups.

00:04:57.366 --> 00:04:59.933
Let's make the whole classroom
students teaching each other,

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:01.678
students having a
conversation with each other.

00:05:01.678 --> 00:05:03.019
The one thing I point
out a lot in the book is

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:07.508
we talk about this human
experience of education,

00:05:07.508 --> 00:05:09.982
but when students are
sitting in a classroom

00:05:09.982 --> 00:05:12.261
and there's someone lecturing at them,

00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:13.268
maybe they're taking notes,

00:05:13.268 --> 00:05:15.883
you're in a room with 30,
maybe 300 other people

00:05:15.883 --> 00:05:16.881
at the college level,

00:05:16.881 --> 00:05:18.633
that's a very dehumanizing experience.

00:05:18.633 --> 00:05:20.928
I've sat in classes for the whole semester

00:05:20.928 --> 00:05:22.505
and I didn't know 98% of those people,

00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:23.383
I didn't know their names.

00:05:23.383 --> 00:05:25.019
What we're really advocating,

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:27.516
and we're starting to see in a
lot of schools and universities,

00:05:27.516 --> 00:05:31.019
is let's have those 300 people
interact with each other.

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:33.020
Instead of having a study
group just the last 3 days

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.185
before the exam, why don't we
have it for the whole semester?

00:05:35.185 --> 00:05:37.511
Neal: A study group with 300 people;

00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:39.266
that's not a class, it's a potential riot.

00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:41.986
Salman: (laughs) No, no, that's right.

00:05:41.986 --> 00:05:44.186
I think that's where
technology comes in, again.

00:05:44.186 --> 00:05:47.933
One, it can help deliver
some of the information

00:05:47.933 --> 00:05:50.387
that lectures used to do;

00:05:50.387 --> 00:05:51.854
but now you can also coordinate.

00:05:51.854 --> 00:05:54.772
You can see where students
are in their skill levels,

00:05:54.772 --> 00:05:55.567
you can pair them up,

00:05:55.567 --> 00:05:58.619
you can give diagnostics to the teacher.

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:02.311
Some people say, "Well, students might not

00:06:02.311 --> 00:06:05.364
"listen to lecture if
it's happening at home."

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:09.244
Before they had homework
that could have been checked.

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.148
What I point out, and most
people agree with this,

00:06:11.148 --> 00:06:13.402
is that the homework,
or the problem solving,

00:06:13.402 --> 00:06:15.142
is where the learning is happening.

00:06:15.142 --> 00:06:16.895
If students are going to check out

00:06:16.895 --> 00:06:18.243
of one of the two things, I would say

00:06:18.243 --> 00:06:20.869
make sure it's not the problem solving.

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:23.897
Neal: Going back to your
days as a student, though,

00:06:23.897 --> 00:06:27.726
are there lectures that you
remember particularly vividly?

00:06:27.726 --> 00:06:30.357
Salman: (chuckles) I
talk a lot in the book,

00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:34.037
my own experience in
undergrad, I talk about,

00:06:34.037 --> 00:06:35.873
I was a bit of a chronic class skipper.

00:06:35.873 --> 00:06:38.239
sometimes out of laziness,

00:06:38.239 --> 00:06:40.037
but for the most part it
was just out of finding

00:06:40.037 --> 00:06:41.351
the most productive use of my time.

00:06:41.351 --> 00:06:43.617
I discovered there was this whole world,

00:06:43.617 --> 00:06:44.458
this was at MIT,

00:06:44.458 --> 00:06:46.100
of people who never went to class

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.537
and would use that time to
do problem solving instead.

00:06:51.537 --> 00:06:53.944
For the most part, the
ones that were memorable

00:06:53.944 --> 00:06:55.879
were the ones where there
was a shared experience.

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:58.698
There were some great orators,

00:06:58.698 --> 00:07:01.027
some great lecturers that were inspiring,

00:07:01.027 --> 00:07:03.864
but it was good for moments.

00:07:03.864 --> 00:07:05.779
It wasn't great when you were trying

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:06.879
to dig deep into something,

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:08.128
when you might be a little bit lost

00:07:08.128 --> 00:07:09.989
and you want to catch up but
the class is going at a pace,

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:11.006
you might be a little bit bored,

00:07:11.006 --> 00:07:13.085
you might know the material already.

00:07:13.085 --> 00:07:16.758
I think the shared experience of a lecture

00:07:16.758 --> 00:07:18.137
is great for inspirational things.

00:07:18.137 --> 00:07:20.671
It's great for things
that aren't super deep

00:07:20.671 --> 00:07:24.008
in terms of the substantive nature.

00:07:24.008 --> 00:07:25.864
I think those type of things can happen

00:07:25.864 --> 00:07:27.261
on-demand at your own pace,

00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:29.258
then class time is all
about problem solving.

00:07:29.258 --> 00:07:31.759
Neal: We're talking with Salman Khan,

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:32.918
founder of the Khan Academy,

00:07:32.918 --> 00:07:36.260
a non-profit that creates
online educational videos.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.167
He's the author of

00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:39.920
"The One World Schoolhouse:
Education Reimagined."

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.171
We want to hear today from you

00:07:41.171 --> 00:07:44.493
about the college lecture
you vividly remember,

00:07:44.493 --> 00:07:49.097
800-989-8255, email talk@npr.org.

00:07:49.097 --> 00:07:51.117
Benjamin's on the line
with us from Fort Wayne.

00:07:51.117 --> 00:07:52.201
Benjamin: Hi there.

00:07:52.201 --> 00:07:53.242
Neal: Hi.

00:07:53.242 --> 00:07:56.010
Benjamin: What I remember
out of all the lectures

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.924
that I've had in college
is from my sociology class.

00:07:59.924 --> 00:08:03.176
Robert Pettit, he's a
great sociology teacher,

00:08:03.176 --> 00:08:07.922
he was using visuals
along with his speech,

00:08:07.922 --> 00:08:10.252
and he was teaching us about
socially constructed realities.

00:08:10.252 --> 00:08:15.828
Basically, he was petting an
invisible cat on his desk.

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.295
Neal: (laughs)

00:08:17.295 --> 00:08:21.051
Benjamin: With saying, if we all believe

00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:25.119
there was a cat here, then
therefore it does exist.

00:08:25.119 --> 00:08:26.879
It was really interesting.

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:33.789
I've found that incorporating
visuals with speaking

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:38.142
made it easier to remember,
more likely to remember.

00:08:38.142 --> 00:08:40.501
Neal: Clearly you remember that one.

00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:41.872
How long ago was that?

00:08:41.872 --> 00:08:44.283
Benjamin: That was, I
would say, 2 years ago.

00:08:44.283 --> 00:08:46.373
Neal: That's not all that long ago.

00:08:46.373 --> 00:08:48.118
Benjamin: No, not at all.

00:08:48.118 --> 00:08:49.868
Neal: All right, thanks very
much for the phone call.

00:08:49.868 --> 00:08:50.236
Appreciate it.

00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:50.620
Benjamin: Thank you.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:55.030
Neal: So even some simple
devices, acting out

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.527
and some visuals, Salman
Khan, can help somewhat.

00:08:58.527 --> 00:09:02.347
Salman: It sounds like that
was a great instructor,

00:09:02.347 --> 00:09:03.120
a great lecturer.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.732
What I would say is that actually

00:09:05.732 --> 00:09:07.614
he should share those skills,

00:09:07.614 --> 00:09:09.594
and it sounds like he was
humorous and all the rest,

00:09:09.594 --> 00:09:11.996
that instructor should make videos,

00:09:11.996 --> 00:09:12.745
put them online.

00:09:12.745 --> 00:09:14.026
His students could access them.

00:09:14.026 --> 00:09:15.119
Then when they go class,

00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:16.850
they can actually have
that debate about whether,

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.372
if everyone believes the cat is there,

00:09:18.372 --> 00:09:19.528
whether it really is there.

00:09:19.528 --> 00:09:21.494
Neal: Let's see if we go to James.

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:24.904
James is with us from
Montrose in Colorado.

00:09:24.904 --> 00:09:25.774
James: Hi Neal.

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:26.630
Neal: Hi.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.643
James: I just wanted to share
really my most memorable

00:09:30.643 --> 00:09:32.558
and this little instance
was the only memory

00:09:32.558 --> 00:09:34.113
that I have of the entire
semester in this class.

00:09:34.113 --> 00:09:35.852
Neal: (chuckles)

00:09:35.852 --> 00:09:39.005
James: Physical geography,
where my professor

00:09:39.005 --> 00:09:43.982
was teaching for the first
time in America from China.

00:09:43.982 --> 00:09:46.374
Nobody could understand a word she said

00:09:46.374 --> 00:09:49.481
until she made one comment
about how she recently

00:09:49.481 --> 00:09:53.554
arrived in American and a
friend called her from China

00:09:53.554 --> 00:09:56.397
and she's trying to describe
the Earth's rotation

00:09:56.397 --> 00:09:58.978
around the sun and how days
and nights are different

00:09:58.978 --> 00:10:00.507
on different sides of the planet,

00:10:00.507 --> 00:10:02.748
and her friend says,
"Hi, how are you doing?"

00:10:02.748 --> 00:10:05.256
She said, "Well, how in the
hell do you think I'm doing?

00:10:05.256 --> 00:10:06.846
"It's 3 in the morning, I'm sleeping."

00:10:06.846 --> 00:10:10.634
That was the only bit
that me and probably 175

00:10:10.634 --> 00:10:14.068
other students caught
for 3-1/2 plus months.

00:10:14.068 --> 00:10:15.144
Neal: (laughs)

00:10:15.144 --> 00:10:17.031
Neal: How'd you do on the course?

00:10:17.031 --> 00:10:22.053
James: That was about 12-1/2 years ago.

00:10:22.053 --> 00:10:23.569
I want to say I did pretty well.

00:10:23.569 --> 00:10:25.858
I enjoyed the class, but honestly,

00:10:25.858 --> 00:10:27.246
I can't remember a lick of it.

00:10:27.246 --> 00:10:29.644
Neal: I guess, Salman Khan,

00:10:29.644 --> 00:10:30.997
thanks very much for the call, James,

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:32.650
that makes your point.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.998
Salman: Yeah, that's exactly.

00:10:34.998 --> 00:10:37.495
Most of us can't remember
actually the courses we took,

00:10:37.495 --> 00:10:39.003
and I'm not that far out of college,

00:10:39.003 --> 00:10:41.845
much less the actual
content of a lot of it.

00:10:41.845 --> 00:10:45.316
Even when you were there,
running up to the final exam,

00:10:45.316 --> 00:10:47.737
this is why there are so
many students cramming,

00:10:47.737 --> 00:10:49.819
is that they've learned very little.

00:10:49.819 --> 00:10:50.996
They've gone through the motions.

00:10:50.996 --> 00:10:52.228
They feel like they're paying tuition.

00:10:52.228 --> 00:10:55.396
It's part of the, I guess the
ceremony of going to college,

00:10:55.396 --> 00:10:57.122
of showing up at these lectures

00:10:57.122 --> 00:10:58.817
because that seems to be
what everyone else is doing.

00:10:58.817 --> 00:11:00.814
But I've actually found that the students

00:11:00.814 --> 00:11:02.067
that are most productive are the ones

00:11:02.067 --> 00:11:04.123
that use that time to
go do something else.

00:11:04.123 --> 00:11:06.403
Neal: Email from Alan in Augusta, Georgia.

00:11:06.403 --> 00:11:08.496
"Of thousands of lectures I've enjoyed,

00:11:08.496 --> 00:11:10.396
"the best is no doubt Jack Pettigrew's

00:11:10.396 --> 00:11:12.403
"'Love is a Plastic State.'

00:11:12.403 --> 00:11:14.248
"I heard this as a student at his

00:11:14.248 --> 00:11:17.001
"neurophysiology class in Caltech in 1975,

00:11:17.001 --> 00:11:18.751
"but he delivered it elsewhere as well.

00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:21.416
"The point was to discuss
neuronal plasticity,

00:11:21.416 --> 00:11:22.853
"how our brains change,

00:11:22.853 --> 00:11:24.378
"and he illustrated it
with numerous anecdotes

00:11:24.378 --> 00:11:26.004
"including how his brother-in-law

00:11:26.004 --> 00:11:29.002
"lost his fear of a
deadly snake while high.

00:11:29.002 --> 00:11:31.239
"Jack really illuminated the subject,

00:11:31.239 --> 00:11:34.004
"the impact of evolution on brain states."

00:11:34.004 --> 00:11:36.985
We're talking with Salman
Khan about lectures

00:11:36.985 --> 00:11:38.500
and re-imagining them.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.565
You're listening to Talk of
the Nation from NPR News.

00:11:42.565 --> 00:11:44.404
Let's go next to Richard.

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:46.260
Richard is with us from
Sioux City in Iowa.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.403
Richard: Hi, hello everybody.

00:11:47.403 --> 00:11:48.401
Nice program.

00:11:48.401 --> 00:11:48.983
Neal: Thank you.

00:11:48.983 --> 00:11:50.249
Richard: Thanks for having me on.

00:11:50.249 --> 00:11:52.998
I teach mindfulness and I
was in a mindfulness course

00:11:52.998 --> 00:11:55.499
at University of Missouri
quite a few years ago,

00:11:55.499 --> 00:11:56.872
a graduate-level course.

00:11:56.872 --> 00:11:59.735
The first lecture about mindfulness was,

00:11:59.735 --> 00:12:02.748
actually started with eating
a raisin and where we,

00:12:02.748 --> 00:12:04.814
the raisins were passed out.

00:12:04.814 --> 00:12:07.122
The idea is we're going
to focus our attention

00:12:07.122 --> 00:12:09.999
on all of the sensuous
aspects of the raisin

00:12:09.999 --> 00:12:11.239
before we even taste it,

00:12:11.239 --> 00:12:12.897
before we put it in our mouth.

00:12:12.897 --> 00:12:15.149
Mindfulness, as you may
know, is, of course,

00:12:15.149 --> 00:12:21.513
the entire process of controlling
your attentional awareness.

00:12:21.513 --> 00:12:25.042
The intent of mindfulness
is that we train our minds

00:12:25.042 --> 00:12:29.132
so that they don't drift away
or drift forward or drift back,

00:12:29.132 --> 00:12:32.747
and we do have more
disciplined thinking processes.

00:12:32.747 --> 00:12:35.379
Neal: Did it worked after 18
minutes or so with the raisin?

00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:36.589
Richard: (laughs) Yeah.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.016
I'd say with that course it really did

00:12:38.016 --> 00:12:39.259
because it was an 8-week course

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:42.130
and it absolutely helps to discipline,

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.435
again, your attentional awareness.

00:12:44.435 --> 00:12:46.380
Where is your attention
at this very moment?

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.647
Is it where it should be or not?

00:12:48.647 --> 00:12:52.016
As a person who now prepares and teaches

00:12:52.016 --> 00:12:53.598
those programs for a couple of schools,

00:12:53.598 --> 00:12:55.873
I can tell you it does work.

00:12:55.873 --> 00:12:57.924
It may be something that
would be of interest

00:12:57.924 --> 00:13:00.257
or that your guests may already be,

00:13:00.257 --> 00:13:02.004
of which they may already be aware.

00:13:02.004 --> 00:13:04.470
Neal: Salman Khan, are
you aware of mindfulness?

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.509
Salman: I think that example,

00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:09.008
the reason why it was so memorable

00:13:09.008 --> 00:13:11.735
is because the students
were doing something.

00:13:11.735 --> 00:13:13.508
They were observing the raisin.

00:13:13.508 --> 00:13:14.669
They were given an activity to do.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:16.508
They weren't just being lectured at.

00:13:16.508 --> 00:13:19.052
What I'm saying is that
lecture's invaluable.

00:13:19.052 --> 00:13:20.507
People have given some examples of some

00:13:20.507 --> 00:13:21.919
very memorable lectures they had.

00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:24.123
It's just that is that the best use

00:13:24.123 --> 00:13:25.503
of when humans get together?

00:13:25.503 --> 00:13:26.634
A lot of these very entertaining,

00:13:26.634 --> 00:13:28.029
very inspiring lectures ...

00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:31.171
I'm coming here as someone who's made

00:13:31.171 --> 00:13:32.755
3,000 lectures on YouTube.

00:13:32.755 --> 00:13:35.181
I'm not saying that they're not valuable,

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:38.258
I'm just saying that they
could maybe be best used

00:13:38.258 --> 00:13:40.981
when you're not in the classroom.

00:13:40.981 --> 00:13:42.676
In the classroom, you
should do things like that,

00:13:42.676 --> 00:13:43.876
expose people to new experiences,

00:13:43.876 --> 00:13:45.000
make them think about it,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.258
have a two-way conversation.

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:48.474
Richard: I agree because
in teaching mindfulness,

00:13:48.474 --> 00:13:51.481
I do have a didactic and
then an experiential portion.

00:13:51.481 --> 00:13:54.927
During the didactic portions
I do try to limit it

00:13:54.927 --> 00:13:57.591
to 12 minutes or so
because I know what happens

00:13:57.591 --> 00:13:59.113
and people don't pay attention.

00:13:59.113 --> 00:14:00.341
Neal: Interesting.

00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:01.349
Thanks very much for the call, Richard.

00:14:01.349 --> 00:14:02.049
Richard: Thank you.

00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:08.014
Neal: That amount of
time, is that time span,

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:11.006
that ability to focus for 10-18 minutes,

00:14:11.006 --> 00:14:15.199
does that cover other aspects
of interaction as well?

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:17.504
Salman: You know, I haven't
seen studies on that,

00:14:17.504 --> 00:14:19.998
but I would believe that
that's probably the case.

00:14:19.998 --> 00:14:23.130
Even in our organization,
we're not-for-profit,

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.110
but there's 36 people who work with me,

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.202
we kind of eat our own dog food.

00:14:27.202 --> 00:14:28.880
We say, look, if we ever have a meeting,

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.882
no one should be talking
for more than 3 minutes.

00:14:30.882 --> 00:14:32.195
If you're talking for more than 3 minutes,

00:14:32.195 --> 00:14:33.486
it's a lecture, make a video,

00:14:33.486 --> 00:14:34.993
Neal: (laughs)

00:14:34.993 --> 00:14:37.625
and people can ask you
questions when we get together.

00:14:37.625 --> 00:14:40.258
Neal: So you have to do that as well.

00:14:40.258 --> 00:14:43.627
Then the space of these
interactive meetings,

00:14:43.627 --> 00:14:46.759
presumably people could
concentrate a little longer.

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:51.386
Salman: We've all had
hours-long conversations

00:14:51.386 --> 00:14:52.504
and enjoyed ourselves.

00:14:52.504 --> 00:14:53.977
That's actually where we learned a lot.

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:55.028
A lot of what we learn from is from

00:14:55.028 --> 00:14:56.646
conversations with other people

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:59.828
That, obviously, can go on well beyond

00:14:59.828 --> 00:15:01.165
10 minutes or even an hour

00:15:01.165 --> 00:15:02.910
because you are actively engaged,

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.214
your brain is actively processing

00:15:04.214 --> 00:15:05.761
and thinking of new things.

00:15:05.761 --> 00:15:07.383
Neal: Let's see, we
get one more caller in.

00:15:07.383 --> 00:15:08.673
This is Jennifer.

00:15:08.673 --> 00:15:10.587
Jennifer's on the line
with us from Orange County.

00:15:10.587 --> 00:15:11.625
Jennifer: Hello.

00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:12.500
Neal: Hi Jennifer.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.011
Jennifer. Hi.

00:15:14.011 --> 00:15:17.301
I had a Disability and Society class,

00:15:17.301 --> 00:15:19.800
actually it was a psychology class,

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.308
in undergrad and I really
remember very little

00:15:22.308 --> 00:15:24.005
from undergraduate school.

00:15:24.005 --> 00:15:28.668
There was a guest speaker
who had cerebral palsy.

00:15:28.668 --> 00:15:33.501
It was my first experience
really hearing from a person

00:15:33.501 --> 00:15:35.366
who had cerebral palsy.

00:15:35.366 --> 00:15:39.370
Before that, I had no
idea that their brains

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:40.938
functioned exactly the same way

00:15:40.938 --> 00:15:42.885
that a normal person's functions,

00:15:42.885 --> 00:15:44.774
it was just their muscles and their bodies

00:15:44.774 --> 00:15:45.885
didn't work the same

00:15:45.885 --> 00:15:47.599
and they weren't able to
communicate the same way.

00:15:47.599 --> 00:15:49.769
Being in that room,

00:15:49.769 --> 00:15:52.633
there was probably over
200 people in that lecture,

00:15:52.633 --> 00:15:57.024
but the professor did such an amazing job

00:15:57.024 --> 00:16:00.635
of bringing people in
and engaging the class

00:16:00.635 --> 00:16:05.126
and changing perspectives.

00:16:05.126 --> 00:16:08.867
Another thing that she did is she had us,

00:16:08.867 --> 00:16:11.703
in the midst of our lecture,

00:16:11.703 --> 00:16:15.553
walk around campus and picture
ourselves in a wheelchair,

00:16:15.553 --> 00:16:17.350
and then come back to the room

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.245
and talk about what that
might have been like

00:16:19.245 --> 00:16:20.486
if we actually were in a wheelchair

00:16:20.486 --> 00:16:21.885
and how we would have gotten around.

00:16:21.885 --> 00:16:22.950
Neal: So experiencing something,

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.382
as well as just being lectured to.

00:16:25.382 --> 00:16:26.879
Jennifer, thanks very much for your time.

00:16:26.879 --> 00:16:28.178
Jennifer: Thank you.

00:16:28.178 --> 00:16:29.497
Neal: One last email.

00:16:29.497 --> 00:16:30.894
This from Janice in Scottsdale.

00:16:30.894 --> 00:16:33.262
"A professor of philosophy
at Eisenhower College

00:16:33.262 --> 00:16:34.360

"He went up to the podium

00:16:41.788 --> 00:16:43.616
"and stood there in
complete and utter silence,

00:16:43.616 --> 00:16:45.594
"looking at us for 50 minutes."

00:16:45.594 --> 00:16:48.999
Salman Khan, thanks very much
for your time today, too.

00:16:48.999 --> 00:16:49.649
Salman: Thanks for having me.

00:16:49.649 --> 00:16:53.500
Neal: It's the Talk of
the Nation from NPR News.
