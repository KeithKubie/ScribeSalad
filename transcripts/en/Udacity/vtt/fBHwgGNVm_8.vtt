00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.350
So finally, to make things as meta as possible, meta reasoning has actually been

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.360
a motivating pedagogical goal for the design of this very course. You'll notice

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.460
that for almost every lesson, we start with an example of a problem that you

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.720
could solve. In incremental concept learning, for example, we start by giving

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.780
you several examples of foos and not foos. And then we asked you is this a foo?

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.470
In production systems, we gave you some information about a baseball game and

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.650
asked you to decide what the pitcher should do next. In learning by recording

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.890
cases, we gave you a world of rectangles and asked you to decide what color

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.660
a new rectangle might be. In classification, we gave you a bunch of pictures and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.660
asked you to decide which of those pictures were birds. In planning,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.200
we gave you our blocks micro-world and

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.980
asked you to develop a plan to go from our initial state to our goal state.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.330
In each of these, we've started with the problem that we could solve,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.860
that we then wanted to design an agent to solve.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.570
These examples then motivated our discussion not necessarily of how we did it,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.980
but how we could design an agent to do it. Then at the end of each lesson,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.160
we revisited that example. We took the reasoning method that we designed for

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.480
our agent and looked at how that exact reasoning method would allow it to

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.489
answer the same example with which we started the lesson. When you

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.590
did the example at the start of the lesson, you didn't necessarily know how you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.740
were able to solve that problem. You could speculate, but you never know for

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.290
sure. But then by building an agent that can solve that problem, we start to

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.720
gain some understanding for the processes that we must be able to engage in,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.260
in order to solve that problem as well. So by designing the agent,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.830
we develop a greater understanding of our own cognition. So in this way,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.270
the very design of the lessons in this course has been driven by trying to

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.010
develop metacognition in you. In fact, developing metacognition in

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.870
students is the entire goal of my own PhD dissertation.
