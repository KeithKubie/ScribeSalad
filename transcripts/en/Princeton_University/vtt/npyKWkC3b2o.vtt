We're here at the Princeton Pre-rade, where we welcome the incoming freshman class of

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.880 position:97%
Jim Valcourt:
2014 for the first time. Could you describe the tradition that's going on here, the Pre-rade? What's this all about?

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.250 position:97%
Will Manning:
Well, the tradition of the Pre-rade is about welcoming the incoming freshmen, because when

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.200 position:97%
Will Manning:
they walk in the gate, it's like they are walking into the student body.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.200
[crowd noise, cheers, drums]

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.350 position:73%

So, what is the FitzRandolph Gate superstition?

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.989 position:97%

The superstition is that once you come through the middle of the gate, until you graduate,

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.379 position:98%
Maraiya Hakeem:
do not go back through the middle of the gate or you will not graduate.

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.100
Jim Valcourt:
And do you believe that?

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.199 position:98%
Maraiya Hakeem:
I don't know if I believe it, but I have not walked through the middle of the gate just

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:43.920
Maraiya Hakeem:
in case it actually is true.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.370 position:86%
Jim Valcourt:
What would it take to get you to walk through the gate?

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.649 position:97%
Maraiya Hakeem:
Absolutely nothing. I was going to say $5 million, but even at that I think I need the

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.230 position:83%
Maraiya Hakeem:
Princeton degree even more than $5 million right now.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.859 position:92%
Will Manning:
In like a million, billion years, it would not be worth it.

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.100 position:97%

you have from your time at Princeton?

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.110

At least 30.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.000 position:67%

I probably have at least 20 or so piled up.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.460

I've got at least 10 or 11 at home.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.160 position:98%
Jim Valcourt:
So, if you had to use all of your T-shirts for some creative use, like if you took them

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.430 position:88%
Jim Valcourt:
to a desert island, what would you do with the T-shirts?

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.790 position:98%
Demetrius Lewis:
I could probably make a tent out of them, since I have so many.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.710 position:98%
Jim Valcourt:
And you could live off those, not have to do laundry for a while?

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.000 position:98%
Demetrius Lewis:
Exactly, no laundry needed when you have free T-shirts coming at you.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.770

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.630 position:58%
Stacey Menjivar:
paths. I don't wait for them to move.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.560 position:83%

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.350 position:70%
David Drew:
I saw one on its hind legs that marked on me.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.940

Do you have any words of advice for the freshmen class?

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.730 position:97%

I would say to go to many shows, talk to many people and try things out. If you don't like

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.770 position:97%
Maraiya Hakeem:
it, move on to something else. Just make sure you actually go out to events and see what

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.360
Maraiya Hakeem:
the community has to offer.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.670 position:75%
Jarett Schwartz:
Advice in three words? Explore, study and study!

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.790

Don't freaking procrastinate!!

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.350 position:98%
