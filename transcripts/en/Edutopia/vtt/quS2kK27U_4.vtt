00:00:02.106 --> 00:00:03.546
&gt;&gt;Daniel Goleman: It
may surprise you to know

00:00:03.546 --> 00:00:05.226
that attention is like a muscle.

00:00:05.226 --> 00:00:10.136
Like a muscle in the arm, and that
there are exercises, mental exercises

00:00:10.136 --> 00:00:13.706
that can improve attention that
strengthen the brain circuitry

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:17.116
for attention just like you'd go
to the gym and you'd do some reps

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:19.776
on a CYBEX machine and
get a stronger tricep.

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:23.446
These exercises are very
simple, but very effective.

00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:26.286
The social emotional
learning curricula have many

00:00:26.286 --> 00:00:30.126
that are developmentally appropriate
so that you teach the same lesson

00:00:30.126 --> 00:00:33.846
in different ways as children's
cognitive abilities expand

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:36.066
with brain growth and as
they go through the grades.

00:00:36.576 --> 00:00:39.716
One of the most effective is
something called "The Stoplight."

00:00:39.876 --> 00:00:41.876
It's a poster on the
wall of a classroom.

00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:46.596
It says, "When you're upset, remember
the stoplight, red light, stop,

00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:51.386
calm down, think before you act,
yellow light, think of a range

00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:54.936
of different things you could do
now and what the outcome would be.

00:00:55.476 --> 00:00:57.146
Green light, pick the best one.

00:00:57.146 --> 00:00:57.816
You can try it.

00:00:58.006 --> 00:00:59.246
It's a highly effective method.
