been working with different proteins to
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.880
been working with different proteins to
see how they behave like compared to

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890
see how they behave like compared to
 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.109

an art you know a lot of people have a
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.370
an art you know a lot of people have a
misconception about science then if you

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
misconception about science then if you
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.230
misconception about science then if you
memorize a lot of facts and you organize

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
memorize a lot of facts and you organize
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.330
memorize a lot of facts and you organize
them together well that you'll be a good

scientist right that's how high schools

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
scientist right that's how high schools
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.569
scientist right that's how high schools
teach science it's our schools tend to

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
teach science it's our schools tend to
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.760

very much a creative process where you

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
very much a creative process where you
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.139
very much a creative process where you
imagine how things are moving you make a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149

I first met him he told me what his lab
 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.040
I first met him he told me what his lab
was about and he did it with a drawing

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050
was about and he did it with a drawing
 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.750
was about and he did it with a drawing
and it's like a you don't really expect
