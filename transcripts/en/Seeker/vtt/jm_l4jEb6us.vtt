00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.530
Playing Candy Crush will make you kill a man.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.530
Truth?

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.890
Or an incredibly over-sensationalised cold
open to a story about videogames and violence?

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:16.880
Hey guys, Joe Bereta here guest hosting for
DNews.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.100
The world of science hath graced us with yet
another study concerning the correlation betwixt

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.450
violence in videogames and violence in real
life, but stick with me button mashers, because

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.660
this isn't your garden variety violent content
does or doesn't beget evil in your impressionable

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.219
young child type of story.

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.180
Now, first off, lets all agree that aggression
is a very common byproduct of playing video

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.180
games.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.180
It doesn't happen all the time, but it can
rear its ugly, hostile head occasionally.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.180
Like...

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.230
I swear to all the gods that if I get blue-shelled
again because I'm in first place in Mario

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.020
Kart Wii, I'm gonna murder everything.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.340
The game punishes you for being awesome and
encourages mediocrity.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.380
It doesn't make sense.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.110
Moving on, research coming out of Oxford University
postulates that it isn't graphic, bloody headshots,

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.290
spinal-cord snaps, or gruesome koopa-troopa
curb stomps that generate aggresive/violent

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.420
behavior in players.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.799
The root of the evil actually lies in the
failure and frustration that a human experiences

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:09.799
when gaming.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.679
So, instead of focusing just on the content
and storylines of games, these guys also monitored

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:19.520
the psychological side of, basically, trying
to complete a task... which is trying to beat

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.849
the game, or finish the level, or get that
god-forsaken flappy bird past the fourth pipe.

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:29.429
It's basic human nature to want to succeed
and be great at things, and when you're losing,

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:35.509
over and over again, it makes sense that emotions
might go all Dante's peak.

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.179
It doesn't matter if you're trying to finish
a dude off by ripping him in half in Mortal

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.079
Kombat or clear a screen in Minesweeper, if
you suck...it sucks.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.999
Co-author of the study, Richard Ryan, explains,
"When people feel they have no control over

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.119
the outcome of a game, that leads to aggression.

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.539
We saw that in our experiments.

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.929
If you press someone's competencies, they'll
become more aggressive, and our effects held

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.119
up whether the games were violent or not."

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.289
So, these Oxfordians rounded-up 600 college-aged
humans and scienced them with video game experiments.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.819
Utilizing violent and non-violent games, the
researchers manipulated variables, like difficulty

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.810
settings and in one particular exercise, participants
were asked to submerge their hands in super

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.709
cold water, like painfully cold.

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.170
Unbeknownst to them, everyone did it for the
same amount of time.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.750
They then played a round of Tetris, afterwhich,
they were to assign an amount of time for

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.750
the next guy or gal to keep their hands submerged.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.560
Now, get this sadistic little tid-bit: Players
who experienced the more difficult version

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.610
of Russian Block Stacking assigned, on average,
10 seconds more chilly hand-bath time to the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.610
next player.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.610
Crazy.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.030
So videogames probably won't send you on a
murder rampage, but they might turn you into

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.530
a momentary butthole.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.030
One time, I threw my best friends Snake Eyes
GI Joe at the wall, causing bits of molded

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.920
plastic to explode everywhere, spewing forth
a plume of imagination and nostalgia.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.390
It's not cause I'm a bad person, it's because
I was playing Battletoads.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.510
Richard Ryan also said, "When the experience
involves threats to our ego, it can cause

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.469
us to be hostile and mean to others."

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:01.060
And really, doesn't this apply to all facets
of our lives?

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.680
No one wants to look stupid or feel inadequate.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.590
Those feelings can lead to insecurity, or
embarrassment, or pure, unadulterated wrath.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.879
That's why we have real life, rage-quitting
instances of full-grown adults throwing second

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.020
base into center-field and flying monopoly
boards on family game night... and the one

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.560
time I saw my own mother try to bite through
the cord of an NES controller because Super

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.870
Mario Brothers brought her to a dark dark
place.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.930
Guys, what's your most frustrating video game
moment?

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.219
Describe it with vivid detail down below.

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.239
