1
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.590
Where do you want me at? Where you want us to sit? That's good.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.680
Testing one, two, this the headphones. You got them Jad, I'm Robert. How's that?

3
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:13.410
Better. Oh, much better. Radiolab. Can I interrupt? Yes,

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.950
but could I say something first me first because I let you go.

5
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:20.130
It's going to be another 20 minutes. Do I get to talk a little while back?

6
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:21.600
I had a rather little, little, little, little,

7
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:24.240
little boisterous conversation with these two guys. First of all,

8
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:28.020
like who are you? I'm Larry. You Bell. Yeah, and I'm Alvin. New Bell.

9
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.600
So you are related in, you're both in the plumbing business.

10
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.340
Are we elite related? Yes,

11
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:36.060
we are related but we are in the home inspection business. Yeah,

12
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.070
their father and son. It's a family business.

13
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:42.090
We are the principles of accurate building inspectors of Brooklyn,

14
00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:44.850
New York and I've been in the construction industry ever since.

15
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:49.590
I'm about 16 years old. I am 84 okay. I'm not giving my age.

16
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.660
I wanted to talk to them because as building inspectors they,

17
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.350
there's something they see over and over and over. Yeah, all the time.

18
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.910
That is actually a clue

19
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.520
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

20
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.140
<v 0>in what turns out to be a deep, deep mystery</v>

21
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.680
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

22
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.970
<v 0>which, which is what exactly. Well, uh,</v>

23
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.820
let us say you have a yard in front of your house.

24
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.100
Yours is the back of your house but doesn't make it in front. Okay.

25
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.450
And right in the middle of the yard is a tree and the tree happens to be weeping

26
00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:23.350
willow just for example, and not too far away from this tree underground,

27
00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:24.660
there is a water pipe,

28
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:28.420
a perfectly good pipe connecting your house to the main city water line that's

29
00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:29.254
in the middle of the street.

30
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.160
[inaudible] the roots of this tree of course can go any way they want to go.

31
00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:34.930
They can go north, south, east, west, whatever.

32
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.520
But the you bells have noticed that even if a tree is 10 or 20,

33
00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:41.500
30 yards away from the water pipe,

34
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.830
for some reason the tree roots creep with uncanny regularity straight toward the

35
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:53.580
water pipe. The tree will wrap its roots around Bagpipe, around at, around,

36
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.850
around in a tangling of Spaghetti, like almost.

37
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.450
And each one of those lines of spaghetti is squeezing a little bit.

38
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:05.370
Loo each one. Announce, announce, announce, announce, announce enough.

39
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.720
Eventually over a period of time it'll crack the pipe.

40
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.540
Like a nutcracker. Yes. You both see this happening all the time. Yeah.

41
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.680
I have done inspections where roots were coming up through the pipe,

42
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.100
into the house, into the house. It's amazing. Yes. This, this, this,

43
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.941
this actually happened to me.

44
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:26.000
The Magnolia tree outside of our house got into the sewer pipes,

45
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.110
reached its tentacles into our house and clustered the sewage pipe.

46
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.080
He just happens to a lot of people. It's almost as if these plants,

47
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.970
it's almost as if they know,

48
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.750
<v 1>okay,</v>

49
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.920
<v 0>where our pipes are.</v>

50
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.940
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

51
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.810
<v 0>I see what's happening. What are you bringing? The plant parade again?</v>

52
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.990
Is that what, is that what this is? Of course I am. Because doing the like,

53
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:46.261
okay.

54
00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:49.500
First it was the roots under the ground and all connected into a whole hive.

55
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.860
I don't know why now problems with this knows cause it's like,

56
00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:55.350
it's like every time I close my eyes you're coming at it from a different

57
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:57.560
direction. I do. I do. The plant parade.

58
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.010
I met a plant biologist who's to lead that parade.

59
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.030
<v 2>She's done three experiments and I think if I tell you about what she has done,</v>

60
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:05.050
you even,

61
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:09.730
you will be provoked into thinking that plants can do stuff you didn't imagine

62
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.300
dream they could do. I know, I know you. I know,

63
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.280
but let me just, let me give it a try. So let's go to the first.

64
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:23.170
This is the plant and pipe mystery. Hello. Hello. Hello.

65
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.760
You might think that the plant sends out roots in every direction.

66
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:30.430
One of the roots just happens to bump into a water pipe and says,

67
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.460
sends a signal to all the others. Come over here. Here's the water. Right.

68
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.000
But that scientist I mentioned, my name is Monica Yanno.

69
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:40.360
I'm a research associate professor at the University of Sydney.

70
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:44.880
She took that notion out of the garden into her laboratory. Yeah,

71
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.260
tested it in my lab. She took some plants,

72
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:51.190
put them in a pot that restricted the route so they could only go in one of just

73
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.910
two directions toward the water pipe or away from the water pipe.

74
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.020
What kind of pot is this?

75
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.160
It's kind of shaped like the letter y but upside down so that you get the rich

76
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:03.310
can go to the left or the to the right. Oh, now the plants,

77
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:07.450
if they were truly dumb, they'd go 50 50 would be all random. Right?

78
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.620
But after five days,

79
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:13.621
she found that 80% of the time the plants went or maybe chose to head toward the

80
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.720
dry pipe that has water in it.

81
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:20.760
So the question is I planted is quite far away from the actual pipe.

82
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.390
How does he know which way to turn and grow its roots so that it can find it?

83
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.010
<v 0>All right? My hypothesis is, is that what happens is, can I, can I,</v>

84
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.310
can I have a few minutes? You've got somewhere to go. You got somewhere to go.

85
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.090
No good. If she's going to do this experiment,

86
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.150
most likely she's going to use cold water.

87
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.980
She's not going to use hot water because you don't want to cook your plants,

88
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.180
you know? And it's more expensive. Why wastes hot water? Well, by the way, true.

89
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.180
We established fact in your mouth. You want to compete. He had,

90
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.160
he's in the right track.

91
00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.310
You have to understand that the cold water pipe causes even a small amount of

92
00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:06.840
water to condense on the pipe itself. On the outside,

93
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.920
it's kind of like a cold glass sitting on your desk and there's always a puddle

94
00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:13.590
at the bottom. The glass is not broken, it's not a leak.

95
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.740
Your water is still in there. So there is some water

96
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.020
<v 2>side of the pipe. It's condensation, right?</v>

97
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.760
So what they're saying is even if you totally sealed the pipe so there's no leak

98
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.653
at all,

99
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.950
the difference in temperature will create some condensation on the outside and

100
00:05:27.951 --> 00:05:31.670
it's that little, little bit of moisture that the plant was somehow since

101
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.970
<v 0>if you look at a route under a microscope,</v>

102
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.630
what you see is all these thousands of feelers,

103
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:41.650
like hairs on your head looking for water, every one of them,

104
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.960
and all of a sudden one of them like, oh, I found a little water,

105
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.370
and then all the other one goes into the same direction. These sensitive hears,

106
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:52.860
he argues would probably be able to feel that tiny difference. Yes.

107
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.190
<v 2>Monica says, no, absolutely not. I purposely removed</v>

108
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.860
<v 0>the chance for most degrading.</v>

109
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.940
<v 2>She made sure that the dirt didn't get wet because she'd actually fashioned the</v>

110
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:08.840
water pipe to the outside of the pot. So it wasn't touching the dirt at all.

111
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.733
<v 0>Wait, so the,</v>

112
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.980
this branching pot thing [inaudible] the part where the water pipe was the,

113
00:06:13.981 --> 00:06:16.880
the pipe was on the outside of the pot right outside.

114
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.650
And the plants still went to the place where the pipe was not even in the dark.

115
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.010
Yeah. Had a strange no,

116
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.940
or even just the vibration of the pipe that's making it go toward it.

117
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.993
No, you got it.

118
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.760
<v 2>Maybe there's some kind of signal,</v>

119
00:06:32.761 --> 00:06:34.770
different kinds of signal traveling through the soil.

120
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.720
Monica thought about that and designed a different experiment. Again,

121
00:06:39.721 --> 00:06:43.490
if you imagine that the pot, my Hispanic mental with the fork box. Yeah.

122
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.910
But then have two very different options for our plant on one side.

123
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.810
Instead of the pipe with water, she attaches an MP,

124
00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:56.280
three player with a little speaker playing a recording of the sound of water.

125
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.590
And then on the other side, Monica has a mother MP3 player with a speaker.

126
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.450
But this one plays

127
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.963
<v 0>nothing.</v>

128
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.340
<v 2>So she's got her plants in the pot and we're going to now wait to see what</v>

129
00:07:12.341 --> 00:07:12.761
happens.

130
00:07:12.761 --> 00:07:17.140
Remember that the roots of these plants can either go one direction towards the

131
00:07:17.141 --> 00:07:22.110
sound of water in a pipe or the other direction to the sound of silence.

132
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.440
On the fifth day they take a look and discover most of the routes and majority

133
00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:30.530
of the roots were hitting toward the sound of water.

134
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.070
<v 4>Exactly. Exactly.</v>

135
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:40.140
<v 0>So they just went right for the MP3 fake water. Not even the actual water.</v>

136
00:07:40.141 --> 00:07:43.440
Just the sound of it. Just the sound that that's, that's interesting.

137
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.620
That's interesting. That is interesting. But what, how would it be

138
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:48.993
<v 2>plant?</v>

139
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.120
Heres something like they don't have ears or a brain or anything like they

140
00:07:54.371 --> 00:07:55.840
couldn't hear like we hear,

141
00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.800
<v 0>well maybe they definitely don't have a brain, no question there,</v>

142
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.240
but they do have root hairs. This is Jennifer Frazier.

143
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.440
I am the blogger of the artful Amoeba at scientific American and she was willing

144
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:13.340
to entertain the possibility that plants can do something like here.

145
00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:18.341
So what do we have in our ears that we use to hear a sound little hairs.

146
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:22.910
Yes. Right. And if you go to too many rock concerts,

147
00:08:22.911 --> 00:08:26.480
you can break these hairs and that leads to permanent hearing loss,

148
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:31.400
which is bad. Uh, so maybe the root hairs,

149
00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:35.480
which are always found right at the growing tips of plant roots.

150
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.410
Maybe plant roots are like little ears.

151
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.190
Maybe each route is, is like a little ear for the plant. I don't know.

152
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.050
That is cool. That is definitely cool. Okay. Good thing I don't get is, is um,

153
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.840
in animals, the hairs in our ear, uh,

154
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.140
are sending the signals to a brain and that is what chooses what to do.

155
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:59.160
That's true. If a plant doesn't have a brain, what is choosing where to go?

156
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:03.090
And I don't think Monica knows the answer to that, but she does believe that,

157
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.320
you know, that we humans,

158
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.720
<v 5>we are a little obsessed with the brain.</v>

159
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.560
And so we are under the impression,

160
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:16.990
oh I would say the conviction that the brain is the center of the universe and

161
00:09:17.381 --> 00:09:20.170
a, and if you have a brain in a nervous system,

162
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.340
you a good and you can do amazing stuff.

163
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:28.570
And if you don't have one by default and you can do much in general,

164
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:34.350
it's a very biased view that humans have in particular two words,

165
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.473
others.

166
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.141
<v 0>But still,</v>

167
00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:41.060
I mean to say that a plant is choosing a direction,

168
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.410
I don't know. I mean it's like when a plant bends towards sunlight, we all,

169
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.970
we've all seen house plants. Right? Right.

170
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.560
Would you say that the plant is seeing the sun? No. I mean it's just, it's,

171
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.620
it's reacting to things and there's a series of mechanical behaviors inside the

172
00:09:56.751 --> 00:09:58.670
plant that are just bending it in the direction. I mean,

173
00:09:58.671 --> 00:10:01.100
couldn't it just be like that? That's fair.

174
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.580
And I think if I move on to the next experiment from Monica,

175
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.060
you are going to find it a little bit harder to object to it.

176
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.470
We need to take a break first,

177
00:10:09.471 --> 00:10:12.380
but when we come back the parade that I want you to join,

178
00:10:12.381 --> 00:10:17.000
we'll come and swoop you up and carry you along in a flow of enthusiasm.

179
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:19.403
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

180
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.370
<v 7>Hi, this is Ashley Harding from Saint John's Newfoundland. Canada.</v>

181
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.500
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation enhancing public

182
00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:34.380
understanding of science and technology in the modern world.

184
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.420
<v 8>Hey, Simon Adler here. Uh,</v>

185
00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.660
I'm one of the producers here at Radiolab and I wanted to take a quick second to

186
00:10:46.661 --> 00:10:49.730
tell you about something that, uh, that I think is pretty interesting that,

187
00:10:49.731 --> 00:10:54.460
that we make here, uh, besides the show. So we have a newsletter,

188
00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.490
which I know everyone does, but hear me out.

189
00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.520
Unlike a lot of other newsletters out there, uh,

190
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:05.290
we don't waste your time by just blabbing about what our next release will be or

191
00:11:05.291 --> 00:11:09.800
begging you for money. Uh, actually we, we do a little bit of that. Uh,

192
00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:14.380
but what we also do is each time a new episode drops,

193
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.500
we send you a list of staff picks,

194
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.580
essentially a collection of things to folks here who make this show have come

195
00:11:21.581 --> 00:11:24.250
across recently and are excited about, uh,

196
00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.810
they range from books and music to TV shows, youtube clips, art exhibits,

197
00:11:28.811 --> 00:11:33.160
blogs. It's sort of a repository for the stuff that's got us interested.

198
00:11:33.161 --> 00:11:37.810
But for whatever reason, uh, we're not sure how to turn into a radio story.

199
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.670
So if that sounds interesting to you at all, I hope you'll sign up for it.

200
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:47.320
Our newsletter, it's free and you can sign up in about just 30 seconds at radio

201
00:11:47.321 --> 00:11:52.321
lab.org/newsletter or even easier just text our l is

202
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:59.190
<v 2>as in radio lab news two seven zero one zero one that's RL news to seven zero</v>

203
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:03.940
one zero one. And thanks

204
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.910
<v 0>a year into Donald Trump's presidency.</v>

205
00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.480
We still don't have answers to basic questions about how this family business

206
00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:16.160
works, like who or their business partners is the business benefiting from his

207
00:12:16.161 --> 00:12:20.120
administration? Is Trump acting on behalf of the country or his company?

208
00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:25.160
Trump inc is a podcast from w NYC studios and propublica where we dig deep and

209
00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:28.280
ask questions about president Trump's family business.

210
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.130
We're looking for answers and you can help subscribe.

211
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.600
<v 2>You can Trump the bank wherever you get your podcasts.</v>

212
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.790
<v 0>Three, two, one Jad Robert Radiolab. Yep.</v>

213
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:45.820
So today we have a triptych of experiments about plants that apparently a jury's

214
00:12:46.731 --> 00:12:50.800
still out are going to make me rethink my stance on plants. Yeah. Uh,

215
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.490
so we're up to experiment too now.

216
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:53.640
<v 2>That is correct.</v>

217
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.640
So we are going to meet a beautiful little plant called a [inaudible],

218
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.570
which is a perfectly symmetrical plant with with leaves on either side of a

219
00:13:03.571 --> 00:13:04.240
central stem.

220
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.850
<v 0>Yeah. I mean mosaic has been one of the pet plans,</v>

221
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:09.340
I guess for many scientists for like centuries

222
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.470
<v 2>because this peculiar plant has a, has a surprising little skill.</v>

223
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.430
Yeah. It reflects and anti Predator reaction,

224
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.500
like a defensive mechanism.

225
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:25.570
As soon as it senses that a grazing animal is nearby. If a nosy do,

226
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.730
you're happy to bump into it. The mimosa plant folds, its leaves,

227
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.860
corrals, all its leaves up against it. Stem,

228
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.730
<v 0>the whole thing immediately closes up and makes it look like, oh,</v>

229
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.200
there's no plan here. Just a boring set of twigs.

230
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.120
Nothing delicious at all.

231
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.810
<v 2>So the idea of like, oh well, never mind. Right.</v>

232
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:52.360
And you can actually see this happen. So, okay. So we can get,

233
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.690
anybody can get one of these plants and we did this one here.

234
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.240
And if you just touch it, can I try it? Yeah, go for it.

235
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.160
Even just one leaf at that, you can actually watch this cascade.

236
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.050
Whoa. We're all the leaves closing like de Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo, Doo Doo.

237
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.540
Declare your man, look at that. They all went closed. Yeah.

238
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.720
Sort of startling to see. That's so UTI.

239
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.430
So that voice belongs to attish backyard. Who uh,

240
00:14:18.431 --> 00:14:21.730
is with Princeton University's Council on science and technology.

241
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.870
We showed one of these plans to him and a couple of his colleagues, Sharon,

242
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:30.850
dela Cruz, this guy or this Guy Peter Landgren. Yeah, there you go. That's neat.

243
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.650
Cause we wanted them to help us recreate Monica's next experiment.

244
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:39.760
So maybe could you, could you just describe it just briefly, just what you did?

245
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:44.910
<v 0>Well, um, I uh, created these, um, horrible, uh,</v>

246
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.350
contraption. Apparently she built some sort of apparatus. Um,

247
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.430
I guess you could call it a Mimosa

248
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.540
<v 2>plant, Dropbox picture, one of those parachute drops that they have at the,</v>

249
00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.320
at state fairs or amusement parks where you're hoisted up to the top,

250
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.230
except in this case, instead of a chair, they've got a little,

251
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:07.520
a plant size box into which she put these sensitive plants.

252
00:15:07.521 --> 00:15:11.510
So the plants are now buckled in, minding their own business. And then

253
00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.370
Monica Woo dropped him just about, you know, seven or eight inches

254
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.630
<v 5>landing very comfortably onto a,</v>

255
00:15:19.631 --> 00:15:21.980
a padded base made of foam.

256
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.070
So no plans with actually hurt in this experiment.

257
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:30.580
<v 2>The drop was just shocking and sudden enough for the little plan to close all</v>

258
00:15:30.581 --> 00:15:33.340
its sleeves do, which reflects defense thing.

259
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.420
Then Monica hits the plant back up again and drops it again.

260
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:38.580
<v 9>Huh?</v>

261
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:39.413
<v 2>And again,</v>

262
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:40.840
<v 9>Oh</v>

263
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.673
<v 2>and again.</v>

264
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:43.000
<v 9>Ooh.</v>

265
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.190
<v 2>And after none, a whole nother drops,</v>

266
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:47.463
<v 9>Woo</v>

267
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.140
<v 2>plant, she noticed, stopped closing its leaves.</v>

268
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.550
<v 5>So after the first few,</v>

269
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.790
the plants already realized that that was not necessary.

270
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.470
<v 2>The plants, the plants stopped. What is it they did? They stopped.</v>

271
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:06.910
They stopped folding up.

272
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:11.080
She thinks that they somehow remembered all those drops and it never hurts.

273
00:16:11.081 --> 00:16:13.870
So they didn't fold up anymore. They'd learned something. Exactly.

274
00:16:13.871 --> 00:16:14.920
Which is pretty amazing.

275
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.820
Couldn't it just be an entirely different interpretation here quick? What?

276
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.060
The plants have to keep pulling their leaves up and they just get tired.

277
00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.660
They run out of energy. It might run out of fuel. Exactly.

278
00:16:25.661 --> 00:16:27.520
It's a costly process for this plant.

279
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.660
But figured out they weren't tired because after dropping them 60 times,

280
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.190
she then shook them left to right and they instantly fold it up again.

281
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.850
It would close up. Oh, so it's not that it couldn't fold up,

282
00:16:39.851 --> 00:16:44.350
it's just a during the dropping it learned that it didn't need to. Yeah,

283
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.560
that's a learning is something I didn't think plants could do. They do.

284
00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:57.390
Oh whoa. High Tech. So we figured, look,

285
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.800
if it's this easy and this, matter of fact,

286
00:16:59.801 --> 00:17:04.300
we should be able to do this ourselves and see it for ourselves. So, oh my God,

287
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.840
that's where the scientists from Princeton come in. Peter, Sharron and optician,

288
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.820
they designed from scratch.

289
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:15.440
So this is a towering parachute drop in blue translucent lego pieces and this is

290
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.020
our plant chopper and we can move it up and we can drop it.

291
00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.180
So we strapped in our Mimosa plant,

292
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.970
little seatbelt farm for the ride down and then all right.

293
00:17:24.971 --> 00:17:29.500
And then someone has to count. Okay. And then we let it drop. Five,

294
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.060
four, three, two, one drops,

295
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.820
five, four, three.

296
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.380
And we dropped it once and twice again. And again.

297
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:46.270
We were waiting for the fleas stopped folding. We dropped, we dropped.

298
00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:52.230
But I don't know, it didn't happen. Oh,

299
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.090
it was curling up each time when every time it just kept curling and curling

300
00:17:57.091 --> 00:17:59.460
didn't seem to be learning anything. So you,

301
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.070
so you couldn't replicate what you saw that happened at all.

302
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:06.390
So we went back to Monaco. Yeah. We, as you know, built your elevator.

303
00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:07.650
<v 5>I heard</v>

304
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.400
<v 2>you told her what we did and what happened to you didn't happen to us now can</v>

305
00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:14.430
you, can you imagine what we did wrong?

306
00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.090
<v 5>Like, for example, my plants were already in environment controlled rooms,</v>

307
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:20.430
which is not a minor details.

308
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.330
Then the NOI experiencing extra changes for example,

309
00:18:24.331 --> 00:18:27.370
I don't know if that was the case for your plans. Um,

310
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.470
<v 2>I kept switching rooms cause we weren't sure whether you want it to be in the</v>

311
00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:34.950
highlight or weak light or some light or no light.

312
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.000
<v 5>I wonder if there was maybe a bit too much. It was a possible</v>

313
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:45.530
then maybe the plants correctly responded by not opening because something

314
00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:49.310
really mad was happening around it and is like a,

315
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.000
this place is not safe.

316
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.970
<v 2>The truth is I think on this point she's got a, she's right</v>

317
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.850
one time the plant literally flew out of the pot and appended with roots.

318
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.520
Exposes like one of those experiments where you just are boarded on

319
00:19:02.521 --> 00:19:03.990
humanitarian. Yeah.

320
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.440
I think what she would argue is that we kind of proved her point.

321
00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:09.150
We were so inconsistent,

322
00:19:09.151 --> 00:19:13.500
so clumsy that the plants were smart to keep playing it safe and closing

323
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:14.220
themselves up.

324
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.350
<v 5>So I told you, I seen you aware,</v>

325
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.590
very successful your experiment you found exactly. Well the plants will do.

326
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.510
And the your circumstances, which were, I don't know, let's say I'd be more,

327
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.600
um, tumultuous than mine

328
00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.830
<v 2>and she goes on to argue that had we been a little bit more steady and a little</v>

329
00:19:30.831 --> 00:19:31.820
bit more consistent,

330
00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.800
the plants would have learned and would have remembered the lesson because what

331
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:39.410
she does next is three days later she takes these plants back into the lab.

332
00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:43.460
<v 5>The idea was to drop them again just to see like, uh, um,</v>

333
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.640
the difference between the first time you learned something and the next time,

334
00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.080
<v 2>but they figure it out faster this time or maybe slower. Yeah.</v>

335
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.470
So she takes the plants, she puts them into the parachute drop,

336
00:19:53.471 --> 00:19:58.180
she drops them and she says this time they relaxed almost immediately.

337
00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.130
Yeah. They'd remember straight away, straight away.

338
00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.880
All of them know already what to do.

339
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.870
They remembered what had happened three days before the dropping didn't hurt

340
00:20:07.871 --> 00:20:10.360
that they didn't have to fold up. So they didn't. Yeah.

341
00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.770
And then she waited a few more days and came back. They still remembered. Yeah.

342
00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.090
A few more days.

343
00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.800
<v 5>Yeah. And it was almost like a,</v>

344
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.600
let's see how much I have to stretch it here before you forget.

345
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.750
<v 2>Eventually she came back after 28 days. 28 days?</v>

346
00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.710
Yes. And they still remember, they still did not close when she dropped him.

347
00:20:30.711 --> 00:20:34.580
That's what she says. What was your reaction when you saw this happen?

348
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:39.050
That's producer Andy Mcewen. Yes. For retention of, of knowledge.

349
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.590
<v 5>My reaction was like, oh shit.</v>

350
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.490
That was my reaction because I'm,

351
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.250
the only reason why this specimen turned out to be 28 days

352
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.290
<v 2>is because I run out of time.</v>

353
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.840
So they might remember even for much longer time than 28 days.

354
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.360
So she's saying they remembered for almost a month.

355
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.420
Can you remember what you were doing even this morning?

356
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.520
That's sort of like poof. Gone. That's a thing. But supposedly that she's right.

357
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.300
Yeah. Where would the have a little plan even store a memory was,

358
00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:14.200
that's what I asked her. Um, I do want to go back though too

359
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:17.560
for for something like learning,

360
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.510
like I don't understand learning as far as I understand it is something that

361
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:27.070
involves memory and storage, but I do that in my brain.

362
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.750
That's the place where I can remember things in my brain to you. Yes.

363
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:36.740
It was. I think is your dog chucked into my analysis

364
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.070
<v 10>because so bigs</v>

365
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.310
because so enough of the peaks.

366
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.770
It's okay. It's okay. Puppy. It's okay.

367
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.930
<v 2>I think I saw enough of that now. Sorry. Actually,</v>

368
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.860
Monica's dog leads perfectly into her third experiment,

369
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:10.240
which again will be with a plant, but it was originally done with, with a dog.

370
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:15.290
<v 11>So half love started by getting some dogs and some meat and a belt.</v>

371
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.580
[inaudible] Jen Frazier gave us the kind of the standard story and his idea was

372
00:22:20.581 --> 00:22:25.581
to see if he could condition these dogs to associate that food would be coming

373
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:28.680
from the sound of a bell.

374
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.940
So he brought them some meat and then eat the meat.

375
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.450
Then he would bring them the meat and he would ring a bell and again,

376
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.480
drooling eating and he would repeat this

377
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.500
<v 12>ring meat, eat, ring meat, eat,</v>

378
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:43.940
ring meat.

379
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.140
<v 11>Finally, one time he did not bring the meat, but he rang the bell.</v>

380
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.870
Sure enough, the dogs began to drill.

381
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.910
They had learned to associate the sound of the bell, you know,

382
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:59.190
for dogs has nothing to do with me with when they actually saw and smelled and

383
00:22:59.191 --> 00:23:00.024
ate meat.

384
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.050
<v 2>Exactly. No, that's a very, you know, animals do this experiment,</v>

385
00:23:04.051 --> 00:23:07.110
but it got Monica thinking, would the plan to the same,

386
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.840
could a plant learn to associate something totally random,

387
00:23:09.841 --> 00:23:13.590
like a bell was something it wanted like food. Yeah.

388
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.620
Are you like aggressively looking around for like,

389
00:23:16.621 --> 00:23:20.310
do you wake up in the morning say now what can I get a plant to do that reminds

390
00:23:20.311 --> 00:23:24.840
me of my dog or reminds me of a bear or reminds me of a bee? No, really.

391
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:30.450
And I guess there's food. I feel, I feel this as a kind of good to say this.

392
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:32.430
It's like, no, no, I don't. I don't do that.

393
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.990
But Monica says what she does do is move around the world with a general feeling

394
00:23:36.991 --> 00:23:37.460
of,

395
00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.620
<v 11>Huh, what if</v>

396
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:41.933
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

397
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.980
<v 2>so she decided to conduct her experiment. Pretty much the concept</v>

398
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.310
<v 5>of Pavlov with this dog applied, but instead of dogs,</v>

399
00:23:49.311 --> 00:23:54.210
she had pea plants in a dark room and for the meat substitutes she gave each one

400
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:58.980
<v 2>plant a little bit of food. In this case, a little blue led light</v>

401
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.910
<v 5>light is obviously representing dinner. So light is if you,</v>

402
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.460
if you shine the light in a plant you're like feeding it. Yeah,

403
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.170
it plants really light light, you know, they need light to grow.

404
00:24:08.171 --> 00:24:12.710
So otherwise they come for the synthesize. So for three days, three times a day,

405
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:17.910
<v 2>Chinese little blue lights on the plants from a particular direction and she</v>

406
00:24:17.911 --> 00:24:21.900
noticed that unsurprisingly the plants would always grow towards the light.

407
00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.510
Anyone who's ever had a plant in a window knows that.

408
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.200
And the salivation equivalent was the tilt of the

409
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.430
<v 5>plan. Exactly. And then I needed to,</v>

410
00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.690
the difficulty I guess of the experiment was to find something that will be

411
00:24:33.691 --> 00:24:38.691
quite irrelevant and really meant nothing to the plant to start with.

412
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.800
Like the bail for the dog.

413
00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.270
<v 2>So after much trial and error with clicks and hums and buzzes</v>

414
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.340
<v 5>all sorts of a randomness,</v>

415
00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.620
she found that the one stimulus that would be [inaudible]

416
00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.540
<v 2>perfect was a fan,</v>

417
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:57.280
<v 5>a little fan. The same one that I used in computers, like you know, really tiny.</v>

418
00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:00.890
<v 2>She determined that you can pick a little computer fan in for Blowgun on the</v>

419
00:25:00.891 --> 00:25:04.640
people in for pretty much ever and the pea plant would be utterly indifferent to

420
00:25:04.641 --> 00:25:06.200
the whole thing. The plants didn't care.

421
00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:09.140
Then she placed the fan right next to the light so that

422
00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.520
<v 5>the light and the fan were always coming from the same direction.</v>

423
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:14.980
<v 2>And with these two stimulates, she put the plans,</v>

424
00:25:14.981 --> 00:25:19.500
a little pea plans through a kind of training regime. Little Fan goes on,

425
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.000
light goes on,

426
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
both aiming at the people from the same direction and the leans toward them.

427
00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.640
Then she takes a little light and the little fan and moves them to the other

428
00:25:29.641 --> 00:25:31.140
side of the plant. Turns the fan on,

429
00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.380
turns the light on and the plan turns that way.

430
00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.320
<v 5>Yeah, find first light after end,</v>

431
00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.290
moved around but always matched in the same way together.

432
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:45.410
<v 2>Fan Light, lean fan light fan light, lean,</v>

433
00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.150
same as the problem, the bell, the meat and the salivation.

434
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:52.580
<v 5>So then at one point when you only play the bale for the dog or you, you know,</v>

435
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.230
play the fan for the plant.

436
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.770
We know now for the dogs the dogs is expecting.

437
00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:02.270
So it's predicting something to arrive in Monaco wandered in the plant's case.

438
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.280
If there was only the fan,

439
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:08.750
would the plant anticipate the light and lean toward it or would just be going

440
00:26:08.751 --> 00:26:11.510
random after three days of this training regime,

441
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:15.660
<v 2>it is now time to test the plans with just the fan. No light.</v>

442
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.680
So Monica moves the fans to a new place. One more time. Yeah, switched on.

443
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.060
And The p plans,

444
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:27.060
I left alone to sit in this quiet dark room feeling the breeze.

445
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:36.420
<v 5>And then the next day I remember going in on at the uni on a Sunday afternoon</v>

446
00:26:36.421 --> 00:26:36.590
and she

447
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.860
<v 2>goes into that darkened room with all the people ads. So you know,</v>

448
00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.040
I mean the dark, but she's got a little red headlamp on. Yeah.

449
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:46.980
And she moves about the room to have a look hearing down at the plants under the

450
00:26:46.981 --> 00:26:48.390
red glow of her headlamp

451
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:50.480
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

452
00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:55.480
<v 2>and then I saw that these little plants by little piece had indeed turned and</v>

453
00:26:57.621 --> 00:27:01.610
moved toward the fan stretching up their little leaves as if they were sure that

454
00:27:01.611 --> 00:27:04.730
at any moment now light would arrive

455
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:08.650
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

456
00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:10.090
<v 5>and it's good. It was Sunday.</v>

457
00:27:10.091 --> 00:27:12.940
And I remember it was Sunday because I started screaming. He might have said,

458
00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.380
oh, I might disturb my plants.

459
00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:18.070
I go out and I thought there is no one here on Sunday afternoon.

460
00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:22.090
I can scream my head off if I want to. And so I was really excited. I was like,

461
00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.280
oh my God, these guys are actually doing it.

462
00:27:24.281 --> 00:27:26.260
And so of course that was only the beginning.

463
00:27:26.261 --> 00:27:30.460
Then we actually had to run four months of trials to make sure that,

464
00:27:30.461 --> 00:27:34.150
you know that what we were seeing was no one p do an hour or two piece,

465
00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.770
but it was actually a majority.

466
00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:39.520
<v 2>So you just did what Pavlov did do a plant.</v>

467
00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.900
You got a plant to associate the fan with food.

468
00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.510
<v 5>Yeah, pretty much.</v>

469
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:48.673
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

470
00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.560
<v 2>But once again,</v>

471
00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:56.650
I kind of wondered if since the plant doesn't have a brain or even neurons to

472
00:27:56.811 --> 00:28:01.310
connect the idea of light and wind or whatever [inaudible] where would they put

473
00:28:01.311 --> 00:28:05.120
that information? Like how can a plant, how does the plant do that?

474
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.013
I don't know.

475
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.110
<v 5>I don't know yet.</v>

476
00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.560
But what I do know is that the fact that the plant doesn't have a brain,

477
00:28:11.561 --> 00:28:14.850
doesn't s doesn't, a priori says that she,

478
00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.840
the plants can do something.

479
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.320
The fact that humans do it in a particular way,

480
00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.490
it doesn't mean that everyone needs to do it in that way to be able to do it in

481
00:28:24.491 --> 00:28:28.300
the first place. There are multiple ways of doing one thing, right?

482
00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:30.270
Huh.

483
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:34.410
<v 2>So we're really like, this is, we're really at the very beginning of this.</v>

484
00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:39.100
<v 5>Yeah, I know this. That's why there is often more questions than answers,</v>

485
00:28:39.101 --> 00:28:41.200
but that's part of the fun as well.

486
00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:46.220
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

487
00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.670
<v 2>Monica, his work has actually gotten quite a bit of attention from other plant</v>

488
00:28:49.671 --> 00:28:52.210
biologists. Yes. And some of them, this is Lincoln.

489
00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.720
I'm a professor emeritus of plant biology at UC Santa Cruz.

490
00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:01.360
Say they're very curious, but want to see these experiments repeated.

491
00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:05.860
It's very interesting experiment and I really want to see whether it's correct

492
00:29:05.861 --> 00:29:10.420
or not. We'd have to, he's got lots of questions about her research methods,

493
00:29:10.421 --> 00:29:15.400
but really his major complaint is, is her language, her use of metaphor, right?

494
00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.570
For example, words like hearing or learning behavior. And this,

495
00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.760
he's not a huge fan of. Yes. If you, uh,

496
00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.720
get too wrapped up in your poetic metaphor,

497
00:29:25.721 --> 00:29:30.721
you're very likely to be misled and to over interpret the data.

498
00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:35.380
I mean, it's a kind of romanticism, I think, you know,

499
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:40.600
it goes back to anthropomorphizing plant behaviors.

500
00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.040
I wonder

501
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.040
<v 11>if her using these metaphors and producer Annie McEwen is perhaps a very</v>

502
00:29:47.801 --> 00:29:52.000
creative way of looking at looking at a plant and therefore leads her to make

503
00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:53.080
makeup,

504
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.320
these experiments that those who wouldn't think the way she would would ever

505
00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:59.650
make up and therefore she might in the end see something that no one else would

506
00:29:59.651 --> 00:30:02.940
see. Is it, can it be letting in the light? Yeah.

507
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.730
Kind of even like could there be a brain or could there be ears or you know,

508
00:30:06.731 --> 00:30:10.330
just sort of like going off the deep end there but maybe it makes her sort of

509
00:30:10.331 --> 00:30:13.960
more open minded than, than, than someone is just looking at a notebook.

510
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.900
<v 2>Um, I think you can be open minded but still objective. Um,</v>

511
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.450
I mean I, I think there's something to that.

512
00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:27.451
I think there are some cases where romanticizing something could possibly lead

513
00:30:29.051 --> 00:30:31.660
you to some interesting results.

514
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:36.580
So you're like a a metaphor cop with a melty heart. Yes.

515
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:38.430
<v 0>Is that,</v>

516
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:42.300
that would be an interesting [inaudible] they have to edit this together.

517
00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.260
Yeah. How much longer? Cause I have an appointment. All right. That's it.

518
00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:46.700
I think

519
00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.490
<v 2>I will. I have one thing, just a curiosity.</v>

520
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.220
As we were winding up with our home inspectors, Alvin and Larry, you bell,

521
00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.630
we thought maybe we should run this metaphor idea by them. There's,

522
00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.510
on the science side,

523
00:30:56.511 --> 00:31:00.260
there's a real suspicion of anything that's anthropomorphizing in a plant.

524
00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:05.290
They just don't like to hear words like mind or hear or see or taste for a plan

525
00:31:06.411 --> 00:31:08.090
because it's too animal and too human.

526
00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.900
And the classic case of this is if you go back a few centuries ago,

527
00:31:11.901 --> 00:31:14.880
someone noticed that plants have sex. Oh yes.

528
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:18.710
That there was a kind of a moral objection to thinking of this way and I'm

529
00:31:18.711 --> 00:31:22.130
wondering whether Monica is going to run into,

530
00:31:22.131 --> 00:31:24.890
as she tries to make plants more animal,

531
00:31:24.891 --> 00:31:29.670
like whether she's just going to run into this malice from the scientific

532
00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.840
extent. I'm just wanting, you have this, you share any of that?

533
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.880
<v 0>No, I don't. Because she may come up against it.</v>

534
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:40.860
People who think that intelligence is unique to humans and so I don't have a

535
00:31:40.861 --> 00:31:41.550
problem with that.

536
00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.160
I've been looking around lately and I know that intelligence is not unique to

537
00:31:44.161 --> 00:31:45.660
humans. Okay.

538
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.650
So I don't have an issue with that and every day that goes by and I have less of

539
00:31:49.651 --> 00:31:53.130
an issue from the day before so I don't have a problem.

540
00:31:53.131 --> 00:31:57.300
The problem is is with plants, so they may have this intelligent,

541
00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:01.650
maybe we are just not smart enough yet to figure it out. Well, okay.

542
00:32:01.651 --> 00:32:03.190
That's a parade. Oh, I'll show up for,

543
00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.870
<v 2>okay, let's do it.</v>

544
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:17.820
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

545
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.840
<v 2>big thanks to Ashish Bhatia to Sharon dela Cruz and to Peter Lander going to</v>

546
00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:25.170
Princeton University's Council on science and technology. Also,

547
00:32:25.171 --> 00:32:28.830
thanks to Kristi Melville and to Emerald O'Brian and to Andrews O'Hara and to

548
00:32:28.831 --> 00:32:31.200
summer rain. You thinking summer rain?

549
00:32:31.201 --> 00:32:36.180
I have did the plant's sneak that one in the summer is a real person and her

550
00:32:36.181 --> 00:32:40.190
last name happens to be spelled a y. E. L. I. Z.

551
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.360
This story was nurtured and fed and ultimately produced by Annie McKeown's.

552
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:48.230
You actually trained this story in a rather elaborate experimental setup to move

553
00:32:48.231 --> 00:32:52.440
away from the light until the late breeze against [inaudible] thinks.

554
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:53.960
Oh, one more thing.

555
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.270
Thanks to Jennifer Frazier who helped us make sense of all this.

556
00:32:56.271 --> 00:32:59.360
You should definitely go out and check out her blog, the artful Amoeba,

557
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:04.010
especially to the post the four Lauren ones about plants. Plants

558
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:08.060
<v 11>are really underrated. When I write a blog post,</v>

559
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.620
my posts that get the least traffic, your anted are the plant posts,

560
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.330
no matter how amazing.

561
00:33:14.331 --> 00:33:19.310
I think that the results are for some reason people just don't think plants are

562
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:22.010
interesting. And to me,

563
00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.130
here are three more reasons that you can say no. Really,

564
00:33:25.131 --> 00:33:29.810
plants are amazing and this world is amazing and that living creatures have this

565
00:33:29.811 --> 00:33:34.760
ability for reasons we don't understand, can't comprehend yet.

566
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:37.370
That's amazing and fantastic.

567
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.700
And does it change my place in the world?

568
00:33:40.701 --> 00:33:45.701
Does it threaten my sense of myself or my place as a human that a plant can do

569
00:33:46.491 --> 00:33:47.540
this? No.

570
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.860
Does it threaten your sense of humanity that you depend for pretty much every

571
00:33:51.861 --> 00:33:55.040
single calorie you eat on a plant? No.

572
00:33:55.041 --> 00:33:59.470
So you think that that this, you think this is a Hubris corrector? Yeah,

573
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:03.860
I mean what? So they can't move. Well, some of them can.

574
00:34:03.861 --> 00:34:07.100
First of all and big deal, can you make your own food? No.
