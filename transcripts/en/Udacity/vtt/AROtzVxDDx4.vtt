00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Narrator] So, what I would like you to do next is to modify our algorithm

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to take the lists of particles and importance weights

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to sample N times with replacement and new particles

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
with a sampling probability proportional to the importance weights,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
or in the code now that we calculated our new particles

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and the corresponding importance weights, construct a new particle set P3,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which we will call P, again, when everything is said and done,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
so that the particles in P3 are drawn from P according to the importance weights W.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now to warn you this is more difficult than it looks like.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm going to show you a trick in a second, so if you fail to do this don't worry.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I give you a chance to do it right now, but then I'm going to tell you

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a little bit more about how to organize this

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
in an efficient way and you get a second chance.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So, try it out, see if you can do it, and if you fail

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.048
look for my advice and then try it again.
