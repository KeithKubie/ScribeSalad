00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.890
The answer is if we're writing in the functional style,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.580
the instanceof operator won't work.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.385
In this case, fido is a simple object that was created with an object literal,

00:00:09.385 --> 00:00:12.582
So it just delegates to object.prototype.

00:00:12.582 --> 00:00:16.830
Dog.prototype can't be found anywhere in fido's prototype chain.
