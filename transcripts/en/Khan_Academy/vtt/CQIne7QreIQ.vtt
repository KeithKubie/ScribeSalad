00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:02.666
- So there're a few questions
that have already been

00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.749
sent in, that I wanted to touch upon,

00:00:07.044 --> 00:00:10.859
and one of 'em is how
often should I practice?

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:11.692
And...

00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:16.007
It kinda depends on how
soon you're taking the test,

00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.019
it depends on what your schedule is,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.436
what your score goals are, how many times

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.345
you've taken the test, but, really,

00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:29.488
it makes sense, the more you
do it, the better you get,

00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:33.155
and if you make that
commitment to yourself,

00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:38.585
to improving the score, your
scores will keep on rising,

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:40.201
and on the Official SAT Practice

00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:43.385
you basically have what you need

00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:46.241
to be working with real practice questions

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:48.531
created by the College
Board, and by Khan Academy

00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:51.114
with College Board's help, and,

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.087
three a times a week for
30 to 60 minutes each

00:00:57.087 --> 00:00:59.855
would be a good amount to study.

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:02.597
If you're taking the test next month,

00:01:02.597 --> 00:01:06.118
you might wanna do an hour
to three hours a week.

00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:07.985
If you're waiting until
March to take the test,

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:10.261
waiting until May to take the test,

00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:12.029
that changes the equation.

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:15.197
The best thing you can do
is to take a full-length

00:01:15.197 --> 00:01:17.780
practice test, and see where you stand,

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.936
and let the system tell
you what level you're at.

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:22.291
There's level two, there's level three,

00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:24.774
there's level four, if
you start at level two,

00:01:24.774 --> 00:01:26.259
you do all the level two questions,

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:27.567
you look at what you've done wrong,

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:30.365
you learn from the solution steps,

00:01:30.365 --> 00:01:34.943
and you'll find your way to
level three, and to level four,

00:01:34.943 --> 00:01:38.610
and you'll gain points,
and it makes it fun,

00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:41.165
so, let me see.

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:44.828
A very important thing is
to remember that the test

00:01:44.828 --> 00:01:46.411
is four hours long.

00:01:47.534 --> 00:01:50.399
That's if you take the essay,
and it's regular timing

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.575
on the test, is about four hours long,

00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:57.158
and, if you just walk
in there on test day,

00:01:58.013 --> 00:02:01.694
and you've never done
a four-hour-long test,

00:02:01.694 --> 00:02:05.302
it's gonna come as a rude awakening, and,

00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:08.802
so I urge you, if you are taking the test,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.633
in October, let's say, to
take one to two full-length

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:17.248
practice tests on Saturday morning,

00:02:17.248 --> 00:02:19.709
just like test day,
and see what it's like,

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.840
see what it's like to write
this essay after three hours

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.723
of multiple-choice testing.

00:02:26.723 --> 00:02:27.556
It's intense.

00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:31.723
Another question that's come
up is, what's a good score?

00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:35.738
And I think that it's important
for everybody to realize

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:39.002
that your SAT score's
just one very small part

00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:40.943
of your college application.

00:02:40.943 --> 00:02:43.639
Colleges are interested in your grades,

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.746
colleges are interested in recommendations

00:02:45.746 --> 00:02:48.032
from your teachers,
colleges are interested

00:02:48.032 --> 00:02:50.927
in the extracurriculars, the
way that you spend your time,

00:02:50.927 --> 00:02:55.787
job experience, internships,
any leadership positions

00:02:55.787 --> 00:02:59.396
that you might've done, any
kind of, what makes you tick,

00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:01.806
what are your interests,
what are your passions?

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:05.512
So your grades are more
important than your SAT score.

00:03:05.512 --> 00:03:09.144
Your recommendations are important.

00:03:09.144 --> 00:03:13.430
And, so, just remember
that that's critical,

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.013
and the SAT is an
important element to show

00:03:17.983 --> 00:03:22.287
your college admissions
officers, just how ready you are.

00:03:22.287 --> 00:03:24.850
Just where you fit in
the range of students

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.652
who have applied to this school before.

00:03:27.652 --> 00:03:31.819
So, depending on the colleges
that are on your list,

00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:36.234
you will have a different range of scores

00:03:36.234 --> 00:03:39.484
that you can discover, by which I mean,

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:44.809
there's a 25th percentile,
and there's a 75th percentile

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:49.160
of scores of students
that have been accepted

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.022
into any college, and you
can find that information

00:03:53.022 --> 00:03:56.772
on BigFuture.org, you
can look up the school,

00:03:59.034 --> 00:04:02.795
you can use college guides,
and it's a statistic

00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:05.712
that every college makes available,

00:04:07.017 --> 00:04:11.184
and that's 25% of the
students applied with a score

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.086
who were offered admission
with a score below

00:04:15.086 --> 00:04:19.253
the 25th percentile range,
and 75% of the students

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:26.389
had scores that were, so somebody scored,

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.111
if you're in the 75th percentile,

00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:32.278
that is better than 75% of
the people who applied, so,

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:34.795
and who get offered admission,

00:04:34.795 --> 00:04:37.004
so, what you do is you
create a range, you say,

00:04:37.004 --> 00:04:39.205
you look at all the 25th percentile scores

00:04:39.205 --> 00:04:41.039
for the colleges in your list,

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.836
you look at the 75th percentile scores

00:04:42.836 --> 00:04:44.926
for the colleges in your list,

00:04:44.926 --> 00:04:47.394
and you use that as an indicator

00:04:47.394 --> 00:04:50.101
for what you think you should do,

00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:54.268
and what your target should
be for your SAT score,

00:04:55.932 --> 00:04:59.966
and, I recommend that if
you make a reach goal,

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.662
to reach for that 75th percentile,

00:05:02.662 --> 00:05:07.615
then, your SAT score will
definitely check the boxes

00:05:07.615 --> 00:05:11.699
for that college, and you don't need to,

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.822
and you can probably move
on to another critical part

00:05:14.822 --> 00:05:18.286
of your admissions profile,
which would be your grades,

00:05:18.286 --> 00:05:20.416
you really want to have
really solid grades

00:05:20.416 --> 00:05:25.135
in junior year, sophomore
year, and on senior year,

00:05:25.135 --> 00:05:27.960
or, other elements, like,
pursue your passions,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.450
get leadership positions, if you can,

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.134
or participate, make a
contribution to your school,

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:38.510
is an important element of
your college admissions too.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.648
Another question that has come up

00:05:39.648 --> 00:05:42.560
is, what do we need to bring on test day?

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.133
And, you can find that information
on Official SAT Practice,

00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:50.884
you can also find it on
the College Board website,

00:05:50.884 --> 00:05:53.920
I think College Board, or Khan Academy,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.663
the team who's watching right now,

00:05:55.663 --> 00:05:59.313
hopefully will be posting
where those links are,

00:05:59.313 --> 00:06:02.774
but you can just go find out
that information right there.

00:06:02.774 --> 00:06:05.562
Honestly, there's so much
information available

00:06:05.562 --> 00:06:09.062
on the Khan Academy, Official SAT Practice

00:06:11.694 --> 00:06:15.403
product, so, we have, the
Tips and Strategies section

00:06:15.403 --> 00:06:17.922
is not just tips and
strategies, there's a lot of

00:06:17.922 --> 00:06:20.606
the changes that have
been made to the SAT,

00:06:20.606 --> 00:06:24.708
what to expect on test day,
what are acceptable calculators,

00:06:24.708 --> 00:06:27.543
there's information on
College Board about that,

00:06:27.543 --> 00:06:28.960
what are the different question types,

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.448
what are the different
lengths of the sections,

00:06:30.448 --> 00:06:33.078
what's a raw score, what's a scaled score,

00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:36.139
all this information is
on Official SAT Practice

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:37.472
in Khan Academy.

00:06:38.512 --> 00:06:39.429
Let me see.

00:06:41.592 --> 00:06:44.580
I'm gonna go to, let's see, let's see

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.330
what kinda questions I have here.

00:06:48.164 --> 00:06:50.081
Is there prep for PSAT?

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:55.246
This is coming in from
Samman, and, let's see, yeah,

00:06:55.246 --> 00:06:59.413
the PSAT and the SAT are the
skills that both of those tests

00:07:00.343 --> 00:07:01.926
test, are the same.

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:08.044
The Official SAT Practice is
also applicable for the PSAT,

00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:12.757
because the tests are so
close in what the content is,

00:07:12.757 --> 00:07:16.917
what the skills are that it's testing you.

00:07:16.917 --> 00:07:19.292
The practice schedule feature allows you

00:07:19.292 --> 00:07:23.061
to also set a schedule
leading up to the PSAT,

00:07:23.061 --> 00:07:25.450
and we also have an official PSAT

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.362
that you can download
off the site as well.

00:07:29.362 --> 00:07:32.344
Another question has come in.

00:07:32.344 --> 00:07:36.011
How should we practice
and tackle the essay?

00:07:39.311 --> 00:07:41.022
Great question.

00:07:41.022 --> 00:07:45.876
The essay is an amazing,
they've changed the essay,

00:07:45.876 --> 00:07:49.209
and the essay right now is an assignment

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.870
that you would see any
college-level English course,

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.837
or History course, and
it is testing how well

00:07:57.837 --> 00:08:02.004
you can analyse evidence,
and understand how an author

00:08:03.227 --> 00:08:07.394
is using different devices,
different writerly devices,

00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:12.537
to persuade the audience
of his or her point

00:08:12.537 --> 00:08:14.704
that she or she is making.

00:08:17.445 --> 00:08:20.027
We have tips and strategies
around helping you with this,

00:08:20.027 --> 00:08:23.240
we're somewhere in development,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.278
we also have full-length essays
with scoring for each exam

00:08:26.278 --> 00:08:29.186
that you can download and work on,

00:08:29.186 --> 00:08:32.061
and if you go to the essay section now,

00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:36.228
you'll see that there're a
couple of relatively new entries

00:08:37.655 --> 00:08:39.306
into the Tips and Strategies.

00:08:39.306 --> 00:08:43.779
One is called Unpacking
the SAT Essay Prompt,

00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:47.654
which is adapted from the
official SAT Study Guide,

00:08:47.654 --> 00:08:50.284
basically, it takes apart
the prompt, and says,

00:08:50.284 --> 00:08:53.485
this is what you're supposed to do.

00:08:53.485 --> 00:08:57.565
You're not supposed to just
say what the author is saying,

00:08:57.565 --> 00:09:00.052
you're not supposed to
reiterate, to say again,

00:09:00.052 --> 00:09:01.915
what the point is, you're not paraphrasing

00:09:01.915 --> 00:09:04.459
the whole document, or the whole passage.

00:09:04.459 --> 00:09:07.959
You are, if we go there, you have one part

00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:12.030
which is, explain how the
author builds an argument

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.859
to persuade the audience.

00:09:14.859 --> 00:09:17.521
And so that is something that
there are do's and don't's

00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:19.771
that I put in that article.

00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:25.508
Consider how the author uses
evidence to support claims.

00:09:25.508 --> 00:09:27.545
I make a list, there's a list in there now

00:09:27.545 --> 00:09:30.809
of different types of evidence
that you might consider,

00:09:30.809 --> 00:09:32.491
that you might look out for,
as you're reading through

00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:33.491
the passage.

00:09:35.252 --> 00:09:39.029
Consider how the author uses
reasoning to develop ideas,

00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:42.154
and connect claims and evidence.

00:09:42.154 --> 00:09:44.791
In the article, we
explain what reasoning is,

00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:49.450
and how that applies, and how
you might be able to draw out

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:52.851
these elements from the
passage that you're analyzing,

00:09:52.851 --> 00:09:54.765
and evaluating.

00:09:54.765 --> 00:09:56.524
Consider how the author uses stylistic

00:09:56.524 --> 00:10:00.225
or persuasive elements to add
power to the ideas expressed.

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.728
So this article is about taking apart

00:10:02.728 --> 00:10:05.361
this really dense prompt, and saying,

00:10:05.361 --> 00:10:08.312
okay, this is what this means,
this is what it means to you,

00:10:08.312 --> 00:10:10.941
when you're sitting there for 50 minutes,

00:10:10.941 --> 00:10:15.147
and you need to write a three-page paper,

00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:19.415
and how to tackle that,
another really great essay,

00:10:19.415 --> 00:10:22.555
that's another article
that's in there now, is,

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:25.192
The SAT Essay, Analyzing a Passage,

00:10:25.192 --> 00:10:29.359
in which we take apart, or
examine how one might approach

00:10:31.463 --> 00:10:35.630
one of the prompts that is
a real SAT essay prompt,

00:10:37.649 --> 00:10:41.300
so I'd say check that out as well.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.133
Let's see.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.501
What else we have here?

00:10:45.501 --> 00:10:48.351
How should we practice and
tackle the essay section?

00:10:48.351 --> 00:10:51.601
The more you do it, the better you get.

00:10:52.838 --> 00:10:54.658
So we're working on adding new features

00:10:54.658 --> 00:10:58.473
that may actually enable you
to get your essay graded,

00:10:58.473 --> 00:11:02.066
but the best way to do
it is to actually put

00:11:02.066 --> 00:11:05.505
pencil to paper, or type an essay in,

00:11:05.505 --> 00:11:09.672
and give yourself a timed
scenario to see how you do,

00:11:11.208 --> 00:11:15.642
and understand that you
need an introduction,

00:11:15.642 --> 00:11:19.083
you need body paragraphs,
and you need a conclusion,

00:11:19.083 --> 00:11:21.410
and each of those body paragraphs

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.945
is probably going to focus
on an element, so maybe,

00:11:25.945 --> 00:11:30.346
let's say, the author is using
a lot of statistics, or data.

00:11:30.346 --> 00:11:33.115
You would use that body
paragraph to talk about

00:11:33.115 --> 00:11:36.789
how the author uses data and evidence

00:11:36.789 --> 00:11:40.902
to support his or her
point, and then you take out

00:11:40.902 --> 00:11:45.469
quoted little statistics, or,
paraphrase little statistics,

00:11:45.469 --> 00:11:48.843
from throughout the essay,
from throughout the passage,

00:11:48.843 --> 00:11:51.289
and put all that evidence
into that body paragraph.

00:11:51.289 --> 00:11:53.419
Then you move on to the
second body paragraph,

00:11:53.419 --> 00:11:55.191
and you think of another element
that the author is doing,

00:11:55.191 --> 00:11:58.691
maybe the author is making the reader feel

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:02.428
afraid of what might happen if...

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.028
If they don't turn off
the air conditioner,

00:12:07.028 --> 00:12:11.195
and you basically point
out all those little things

00:12:12.448 --> 00:12:15.365
in the passage that the author says

00:12:16.612 --> 00:12:19.883
to kinda me a little scared
about what might happen

00:12:19.883 --> 00:12:23.410
with climate change, if I keep
burning my air conditioner.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.953
So, you take those elements, threads

00:12:26.953 --> 00:12:28.536
from different paragraphs of the passage,

00:12:28.536 --> 00:12:33.084
and weave them into one body
paragraph in your essay.

00:12:33.084 --> 00:12:36.334
So, you kinda work through it that way.

00:12:38.122 --> 00:12:40.440
Let's see, another question.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.537
Are we allowed to use graphing
calculators during the SAT,

00:12:43.537 --> 00:12:45.926
or only scientific calculators?

00:12:45.926 --> 00:12:50.196
This is from Shawn, thanks
Shawn, great question.

00:12:50.196 --> 00:12:54.506
There's a full list of acceptable
calculators on SAT.org,

00:12:54.506 --> 00:12:56.309
and there's a calculator policy,

00:12:56.309 --> 00:13:00.226
you go there under Taking
the Test, on SAT.org.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.991
In general, most graphing
calculators are permitted,

00:13:05.991 --> 00:13:07.991
so, just check that out.

00:13:09.296 --> 00:13:12.254
Ordinarily, with a calculator,
you don't really need it,

00:13:12.254 --> 00:13:16.437
and if you find yourself doing
really lengthy calculations

00:13:16.437 --> 00:13:19.620
in your calculator, the chances are,

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.304
you might've missed something,
so I just wanna say,

00:13:22.304 --> 00:13:25.341
be cautious about when you
pick up your calculator,

00:13:25.341 --> 00:13:26.940
obviously, there's a section of the SAT

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.347
that you're not allowed
to use a calculator,

00:13:29.347 --> 00:13:31.238
but even when you are using a calculator,

00:13:31.238 --> 00:13:32.714
it's the calculator
section, that doesn't mean

00:13:32.714 --> 00:13:35.616
that the first thing you do
is type the numbers you see

00:13:35.616 --> 00:13:38.488
in the question into the calculator.

00:13:38.488 --> 00:13:40.991
You wanna take a step back,
you wanna say to yourself,

00:13:40.991 --> 00:13:44.602
hold on, what does the question want,

00:13:44.602 --> 00:13:49.144
what is the question telling
me, what's my game plan here?

00:13:49.144 --> 00:13:50.204
And then you decide whether you need

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:53.037
the calculator or not, to do that.

00:13:53.939 --> 00:13:55.006
Let's see.

00:13:55.006 --> 00:13:55.890
Another question.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.539
How can I reset my skill level

00:13:58.539 --> 00:14:02.622
so I can practice the
lower skill levels of math?

00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:06.985
The answer is, well, you can't.

00:14:06.985 --> 00:14:08.326
The Official SAT Practice
doesn't allow you

00:14:08.326 --> 00:14:10.434
to reset your skill level,
because it's a reflection

00:14:10.434 --> 00:14:12.258
of where you are.

00:14:12.258 --> 00:14:15.621
If you wanna review things
from a lower skill level,

00:14:15.621 --> 00:14:18.454
then, you can go to the review tab

00:14:19.403 --> 00:14:22.207
at the top of Official SAT Practice,

00:14:22.207 --> 00:14:26.522
and look at the questions
again, that you missed.

00:14:26.522 --> 00:14:27.355
Let's see.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.024
Another question.

00:14:30.024 --> 00:14:34.191
I'm a junior, but I am not
taking Pre-Calc and AP Calc,

00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:39.901
but can I still really do well on the SAT,

00:14:39.901 --> 00:14:42.721
through Khan Academy SAT practice?

00:14:42.721 --> 00:14:45.638
And the answer is, absolutely, man!

00:14:46.588 --> 00:14:48.255
Or, whoever you are!

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.148
Absolutely!

00:14:51.148 --> 00:14:55.142
The best way that you can
prep for the SAT right now,

00:14:55.142 --> 00:14:58.975
is to go on Khan Academy,
and do a diagnostic,

00:15:00.324 --> 00:15:01.671
see how you do.

00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:04.794
If you get the questions
wrong, that is okay.

00:15:04.794 --> 00:15:08.098
The system will send you
to practice those skills

00:15:08.098 --> 00:15:11.621
that you're not strong enough in yet,

00:15:11.621 --> 00:15:13.362
to get those questions right.

00:15:13.362 --> 00:15:16.074
The key to doing well is to start early,

00:15:16.074 --> 00:15:18.027
and just keep on getting familiar

00:15:18.027 --> 00:15:20.802
with the skills you need on the test.

00:15:20.802 --> 00:15:23.802
You also can watch videos on any concept

00:15:23.802 --> 00:15:26.487
you haven't learned yet,
so, that isn't just an

00:15:26.487 --> 00:15:28.476
Official SAT Practice, if you don't find

00:15:28.476 --> 00:15:32.238
what you need there, then
head on out to Khan Academy,

00:15:32.238 --> 00:15:34.988
go to the subjects, and get some!

00:15:35.979 --> 00:15:39.670
Get some amazing videos
and articles and exercises

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.503
to help you strengthen your skills

00:15:43.488 --> 00:15:45.738
in the areas that you need.

00:15:47.102 --> 00:15:49.019
Let's see, another one.

00:15:50.156 --> 00:15:53.131
What about book
recommendations and strategies

00:15:53.131 --> 00:15:55.497
for the reading part?

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:56.997
This is from Haya.

00:15:58.612 --> 00:16:01.859
There's always one passage
from the US founding documents,

00:16:01.859 --> 00:16:04.355
and the great conversations
that they've inspired

00:16:04.355 --> 00:16:07.355
through the years, women's suffrage,

00:16:08.961 --> 00:16:12.630
there are all sorts of
debate about slavery,

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.797
debate about the way that
the Constitution was drafted.

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:19.472
The...

00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:23.727
This is bumping around.

00:16:23.727 --> 00:16:25.283
Other passages included are classic

00:16:25.283 --> 00:16:28.951
and contemporary literature, a
passage about social science,

00:16:28.951 --> 00:16:31.034
and two science passages.

00:16:32.014 --> 00:16:35.955
If you wanna practice for the
reading section of the test,

00:16:35.955 --> 00:16:40.476
look at the strategies that
are in Tips and Strategies,

00:16:40.476 --> 00:16:41.840
on the Official SAT Practice.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.523
If you're trying to, really, just build up

00:16:43.523 --> 00:16:47.690
your reading fluency, then,
read the New York Times,

00:16:52.029 --> 00:16:55.183
read the Washington Post,
read the Chicago Tribune,

00:16:55.183 --> 00:16:58.087
read the LA Times, read Newsweek,

00:16:58.087 --> 00:17:02.170
read content, read stories,
that are at the level

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:08.188
that the SAT is at, but, you
don't need to do that now,

00:17:08.188 --> 00:17:10.884
you should jump in to
Official SAT Practice,

00:17:10.884 --> 00:17:13.688
and look at those passages.

00:17:13.688 --> 00:17:16.443
There are lots of sample
passages there to try out,

00:17:16.443 --> 00:17:20.603
and, if you get questions
wrong, it's no big deal,

00:17:20.603 --> 00:17:22.795
nobody's gonna look at your results,

00:17:22.795 --> 00:17:24.115
nobody's gonna look at your practice,

00:17:24.115 --> 00:17:26.438
you don't need to let
anybody in except you,

00:17:26.438 --> 00:17:28.021
and, so, go for it!

00:17:31.444 --> 00:17:32.277
Let's see.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:38.017
I have exhausted all the
exercises, what should I do now?

00:17:40.646 --> 00:17:42.969
We continually are adding new exercises,

00:17:42.969 --> 00:17:45.533
we're adding more writing
and language exercises

00:17:45.533 --> 00:17:47.735
this week and next, we're
adding more reading passages

00:17:47.735 --> 00:17:51.092
this week and next, but, congratulations

00:17:51.092 --> 00:17:52.906
if you've done all of this
stuff, you've done tons of work,

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:55.926
and I hope that you've seen results.

00:17:55.926 --> 00:17:59.475
The thing that I wanna emphasize here,

00:17:59.475 --> 00:18:03.030
is that if you've done the passages,

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.991
and you've gotten questions
wrong, what you should do

00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:09.551
is go and pretend you've
never seen them before.

00:18:09.551 --> 00:18:11.374
You shouldn't look at the answer and say,

00:18:11.374 --> 00:18:15.116
oh, that's the answer, I guess
I'll try another question,

00:18:15.116 --> 00:18:15.949
right?

00:18:15.949 --> 00:18:18.910
Every question is this opportunity

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.775
to learn about that type
of question, and say,

00:18:22.775 --> 00:18:24.543
like, what do I have to
do differently next time

00:18:24.543 --> 00:18:27.876
when this sort of question comes my way?

00:18:28.881 --> 00:18:32.426
And when you're using the
review tab the right way,

00:18:32.426 --> 00:18:34.301
every one of those questions you missed

00:18:34.301 --> 00:18:38.108
from the moment you started
using the Official SAT Practice,

00:18:38.108 --> 00:18:41.108
this will be able to, you'll
be able to say to yourself,

00:18:41.108 --> 00:18:44.827
okay, this one went wrong, this
is why that answer is right,

00:18:44.827 --> 00:18:47.566
this is why the answer I chose was wrong,

00:18:47.566 --> 00:18:51.849
I think I got it now, and
then you try another passage.

00:18:51.849 --> 00:18:52.682
Let's see.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:57.490
I have another question from Erphan,

00:18:58.587 --> 00:19:01.837
what can I do if I feel like I'm stuck,

00:19:02.882 --> 00:19:04.882
and not making progress?

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:09.297
Great question, can be super frustrating.

00:19:09.297 --> 00:19:13.143
I would love to know from you whether it's

00:19:13.143 --> 00:19:14.513
the reading section you're
having trouble with,

00:19:14.513 --> 00:19:16.374
the writing and language section
you're having trouble with,

00:19:16.374 --> 00:19:20.541
or whether it's math, math,
I'd say, watch all the videos,

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:25.395
go back into the main Khan Academy site,

00:19:25.395 --> 00:19:30.127
and study those math types, if
you've used all the exercises

00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:33.902
and done all the problems
in Official SAT Practice.

00:19:33.902 --> 00:19:38.592
In the reading, it may be
because of time management,

00:19:38.592 --> 00:19:41.798
which we haven't quite talked about yet.

00:19:41.798 --> 00:19:44.956
So, time management in
the reading section,

00:19:44.956 --> 00:19:49.014
like if you're somebody who's
finding yourself out of time

00:19:49.014 --> 00:19:52.660
on the reading section, then
there are things you can do

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.660
to build up your score, and in part,

00:19:56.808 --> 00:20:01.389
that's realizing that there are
different difficulty levels,

00:20:01.389 --> 00:20:03.801
every question is different,
and there are some easy,

00:20:03.801 --> 00:20:07.667
there's some easier questions at the end,

00:20:07.667 --> 00:20:12.127
at the end of the reading
section, the passage at the end

00:20:12.127 --> 00:20:14.160
is not necessarily the hardest passage,

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.253
the passage at the end of
the writing and language test

00:20:16.253 --> 00:20:18.301
is not necessarily the hardest passage,

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:21.470
so, if you're running out
of time and having to guess

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:25.931
on a passage or two, at the
end of those parts of the SAT,

00:20:25.931 --> 00:20:28.258
then you should make a real adjustment

00:20:28.258 --> 00:20:30.726
to the way that you manage your time,

00:20:30.726 --> 00:20:33.804
and there's details about
that in Tips and Strategies,

00:20:33.804 --> 00:20:38.192
we have a couple new articles
there, about time management,

00:20:38.192 --> 00:20:40.390
and there're also a couple
great articles there now

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.973
about active reading strategies

00:20:44.042 --> 00:20:47.779
that will help you really
engage with the passage

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:50.355
in a more active way,
in a more focused way,

00:20:50.355 --> 00:20:54.522
and also, help you not choose
choices that look good,

00:20:57.777 --> 00:21:00.049
just because they look good, right?

00:21:00.049 --> 00:21:04.216
The answer choices are
created to look good, right?

00:21:05.307 --> 00:21:09.193
So, the best way that you can move forward

00:21:09.193 --> 00:21:13.360
with so many of the questions
in the reading test,

00:21:14.917 --> 00:21:18.372
is, have some idea of
what you're looking for

00:21:18.372 --> 00:21:20.094
before you start looking, right?

00:21:20.094 --> 00:21:22.315
So what does that mean?

00:21:22.315 --> 00:21:26.385
That means that, if you
have question that's like,

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:28.905
the primary purpose of paragraph three

00:21:28.905 --> 00:21:32.572
can best be described
as, what you should do

00:21:33.848 --> 00:21:36.568
is not just read the choices right then.

00:21:36.568 --> 00:21:38.724
If you're reading the choices right then,

00:21:38.724 --> 00:21:43.552
then you might just choose
one that looks good, right?

00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:45.691
What you should do instead
is take a moment, and say,

00:21:45.691 --> 00:21:48.093
okay, what is this question asking?

00:21:48.093 --> 00:21:50.483
What is paragraph three doing?

00:21:50.483 --> 00:21:53.569
What is the purpose of paragraph three?

00:21:53.569 --> 00:21:55.868
You go back to paragraph
three, you look at it,

00:21:55.868 --> 00:21:57.875
you say it in your own words, you say,

00:21:57.875 --> 00:22:00.097
oh, paragraph three is
supplying evidence to support

00:22:00.097 --> 00:22:02.347
the author's point about...

00:22:04.055 --> 00:22:08.520
Arctic tern migration, or
something, and then you say, okay,

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.254
that's what it's doing,
and then you go back

00:22:10.254 --> 00:22:13.504
to the choices then, and you say, okay,

00:22:14.949 --> 00:22:17.175
I'm looking for supporting point about

00:22:17.175 --> 00:22:19.927
Arctic tern migration, and at that point,

00:22:19.927 --> 00:22:20.853
you know what you're looking for,

00:22:20.853 --> 00:22:22.902
you're in control of the question,

00:22:22.902 --> 00:22:25.276
you're in control of
what you're looking for,

00:22:25.276 --> 00:22:27.859
and at that point, the wrong answers

00:22:27.859 --> 00:22:30.422
kinda disqualify themselves,
because they don't really

00:22:30.422 --> 00:22:32.695
tell you what you thought
you were looking for.

00:22:32.695 --> 00:22:34.115
And this is a lot about trusting yourself,

00:22:34.115 --> 00:22:35.850
and there's more about
that in the article,

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:38.497
in Tips and Strategies.

00:22:38.497 --> 00:22:40.588
So that's what I'd say about that.

00:22:40.588 --> 00:22:41.838
And, let's see.

00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:44.208
Another question.

00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:50.254
If you have good grades but
don't have a great SAT score,

00:22:50.254 --> 00:22:55.040
does that affect your chances
of getting into a good school?

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.483
I answered that a little
bit earlier, in a way,

00:22:58.483 --> 00:23:00.535
I addressed that a little bit earlier.

00:23:00.535 --> 00:23:03.050
And remember, the SAT is just one part

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.321
of your college application,
and I would encourage you

00:23:05.321 --> 00:23:07.774
to check out BigFuture.org
to explore the colleges

00:23:07.774 --> 00:23:10.732
that might be a good fit
for you based on your GPA,

00:23:10.732 --> 00:23:12.549
and your tests scores and your interests,

00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:15.544
but, grades are really important.

00:23:15.544 --> 00:23:18.211
Grades demonstrate that
you work hard in school.

00:23:18.211 --> 00:23:21.279
If you have great grades
and your SAT isn't so good,

00:23:21.279 --> 00:23:23.132
you certainly aren't the
first person in the world

00:23:23.132 --> 00:23:26.268
to have this problem, that
have like test-taking anxiety,

00:23:26.268 --> 00:23:30.601
you freeze up when you're,
like, they're on a timed test,

00:23:30.601 --> 00:23:32.038
if you had a choice between being somebody

00:23:32.038 --> 00:23:35.538
who had awesome grades and
a kind of mediocre score

00:23:35.538 --> 00:23:37.595
on the SAT, and somebody who had

00:23:37.595 --> 00:23:41.689
mediocre grades, and an
awesome score on the SAT,

00:23:41.689 --> 00:23:43.717
I would much rather be the first student,

00:23:43.717 --> 00:23:46.849
because, if you have mediocre grades

00:23:46.849 --> 00:23:49.609
but an awesome SAT score,
as admission officer,

00:23:49.609 --> 00:23:52.796
I may say, like, this
student is an underachiever,

00:23:52.796 --> 00:23:55.463
this student isn't working hard,

00:23:56.308 --> 00:23:58.813
what's going on here,
there's a weird story here.

00:23:58.813 --> 00:24:00.051
But if you get great grades and you have

00:24:00.051 --> 00:24:02.265
great recommendations, then yes,

00:24:02.265 --> 00:24:06.023
you don't necessarily need
to have an amazing SAT score,

00:24:06.023 --> 00:24:10.352
if you look at those score
ranges, 25th to 75th percentile,

00:24:10.352 --> 00:24:13.334
if you have a score down
to the 25th percentile,

00:24:13.334 --> 00:24:17.392
25% of the people who were
offered admission to that school

00:24:17.392 --> 00:24:22.366
had scores lower than that,
so, I hope that makes sense,

00:24:22.366 --> 00:24:24.974
if you have questions, you can ask 'em,

00:24:24.974 --> 00:24:26.940
and we'll try to answer
'em, relating to that,

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.190
if that doesn't make sense.

00:24:30.423 --> 00:24:32.461
Question, okay, let's
see, I have registered

00:24:32.461 --> 00:24:35.094
for the October 1st exam.

00:24:35.094 --> 00:24:37.786
What would be the best practice plan

00:24:37.786 --> 00:24:40.113
from now til October?

00:24:40.113 --> 00:24:41.991
Great question.

00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:45.574
Maybe there're a bunch
of you in this boat.

00:24:46.437 --> 00:24:50.530
I'd say that you should
take a diagnostic test

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:54.053
as soon as possible,
and, or link your exam,

00:24:54.053 --> 00:24:57.663
your most recent SAT exam, or your PSAT,

00:24:57.663 --> 00:25:01.298
to Official SAT Practice, and then create

00:25:01.298 --> 00:25:05.020
a practice plan from there, and the system

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.152
will also create one for
you that you can customize,

00:25:07.152 --> 00:25:10.293
so it's just, oh, you wanna
do eight hours a week,

00:25:10.293 --> 00:25:14.450
how about Monday, Tuesday,
Thursday, from five to seven,

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.366
and you can tweak that,
and move it around,

00:25:16.366 --> 00:25:18.865
and decide what it is that you wanna do,

00:25:18.865 --> 00:25:21.523
what you can commit to.

00:25:21.523 --> 00:25:23.847
That's a great start.

00:25:23.847 --> 00:25:25.191
It depends on how much time you have.

00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:26.995
The more you do it, the better you get,

00:25:26.995 --> 00:25:31.162
and, I would say that taking
one practice test soon,

00:25:32.082 --> 00:25:34.733
and planning to take another
full-length practice test

00:25:34.733 --> 00:25:37.257
in a week or two before the test,

00:25:37.257 --> 00:25:39.964
and then, take the time, after
you take that practice test,

00:25:39.964 --> 00:25:42.738
to really dissect it, to take apart

00:25:42.738 --> 00:25:46.020
every question you missed, and say, okay,

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:46.978
what happened here?

00:25:46.978 --> 00:25:49.111
Is this a percentages question?

00:25:49.111 --> 00:25:51.223
Is this a quadratics question?

00:25:51.223 --> 00:25:53.202
And the thing is that
that work is done for you

00:25:53.202 --> 00:25:55.015
by Official SAT Practice.

00:25:55.015 --> 00:25:57.573
So, if you get information
into the system,

00:25:57.573 --> 00:25:59.478
the system will tell
you what you should do,

00:25:59.478 --> 00:26:03.561
and it will take as much
time as you can give it.

00:26:04.678 --> 00:26:07.116
But I'd say a minimum,
four weeks schedule,

00:26:07.116 --> 00:26:09.433
if you wanna move your score 100 points,

00:26:09.433 --> 00:26:12.588
which is fairly ambitious
but totally possible,

00:26:12.588 --> 00:26:16.515
then you wanna put in, I've
seen students hit the books

00:26:16.515 --> 00:26:20.051
super hard, and raise their
score 200 points, 300 points.

00:26:20.051 --> 00:26:24.218
That's an exception, but you
go in, and you log the time,

00:26:27.255 --> 00:26:29.432
and, if you have comments or questions,

00:26:29.432 --> 00:26:31.849
as you're using the product,
put 'em in the comments,

00:26:31.849 --> 00:26:33.402
put it in the questions,
put it in the tips section

00:26:33.402 --> 00:26:36.972
of every one of the articles
in Tips and Strategies,

00:26:36.972 --> 00:26:41.139
and we'll try to address
your questions and concerns

00:26:43.114 --> 00:26:44.281
in due course.

00:26:45.407 --> 00:26:46.240
Let's see.

00:26:48.802 --> 00:26:49.838
Let's see.

00:26:49.838 --> 00:26:51.792
When is the last SAT test that I can take

00:26:51.792 --> 00:26:54.981
before the usual deadline
of college applications?

00:26:54.981 --> 00:26:56.231
Great question.

00:26:57.469 --> 00:27:00.565
The usual deadline is, a lot of colleges

00:27:00.565 --> 00:27:02.672
have different deadlines,
some of them have January 1st,

00:27:02.672 --> 00:27:05.901
some of them have January
15th, early decision deadlines

00:27:05.901 --> 00:27:07.218
are sometimes at the
beginning of November,

00:27:07.218 --> 00:27:10.112
beginning to middle of November,

00:27:10.112 --> 00:27:14.395
and, early decision, early
action, the recommendation,

00:27:14.395 --> 00:27:16.050
we recommend that you take the test,

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.617
October 1st is really the last one to meet

00:27:18.617 --> 00:27:22.855
the early deadlines, the
November and December tests

00:27:22.855 --> 00:27:26.207
are fine for your later deadline,
so if it's a January 15th

00:27:26.207 --> 00:27:28.559
or January 1st, November, December tests

00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:30.280
are gonna work out
fine, and you'll be able

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.447
to send those scores to those schools.

00:27:34.329 --> 00:27:35.162
Let's see.

00:27:36.633 --> 00:27:40.800
Is the SAT going to be
harder than last year's SAT?

00:27:42.154 --> 00:27:45.753
Okay, what carries more
weight, the ACT or SAT?

00:27:45.753 --> 00:27:48.317
Two amazing questions.

00:27:48.317 --> 00:27:49.306
Okay.

00:27:49.306 --> 00:27:51.915
Is the SAT harder than it was last year?

00:27:51.915 --> 00:27:53.915
Totally different tests.

00:27:55.101 --> 00:27:58.101
In some ways, yes, in some ways, no.

00:27:59.607 --> 00:28:03.774
It's kind of a moot point,
meaning that it doesn't matter

00:28:05.474 --> 00:28:08.164
whether it's harder or easier,

00:28:08.164 --> 00:28:10.418
because you can't take
the old SAT anymore,

00:28:10.418 --> 00:28:14.585
the new SAT is the SAT
now, and some students find

00:28:16.001 --> 00:28:18.696
SAT more challenging,
some students find the ACT

00:28:18.696 --> 00:28:22.120
more challenging, you can't know

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.574
which one you're gonna do better on

00:28:23.574 --> 00:28:27.025
until you take a
full-length practice test.

00:28:27.025 --> 00:28:29.997
What carries more weight, ACT or SAT?

00:28:29.997 --> 00:28:32.460
As far as I know, there's
not a single college

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.597
that prefers one test or the
other at this moment in time.

00:28:36.597 --> 00:28:39.317
So, that may have been
true, it might've been true

00:28:39.317 --> 00:28:42.432
five, 10, 15 years ago,
the word on the street,

00:28:42.432 --> 00:28:45.831
the rumors have had it
that Midwestern colleges

00:28:45.831 --> 00:28:49.181
prefer ACT, and colleges
on the coasts prefer SAT,

00:28:49.181 --> 00:28:51.801
that is not true anymore.

00:28:51.801 --> 00:28:55.185
Both are accepted by all colleges, and so,

00:28:55.185 --> 00:28:58.793
there's no reason to try
to game it or second guess

00:28:58.793 --> 00:29:01.443
which college, which one would prefer,

00:29:01.443 --> 00:29:02.712
and you can verify this by calling

00:29:02.712 --> 00:29:04.715
any college admissions office.

00:29:04.715 --> 00:29:06.215
Try them both out.

00:29:07.568 --> 00:29:08.401
Let's see.

00:29:09.908 --> 00:29:14.075
Would I recommend practicing
more rather than studying?

00:29:15.224 --> 00:29:16.920
Interesting.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.637
Practicing versus studying,
I think it's important

00:29:20.637 --> 00:29:23.833
not to just keep on taking practice tests,

00:29:23.833 --> 00:29:25.832
you don't just take practice
test after practice test

00:29:25.832 --> 00:29:28.078
after practice test, without taking time

00:29:28.078 --> 00:29:30.781
between each practice test to say, like,

00:29:30.781 --> 00:29:33.035
okay, what do I learn?

00:29:33.035 --> 00:29:35.923
Go back, look at any question
that you missed, and say,

00:29:35.923 --> 00:29:37.556
okay, why did I miss that?

00:29:37.556 --> 00:29:39.391
Was it a careless error?

00:29:39.391 --> 00:29:41.296
Could I have gotten this?

00:29:41.296 --> 00:29:44.847
What could I have done differently?

00:29:44.847 --> 00:29:45.680
And, so...

00:29:46.647 --> 00:29:49.400
So I just wanna say, don't
just take practice test

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.741
after practice test.

00:29:51.741 --> 00:29:52.743
After you take a practice test,

00:29:52.743 --> 00:29:55.360
find out what you need to study.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.429
Find out what you need to work on,

00:29:57.429 --> 00:30:02.008
and you can use Official
SAT Practice as a resource.

00:30:02.008 --> 00:30:06.377
Our goal here is to get
the world's best test prep,

00:30:06.377 --> 00:30:10.437
and that's a tall order,
but I think we're doing it,

00:30:10.437 --> 00:30:14.604
and it's super exciting
to be a part of this team,

00:30:16.155 --> 00:30:18.084
and part of this movement, really,

00:30:18.084 --> 00:30:20.666
to make all of this information,

00:30:20.666 --> 00:30:22.103
all these tips, all these strategies,

00:30:22.103 --> 00:30:26.270
all this real practice questions,
and personalized practice,

00:30:28.214 --> 00:30:30.797
available to anybody, for free.

00:30:32.374 --> 00:30:33.807
Let's see.

00:30:33.807 --> 00:30:37.106
Other questions, let's see,
I'll maybe take a couple more,

00:30:37.106 --> 00:30:40.356
running a little over, but this is fun.

00:30:41.874 --> 00:30:45.124
In what grade should I start preparing?

00:30:46.252 --> 00:30:49.649
Really tough question, I would say,

00:30:49.649 --> 00:30:53.399
you're preparing for
college your whole life,

00:30:55.123 --> 00:30:58.694
and so, you should be doing
your best in your school,

00:30:58.694 --> 00:30:59.873
you should be challenging yourself,

00:30:59.873 --> 00:31:03.956
you should be challenging
yourself to read books,

00:31:04.929 --> 00:31:08.212
to read articles, to
do your best in class,

00:31:08.212 --> 00:31:11.291
and if you're doing that, and
you're challenging yourself

00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:14.039
in school, you are preparing for the SAT.

00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:15.601
Now, if it comes to, like, when do I,

00:31:15.601 --> 00:31:20.368
okay, okay, I get that,
Dave, when do I start using

00:31:20.368 --> 00:31:24.339
Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy?

00:31:24.339 --> 00:31:28.790
Six months is plenty, but
it depends, for most people.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:33.458
It depends on what is the
gap you're trying to close

00:31:33.458 --> 00:31:34.970
with your scores.

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:36.137
If you have...

00:31:37.077 --> 00:31:40.206
If you're trying and you have
a PSAT from sophomore year,

00:31:40.206 --> 00:31:42.769
'cause some high schools
administer the PSAT sophomore year.

00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:44.465
If you've done that, and you're like,

00:31:44.465 --> 00:31:49.087
oh, I need to raise my score
300 points, 400 points,

00:31:49.087 --> 00:31:53.077
I still wouldn't hit Official
SAT Practice very hard

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:55.814
until like six months out.

00:31:55.814 --> 00:31:58.481
But you can take practice tests.

00:31:59.674 --> 00:32:02.765
You can be using Khan Academy,
and do those questions,

00:32:02.765 --> 00:32:05.780
and try to fill in whatever holes or gaps

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:09.624
in your comprehension there are in math.

00:32:09.624 --> 00:32:12.170
You should take the PSAT
sophomore or junior year,

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:15.000
and then, in your junior year,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.408
you start spending more time doing it.

00:32:18.408 --> 00:32:20.308
Maybe the summer before junior year,

00:32:20.308 --> 00:32:23.112
if you're gonna be super
slammed junior year

00:32:23.112 --> 00:32:26.445
with sports or work or extracurriculars,

00:32:28.207 --> 00:32:31.677
or just, you have a
really tough course load,

00:32:31.677 --> 00:32:33.285
it may make sense to do a little practice,

00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:37.388
take another practice test
the summer before junior year.

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:41.190
When is the best time to take the SAT?

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:42.263
Let's see.

00:32:42.263 --> 00:32:46.413
Most students take the SAT
in the spring of junior year,

00:32:46.413 --> 00:32:51.071
and then again in the
fall of their senior year,

00:32:51.071 --> 00:32:55.330
and that's a good schedule,
the only exception

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:58.050
I might ever add to that is that,

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:00.911
if you take a practice
test, and you're like,

00:33:00.911 --> 00:33:04.159
oh my gosh, my score is
amazing, this is totally fine,

00:33:04.159 --> 00:33:07.705
I wanna get it out of
the way, then, congrats,

00:33:07.705 --> 00:33:10.704
and you could maybe do it earlier,

00:33:10.704 --> 00:33:14.371
and take it January or
March of junior year,

00:33:16.134 --> 00:33:20.325
but most people, you're
still learning more and more,

00:33:20.325 --> 00:33:22.487
throughout junior year,
you're still learning

00:33:22.487 --> 00:33:25.230
through the first couple
months of senior year,

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:28.107
your score's gonna sort
of naturally go up,

00:33:28.107 --> 00:33:31.940
so, aim to do your best
spring of junior year.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.614
Okay, another question.

00:33:35.614 --> 00:33:39.077
Do we need to memorize
SAT words like before?

00:33:39.077 --> 00:33:42.498
And the answer is, no, you don't!

00:33:42.498 --> 00:33:45.954
The new SAT is designed to
test what you need to know,

00:33:45.954 --> 00:33:50.343
and will be more applicable
to college and life.

00:33:50.343 --> 00:33:52.043
One of the big changes of the SAT

00:33:52.043 --> 00:33:53.954
from the old format to the new format,

00:33:53.954 --> 00:33:56.382
is that the vocabulary section,

00:33:56.382 --> 00:33:59.018
the sentence completions,
where you had to, like,

00:33:59.018 --> 00:34:00.534
plug in the right word,
and these are words

00:34:00.534 --> 00:34:02.618
that you maybe never seen before,

00:34:02.618 --> 00:34:05.580
and never expect to see again,

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.429
those words aren't on the test anymore,

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:10.529
so you have vocab and context questions

00:34:10.529 --> 00:34:13.430
that are words that are much more common,

00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:16.763
they might have multiple meanings, like,

00:34:17.857 --> 00:34:21.024
like the word discriminate,
which isn't always a bad thing,

00:34:21.024 --> 00:34:23.669
discriminating can also mean,
it's a verb to mean, like,

00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:26.092
noting subtle differences in something,

00:34:26.092 --> 00:34:29.567
the word currency is another
one that jumps to mind, like,

00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:32.814
things that are current, that
idea is holding currency,

00:34:32.814 --> 00:34:35.888
that means that that idea is current,

00:34:35.888 --> 00:34:38.873
it's something that people
are talking about now,

00:34:38.873 --> 00:34:41.723
it's not the same as money.

00:34:41.723 --> 00:34:45.723
So, recognizing those
different contextual clues

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.827
to identify those words is something that

00:34:48.827 --> 00:34:50.660
is on the current SAT.

00:34:52.792 --> 00:34:53.625
Let's see.

00:34:53.625 --> 00:34:56.363
I am, let's see, I'm gonna
take two more questions,

00:34:56.363 --> 00:34:58.363
then I'm gonna sign off.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:00.803
Let's see.

00:35:00.803 --> 00:35:03.535
Do you have food or water during the test?

00:35:03.535 --> 00:35:05.198
Great question.

00:35:05.198 --> 00:35:07.580
You need your desk to be
clear, when you take the test.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.161
You're not allowed to have water there

00:35:09.161 --> 00:35:11.665
on the table next to you.

00:35:11.665 --> 00:35:13.323
You're not allowed to
have food next to you.

00:35:13.323 --> 00:35:16.561
But you can have water in your
bag, underneath your chair,

00:35:16.561 --> 00:35:19.170
you can have a sandwich stowed away

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.947
for your 10-minute break,
or your 5-minute break,

00:35:21.947 --> 00:35:23.430
or your 2-minute break.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:27.347
These breaks are super
short, and just remember

00:35:28.229 --> 00:35:29.862
that if you don't take that opportunity,

00:35:29.862 --> 00:35:34.029
get up and stretch, and drink
water, and have a snack,

00:35:36.005 --> 00:35:37.853
your blood sugar level's gonna go down,

00:35:37.853 --> 00:35:42.635
and you may not be able to
focus as well as you'd like,

00:35:42.635 --> 00:35:46.075
going into that third, and
that fourth hour, of the test,

00:35:46.075 --> 00:35:49.805
so, bring those snacks, figure
out what those snacks are,

00:35:49.805 --> 00:35:51.076
have a good dinner the night before,

00:35:51.076 --> 00:35:52.895
have a good breakfast the morning of,

00:35:52.895 --> 00:35:56.510
and bring stuff with
you to eat really fast

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:59.559
during the break, so you can
keep your energy level up,

00:35:59.559 --> 00:36:02.976
'cause it's a marathon, and you need fuel

00:36:04.838 --> 00:36:08.424
as you're going through that marathon.

00:36:08.424 --> 00:36:09.754
So, let's see.

00:36:09.754 --> 00:36:12.155
There's more advice like
that in Tips and Strategies

00:36:12.155 --> 00:36:15.238
section of the Official SAT Practice.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:17.913
Let's see.

00:36:19.203 --> 00:36:21.476
How important is SAT for
international students

00:36:21.476 --> 00:36:24.294
interested in studying in the US?

00:36:24.294 --> 00:36:27.084
Another amazing question.

00:36:27.084 --> 00:36:28.358
It depends on the school.

00:36:28.358 --> 00:36:29.713
It depends on where you're applying.

00:36:29.713 --> 00:36:33.662
The best thing to do, once
you get that list of schools,

00:36:33.662 --> 00:36:37.504
is to actually call the admissions
office at those schools,

00:36:37.504 --> 00:36:41.134
and ask them, say, "Hey, I'm
applying internationally,

00:36:41.134 --> 00:36:45.100
"here are my grades, here's
a little bit about myself,

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.305
"what do you think, do you
want me to take the SAT?"

00:36:46.305 --> 00:36:48.420
And the answer is probably, "Yes, we do,"

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.008
that's the way that we
measure college readiness,

00:36:52.008 --> 00:36:56.175
and it's an indicator that,
you take the ACT or the SAT,

00:36:57.034 --> 00:36:59.784
this is a part of your
package, but some may say,

00:36:59.784 --> 00:37:02.701
"You know what, it's not critical,"

00:37:03.587 --> 00:37:06.050
so, you really just
need to call the school,

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:10.217
and that school's gonna start
creating a folder for you,

00:37:11.649 --> 00:37:13.629
that's another important part
of your college applications,

00:37:13.629 --> 00:37:16.721
you wanna let the school
know that you really

00:37:16.721 --> 00:37:18.855
wanna go there, because the college,

00:37:18.855 --> 00:37:21.411
most colleges want to offer places

00:37:21.411 --> 00:37:23.377
to students who will accept those places,

00:37:23.377 --> 00:37:26.495
and go there gladly, and they wanna fill

00:37:26.495 --> 00:37:30.646
their freshman class with
students, their first-year class,

00:37:30.646 --> 00:37:35.033
with students who are
super psyched to be there,

00:37:35.033 --> 00:37:39.580
so, if you demonstrate
your interest in that way,

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.809
then that'll help, that
can do nothing but help,

00:37:42.809 --> 00:37:47.427
so make those calls, write
those emails, don't be shy,

00:37:47.427 --> 00:37:52.015
because it may raise the chances
that they'll remember you

00:37:52.015 --> 00:37:56.234
when they start considering
people's applications.

00:37:56.234 --> 00:37:57.817
I'll take one more.

00:37:58.772 --> 00:38:00.854
Let's see, one little quick one, okay.

00:38:00.854 --> 00:38:03.603
Although the math section
gives you formulas,

00:38:03.603 --> 00:38:06.224
which it does, is there anything you think

00:38:06.224 --> 00:38:10.391
we should have memorized by
heart when we go into the test?

00:38:12.379 --> 00:38:16.546
There are a handful of things,
the two that jump to mind

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.957
is that you probably wanna
know your distance formula,

00:38:20.957 --> 00:38:23.944
you probably wanna know
your midpoint formula,

00:38:23.944 --> 00:38:27.194
you want to know difference of squares,

00:38:29.008 --> 00:38:30.178
like x squared minus y squared

00:38:30.178 --> 00:38:32.325
factors into x plus y times x minus y,

00:38:32.325 --> 00:38:33.990
and you should be making
flashcards for yourself,

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:35.184
if there's a little fact that comes up

00:38:35.184 --> 00:38:38.342
with a question you missed
on Official SAT Practice,

00:38:38.342 --> 00:38:41.186
change it, sorry, write that down,

00:38:41.186 --> 00:38:43.050
and make a little flashcard!

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:46.206
You also wanna be super
fluent with the formulas

00:38:46.206 --> 00:38:48.002
that are on the test.

00:38:48.002 --> 00:38:50.036
You don't wanna be
looking back and saying,

00:38:50.036 --> 00:38:52.536
is circumference pi r squared?

00:38:53.434 --> 00:38:56.500
By the way, no, it's not,
circumference is pi d,

00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.033
and the area of a circle is pi r squared,

00:39:00.033 --> 00:39:02.250
those are things that, it's really useful

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:03.959
just have on the tip of your tongue,

00:39:03.959 --> 00:39:06.115
if you have to be flipping back and forth,

00:39:06.115 --> 00:39:10.282
it's slowing you down, it's
wasting critical energy

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.599
that you need in order to do your best.

00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:15.703
Okay.

00:39:15.703 --> 00:39:17.620
We're gonna wrap it up.

00:39:18.965 --> 00:39:21.065
And I'll be back!

00:39:21.065 --> 00:39:22.576
Another one little thing I'm gonna say,

00:39:22.576 --> 00:39:26.488
is there are new articles in
the Tips and Strategies section

00:39:26.488 --> 00:39:31.068
that give you an opportunity
to share your favorite tips

00:39:31.068 --> 00:39:33.630
that you might've gotten from wherever,

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:36.483
for tackling the various
parts of the SAT, so,

00:39:36.483 --> 00:39:40.347
there's a math share space,
there's a writing and language

00:39:40.347 --> 00:39:42.198
share space, there's
a reading share space,

00:39:42.198 --> 00:39:45.928
general strategies share
space, and essay share space.

00:39:45.928 --> 00:39:47.511
Go there and share!

00:39:48.352 --> 00:39:52.916
And that includes any
educators that are watching,

00:39:52.916 --> 00:39:54.328
if you work with students,
and you have things

00:39:54.328 --> 00:39:56.311
that you know work, and you
wanna share those things

00:39:56.311 --> 00:39:59.507
with everybody, then, do it, please do it,

00:39:59.507 --> 00:40:02.674
we want everybody to use Khan Academy,

00:40:03.526 --> 00:40:07.648
use Official SAT Practice,
and, on that note,

00:40:07.648 --> 00:40:10.648
I guess I'll bid you all good night,

00:40:11.814 --> 00:40:15.814
and hope to see you again,
right here next time,

00:40:17.477 --> 00:40:20.307
take care, thanks for
watching, really appreciate it.

00:40:20.307 --> 00:40:21.140
Bye.
