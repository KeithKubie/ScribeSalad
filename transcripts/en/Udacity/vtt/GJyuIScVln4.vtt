00:00:00.715 --> 00:00:04.460
Okay, let's take a look at the answer. If we use our genetic code, we see that

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.210
the first codon is TAC. So I'm going to look here, UAC, and

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.870
that's tyrosine, which we symbolize with Y. Then I'm let's take the next one,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:25.570
CTG, CUG, which would be leucine or L. And then I am going to take the last one,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.560
which is GGG. And look for GGG glycine, which is symbolized with the G. So

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.240
the answer is YLG. Now, what I hope none of you got tricked by is the fact that

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.780
I gave you the DNA sequence not the RNA sequence. This is a coding region of

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.700
DNA that will eventually be transcribed into the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.120
mRNA, that at these same positions will say UAC

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.060
CUG GGG and so on, and we'll

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.300
have these three codons. But remember, when the coding region is copied into

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.349
the RNA intermediate, the mRNA, the thymines, or

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:10.360
Ts, are replaced by U's. And that's why our genetic code uses U's, is

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.270
because technically, the code that's being translated is not the DNA but the RNA

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.295
that's being turned into protein. The RNA is the

00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:22.220
intermediate, and the DNA is where that RNA came from.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.050
So, although I give you the original DNA sequence,

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.130
you should be able to figure out the protein by

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.026
simply replacing the thymines with uracils, or T's with

00:01:30.026 --> 00:01:34.820
U's. And then reading the codons in that format, translating

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.750
it from the genetic code into the protein sequence

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.300
that you would get right here. So, in this case,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.240
in the ABO gene, from position 793 to position 801

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.820
of the genetic code, the coding region of the gene, we

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.610
would get three amino acids from three codons, totaling nine

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.100
nucleotides, tyrosine or Y, L for leucene, and G for glycine.
