00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.290
You know what happens when you hold your pee?

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.390
Urine trouble!

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.100
Who is writing these?!

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.369
Hey pee-pees, Jules here for DNews.

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:14.539
We’ve all been there.

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.920
You’ve had too much to drink in too short
a time, your bladder feels like it's about

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.390
to burst but… oh no!

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.570
You’re DJing your cousin’s quinceanera
and they just requested the Cha Cha, so you

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.369
can’t go anywhere for a while!

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.090
You’re just gonna have to hold it.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.710
Maybe you’ll do a little pee dance like
you’re Pelvis Presley, or try to distract

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.260
yourself, but ultimately, you have to pee.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.750
So, just how bad is that for you?

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.840
Should you wait it out to avoid embarrassment?

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.950
Or should you bail on your prima’s 15th
birthday to relieve yourself?

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.550
Well, it really depends, unless you’re literally
wearing Depends and then it doesn’t matter.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.870
The average adult pees about four to seven
times a day, because the average adult bladder

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.030
can really only hold about sixteen ounces
worth of liquid before feeling the urge to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.030
purge.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.390
At night, your bladder can hold up to twice
that before signaling that you have to pee,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.150
which is why waking up to pee like a racehorse
is a pretty common experience.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.140
But every body is different, and the amount
of bladder fullness necessary to feel the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.640
pee reflect changes based on how hydrated
you are, the actual size of your bladder,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.960
and most importantly, your bladder sensitivity.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.060
See, when your bladder fills up, stretch receptors
along your bladder walls send a signal through

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.110
your spinal cord up into your brain.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.600
In response, your brain sends back a “reflex”
signal, telling the detrusor muscle in your

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.580
bladder to contract, which squeezes your bladder
and creates an even stronger stretch reflex.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.310
This feedback loop is what makes you have
to pee.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.620
Your internal bladder sphincter, which is
a muscle that is normally tightened against

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.130
the intersection of your urethra and bladder,
opens up and is ready to let loose.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.920
But hold on a second, if that’s all there
was to it, we’d have no control over our

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.920
urination.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.549
Luckily, there’s something in the way.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.490
The external sphincter, which is the last
line of defense against pee pants.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.229
As long as our external sphincter, also called
the “distal sphincter” is healthy and

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.470
functional, you can technically hold your
pee forever.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.470
But you won’t.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.730
See, holding your pee in is kind of like an
unstoppable force going against an immovable

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.730
object.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.640
Either your external sphincter or your detrusor
muscle are going to win the fight, and spoiler

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.299
alert: unless you’ve had bladder cancer,
or bladder surgery, or if you’ve had a Radical

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.900
Cystectomy with an Orthotopic Neobladder,
which is when doctors remove your bladder

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.920
and replace it with a new one made out of
your small intestines… if none of those

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.840
things apply to you, then your detrusor muscle
is going to win.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.599
You’re gonna pee alllll over yourself.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.959
Otherwise, if your bladder is structurally
weak, it can rupture against the seal of your

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.430
external sphincter, filling your abdomen with
urine that will have to be cathetered out.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.579
So if you’ve got a healthy bladder then
nothing to worry about except peeing yourself,

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:38.579
right?

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:39.579
Wrong.

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.030
What you should be worried about are urinary
tract infections.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.069
See, instead of thinking of your bladder like
a five star hotel swimming lounge, it’s

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.969
kind of more like a dirty pond.

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.049
The longer you let the pond stagnate, the
more likely it is to build up bacteria, which

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.470
can result in a urinary tract infection.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.000
That’s almost certainly E. coli.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.620
And besides being an infection down there,
which is already unpleasant, it can also cause

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.459
you to feel like you have to pee when your
bladder is empty!

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.650
So, in a way, if you keep holding your pee,
you’ll end up feeling like you have to pee

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.360
FOREVER!!!

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.090
The other side effect of regularly holding
in your pee is called “urinary retention”

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.989
which is when your detrusor muscle is unable
to fully evacuate the bladder.

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.309
So every time you pee, you don’t get it
all out.

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:24.190
Here’s the point: holding your pee is natural,
and we do it pretty much every single night.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.879
In any single case, for a healthy adult, holding
your pee isn’t too big of a deal, and in

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.609
the worst case scenario, you’ll probably
just pee yourself.

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.959
But if you already have bladder issues, or
if you regularly refuse to pee when your body

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.860
demands it, then you’re very much at risk
of developing a UTI, or another inconvenient

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.129
medical problem.

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.469
You could even burst your bladder in some
cases.

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:47.079
So, do yourself a favor, pee freely and don’t
get pissed off.

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.239
Remember: peeing is #1.

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.439
And while you’re chilling, think of all
the time you’ve wasted not working on your

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.299
beach bod.

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.480
