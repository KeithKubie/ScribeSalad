00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
One year ago today I uploaded a video to YouTube about the difference between the UK, Great Britain and England.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
At the time of the upload I've been living in London for about 8 years. And, while, I understood the basics of this foreign land...

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I still had questions niggling at the back of my mind about all the other little pieces.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Such as the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey. Who weren't exactly part of the UK, but were still somehow british.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
One day while buying cream for my wife's coffee, I was confronted with this: 'Jersey Cows'.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And could no longer contain my irritation of my own ignorance. 'What are you Jersey Cows?' I wondered.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And why is the Union Jack on here if you're not part of the UK?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I went home to sort this out for once and all and, what I expected would take ten minutes...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But, as so often is the case when your starting point is the Wikipedia,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Ended up becoming a research project involving dozens of hours

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
To not feel like I completely wasted my time, I turned it into the video I eventually uploaded to YouTube. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I asked some locals what they thought and soon was attacked by the monster of viral videos.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Fast-forward to today and I now find myself in the odd position of being a socially reclusive guy...

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Followed by a 100,000+ people, whose videos have been seen more than 10 million times.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Which is more than a bit overwhelming if I think about it too much.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But I want to say a huge 'Thank you' to each and every one of you.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Not personally of course as reading 100,000+ names at 1 second each would take about 28 hours.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But a general thank you - thank you so much for subscribing, watching and sharing my videos.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I also want to thank some YouTubers who've helped me along the way...

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Including MinutePhysics, the VlogBrothers, Phil DeFranco - who, in a single week tripled my subscribers.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And in particular I want to thank Michael from VSauce, who was nice enough to meet up with me...

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
...in the physical world at the London Googleplex, which, getting to see the inside of made me feel 20% cooler,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
...where he encouraged me to make videos on a more regular schedule.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You, dear viewer, may know 1 or more of these guys but please subscribe to them all and encourage YouTube cross-pollination.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I don't know exactly where this channel is going to go in the future, but its been an interesting ride so far.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And, if you stay with me, I sincerely hope to keep making more stuff that you'll like.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Thanks again to all 100,000 of you!
