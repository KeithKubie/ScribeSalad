00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.005
Voiceover: Here are some
option quotes from CNBC.com

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.394
and my goal here is to
really just familiarize you

00:00:06.394 --> 00:00:08.879
with the quote, so you know
what you're looking at.

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:11.085
So the first thing to
realize is that options are

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:13.250
categorized by expiration dates.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.970
So these options that
I've listed right here

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.368
are expiring in April 2011
and options expire or they

00:00:21.368 --> 00:00:25.544
usually expire on the
third Friday of any month

00:00:25.544 --> 00:00:29.010
or I guess to be exact, the
third Friday of the month

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.093
is the last day that you could trade them.

00:00:31.093 --> 00:00:33.993
They officially expire
the Saturday after that.

00:00:33.993 --> 00:00:37.460
And these are options on
GE, the last stock quote.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.390
It last traded at $18.95 and the way

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.267
that that's listed on CNBC.com,
and it tends to be listed

00:00:44.267 --> 00:00:47.535
this way pretty much anywhere
that you look at option quotes,

00:00:47.535 --> 00:00:50.793
is that they list the calls
on one side and then the puts

00:00:50.793 --> 00:00:53.921
on the other side and these
are obviously calls and puts on

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:56.516
General Electric and then
they write the strike prices

00:00:56.516 --> 00:00:59.052
down the middle in increasing order.

00:00:59.052 --> 00:01:03.333
So the first column, this is just the
symbol for that particular option.

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:07.018
This is the last trading price. This
is how much it's changed that day.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.361
The low and the high
give the range of trading

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.878
that day on that option.

00:01:10.878 --> 00:01:14.483
Volume tells us how many
options actually traded that day

00:01:14.483 --> 00:01:17.533
and open interest, which is
something that you're probably

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.918
not familiar with if you've
only looked at stock quotes,

00:01:19.918 --> 00:01:24.948
tells us how many actual, open
options contracts of that type

00:01:24.948 --> 00:01:28.168
are actually in existence. So
if you look right over here,

00:01:28.168 --> 00:01:33.494
this tells us that there are
399 open con ... open call

00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:40.742
options with a $14 stock ...
strike price at an April 2011

00:01:40.742 --> 00:01:43.850
expiration on General Electric.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.137
And it tells us that none
of those 399 open options

00:01:47.137 --> 00:01:48.733
actually traded that day.

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:54.527
If any of these 399 options get
exercised, then it'll go down to 398.

00:01:54.527 --> 00:01:58.694
If someone writes a new option,
then it'll go up to 400.

00:01:58.694 --> 00:02:01.026
And the way it's listed here
is that the "in the money"

00:02:01.026 --> 00:02:04.361
options are listed in this
light blue color and that the

00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:06.880
"out of the money" options
don't get the light blue color.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.320
And so you can see the "in the
money" call options are the ones

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.586
that have the strike price
below ... below today's

00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:19.603
current strike price. Because
if you had a call option for $17

00:02:19.603 --> 00:02:23.185
that gives you the right to buy GE for $17

00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:26.203
and if you exercise it
today, you'd buy it at $17

00:02:26.203 --> 00:02:29.535
and you could immediately
sell that stock for $18.95.

00:02:29.535 --> 00:02:33.178
So you would immediately
make $1.95 profit.

00:02:33.178 --> 00:02:36.011
And you could see right here
that the stock is or the

00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:38.804
option I should say, is actually
trading a little bit above that

00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:40.613
and that's because it has the optionality.

00:02:40.613 --> 00:02:43.469
You can definitely make $1.95 on it,

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:44.947
but you might want to keep it around

00:02:44.947 --> 00:02:47.613
because you can potentially
get the upside on GE

00:02:47.613 --> 00:02:51.730
stock, up to the third Friday
of April 2011 while having a

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.794
limited downside. The most you
could lose here is the price

00:02:54.794 --> 00:02:56.901
that you paid for your option.

00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:00.258
And then you can see the put
options that are in the money,

00:03:00.258 --> 00:03:04.206
are the ones that have a strike price
above the current trading price.

00:03:04.224 --> 00:03:08.724
If I had a $20 ... If I had a
put option with a $20 strike

00:03:08.724 --> 00:03:11.783
or a $20 exercise price, that
means that I could go out

00:03:11.783 --> 00:03:16.283
in the market today,
buy the stock for $18.95

00:03:16.283 --> 00:03:19.663
and then immediately sell it for $20.

00:03:19.663 --> 00:03:22.046
So I would make an immediate $1.05 profit

00:03:22.046 --> 00:03:24.330
and you could see here
that the option is trading

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.033
for a little bit more than $1.05
because of the optionality.
