00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:01.768
So get this--

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.371
Belinda is saying she has
fibromyalgia yet again,

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:08.071
which means that
I have to cover
the Houston conference.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.540
That is
so awesome, babe.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.700
(Amy Schumer)
It can happen anytime.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.200
Oh, my God.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.713
You're not even
listening to me.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.140
Now, help is
at your fingertips.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.780
Hello?

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.720
ListenAlert,
this is Katie. Just stay calm
and tell me your story.

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:23.090
Oh, thank God. Okay, so I talked to HR
and apparently,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.327
I have to go to Houston
and I wanted to fly JetBlue,

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.930
but they're making me
go on Southwest.

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:35.035
Here at ListenAlert, our trained
operators are standing by,

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.204
waiting to respond
to your calls,

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:38.739
to hear how things turned out.

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.141
We're prepared
with such phrases as,

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.776
"Are you kidding me?"

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:43.977
Or, "Uh-huh."

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.646
Or, "She's the worst.

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:48.081
Sounds like you handled that
perfectly."

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:49.783
Technically, I haven't
lost any weight yet,

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.251
but I feel lighter.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:52.786
Oh, my God,
you guys.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:53.854
I totally forgot.

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:55.022
I saw Janelle
yesterday.

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:56.957
Oh, my God.
What was she wearing?

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.426
(inhales, then exhales)

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:01.762
ListenAlert, this is Jeff,
tell me everything.

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:03.096
Don't leave out
your feelings.

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:04.798
I'm on my third day
of green juice,

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.768
but since I'm having a salad
tonight, I think it's okay.

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:09.703
You should have
a podcast.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.572
ListenAlert is not just
for women.

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:14.975
So when I started high school,
I was 5'10", 150 pounds,

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.744
then in my junior year,
I shot up to like 6'2",
buck-ninety.

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:19.613
But what size shoe
did you wear?

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:20.681
Well, that's the thing.

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.182
Like I had always
had size 13s,

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:24.117
so I was just kind
of waiting to grow.

00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:25.819
In the cases
of longer stories,

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.755
we'll even dispatch our agents
right to you.

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:31.992
So there is another clutch
that was 50% off,

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.995
but it was
a little smaller, like...

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.864
Is it more like
a wristlet?

00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:38.732
I'm having trouble
picturing the size.

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:39.900
Help is on the way.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.202
(phone beeps)

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.304
Were they buy one, get one
or buy one, get one 50% off?

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:46.940
It was 50% off, but it was
only in one color.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.475
Which color?
Red.

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:49.977
That's a tough one.

00:01:50.077 --> 00:01:54.715
All this is covered by a low,
low price of $100,000 a month.

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:56.416
So it was like
my grandma's house,

00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:57.618
but at the same time,

00:01:57.718 --> 00:01:59.453
it was not totally
my grandma's house, like--

00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:00.654
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!

00:02:02.022 --> 00:02:03.223
We are not saints.

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:04.358
