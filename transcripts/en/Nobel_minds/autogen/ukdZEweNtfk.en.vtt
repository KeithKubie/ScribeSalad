then I realized that was a lot of work
and I studied engineering because it was

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750
and I studied engineering because it was
 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.520

the easiest option and the easiest way

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530
the easiest option and the easiest way
 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.710

that had to be developed and now

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:25.730
that had to be developed and now
 

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:29.990
that had to be developed and now
everybody has babies but that was a new

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000
everybody has babies but that was a new
 

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.799
everybody has babies but that was a new
phenomenon and we had to go through the

00:21:33.799 --> 00:21:33.809
phenomenon and we had to go through the
 

00:21:33.809 --> 00:21:37.820
phenomenon and we had to go through the
process of how do we support women so

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:37.830
process of how do we support women so
 

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.639
process of how do we support women so
that they can succeed and can have all

00:21:40.639 --> 00:21:40.649
that they can succeed and can have all
 

00:21:40.649 --> 00:21:50.240
that they can succeed and can have all
the other things that everyone wants my

the other things that everyone wants my
favorite advice for young women who want

00:21:53.389 --> 00:21:53.399
favorite advice for young women who want
 

00:21:53.399 --> 00:21:56.539
favorite advice for young women who want
to do science and engineering is by all

00:21:56.539 --> 00:21:56.549
to do science and engineering is by all
 

00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:59.330
to do science and engineering is by all
means do it even if you don't want to do

00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340
means do it even if you don't want to do
 

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.130
means do it even if you don't want to do
it don't leave it for the men because

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.140
it don't leave it for the men because
 

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.519
it don't leave it for the men because
it's so much fun it's fun it's important

00:22:04.519 --> 00:22:04.529
it's so much fun it's fun it's important
 

00:22:04.529 --> 00:22:07.010
it's so much fun it's fun it's important
it's really thrilling to use your

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:07.020
it's really thrilling to use your
 

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.100
it's really thrilling to use your
creativity to do useful things for

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:10.110
creativity to do useful things for
 

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:16.990
creativity to do useful things for
people don't leave it for the men

I think everybody needs to know

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:22.950
I think everybody needs to know
 

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.280
I think everybody needs to know
something about science and engineering

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:25.290
something about science and engineering
 

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:27.980
something about science and engineering
maybe they don't go and get a degree in

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:27.990
maybe they don't go and get a degree in
 

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:31.240
maybe they don't go and get a degree in
it but we need a scientifically literate

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:31.250
it but we need a scientifically literate
 

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.549
it but we need a scientifically literate
population sciences and technology it's

00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559
population sciences and technology it's
 

00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:36.340
population sciences and technology it's
a future it's a future of the planet

without science and technology we won't

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:39.030
without science and technology we won't
 

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.480
without science and technology we won't
feed 10 billion people we won't provide

feed 10 billion people we won't provide
 

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.400
feed 10 billion people we won't provide
water or we won't have cities that are

it's science and technology so everybody

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:47.700
it's science and technology so everybody
 

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.060
it's science and technology so everybody
has to do it and most certainly women

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:50.070
has to do it and most certainly women
 

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.659
has to do it and most certainly women
are going to play a huge role in the

00:22:53.659 --> 00:22:53.669
are going to play a huge role in the
 

00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:55.310
are going to play a huge role in the
future of science and technology because

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320
future of science and technology because
 

00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:05.440
future of science and technology because
that's where a 50% of the best minds are

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:05.450
 

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:10.160
the wonderful thing about evolution is

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:10.170
the wonderful thing about evolution is
 

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:13.850
the wonderful thing about evolution is
that here is a design process that works

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:13.860
that here is a design process that works
 

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.610
that here is a design process that works
at all scales from molecules to

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:16.620
at all scales from molecules to
 

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.420
at all scales from molecules to
ecosystems one design algorithm that

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:20.430
ecosystems one design algorithm that
 

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.510
ecosystems one design algorithm that
solved everything in life created

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520
solved everything in life created
 

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.930
solved everything in life created
everything in the living world what I

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:26.940
everything in the living world what I
 

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.210
everything in the living world what I
realized is that we're just at the

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220
realized is that we're just at the
 

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.540
realized is that we're just at the
beginning of using evolution to move

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:32.550
beginning of using evolution to move
 

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.840
beginning of using evolution to move
into the future so what that means is

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:35.850
into the future so what that means is
 

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:39.530
into the future so what that means is
that these processes that we pioneered

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:39.540
that these processes that we pioneered
 

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.570
that these processes that we pioneered
many years ago have started to be used

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:43.580
many years ago have started to be used
 

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.670
many years ago have started to be used
by hundreds of people thousands of

by hundreds of people thousands of
 

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.930
by hundreds of people thousands of
people to do very creative things with

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:50.940
people to do very creative things with
 

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:56.080
people to do very creative things with
real applications so for example

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:56.090
real applications so for example
 

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:58.340
real applications so for example
