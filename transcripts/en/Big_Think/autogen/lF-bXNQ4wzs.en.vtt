if you don't have anything to look up to

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:08.019
if you don't have anything to look up to
 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.060
if you don't have anything to look up to
you don't have anything to do right a

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070
you don't have anything to do right a
 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.130
you don't have anything to do right a
lot of the meaning that people find in

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.140
lot of the meaning that people find in
 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.310
lot of the meaning that people find in
their lives is Purpose Driven and in

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320
their lives is Purpose Driven and in
 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.529
their lives is Purpose Driven and in
order to put effort into something to

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539
order to put effort into something to
 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.630
order to put effort into something to
work towards something you have to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640
work towards something you have to
 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.540
work towards something you have to
assume axiomatically that what you're

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550
assume axiomatically that what you're
 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.890
assume axiomatically that what you're
working towards is better than what you

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900
working towards is better than what you
 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.929
working towards is better than what you
have because why else would you do it

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939
have because why else would you do it
 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.569
have because why else would you do it
and there's a relationship like if it's

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579
and there's a relationship like if it's
 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.130
and there's a relationship like if it's
way better than what you have it's

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140
way better than what you have it's
 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.959
way better than what you have it's
obviously proportionally difficult so

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969
obviously proportionally difficult so
 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.380
obviously proportionally difficult so
you try to balance difficulty with with

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390
you try to balance difficulty with with
 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.420
you try to balance difficulty with with
positivity let's say something like that

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430
positivity let's say something like that
 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.130
positivity let's say something like that
but you're always aiming up if you're

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140
but you're always aiming up if you're
 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.619
but you're always aiming up if you're
aiming and if you're not aiming then you

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629
aiming and if you're not aiming then you
 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.240
aiming and if you're not aiming then you
don't really have any purpose and that

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250
don't really have any purpose and that
 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.160
don't really have any purpose and that
deprives your life of meaning that's not

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170
deprives your life of meaning that's not
 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.380
deprives your life of meaning that's not
good because if your life is deprived of

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390
good because if your life is deprived of
 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.700
good because if your life is deprived of
meaning then what you're left with is

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710
meaning then what you're left with is
 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.250
meaning then what you're left with is
the suffering it's not neutral right

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260
the suffering it's not neutral right
 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.369
the suffering it's not neutral right
it's negative so now the problem with

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379
it's negative so now the problem with
 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.069
it's negative so now the problem with
having to aim up is that that produces a

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079
having to aim up is that that produces a
 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.459
having to aim up is that that produces a
hierarchy right because if you pause it

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469
hierarchy right because if you pause it
 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.480
hierarchy right because if you pause it
an aim then everyone arrays themselves

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490
an aim then everyone arrays themselves
 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.690
an aim then everyone arrays themselves
along a hierarchy of better at it to

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700
along a hierarchy of better at it to
 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.270
along a hierarchy of better at it to
worse at it right and it doesn't matter

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280
worse at it right and it doesn't matter
 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.200
worse at it right and it doesn't matter
like if you if you create basketball as

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210
like if you if you create basketball as
 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.139
like if you if you create basketball as
a game a hundred years later you create

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149
a game a hundred years later you create
 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.550
a game a hundred years later you create
people who are hyper specialized at

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560
people who are hyper specialized at
 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.200
people who are hyper specialized at
basketball and they're great at it and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210
basketball and they're great at it and
 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.530
basketball and they're great at it and
virtually everyone else is bad so it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540
virtually everyone else is bad so it
 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.149
virtually everyone else is bad so it
doesn't matter as soon as you produce a

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159
doesn't matter as soon as you produce a
 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.310
doesn't matter as soon as you produce a
value value proposition you produce a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320
value value proposition you produce a
 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.139
value value proposition you produce a
hierarchy the problem with the hierarchy

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149
hierarchy the problem with the hierarchy
 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.530
hierarchy the problem with the hierarchy
is it produces inequality the problem

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540
is it produces inequality the problem
 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.730
is it produces inequality the problem
with inequality is it produces

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740
with inequality is it produces
 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.999
with inequality is it produces
resentment right but you can't get rid

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009
resentment right but you can't get rid
 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.530
resentment right but you can't get rid
of the damn hierarchy because they

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540
of the damn hierarchy because they
 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.300
of the damn hierarchy because they
produce inequality and resentment

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310
produce inequality and resentment
 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.410
produce inequality and resentment
because then you don't have anywhere to

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420
because then you don't have anywhere to
 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.219
because then you don't have anywhere to
go so that's not an answer ok so let's

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229
go so that's not an answer ok so let's
 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.620
go so that's not an answer ok so let's
say you're trying to deal with the fact

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630
say you're trying to deal with the fact
 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.359
say you're trying to deal with the fact
that you have to put up with a hierarchy

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369
that you have to put up with a hierarchy
 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.249
that you have to put up with a hierarchy
if you're gonna have any values how do

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259
if you're gonna have any values how do
 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.620
if you're gonna have any values how do
you escape from the resentment trap an

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630
you escape from the resentment trap an
 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.139
you escape from the resentment trap an
answer is you do an intelligent

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149
answer is you do an intelligent
 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.179
answer is you do an intelligent
multi-dimensional analysis of your life

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189
multi-dimensional analysis of your life
 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.849
multi-dimensional analysis of your life
it's like by the time you're 30 I would

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859
it's like by the time you're 30 I would
 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.999
it's like by the time you're 30 I would
say you're a pretty singular person you

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009
say you're a pretty singular person you
 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.580
say you're a pretty singular person you
know your your your unique in particular

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590
know your your your unique in particular
 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.280
know your your your unique in particular
and your life has multiple dimensions

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290
and your life has multiple dimensions
 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.559
and your life has multiple dimensions
and you're more or less successful or

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569
and you're more or less successful or
 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.420
and you're more or less successful or
not along many of those demands

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430
not along many of those demands
 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.119
not along many of those demands
but it's completely ridiculous game to

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129
but it's completely ridiculous game to
 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.520
but it's completely ridiculous game to
pick someone else arbitrarily who's

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530
pick someone else arbitrarily who's
 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.039
pick someone else arbitrarily who's
doing much better than you on one of

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049
doing much better than you on one of
 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.530
doing much better than you on one of
those dimensions to assume that you're a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540
those dimensions to assume that you're a
 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.030
those dimensions to assume that you're a
failure because of that or that the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040
failure because of that or that the
 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.100
failure because of that or that the
world is unfair because of that without

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110
world is unfair because of that without
 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.920
world is unfair because of that without
knowing in full detail all of the rest

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930
knowing in full detail all of the rest
 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.360
knowing in full detail all of the rest
of the elements of their lives

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370
of the elements of their lives
 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.850
of the elements of their lives
I mean look we're absolutely awash in

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860
I mean look we're absolutely awash in
 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.369
I mean look we're absolutely awash in
stories of unhappy celebrities you know

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379
stories of unhappy celebrities you know
 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.670
stories of unhappy celebrities you know
in admired in interminable divorces or

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680
in admired in interminable divorces or

in in Affairs or in addictions or and
that's par for the course it's not

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920
that's par for the course it's not
 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.089
that's par for the course it's not
helpful it's helpful to have a goal it's

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099
helpful it's helpful to have a goal it's
 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.360
helpful it's helpful to have a goal it's
necessary to have a hierarchy it's not

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370
necessary to have a hierarchy it's not
 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.550
necessary to have a hierarchy it's not
particularly useful to compare yourself

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560
particularly useful to compare yourself
 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.420
particularly useful to compare yourself
to other people

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430
to other people
 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.759
to other people
but it is useful to compare yourself to

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769
but it is useful to compare yourself to
 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.369
but it is useful to compare yourself to
yourself that's the right baseline right

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379
yourself that's the right baseline right
 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.080
yourself that's the right baseline right
that stakes everything is else into

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090
that stakes everything is else into
 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.930
that stakes everything is else into
account and and it's really practically

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940
account and and it's really practically
 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.940
account and and it's really practically
useful and I've done this in my clinical

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950
useful and I've done this in my clinical
 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.500
useful and I've done this in my clinical
practice very frequently it's like okay

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510
practice very frequently it's like okay
 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.110
practice very frequently it's like okay
let's take stock of where you are okay

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120
let's take stock of where you are okay
 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.360
let's take stock of where you are okay
and then let's let's hypothesize about

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370
and then let's let's hypothesize about
 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.860
and then let's let's hypothesize about
where you would like to be it's a

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870
where you would like to be it's a
 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.449
where you would like to be it's a
complex conversation right because we

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459
complex conversation right because we
 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.339
complex conversation right because we
want to figure out what's not so good

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349
want to figure out what's not so good
 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.080
want to figure out what's not so good
about your present situation exactly

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090
about your present situation exactly
 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.690
about your present situation exactly
precisely and then come up with a

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700
precisely and then come up with a
 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.670
precisely and then come up with a
hypothesis about what your life would

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680
hypothesis about what your life would
 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.220
hypothesis about what your life would
look like if it was better and then we

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230
look like if it was better and then we
 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.500
look like if it was better and then we
can work on incremental improvement and

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510
can work on incremental improvement and
 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.500
can work on incremental improvement and
the idea would be there's some step you

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510
the idea would be there's some step you
 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.680
the idea would be there's some step you
could take that you would take that

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690
could take that you would take that
 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.979
could take that you would take that
would make today or tomorrow

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989
would make today or tomorrow
 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.710
would make today or tomorrow
fractionally better than yesterday right

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720
fractionally better than yesterday right
 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.869
fractionally better than yesterday right
and then you can iterate that and that's

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879
and then you can iterate that and that's
 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.970
and then you can iterate that and that's
actually unbelievably powerful you you

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980
actually unbelievably powerful you you
 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.610
actually unbelievably powerful you you
hit the effect of compounding interest

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620
hit the effect of compounding interest
 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.710
hit the effect of compounding interest
let's say very very rapidly if you do

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720
let's say very very rapidly if you do
 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.240
let's say very very rapidly if you do
that yeah well so there's real utility

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250
that yeah well so there's real utility
 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.939
that yeah well so there's real utility
and incremental progress and you don't

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949
and incremental progress and you don't
 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:58.589
and incremental progress and you don't
have to improve your life much in

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599
have to improve your life much in
 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.960
have to improve your life much in
increments to start hitting the effect

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970
increments to start hitting the effect
 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.849
increments to start hitting the effect
of compounding interest you know you

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859
of compounding interest you know you
 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.449
of compounding interest you know you
make one thing slightly better and that

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459
make one thing slightly better and that
 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.559
make one thing slightly better and that
increases the probability that you'll

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569
increases the probability that you'll
 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.360
increases the probability that you'll
make the next thing slightly better as

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370
make the next thing slightly better as
 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.520
make the next thing slightly better as
well as having its positive side effects

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530
well as having its positive side effects
 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.039
well as having its positive side effects
and so if you even if you make small

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049
and so if you even if you make small
 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.569
and so if you even if you make small
steps forward and you do that regularly

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579
steps forward and you do that regularly
 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.120
steps forward and you do that regularly
that can turn your life around very

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130
that can turn your life around very
 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.039
that can turn your life around very
rapidly over like a one to two year

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049
rapidly over like a one to two year
 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.020
rapidly over like a one to two year
period I mean that's a long time one to

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030
period I mean that's a long time one to
 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.029
period I mean that's a long time one to
two years but it's not a lifetime and it

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039
two years but it's not a lifetime and it
 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.290
two years but it's not a lifetime and it
certainly beats the hell out of going

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300
certainly beats the hell out of going
 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.140
certainly beats the hell out of going
downhill precipitously which tends to be

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150
downhill precipitously which tends to be
 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.189
downhill precipitously which tends to be
the alternative

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199
the alternative
 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.580
the alternative
so it's better and it keeps you out of

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590
so it's better and it keeps you out of
 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.589
so it's better and it keeps you out of
the resentment you know it's also more

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599
the resentment you know it's also more
 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.459
the resentment you know it's also more
realistic because it's not like it's not

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:38.469
realistic because it's not like it's not
 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:40.260
realistic because it's not like it's not
like everyone else doesn't have their

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270
like everyone else doesn't have their
 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.839
like everyone else doesn't have their
problems you know we have these

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849
problems you know we have these
 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.350
problems you know we have these
fictitious successful people that that

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360
fictitious successful people that that
 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.379
fictitious successful people that that
it's easy for us to compare ourselves to

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389
it's easy for us to compare ourselves to
 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.909
it's easy for us to compare ourselves to
detrimental II and to become jealous and

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919
detrimental II and to become jealous and
 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.320
detrimental II and to become jealous and
bitter about that but also to be very

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330
bitter about that but also to be very
 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.850
bitter about that but also to be very
hard on ourselves because we're not

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860
hard on ourselves because we're not
 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.929
hard on ourselves because we're not
successful it's like if you talk to

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:56.939
successful it's like if you talk to
 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.820
successful it's like if you talk to
successful people let's say and I'm not

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830
successful people let's say and I'm not
 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.350

trying to say that there's no such thing
 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.790
trying to say that there's no such thing
as genuine accomplishment because

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800
as genuine accomplishment because
 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.579
as genuine accomplishment because
obviously there is but people even
