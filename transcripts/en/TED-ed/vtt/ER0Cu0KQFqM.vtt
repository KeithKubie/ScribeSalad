00:00:07.312 --> 00:00:10.691
A lone priestess walks towards
an underground chamber.

00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:14.232
People line the streets to watch
as she proclaims her innocence.

00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:15.472
It doesn't matter.

00:00:15.472 --> 00:00:17.922
She's already been judged
and found guilty.

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:18.949
The sentence?

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.552
Live burial.

00:00:20.552 --> 00:00:25.052
The underground chamber contains
a portion of bread, water, milk, and oil.

00:00:25.052 --> 00:00:27.662
She will have a lamp, a bed,
and a blanket,

00:00:27.662 --> 00:00:30.142
but she won't emerge alive.

00:00:30.142 --> 00:00:32.542
At the threshold, the priestess pauses,

00:00:32.542 --> 00:00:35.172
claims her innocence one last time,

00:00:35.172 --> 00:00:39.351
then enters the chamber never
to be seen again by the Roman people.

00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:42.843
The priestess is one 
of Rome's six Vestal Virgins,

00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:48.342
each carefully selected as children
from Rome's most aristocratic families.

00:00:48.342 --> 00:00:51.203
But now with her death,
there are only five,

00:00:51.203 --> 00:00:53.863
and a new priestess must be chosen.

00:00:53.863 --> 00:00:56.904
The six-year-old Licinia witnessed
the spectacle,

00:00:56.904 --> 00:01:02.143
never suspecting that a few days later,
she'd be chosen as the next Vestal Virgin.

00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:04.623
Her age, her patrician family lineage,

00:01:04.623 --> 00:01:06.403
and her apparent good health

00:01:06.403 --> 00:01:11.245
makes her the best candidate to serve the
goddess Vesta in the eyes of the Romans.

00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:14.304
Her parents are proud that their
daughter's been chosen.

00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:18.203
Licinia is afraid,
but she has no choice in the matter.

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:22.183
She must serve the goddess
for at least the next 30 years.

00:01:22.183 --> 00:01:24.953
For the first ten years 
of Licinia's service,

00:01:24.953 --> 00:01:29.704
she's considered in training,
learning how to be a Vestal Virgin.

00:01:29.704 --> 00:01:33.365
Her most important duty is keeping vigil
over the flame of Vesta,

00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:35.716
the virgin goddess of the hearth.

00:01:35.716 --> 00:01:39.595
Vesta doesn't have a statue
like other Roman gods and goddesses.

00:01:39.595 --> 00:01:44.765
Instead, she's represented by the flame
which burns day and night in her temple

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:48.269
located next to the Forum in the center
of the city.

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:52.455
Like all Vestal priestesses, Licinia
spends part of each day on shift,

00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:55.165
watching and tending to the flame.

00:01:55.165 --> 00:01:57.071
The flame represents two things.

00:01:57.071 --> 00:02:01.286
The first is the continuation of Rome
as a power in the world.

00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:05.316
The Romans believed that if the flame
goes out, the city's in danger.

00:02:05.316 --> 00:02:10.434
The flame also symbolizes the continuing
virginity of Vesta's priestesses.

00:02:10.434 --> 00:02:14.866
For the Romans, a Vestal's virginity
signaled not only her castitas,

00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:17.156
or modest spirit and body,

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:19.616
but also her ritual purity.

00:02:19.616 --> 00:02:22.848
So Licinia knows she must never
let the flame go out.

00:02:22.848 --> 00:02:23.785
Her life,

00:02:23.785 --> 00:02:25.605
the lives of her fellow Vestals,

00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:29.288
and the safety of Rome itself 
depends upon it.

00:02:29.288 --> 00:02:33.288
Licinia learns to collect water each day
from a nearby fountain

00:02:33.288 --> 00:02:35.187
to cleanse the temple.

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:38.708
She learns the Fasti, the calendar
of sacred rituals

00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:43.298
and she watches while the senior
priestesses conduct sacrifices.

00:02:43.298 --> 00:02:45.567
By the time Licinia 
completes her training,

00:02:45.567 --> 00:02:47.857
she's 16 years old.

00:02:47.857 --> 00:02:50.327
Licinia understands that 
the way she must act

00:02:50.327 --> 00:02:53.207
is a reflection of the goddess she serves.

00:02:53.207 --> 00:02:57.498
When it's her turn to collect the water,
she keeps her eyes lowered to the ground.

00:02:57.498 --> 00:03:02.457
When she performs sacrifices,
she focuses intently on the task.

00:03:02.457 --> 00:03:06.518
Licinia directs her energy towards
being the best priestess she can be.

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:10.756
She's worried that someday the state
will claim her life for its own purposes

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:13.108
to protect itself from danger.

00:03:13.108 --> 00:03:16.567
Licinia could be accused of incestum,
meaning unchastity,

00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:21.238
at any time and be sacrificed whether
she's innocent or guilty.

00:03:21.238 --> 00:03:26.970
Licinia fully understands now why her
predecessor was buried alive.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.350
Ten years ago, 
the flame of Vesta went out.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.090
The priestesses knew that they couldn't
keep it a secret.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.761
The future of Rome depended upon it.

00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:38.631
They went to the chief priest
and he opened an investigation

00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:41.179
to discover why the flame had failed.

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.229
Someone came forward and claimed
that one of the Vestals

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.120
was no longer a virgin.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.818
That was the beginning of the end.

00:03:47.818 --> 00:03:51.579
The accused protested her innocence,
but it wasn't enough.

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.380
She was tried and found guilty.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.090
That Vestal's death was meant
to protect the city,

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.809
but Licinia weeps for what has been lost
and for what she knows now.

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:06.152
Her own path was paved by the death
of another,

00:04:06.152 --> 00:04:08.501
and her life could be taken just as easily

00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:11.589
for something as simple 
as a flame going out.
