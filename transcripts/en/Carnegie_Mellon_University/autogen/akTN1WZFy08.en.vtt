00:16:06.169 --> 00:16:06.179
experimental idea that was really at the
 

00:16:06.179 --> 00:16:07.819
experimental idea that was really at the
fringe of the global electricity

00:16:07.819 --> 00:16:07.829
fringe of the global electricity
 

00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:09.829
fringe of the global electricity
industry to something that people

00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839
industry to something that people
 

00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:11.899
industry to something that people
consider to be one of the big solutions

00:16:11.899 --> 00:16:11.909
consider to be one of the big solutions
 

00:16:11.909 --> 00:16:13.549
consider to be one of the big solutions
going forward for the grid and it's been

00:16:13.549 --> 00:16:13.559
going forward for the grid and it's been
 

00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:20.370
going forward for the grid and it's been
incredible to watch and be a part of

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:20.380
 
 

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:24.610
 
yeah so 10 years ago roughly I started

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:24.620
yeah so 10 years ago roughly I started
 

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.810
yeah so 10 years ago roughly I started
graduate school and I came to Stanford

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:27.820
graduate school and I came to Stanford
 

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.660
graduate school and I came to Stanford
and I think one useful thing that

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:31.670
and I think one useful thing that
 

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.480
and I think one useful thing that
happened was I did my undergrad at IIT

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:34.490
happened was I did my undergrad at IIT
 

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.060
happened was I did my undergrad at IIT
which is a place of perfect competition

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:36.070
which is a place of perfect competition
 

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.850
which is a place of perfect competition
and so one amazing thing that happened

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:39.860
and so one amazing thing that happened
 

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.319
and so one amazing thing that happened
was most of my friends close friends

00:16:41.319 --> 00:16:41.329
was most of my friends close friends
 

00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:43.870
was most of my friends close friends
ended up on the East Coast and so I was

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880
ended up on the East Coast and so I was
 

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.160
ended up on the East Coast and so I was
sort of the loner there on the west

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:45.170
sort of the loner there on the west
 

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.199
sort of the loner there on the west
coast and that fundamentally changed my

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:47.209
coast and that fundamentally changed my
 

00:16:47.209 --> 00:16:51.490
coast and that fundamentally changed my
thinking at least in terms of decoupling

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:51.500
thinking at least in terms of decoupling
 

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.490
thinking at least in terms of decoupling
difficulty of problem and importance of

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:54.500
difficulty of problem and importance of
 

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.819
difficulty of problem and importance of
problem and I think that sort of is my

00:16:57.819 --> 00:16:57.829
problem and I think that sort of is my
 

00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:59.590
problem and I think that sort of is my
journey into becoming an accidental

00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600
journey into becoming an accidental
 

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.069
journey into becoming an accidental
electric chemist so I started my

00:17:03.069 --> 00:17:03.079
electric chemist so I started my
 

00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:04.299
electric chemist so I started my
graduate school and wanted to work on

00:17:04.299 --> 00:17:04.309
graduate school and wanted to work on
 

00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:07.059
graduate school and wanted to work on
fluid mechanics which is if you're if

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:07.069
fluid mechanics which is if you're if
 

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:09.010
fluid mechanics which is if you're if
you did mechanical engineering as an

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:09.020
you did mechanical engineering as an
 

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.809
you did mechanical engineering as an
undergrad that's probably one of the

00:17:10.809 --> 00:17:10.819
undergrad that's probably one of the
 

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:12.819
undergrad that's probably one of the
topics that you would think is hard

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:12.829
topics that you would think is hard
 

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.640
topics that you would think is hard
I came in to graduate school in the

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:15.650
I came in to graduate school in the
 

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.480
I came in to graduate school in the
division of computational fluid dynamics

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:18.490
division of computational fluid dynamics
 

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.829
division of computational fluid dynamics
quickly realized there are not many

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:20.839
quickly realized there are not many
 

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.150
quickly realized there are not many
important things to be done in that

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160
important things to be done in that
 

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.640
important things to be done in that
field and then the second accident that

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:24.650
field and then the second accident that
 

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.169
field and then the second accident that
happened was I did a summer internship

00:17:26.169 --> 00:17:26.179
happened was I did a summer internship
 

00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:29.470
happened was I did a summer internship
at Bosch and they defined a problem in

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.480
at Bosch and they defined a problem in
 

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.760
at Bosch and they defined a problem in
batteries and I done nothing in

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:30.770
batteries and I done nothing in
 

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.039
batteries and I done nothing in
batteries up until that point this is

00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:33.049
batteries up until that point this is
 

00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:35.680
batteries up until that point this is
just a message to many of you that may

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:35.690
just a message to many of you that may
 

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.560
just a message to many of you that may
be thinking about getting into batteries

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:38.570
be thinking about getting into batteries
 

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.620
be thinking about getting into batteries
and I have no background I had no

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:41.630
and I have no background I had no
 

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.230
and I have no background I had no
background eight years ago and I'm here

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240
background eight years ago and I'm here
 

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.350
background eight years ago and I'm here
so so I think that you know everyone can

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360
so so I think that you know everyone can
 

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.169
so so I think that you know everyone can
get there by spending the right amount

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:50.179
get there by spending the right amount
 

00:17:50.179 --> 00:17:55.180
get there by spending the right amount
of time on it so I I switched sort of

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:55.190
of time on it so I I switched sort of
 

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.919
of time on it so I I switched sort of
midway through my PhD to think on

00:17:56.919 --> 00:17:56.929
midway through my PhD to think on
 

00:17:56.929 --> 00:17:59.490
midway through my PhD to think on
lithium ion and and next generation

00:17:59.490 --> 00:17:59.500
lithium ion and and next generation
 

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.970
lithium ion and and next generation
chemistry is related to lithium air and

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:02.980
chemistry is related to lithium air and
 

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.330
chemistry is related to lithium air and
and I I i interviewed here actually as a

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:07.340
and I I i interviewed here actually as a
 

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.419
and I I i interviewed here actually as a
graduate student J was J was in the

00:18:10.419 --> 00:18:10.429
graduate student J was J was in the
 

00:18:10.429 --> 00:18:14.560
graduate student J was J was in the
audience and and he asked the sort of

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:14.570
audience and and he asked the sort of
 

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.440
audience and and he asked the sort of
meanest toughest questions when I was

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:17.450
meanest toughest questions when I was
 

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.960
meanest toughest questions when I was
interviewing the seminars up on YouTube

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:19.970
interviewing the seminars up on YouTube
 

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.530
interviewing the seminars up on YouTube
so there's like proof that that happened

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:22.540
so there's like proof that that happened
 

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.020
so there's like proof that that happened
and so then I started my when I came

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:26.030
and so then I started my when I came
 

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.160
and so then I started my when I came
here after a brief stint

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.170
here after a brief stint
 

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.020
here after a brief stint
at MIT and I I came here started a group

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.030
at MIT and I I came here started a group
 

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.930
at MIT and I I came here started a group
largely thinking about electrification

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:34.940
largely thinking about electrification
 

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.910
largely thinking about electrification
mostly on vehicles and the sort of big

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:37.920
mostly on vehicles and the sort of big
 

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.290
mostly on vehicles and the sort of big
question that we were trying to answer

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:39.300
question that we were trying to answer
 

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.980
question that we were trying to answer
was was how can we design organic

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:42.990
was was how can we design organic
 

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.360
was was how can we design organic
electrolytes I think that was the one

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:44.370
electrolytes I think that was the one
 

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.150
electrolytes I think that was the one
piece that I felt there was a lot of art

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160
piece that I felt there was a lot of art
 

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:47.870
piece that I felt there was a lot of art
to it

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880
to it
 

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.890
to it
and we wanted to try and change that

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:50.900
and we wanted to try and change that
 

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.030
and we wanted to try and change that
process of of thinking about

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:53.040
process of of thinking about
 

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.060
process of of thinking about
electrolytes and so I'm not an organic

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:56.070
electrolytes and so I'm not an organic
 

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.530
electrolytes and so I'm not an organic
chemist so we thought about Big Data

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:57.540
chemist so we thought about Big Data
 

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.020
chemist so we thought about Big Data
along before Big Data was was sort of a

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:00.030
along before Big Data was was sort of a
 

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.660
along before Big Data was was sort of a
huge buzz word but I think you know

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:02.670
huge buzz word but I think you know
 

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:04.340
huge buzz word but I think you know
we've we've made phenomenal progress you

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:04.350
we've we've made phenomenal progress you
 

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.970
we've we've made phenomenal progress you
know I lead a team of about 20 other

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:06.980
know I lead a team of about 20 other
 

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.350

accidental electro chemists and I think

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360
accidental electro chemists and I think
 

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.240
accidental electro chemists and I think
they will all like this but that but I

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:11.250
they will all like this but that but I
 

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.680
they will all like this but that but I
think that's you know it's been

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:12.690
think that's you know it's been
 

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:16.420
think that's you know it's been
phenomenal to have a group of very

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:16.430
phenomenal to have a group of very
 

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.030
phenomenal to have a group of very

it's very difficult to develop a product
and protect your intellectual property

00:22:26.879 --> 00:22:26.889
and protect your intellectual property
 

00:22:26.889 --> 00:22:29.710
and protect your intellectual property
but I would say that most of the

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:29.720
but I would say that most of the
 

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.360
but I would say that most of the
individual pieces of the technology are

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:31.370
individual pieces of the technology are
 

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.750
individual pieces of the technology are
out there and that it's a matter of

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760
out there and that it's a matter of
 

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.769
out there and that it's a matter of
sharing your information and you would

00:22:35.769 --> 00:22:35.779
sharing your information and you would
 

00:22:35.779 --> 00:22:38.889
sharing your information and you would
actually get there that would be high

00:22:38.889 --> 00:22:38.899
actually get there that would be high
 

00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:40.779
actually get there that would be high

way they maybe come to the BIC as well
 

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:05.590
way they maybe come to the BIC as well
and we try to develop their cell as a

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600
and we try to develop their cell as a
 

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.320
and we try to develop their cell as a
collaborative process and test it with a

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:08.330
collaborative process and test it with a
 

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:10.480
collaborative process and test it with a

different competitors I presume though

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:11.720
different competitors I presume though
 

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:16.090
different competitors I presume though
yes it's a careful process but we've

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:16.100
yes it's a careful process but we've
 

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.300
yes it's a careful process but we've
managed we managed and then there's one

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:19.310
managed we managed and then there's one
 

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:20.560
managed we managed and then there's one
of the other things we try to do is if

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:20.570
of the other things we try to do is if
 

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.870
of the other things we try to do is if
there is something that's shared or the

there is something that's shared or the
 

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.020
there is something that's shared or the
opportunity to share we basically have

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:26.030
opportunity to share we basically have
 

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.570

like a black box process you can put

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:28.580
like a black box process you can put
 

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.640
like a black box process you can put
your thing every company can put their

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:30.650
your thing every company can put their
 

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.170
your thing every company can put their
thing into the black box we don't tell

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:32.180
thing into the black box we don't tell
 

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.580
thing into the black box we don't tell
you what it is but we'll show you the

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:33.590
you what it is but we'll show you the
 

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.410
you what it is but we'll show you the
performance results after the fact and

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:35.420
performance results after the fact and
 

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.170
performance results after the fact and
if they're so stunning maybe you'll

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:38.180
if they're so stunning maybe you'll
 

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.430
if they're so stunning maybe you'll
start sharing that information and that

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440
start sharing that information and that
 

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.120
start sharing that information and that
has actually happened in the past but

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:43.130
has actually happened in the past but
 

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.590
has actually happened in the past but
yeah for the most part silicon has been

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:44.600
yeah for the most part silicon has been
 

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.790
yeah for the most part silicon has been
where we've seen a lot of development

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:45.800
where we've seen a lot of development
 

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.740
where we've seen a lot of development
and electrolyte and high voltage

electrolytes okay it's been the big part
 

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:57.700
electrolytes okay it's been the big part
of the work I'd say I like the rest of

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:57.710
of the work I'd say I like the rest of
 

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.800

people complain constantly about how the

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240
people complain constantly about how the
 

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.910
people complain constantly about how the

naive I I sort of asked the question

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:44.430
naive I I sort of asked the question
 

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:45.770

well is anybody taking the big data

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:45.780
well is anybody taking the big data
 

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.690
well is anybody taking the big data
approach and just trying to collect as

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:47.700
approach and just trying to collect as
 

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.060
approach and just trying to collect as
much data as you can and and be

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:50.070
much data as you can and and be
 

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.670
much data as you can and and be
empirical so look at the you know the

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:52.680
empirical so look at the you know the
 

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.900
empirical so look at the you know the
actual performance data of how these

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:53.910
actual performance data of how these
 

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.550

and it turned out that that nobody was

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:02.220
and it turned out that that nobody was
 

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.070
and it turned out that that nobody was
doing that and one of the big reasons

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080
doing that and one of the big reasons
 

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.920
doing that and one of the big reasons
was that nobody could get enough data in

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:06.930
was that nobody could get enough data in
 

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.110
was that nobody could get enough data in
one place in order to you know get a

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120
one place in order to you know get a
 

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.550
one place in order to you know get a
meaningful data set that would be useful

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:10.560
meaningful data set that would be useful
 

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.830
meaningful data set that would be useful
in that kind of study so that's sort of

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840
in that kind of study so that's sort of
 

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.380
in that kind of study so that's sort of
the dual there's sort of two things that

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:15.390
the dual there's sort of two things that
 

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.440
the dual there's sort of two things that
we're focused on it voltaic is really

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:17.450
we're focused on it voltaic is really
 

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:19.730
we're focused on it voltaic is really
getting all that data into one place and

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740
getting all that data into one place and
 

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.780
getting all that data into one place and
then doing interesting and valuable

things so this is evidence that if you

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200
things so this is evidence that if you
 

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.600
things so this is evidence that if you
want to work in batteries don't start

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:26.610
want to work in batteries don't start
 

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.510
want to work in batteries don't start
studying batteries you should move on to

00:30:40.859 --> 00:30:40.869
as fast as possible so to get to 2.0 we
 

00:30:40.869 --> 00:30:43.680
as fast as possible so to get to 2.0 we
need to know where 1.0 darkness and and

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:43.690
need to know where 1.0 darkness and and
 

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:48.210
need to know where 1.0 darkness and and
so I think largely this is sort of my

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:48.220
so I think largely this is sort of my
 

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:51.779
so I think largely this is sort of my
current thesis one point with 1.0 we

00:30:51.779 --> 00:30:51.789
current thesis one point with 1.0 we
 

00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:54.980
current thesis one point with 1.0 we
will electrify nearly all markets of

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:54.990
will electrify nearly all markets of
 

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.720
will electrify nearly all markets of
transportation including heavy duty

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:57.730
transportation including heavy duty
 

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:00.210
transportation including heavy duty
trucking with some slight changes in

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:00.220
trucking with some slight changes in
 

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.989
trucking with some slight changes in
behavior and probably with some

00:31:03.989 --> 00:31:03.999
behavior and probably with some
 

00:31:03.999 --> 00:31:05.609
behavior and probably with some
enhancements and charging which will

00:31:05.609 --> 00:31:05.619
enhancements and charging which will
 

00:31:05.619 --> 00:31:08.970
enhancements and charging which will
happen so which means then the question

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:08.980
happen so which means then the question
 

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.399
happen so which means then the question
is we know what is 2.0 and and for me

00:31:11.399 --> 00:31:11.409
is we know what is 2.0 and and for me
 

00:31:11.409 --> 00:31:14.519
is we know what is 2.0 and and for me
personally you know I think the the

00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:14.529
personally you know I think the the
 

00:31:14.529 --> 00:31:17.639
personally you know I think the the
biggest the biggest omission at least

00:31:17.639 --> 00:31:17.649
biggest the biggest omission at least
 

00:31:17.649 --> 00:31:19.859
biggest the biggest omission at least
from a personal stance standpoint is

00:31:19.859 --> 00:31:19.869
from a personal stance standpoint is
 

00:31:19.869 --> 00:31:20.220
from a personal stance standpoint is
flying

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:20.230
flying
 

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.379
flying
I fly a hundred thousand miles a year

00:31:22.379 --> 00:31:22.389
I fly a hundred thousand miles a year
 

00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:25.799
I fly a hundred thousand miles a year
not proud of it and my body doesn't like

00:31:25.799 --> 00:31:25.809
not proud of it and my body doesn't like
 

00:31:25.809 --> 00:31:28.680
not proud of it and my body doesn't like
it and so we would like to try and

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:28.690
it and so we would like to try and
 

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:31.109
it and so we would like to try and
Electrify planes I think it's not as

00:31:31.109 --> 00:31:31.119
Electrify planes I think it's not as
 

00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:33.210
Electrify planes I think it's not as
hard as it might imagine so I think

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:33.220
hard as it might imagine so I think
 

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:33.880
hard as it might imagine so I think
that's one

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:33.890
that's one
 

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:37.270
that's one
of battery 2.0 at least personally the

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:37.280
of battery 2.0 at least personally the
 

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.820
of battery 2.0 at least personally the
second thing which I think gets to many

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:39.830
second thing which I think gets to many
 

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:40.720
second thing which I think gets to many
of the things that people have been

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:40.730
of the things that people have been
 

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:42.640
of the things that people have been
talking about is in the battery business

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:42.650
talking about is in the battery business
 

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:45.070
talking about is in the battery business
the problem is when people tell you

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080
the problem is when people tell you
 

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.060
the problem is when people tell you
something

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:46.070
something
 

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.970
something
there's people tell you many things all

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:48.980
there's people tell you many things all
 

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.860
there's people tell you many things all
of which could be true but they're all

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:50.870
of which could be true but they're all
 

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:54.430
of which could be true but they're all
never simultaneously true and and so as

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440
never simultaneously true and and so as
 

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.250
never simultaneously true and and so as
a result there's sort of a huge mistrust

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:57.260
a result there's sort of a huge mistrust
 

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:01.330
a result there's sort of a huge mistrust
in the battery field and I think part of

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:01.340
in the battery field and I think part of
 

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:05.919
in the battery field and I think part of
this is is that it's a hard problem

00:32:05.919 --> 00:32:05.929
this is is that it's a hard problem
 

00:32:05.929 --> 00:32:08.289
this is is that it's a hard problem
you know multiphysics multi-dimensional

00:32:08.289 --> 00:32:08.299
you know multiphysics multi-dimensional
 

00:32:08.299 --> 00:32:10.150
you know multiphysics multi-dimensional
and so on so I think data is going to be

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:10.160
and so on so I think data is going to be
 

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.240
and so on so I think data is going to be
a key layer as we go forward and so I

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:13.250
a key layer as we go forward and so I
 

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:17.620
a key layer as we go forward and so I
think having data fill the gap and and

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:17.630
think having data fill the gap and and
 

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.560
think having data fill the gap and and
be the sort of driver of innovation

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:19.570
be the sort of driver of innovation
 

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.820
be the sort of driver of innovation

still think that battery 1.0 still has a

still think that battery 1.0 still has a
lot of legroom in the in the sense that

increment of improvement and so to me

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:32.570
increment of improvement and so to me

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:01.410
hundreds of PhDs who are doing
 

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:02.990
hundreds of PhDs who are doing
incremental improvement on the current

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000
incremental improvement on the current
 

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.960
incremental improvement on the current
technologies and they are doing it in a

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:05.970
technologies and they are doing it in a
 

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.690
technologies and they are doing it in a
brutal way that is hard to compete with

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:07.700
brutal way that is hard to compete with
 

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.089
brutal way that is hard to compete with
what happens here to do the next thing

00:38:11.089 --> 00:38:11.099
what happens here to do the next thing
 

00:38:11.099 --> 00:38:12.470
what happens here to do the next thing
that's gonna matter that's gonna move

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480
that's gonna matter that's gonna move
 

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.500
that's gonna matter that's gonna move
the bar and is this an R&amp;D function for

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:15.510
the bar and is this an R&amp;D function for
 

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:16.579
the bar and is this an R&amp;D function for
the government or is this something that

00:38:16.579 --> 00:38:16.589
the government or is this something that
 

00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:21.140
the government or is this something that
should be more or venture based I think

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:21.150
should be more or venture based I think
 

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:24.529
should be more or venture based I think
in the spectrum of R&amp;D what I would like

00:38:24.529 --> 00:38:24.539
in the spectrum of R&amp;D what I would like
 

00:38:24.539 --> 00:38:28.190
in the spectrum of R&amp;D what I would like
to see more of is focus on the D the

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200
to see more of is focus on the D the
 

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.220
to see more of is focus on the D the
development portion of it and in

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:31.230
development portion of it and in
 

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.839
development portion of it and in
particular I think about a learning

00:38:32.839 --> 00:38:32.849
particular I think about a learning
 

00:38:32.849 --> 00:38:36.740
particular I think about a learning
curve like a right curve where the total

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:36.750
curve like a right curve where the total
 

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:40.999
curve like a right curve where the total
volume of production is correlated to an

00:38:40.999 --> 00:38:41.009
volume of production is correlated to an
 

00:38:41.009 --> 00:38:43.130
volume of production is correlated to an
exponential price decline and in order

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:43.140
exponential price decline and in order
 

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.900
exponential price decline and in order
to achieve the value of that learning

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:44.910
to achieve the value of that learning
 

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:48.769
to achieve the value of that learning
curve we need to produce the volume and

00:38:48.769 --> 00:38:48.779
curve we need to produce the volume and
 

00:38:48.779 --> 00:38:51.950
curve we need to produce the volume and
so lithium-ion has that advantage it is

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960
so lithium-ion has that advantage it is
 

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.019
so lithium-ion has that advantage it is
producing at volumes that are increasing

00:38:54.019 --> 00:38:54.029
producing at volumes that are increasing
 

00:38:54.029 --> 00:38:56.450
producing at volumes that are increasing
year over year if we're going to see new

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:56.460
year over year if we're going to see new
 

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.549
year over year if we're going to see new
technologies compete we have to give

00:38:58.549 --> 00:38:58.559
technologies compete we have to give
 

00:38:58.559 --> 00:39:00.589
technologies compete we have to give
them a shot at more than the our level

00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599
them a shot at more than the our level
 

00:39:00.599 --> 00:39:02.420
them a shot at more than the our level
and and that has to be a national

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:02.430
and and that has to be a national
 

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.339
and and that has to be a national
priority if we are going to be the ones

00:39:04.339 --> 00:39:04.349
priority if we are going to be the ones
 

00:39:04.349 --> 00:39:05.660
priority if we are going to be the ones
that are going to capture that flag in

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:05.670
that are going to capture that flag in
 

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:07.609
that are going to capture that flag in
the United States it certainly is a

00:39:07.609 --> 00:39:07.619
the United States it certainly is a
 

00:39:07.619 --> 00:39:09.859
the United States it certainly is a
national priority in China for instance

00:39:09.859 --> 00:39:09.869
national priority in China for instance
 

00:39:09.869 --> 00:39:11.990
national priority in China for instance
they're making an 800 megawatt hour flow

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000
they're making an 800 megawatt hour flow
 

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.460
they're making an 800 megawatt hour flow

don't know but the only way to find out

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:17.730
don't know but the only way to find out
 

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.670
don't know but the only way to find out
is to you know is to fund the

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680
is to you know is to fund the
 

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.930
is to you know is to fund the
development effort as well as the

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:20.940
development effort as well as the
 

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:25.200
development effort as well as the
research ever

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:25.210
 
 

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:28.300
 
just to follow up on that I think there

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:28.310
just to follow up on that I think there
 

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:29.589
just to follow up on that I think there
needs to be sort of more crosstalk

00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599
needs to be sort of more crosstalk
 

00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:32.079
needs to be sort of more crosstalk
between R and D I think there's a lot of

00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:32.089
between R and D I think there's a lot of
 

00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:34.780
between R and D I think there's a lot of
people that work a lot on either R or

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:34.790
people that work a lot on either R or
 

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:37.030
people that work a lot on either R or
either D and I think there's very little

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040
either D and I think there's very little
 

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.520
either D and I think there's very little
crosstalk in my own experience and I

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:39.530
crosstalk in my own experience and I
 

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:40.900
crosstalk in my own experience and I
think some of my students will attest to

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:40.910
think some of my students will attest to
 

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:44.109
think some of my students will attest to
this when you have that link to folks

00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:44.119
this when you have that link to folks
 

00:39:44.119 --> 00:39:45.579
this when you have that link to folks
that are that are constantly thinking

00:39:45.579 --> 00:39:45.589
that are that are constantly thinking
 

00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:48.250
that are that are constantly thinking
about development that fundamentally

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:48.260
about development that fundamentally
 

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.750
about development that fundamentally
changes your landscape in terms of how

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760
changes your landscape in terms of how
 

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.180
changes your landscape in terms of how
you think about research how you think

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:52.190
you think about research how you think
 

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.720
you think about research how you think
about framing your question and and you

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:55.730
about framing your question and and you
 

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:59.380
about framing your question and and you
sort of know whether what you do will

00:39:59.380 --> 00:39:59.390
sort of know whether what you do will
 

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:00.700
sort of know whether what you do will
ever make a difference and I think

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:00.710
ever make a difference and I think
 

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:02.829
ever make a difference and I think
that's a really important thing that I

00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:02.839
that's a really important thing that I
 

00:40:02.839 --> 00:40:05.680
that's a really important thing that I
think some of the agencies like goe and

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:05.690
think some of the agencies like goe and
 

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:08.920
think some of the agencies like goe and
RPE encourage of course the challenge

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:08.930
RPE encourage of course the challenge
 

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:12.900
RPE encourage of course the challenge
with many of that kind of funding comes

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:12.910
with many of that kind of funding comes
 

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:16.180
with many of that kind of funding comes
sort of challenging milestones and

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:16.190
sort of challenging milestones and
 

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:19.960
sort of challenging milestones and
deliverables that you know this is

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:19.970
deliverables that you know this is
 

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:22.240
deliverables that you know this is
sometimes hard to predict with such

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:22.250
sometimes hard to predict with such
 

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:26.050
sometimes hard to predict with such
ambitious projects and and obviously

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:26.060
ambitious projects and and obviously
 

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:27.309
ambitious projects and and obviously
when you want to try and bring anything

00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:27.319
when you want to try and bring anything
 

00:40:27.319 --> 00:40:29.800
when you want to try and bring anything
new you have to also assume that the

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:29.810
new you have to also assume that the
 

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:31.720
new you have to also assume that the
current technology is going to get so

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:31.730
current technology is going to get so
 

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:35.349
current technology is going to get so
much better and so you have to assume

00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359
much better and so you have to assume
 

00:40:35.359 --> 00:40:36.640
much better and so you have to assume
that you can beat them five years from

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:36.650
that you can beat them five years from
 

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.640
that you can beat them five years from
now so I think there are some pieces

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:39.650
now so I think there are some pieces
 

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:43.690
now so I think there are some pieces
that are very good with how RPE

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:43.700
that are very good with how RPE
 

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:49.329
that are very good with how RPE
and and do e elements that they have in

00:40:49.329 --> 00:40:49.339
and and do e elements that they have in
 

00:40:49.339 --> 00:40:51.359
and and do e elements that they have in
their funding model but they're I think

00:40:51.359 --> 00:40:51.369
their funding model but they're I think
 

00:40:51.369 --> 00:40:54.190
their funding model but they're I think
taking a longer-term view is of course

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200
taking a longer-term view is of course
 

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.599
taking a longer-term view is of course
challenging but I think would be

00:40:55.599 --> 00:40:55.609
challenging but I think would be
 

00:40:55.609 --> 00:40:58.059
challenging but I think would be
something that would greatly benefit

00:40:58.059 --> 00:40:58.069
something that would greatly benefit
 

00:40:58.069 --> 00:41:03.270
something that would greatly benefit
these sorts of very ambitious projects

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280
 
 

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.740
 
all right I think I'm definitely

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:05.750

agreeing on a particularly the rnd
separation there that's definitely

as far as the coin cell is concerned the
electrolyte to active mass ratio there's

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:57.500
electrolyte to active mass ratio there's
 

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.590

geometric basis for that format just

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880
geometric basis for that format just
 

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:06.210
geometric basis for that format just
don't translate very well and

often look to get our own grants we

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920
often look to get our own grants we
 

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.470
often look to get our own grants we
usually partner with different entities

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:17.480
usually partner with different entities
 

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.090
usually partner with different entities
that have you know some piece of

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:19.100
that have you know some piece of
 

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.370
that have you know some piece of
technology and we'll partner with them

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:21.380
technology and we'll partner with them
 

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.590
technology and we'll partner with them
on a grant to to facilitate it and so

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:23.600
on a grant to to facilitate it and so
 

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.320
on a grant to to facilitate it and so
we've seen a whole lot of different

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:26.330
we've seen a whole lot of different
 

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:28.120
we've seen a whole lot of different
applications and the ones that succeed

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:28.130
applications and the ones that succeed
 

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:33.070
applications and the ones that succeed
and don't and I would generally I

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:33.080
and don't and I would generally I
 

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.870
and don't and I would generally I
generally think that the better ones do

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880
generally think that the better ones do
 

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.910
generally think that the better ones do
tend to succeed although the ones that

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:36.920
tend to succeed although the ones that
 

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:40.210
tend to succeed although the ones that
promise the most to get the grants the

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:40.220
promise the most to get the grants the
 

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:42.460
promise the most to get the grants the
most as well which is which is some some

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:42.470
most as well which is which is some some
 

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:43.810
most as well which is which is some some
of what of a challenge I think but

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:43.820
of what of a challenge I think but
 

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:47.050
of what of a challenge I think but
that's hard to hard to fight against

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:47.060
that's hard to hard to fight against
 

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.700
that's hard to hard to fight against
obviously the person promising the most

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:48.710
obviously the person promising the most
 

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:51.850
obviously the person promising the most
is the most enticing or the biggest liar

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:51.860
is the most enticing or the biggest liar
 

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:56.290
is the most enticing or the biggest liar
yeah the most optimistic you can just be

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:56.300
yeah the most optimistic you can just be
 

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.420
yeah the most optimistic you can just be
I like to be I like to be positive and

00:42:58.420 --> 00:42:58.430
I like to be I like to be positive and
 

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:00.930
I like to be I like to be positive and
just say they were the most optimistic

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:00.940
just say they were the most optimistic
 

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:05.410
just say they were the most optimistic
researchers but yes I do think that that

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:05.420
researchers but yes I do think that that
 

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.200
researchers but yes I do think that that
step between early research and later

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:08.210
step between early research and later
 

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.420
step between early research and later
development and scale-up it could be

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:10.430
development and scale-up it could be
 

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.310
development and scale-up it could be
bridged a lot more and that's really

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:12.320
bridged a lot more and that's really
 

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.050
bridged a lot more and that's really
what the book is all about was what's

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:14.060
what the book is all about was what's
 

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:18.490
what the book is all about was what's
creating that bridge and I think we've

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:18.500
creating that bridge and I think we've
 

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.910
creating that bridge and I think we've
had some success in that great so I'm

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920
had some success in that great so I'm
 

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.950
had some success in that great so I'm
gonna echo a couple of things that that

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960
gonna echo a couple of things that that
 

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.850
gonna echo a couple of things that that
were said just now which is that I think

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:27.860
were said just now which is that I think
 

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.830
were said just now which is that I think
a major priority going forward for

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:29.840
a major priority going forward for
 

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.680
a major priority going forward for
battery R&amp;D is to develop metrics so

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:32.690
battery R&amp;D is to develop metrics so
 

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:35.530
battery R&amp;D is to develop metrics so
that you can actually compare different

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:35.540
that you can actually compare different
 

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.330
that you can actually compare different
technologies on a level playing field

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:37.340
technologies on a level playing field
 

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:41.230
technologies on a level playing field
and so broadly speaking you know when

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240
and so broadly speaking you know when
 

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.100
and so broadly speaking you know when
you're developing a new battery

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:42.110
you're developing a new battery
 

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:43.930
you're developing a new battery
technology things are concerned with our

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:43.940
technology things are concerned with our
 

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.940
technology things are concerned with our
how much energy can it hold how much

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:45.950
how much energy can it hold how much
 

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:46.490
how much energy can it hold how much
power

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:46.500
power
 

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.230
power
deliver how long can you cycle it how

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240
deliver how long can you cycle it how
 

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.310
deliver how long can you cycle it how
many times can you charge and discharge

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:49.320
many times can you charge and discharge
 

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.980
many times can you charge and discharge
it how much does it cost and how safe is

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:51.990
it how much does it cost and how safe is
 

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:55.520
it how much does it cost and how safe is
it and so you know I think that it would

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:55.530
it and so you know I think that it would
 

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:56.780
it and so you know I think that it would
be great if there were some priority

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:56.790
be great if there were some priority
 

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:58.610
be great if there were some priority
around developing a standard set of

00:43:58.610 --> 00:43:58.620
around developing a standard set of
 

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:00.380
around developing a standard set of
metrics to evaluate every technology

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:00.390
metrics to evaluate every technology
 

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:02.330
metrics to evaluate every technology
along those different axes it would be

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:02.340
along those different axes it would be
 

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.030
along those different axes it would be
fairly straightforward to propose you

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040
fairly straightforward to propose you
 

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.290
fairly straightforward to propose you
know for different applications where

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:06.300
know for different applications where
 

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:07.640
know for different applications where
there's transportation for its storage

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:07.650
there's transportation for its storage
 

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:09.140
there's transportation for its storage
etc which ones are more important how

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:09.150
etc which ones are more important how
 

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:11.540
etc which ones are more important how
they should be weighted but you know

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:11.550
they should be weighted but you know
 

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:13.370
they should be weighted but you know
it's sort of I think that there's an

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:13.380
it's sort of I think that there's an
 

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.030
it's sort of I think that there's an
issue in that you hear so often in the

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040
issue in that you hear so often in the
 

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.140
issue in that you hear so often in the
media the sort of the stories that

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:18.150
media the sort of the stories that
 

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:19.460
media the sort of the stories that
bubble up to the media about the newest

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:19.470
bubble up to the media about the newest
 

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.080
bubble up to the media about the newest
battery breakthrough it somebody has a

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:21.090
battery breakthrough it somebody has a
 

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:22.970
battery breakthrough it somebody has a
technology that can you know will be

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:22.980
technology that can you know will be
 

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.530
technology that can you know will be
able to charge your car in 10 seconds

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:24.540
able to charge your car in 10 seconds
 

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:25.970
able to charge your car in 10 seconds
your electric vehicle in 10 seconds or

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:25.980
your electric vehicle in 10 seconds or
 

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.310
your electric vehicle in 10 seconds or
what have you but almost invariably

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:28.320
what have you but almost invariably
 

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.080
what have you but almost invariably
there's some one of those acts one or

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:30.090
there's some one of those acts one or
 

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:32.510
there's some one of those acts one or
more of those axes of performance is

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520
more of those axes of performance is
 

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.800
more of those axes of performance is
sort of being hidden and not talked

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:33.810
sort of being hidden and not talked
 

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:35.900
sort of being hidden and not talked
about and those are important very

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:35.910
about and those are important very
 

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:39.280
about and those are important very
relevant and so I think some you know

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:39.290
relevant and so I think some you know
 

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:41.750
relevant and so I think some you know
making it a priority in terms of

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760
making it a priority in terms of
 

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.790
making it a priority in terms of
research funding where those resources

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800
research funding where those resources
 

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.590
research funding where those resources
go being able to evaluate these things

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:45.600
go being able to evaluate these things
 

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.180
go being able to evaluate these things
so you can separate out sort of the the

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:47.190
so you can separate out sort of the the
 

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:49.100
so you can separate out sort of the the
science projects or the you know the

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:49.110
science projects or the you know the
 

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:50.780

the DGE dureth on battery team so you
 

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:22.970
the DGE dureth on battery team so you
this is sort of it's an interesting

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:22.980
this is sort of it's an interesting
 

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.950
this is sort of it's an interesting
historical I'm gonna bring this into to

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960
historical I'm gonna bring this into to
 

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.960
historical I'm gonna bring this into to
a corporate R&amp;D for batteries just that

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:26.970
a corporate R&amp;D for batteries just that
 

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:29.750
a corporate R&amp;D for batteries just that
just so you know but GE bought purchased

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760
just so you know but GE bought purchased
 

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.910
just so you know but GE bought purchased
a company called beta battery right and

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920
a company called beta battery right and
 

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.230
a company called beta battery right and
then they decided they were gonna scale

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240
then they decided they were gonna scale
 

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.410
then they decided they were gonna scale
this is a high temperature what was it a

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:36.420
this is a high temperature what was it a
 

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:38.750
this is a high temperature what was it a
nickel sodium sodium yes it a nickel

chloride battery and they poured how

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700
chloride battery and they poured how
 

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.510
chloride battery and they poured how
much money into it hundreds of millions

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520
much money into it hundreds of millions
 

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.540
much money into it hundreds of millions
yeah at least

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:46.550
yeah at least
 

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.820
yeah at least
so millions into manufacturing the team

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:48.830
so millions into manufacturing the team
 

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:50.890
so millions into manufacturing the team
the you have the clean rooms everything

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:50.900
the you have the clean rooms everything
 

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:55.090
the you have the clean rooms everything
and what happened it's no longer

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:55.100
and what happened it's no longer
 

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.750
and what happened it's no longer
operable that's right and and so I get

00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:58.760
operable that's right and and so I get
 

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.760
operable that's right and and so I get
my question really is corporate wise the

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:00.770
my question really is corporate wise the
 

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:02.680
my question really is corporate wise the
GES of the world I mean are they diving

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:02.690
GES of the world I mean are they diving
 

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:03.970
GES of the world I mean are they diving
back in the new batteries or not like

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:03.980
back in the new batteries or not like
 

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:06.070

what's where do people stand so I I

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:06.080
what's where do people stand so I I
 

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.660
what's where do people stand so I I
don't think so I don't think we're gonna

research from the ground up I think what

00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:16.340
research from the ground up I think what
 

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.650
research from the ground up I think what
all those big companies are doing is

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:17.660
all those big companies are doing is
 

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.990
all those big companies are doing is
hoping that either something gets

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000
hoping that either something gets
 

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.210

of it where they can go out and deploy

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:23.510
of it where they can go out and deploy
 

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:25.870
of it where they can go out and deploy
or they're very content right now just

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:25.880
or they're very content right now just
 

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.960
or they're very content right now just
to buy off-the-shelf lithium-ion cells

one way I think about it is is you you
 

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:12.170
one way I think about it is is you you
you have to sort of think about whether

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180
you have to sort of think about whether
 

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:14.450

you can do all you need is one mole of
 

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:30.650
you can do all you need is one mole of
lithium and one mole of transition metal

back-of-the-envelope looking back at
 

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.200
back-of-the-envelope looking back at
your periodic table and know that you

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:36.210
your periodic table and know that you
 

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:38.510
your periodic table and know that you
know you need one tenth of lithium for

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520
know you need one tenth of lithium for
 

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.180

from our old pipes and that was really
 

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:26.120
from our old pipes and that was really
important for us to understand one this

important for us to understand one this
 

01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:28.550

make sure we're reliable getting people

01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840
make sure we're reliable getting people

which overlaid that with the
 

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.850
which overlaid that with the
environmental issues so where we had

01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:01.860
environmental issues so where we had
 

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.340
environmental issues so where we had
significant environmental issues all of

that we're breathing from the pipe line

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760
that we're breathing from the pipe line
 

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:18.980
that we're breathing from the pipe line
replacement so it was really a

01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:18.990
replacement so it was really a
 

01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:22.310
replacement so it was really a
before-and-after and so we're at the

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320
before-and-after and so we're at the
 

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.320

that we're serving one the issues that
were causing by having these old pipes

01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800
were causing by having these old pipes
 

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.860

replacement of those pipes and so that's

01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:54.420
replacement of those pipes and so that's
 

01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:56.510
replacement of those pipes and so that's
really the next phase of our partnership

01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520
really the next phase of our partnership
 

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:59.270
really the next phase of our partnership
which is really exciting so this is not

which is a safety and environmental
device where you have an operational

01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800
device where you have an operational
 

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.040
device where you have an operational
upset to relieve pressure from that

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:49.050
upset to relieve pressure from that
 

01:18:49.050 --> 01:18:51.500
upset to relieve pressure from that
operational upset you send a stream of

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:51.510
operational upset you send a stream of
 

01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:56.380
operational upset you send a stream of
gas or some mode of product up the flare

01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:56.390
gas or some mode of product up the flare
 

01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:59.540
gas or some mode of product up the flare
to relieve the pressure situation that's

01:18:59.540 --> 01:18:59.550
to relieve the pressure situation that's
 

01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:01.160
to relieve the pressure situation that's
occurring literally at the ground level

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:01.170
occurring literally at the ground level
 

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:04.640
occurring literally at the ground level
and most of the emissions but not all

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:04.650
and most of the emissions but not all
 

01:19:04.650 --> 01:19:06.860
and most of the emissions but not all
most of the emissions are burned off at

most of the emissions are burned off at
 

01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:11.810
most of the emissions are burned off at
the flare so and and 98 99 % when I say

01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:11.820

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:13.490
the flare so and and 98 99 % when I say
most but still when you have a foot a

01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500
most but still when you have a foot a
 

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.060

flaring incident that

01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:15.070
flaring incident that
 

01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:17.970
flaring incident that
one that goes for a long time at a plan

01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:17.980
one that goes for a long time at a plan
 

01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:20.129

of a large scale the emissions numbers

01:19:20.129 --> 01:19:20.139
of a large scale the emissions numbers
 

01:19:20.139 --> 01:19:21.149
of a large scale the emissions numbers
that have to be reported to the

01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:21.159
that have to be reported to the
 

01:19:21.159 --> 01:19:24.390
that have to be reported to the
regulator are typically pretty large so

01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400
regulator are typically pretty large so
 

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:26.700
regulator are typically pretty large so
what we did at this point was we

01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:26.710
what we did at this point was we
 

01:19:26.710 --> 01:19:28.950
what we did at this point was we
developed sort of an internal pipeline

01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960
developed sort of an internal pipeline
 

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:31.859
developed sort of an internal pipeline
network where we will circulate the

01:19:31.859 --> 01:19:31.869
network where we will circulate the
 

01:19:31.869 --> 01:19:34.589
network where we will circulate the
ethane if we have an upset and and we'll

01:19:34.589 --> 01:19:34.599
ethane if we have an upset and and we'll
 

01:19:34.599 --> 01:19:36.330
ethane if we have an upset and and we'll
be able to do this for approximately 24

01:19:36.330 --> 01:19:36.340
be able to do this for approximately 24
 

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:39.419
be able to do this for approximately 24
hours so if you have a situation in a

01:19:39.419 --> 01:19:39.429
hours so if you have a situation in a
 

01:19:39.429 --> 01:19:41.819

the upset we will have circulated the
 

01:19:51.010 --> 01:19:53.490
the upset we will have circulated the
ethane not have all the emissions that

ethane not have all the emissions that
 

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:56.189
ethane not have all the emissions that
would have been reported and well

01:19:56.189 --> 01:19:56.199
would have been reported and well
 

01:19:56.199 --> 01:19:57.899

after years of operating there'll be a
 

01:20:02.139 --> 01:20:03.689
after years of operating there'll be a
benefit cuz we wouldn't have wasted all

is a way we've looked at things
 

01:20:23.739 --> 01:20:25.439
is a way we've looked at things
differently and see how we can offer

differently and see how we can offer
 

01:20:25.449 --> 01:20:28.979
differently and see how we can offer
both an environmental benefit to the

three states as to where storage could
happen and in the Gulf Coast storage is

01:22:08.849 --> 01:22:08.859
happen and in the Gulf Coast storage is
 

01:22:08.859 --> 01:22:11.219
happen and in the Gulf Coast storage is
there and easy for people to use and we

01:22:11.219 --> 01:22:11.229
there and easy for people to use and we
 

01:22:11.229 --> 01:22:12.750
there and easy for people to use and we
need something comparable of that to be

01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:12.760
need something comparable of that to be
 

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:16.139
need something comparable of that to be

to it nearly as well as Brian could but
 

01:22:26.289 --> 01:22:30.209
to it nearly as well as Brian could but
it is a an ongoing significant effort

01:22:30.209 --> 01:22:30.219
it is a an ongoing significant effort
 

01:22:30.219 --> 01:22:32.719
it is a an ongoing significant effort
and if that is accomplished I think that

01:22:32.719 --> 01:22:32.729
and if that is accomplished I think that
 

01:22:32.729 --> 01:22:36.329
and if that is accomplished I think that

that it could be done now the question
 

01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:46.960
that it could be done now the question
is you know where and and obviously this

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:46.970
is you know where and and obviously this
 

01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:49.120
is you know where and and obviously this
is going to be a long and debatable

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:49.130
is going to be a long and debatable

it's not a it's not a noticeable piece

01:23:58.720 --> 01:23:58.730
it's not a it's not a noticeable piece
 

01:23:58.730 --> 01:24:00.370
it's not a it's not a noticeable piece
of infrastructure for the most part but

01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:00.380
of infrastructure for the most part but
 

01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:01.840
of infrastructure for the most part but
it is critical you've got to be able to

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:01.850
it is critical you've got to be able to
 

01:24:01.850 --> 01:24:04.540
it is critical you've got to be able to
move the the NGOs around the region so

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:04.550
move the the NGOs around the region so
 

01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:06.130
move the the NGOs around the region so
that manufacturing can take place in

01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:06.140
that manufacturing can take place in
 

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:08.260
that manufacturing can take place in
different locations but I think the

01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:08.270
different locations but I think the
 

01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:11.260
different locations but I think the
there is interest in and there is a

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:11.270
there is interest in and there is a
 

01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:13.510
there is interest in and there is a
storage facility in Ohio that goldman

01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520
storage facility in Ohio that goldman
 

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:15.340
storage facility in Ohio that goldman
sachs has an interest in so i think that

01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:15.350
sachs has an interest in so i think that
 

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:17.260
sachs has an interest in so i think that
the potential is there for the private

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:17.270
the potential is there for the private
 

01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:18.940
the potential is there for the private
sector to get engaged at the grade level

01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:18.950
sector to get engaged at the grade level
 

01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:21.880
sector to get engaged at the grade level
but at this point it's still an effort

01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:21.890
but at this point it's still an effort
 

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:26.050
but at this point it's still an effort
to develop the engineering to show how

01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:26.060
to develop the engineering to show how
 

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:30.160
to develop the engineering to show how
best stacy forging the future report

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:30.170
best stacy forging the future report
 

01:24:30.170 --> 01:24:31.530
best stacy forging the future report
there were there specific

01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:31.540
there were there specific
 

01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:33.370
there were there specific
recommendations in terms of what

01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:33.380
recommendations in terms of what
 

01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:35.860
recommendations in terms of what
government or anybody else ought to be

01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:35.870
government or anybody else ought to be
 

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:39.490
government or anybody else ought to be
doing to realize the benefits yes excuse

01:24:39.490 --> 01:24:39.500
doing to realize the benefits yes excuse
 

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.729
doing to realize the benefits yes excuse
me there were specific recommendations

01:24:41.729 --> 01:24:41.739
me there were specific recommendations
 

01:24:41.739 --> 01:24:44.380
me there were specific recommendations
again you have this huge supply but the

01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:44.390
again you have this huge supply but the
 

01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:47.050
again you have this huge supply but the
regional demand is really really low and

01:24:47.050 --> 01:24:47.060
regional demand is really really low and
 

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:49.660
regional demand is really really low and
so the key question was how can you

01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:49.670
so the key question was how can you
 

01:24:49.670 --> 01:24:51.790
so the key question was how can you
build regional demand more regional

01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:51.800
build regional demand more regional
 

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.180
build regional demand more regional
demand so that the region really

01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:54.190
demand so that the region really
 

01:24:54.190 --> 01:24:57.370
demand so that the region really
benefits from the economic potential so

01:24:57.370 --> 01:24:57.380
benefits from the economic potential so
 

01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:59.290
benefits from the economic potential so
one of the strategies was what Morgan

01:24:59.290 --> 01:24:59.300
one of the strategies was what Morgan
 

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:01.210
one of the strategies was what Morgan
said yeah just getting more natural gas

01:25:01.210 --> 01:25:01.220
said yeah just getting more natural gas
 

01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:04.150
said yeah just getting more natural gas
into homes the second strategy was

01:25:04.150 --> 01:25:04.160
into homes the second strategy was
 

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:07.350
into homes the second strategy was
around how to develop economic clusters

01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:07.360
around how to develop economic clusters
 

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.540
around how to develop economic clusters
that where you can get let's say

01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:10.550
that where you can get let's say
 

01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:12.870
that where you can get let's say
advanced manufacturing data centers

01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880
advanced manufacturing data centers
 

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:18.070
advanced manufacturing data centers
users of a lot of natural gas that would

01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080
users of a lot of natural gas that would
 

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:21.729
users of a lot of natural gas that would
want low cost natural gas to come and

01:25:21.729 --> 01:25:21.739
want low cost natural gas to come and
 

01:25:21.739 --> 01:25:24.729
want low cost natural gas to come and
develop these economic clusters and that

01:25:24.729 --> 01:25:24.739
develop these economic clusters and that
 

01:25:24.739 --> 01:25:27.280
develop these economic clusters and that
plays right into this region strength

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:27.290
plays right into this region strength
 

01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:30.000
plays right into this region strength
which is robotics innovation

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:30.010
which is robotics innovation
 

01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:32.680
which is robotics innovation
manufacturing and so that was the second

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:32.690
manufacturing and so that was the second
 

01:25:32.690 --> 01:25:35.200
manufacturing and so that was the second
strategy was around those clusters the

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:35.210
strategy was around those clusters the
 

01:25:35.210 --> 01:25:37.120
strategy was around those clusters the
third strategy was actually around

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:37.130
third strategy was actually around
 

01:25:37.130 --> 01:25:38.089
third strategy was actually around
advanced

01:25:38.089 --> 01:25:38.099
advanced
 

01:25:38.099 --> 01:25:40.280
advanced
infrastructure to export some of the gas

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:40.290
infrastructure to export some of the gas
 

01:25:40.290 --> 01:25:42.709
infrastructure to export some of the gas
so there is so much gas here that

01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719
so there is so much gas here that
 

01:25:42.719 --> 01:25:44.930
so there is so much gas here that
probably you could never use it here

01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:44.940
probably you could never use it here
 

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:47.390
probably you could never use it here
even if you had a lot of data centers

01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400
even if you had a lot of data centers
 

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:50.209
even if you had a lot of data centers
and more crackers so getting some of

01:25:50.209 --> 01:25:50.219
and more crackers so getting some of
 

01:25:50.219 --> 01:25:52.520
and more crackers so getting some of
this gas to the Gulf Coast's which can

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:52.530
this gas to the Gulf Coast's which can
 

01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:54.859
this gas to the Gulf Coast's which can
link it into global markets is actually

01:25:54.859 --> 01:25:54.869
link it into global markets is actually
 

01:25:54.869 --> 01:26:00.740
link it into global markets is actually
also important so Stacey oh I don't mean

01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:00.750
also important so Stacey oh I don't mean

01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:42.260
petrochemical feedstocks would be
 

01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:44.569
petrochemical feedstocks would be
important for the manufacturing future

01:30:44.569 --> 01:30:44.579
important for the manufacturing future
 

01:30:44.579 --> 01:30:46.189
important for the manufacturing future
for the downstream because among other

01:30:46.189 --> 01:30:46.199
for the downstream because among other
 

01:30:46.199 --> 01:30:48.469
for the downstream because among other
things they can be made recyclable and

things they can be made recyclable and
 

01:30:48.479 --> 01:30:50.120
things they can be made recyclable and
that drives the price down to make it

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:50.130
that drives the price down to make it
 

01:30:50.130 --> 01:30:52.040
that drives the price down to make it
competitive carbon fibers are stronger

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:52.050
competitive carbon fibers are stronger
 

01:30:52.050 --> 01:30:54.549
competitive carbon fibers are stronger
and lighter than other materials and

01:30:54.549 --> 01:30:54.559
and lighter than other materials and

Pennsylvania report also is that this is

01:31:02.299 --> 01:31:02.309
Pennsylvania report also is that this is
 

01:31:02.309 --> 01:31:04.879
Pennsylvania report also is that this is
a clear opportunity for the region as to

01:31:04.879 --> 01:31:04.889
a clear opportunity for the region as to
 

01:31:04.889 --> 01:31:07.819
a clear opportunity for the region as to
the Rd part I think clearly this region

01:31:07.819 --> 01:31:07.829
the Rd part I think clearly this region
 

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:10.399
the Rd part I think clearly this region
has strengths in in what Carnegie Mellon

01:31:10.399 --> 01:31:10.409
has strengths in in what Carnegie Mellon
 

01:31:10.409 --> 01:31:12.620
has strengths in in what Carnegie Mellon
is strong and that one doubts the world

01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:12.630
is strong and that one doubts the world

development of future products is a

01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:19.320
development of future products is a
 

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:20.959
development of future products is a
little bit more spread out I know that

01:31:20.959 --> 01:31:20.969
little bit more spread out I know that
 

01:31:20.969 --> 01:31:22.580
little bit more spread out I know that
there's a German company that's looking

01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:22.590
there's a German company that's looking
 

01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:25.040
there's a German company that's looking
at it as a recycling facility for carbon

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:25.050
at it as a recycling facility for carbon
 

01:31:25.050 --> 01:31:26.839
at it as a recycling facility for carbon
fibers in the UK that's looking to

01:31:26.839 --> 01:31:26.849
fibers in the UK that's looking to
 

01:31:26.849 --> 01:31:29.419
fibers in the UK that's looking to
create one here and they get their work

01:31:29.419 --> 01:31:29.429
create one here and they get their work
 

01:31:29.429 --> 01:31:32.810
create one here and they get their work
done and an oak ridge so I think maybe

01:31:32.810 --> 01:31:32.820
done and an oak ridge so I think maybe
 

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:34.879
done and an oak ridge so I think maybe
that's something we need to actually put

01:31:34.879 --> 01:31:34.889
that's something we need to actually put
 

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:36.529
that's something we need to actually put
some thought into that very issue who is

01:31:36.529 --> 01:31:36.539
some thought into that very issue who is
 

01:31:36.539 --> 01:31:40.580
some thought into that very issue who is
who are the sources for the Rd for the

01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:40.590
who are the sources for the Rd for the
 

01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:44.060
who are the sources for the Rd for the
the future product development yeah you

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:44.070
the future product development yeah you
 

01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:46.100
the future product development yeah you
know and I think the attitude that we

01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:46.110
know and I think the attitude that we
 

01:31:46.110 --> 01:31:48.339
know and I think the attitude that we
took with Carnegie Mellon was to

01:31:48.339 --> 01:31:48.349
took with Carnegie Mellon was to
 

01:31:48.349 --> 01:31:50.640
took with Carnegie Mellon was to
basically have an open mind

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:50.650
basically have an open mind
 

01:31:50.650 --> 01:31:54.510
basically have an open mind
listen and as we began that dialogue we

01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:54.520
listen and as we began that dialogue we
 

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:56.580
listen and as we began that dialogue we
were introduced you know we basically

01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:56.590
were introduced you know we basically
 

01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:59.700
were introduced you know we basically
said you know any ideas and things that

01:31:59.700 --> 01:31:59.710
said you know any ideas and things that
 

01:31:59.710 --> 01:32:01.020
said you know any ideas and things that
people are working on that you think

01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:01.030
people are working on that you think
 

01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:02.700
people are working on that you think
would apply and make us better at what

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:02.710
would apply and make us better at what
 

01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:04.649
would apply and make us better at what
we're doing knowing what our mission is

01:32:04.649 --> 01:32:04.659
we're doing knowing what our mission is
 

01:32:04.659 --> 01:32:07.649

we'd love to be the sandbox that people

01:32:07.649 --> 01:32:07.659
we'd love to be the sandbox that people
 

01:32:07.659 --> 01:32:10.020
we'd love to be the sandbox that people
played in and and since that time you

01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:10.030
played in and and since that time you
 

01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:13.380
played in and and since that time you
know we now have I call them drones but

01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:13.390
know we now have I call them drones but
 

01:32:13.390 --> 01:32:17.580
know we now have I call them drones but
I don imus flying devices that actually

01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:17.590
I don imus flying devices that actually
 

01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:20.280
I don imus flying devices that actually
are basically flying along the bridges

01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:20.290
are basically flying along the bridges
 

01:32:20.290 --> 01:32:22.890
are basically flying along the bridges
in western Pennsylvania that we have

01:32:22.890 --> 01:32:22.900
in western Pennsylvania that we have
 

01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:24.840
in western Pennsylvania that we have
quite a few of and a lot of them have

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:24.850
quite a few of and a lot of them have
 

01:32:24.850 --> 01:32:26.760
quite a few of and a lot of them have
gas lines underneath and typically

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:26.770
gas lines underneath and typically
 

01:32:26.770 --> 01:32:30.290
gas lines underneath and typically
historically we would have folks

01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:30.300
historically we would have folks
 

01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:32.490
historically we would have folks
underneath those bridges checking those

01:32:32.490 --> 01:32:32.500
underneath those bridges checking those
 

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:35.910
underneath those bridges checking those
pipes these drones now go flying through

01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920
pipes these drones now go flying through
 

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:38.280
pipes these drones now go flying through
the air and give us better better data

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:38.290
the air and give us better better data
 

01:32:38.290 --> 01:32:41.459
the air and give us better better data
and it's obviously much safer we've also

01:32:41.459 --> 01:32:41.469
and it's obviously much safer we've also
 

01:32:41.469 --> 01:32:44.070
and it's obviously much safer we've also
been introduced to a robotics strategy

01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080
been introduced to a robotics strategy
 

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:47.550
been introduced to a robotics strategy
that literally threw gas lines as small

01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:47.560
that literally threw gas lines as small
 

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:50.040
that literally threw gas lines as small
as four inches a robot can go through

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:50.050
as four inches a robot can go through
 

01:32:50.050 --> 01:32:52.470
as four inches a robot can go through
and literally take photos of the inside

01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480
and literally take photos of the inside
 

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:55.200
and literally take photos of the inside
of the pipe to give us a real real-time

01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:55.210
of the pipe to give us a real real-time
 

01:32:55.210 --> 01:32:57.570
of the pipe to give us a real real-time
depiction of of what that looks like and

01:32:57.570 --> 01:32:57.580
depiction of of what that looks like and
 

01:32:57.580 --> 01:32:59.669

they also have the ability to seal

01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679
they also have the ability to seal
 

01:32:59.679 --> 01:33:01.590
they also have the ability to seal
joints particularly in some of the older

bigger pipes and so and then the last

01:33:05.250 --> 01:33:05.260
bigger pipes and so and then the last
 

01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:08.189
bigger pipes and so and then the last
innovation that we we sort of been

01:33:08.189 --> 01:33:08.199
innovation that we we sort of been
 

01:33:08.199 --> 01:33:10.110

I know there's a lot of discussions
 

01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:20.370
I know there's a lot of discussions
around battery where you basically take

01:33:20.370 --> 01:33:20.380
around battery where you basically take
 

01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:23.040

I think it's we're just at the beginning
of it and I think it's gonna be

01:34:27.850 --> 01:34:27.860
of it and I think it's gonna be
 

01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:30.520
of it and I think it's gonna be
dramatically probably more quickly than

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:30.530
dramatically probably more quickly than
 

01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:32.709
dramatically probably more quickly than
anything make us so much more

01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:32.719
anything make us so much more
 

01:34:32.719 --> 01:34:35.140
anything make us so much more
responsible and that fear that I started

01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:35.150
responsible and that fear that I started
 

01:34:35.150 --> 01:34:38.100
responsible and that fear that I started
with not only put that to ease but also

01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:38.110
with not only put that to ease but also
 

01:34:38.110 --> 01:34:41.739
with not only put that to ease but also
help you and people that we serve come

01:34:41.739 --> 01:34:41.749
help you and people that we serve come
 

01:34:41.749 --> 01:34:44.350
help you and people that we serve come
up with environmental answers that make

01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:44.360
up with environmental answers that make
 

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.390
up with environmental answers that make
economic sense that take advantage of

01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400
economic sense that take advantage of
 

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:48.790
economic sense that take advantage of
this and as you say that those always

01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800
this and as you say that those always
 

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:51.100
this and as you say that those always
some environmental impacts but taking

01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:51.110
some environmental impacts but taking
 

01:34:51.110 --> 01:34:53.109
some environmental impacts but taking
those next steps I think there's a lot

01:34:53.109 --> 01:34:53.119
those next steps I think there's a lot
 

01:34:53.119 --> 01:34:55.930
those next steps I think there's a lot
of opportunities for traditional ways

01:34:55.930 --> 01:34:55.940
of opportunities for traditional ways
 

01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:57.969
of opportunities for traditional ways
changing and making it a much much

01:34:57.969 --> 01:34:57.979
changing and making it a much much
 

01:34:57.979 --> 01:35:01.029
changing and making it a much much
better path forward thank you Anna

01:35:01.029 --> 01:35:01.039
better path forward thank you Anna
 

01:35:01.039 --> 01:35:08.890
better path forward thank you Anna
time for one more we have a question is

01:35:08.890 --> 01:35:08.900
time for one more we have a question is
 

01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:11.080
time for one more we have a question is
the increasing share of natural gas for

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:11.090
the increasing share of natural gas for
 

01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:13.299
the increasing share of natural gas for
power generation causing any shifts in

01:35:13.299 --> 01:35:13.309
power generation causing any shifts in
 

01:35:13.309 --> 01:35:14.770
power generation causing any shifts in
your priority for replacement and

01:35:14.770 --> 01:35:14.780
your priority for replacement and
 

01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:19.390
your priority for replacement and
upgrade of old infrastructure I think

01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:19.400
upgrade of old infrastructure I think
 

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:22.000
upgrade of old infrastructure I think
that's for uh no it's I guess it's for

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:22.010
that's for uh no it's I guess it's for
 

01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:27.580
that's for uh no it's I guess it's for
me I would say what's really you know we

01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:27.590
me I would say what's really you know we
 

01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:29.770
me I would say what's really you know we
we have changed our infrastructure

01:35:29.770 --> 01:35:29.780
we have changed our infrastructure
 

01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:33.189
we have changed our infrastructure
strategy almost completely around the

01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199
strategy almost completely around the
 

01:35:33.199 --> 01:35:34.899
strategy almost completely around the
environmental impacts I would say that

01:35:34.899 --> 01:35:34.909
environmental impacts I would say that
 

01:35:34.909 --> 01:35:37.359
environmental impacts I would say that
nothing more has more impact on how we

01:35:37.359 --> 01:35:37.369
nothing more has more impact on how we
 

01:35:37.369 --> 01:35:39.069
nothing more has more impact on how we
were and how we would have done it

01:35:39.069 --> 01:35:39.079
were and how we would have done it
 

01:35:39.079 --> 01:35:40.750
were and how we would have done it
versus how we're doing it

01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:40.760
versus how we're doing it
 

01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:43.810
versus how we're doing it
what pipes were replacing those old

01:35:43.810 --> 01:35:43.820
what pipes were replacing those old
 

01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:45.939
what pipes were replacing those old
pipes with and the ability to

01:35:45.939 --> 01:35:45.949
pipes with and the ability to
 

01:35:45.949 --> 01:35:48.759
pipes with and the ability to
potentially serve more gas to our

01:35:48.759 --> 01:35:48.769
potentially serve more gas to our
 

01:35:48.769 --> 01:35:51.430
potentially serve more gas to our
customers and bring more gas in I think

01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440
customers and bring more gas in I think
 

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.080
customers and bring more gas in I think
is is probably an answer to that

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:53.090
is is probably an answer to that
 

01:35:53.090 --> 01:35:55.779
is is probably an answer to that

01:35:55.779 --> 01:35:55.789
question we are thinking of the future
 

01:35:55.789 --> 01:35:58.810
question we are thinking of the future
of this region not the past how we used

01:35:58.810 --> 01:35:58.820
of this region not the past how we used
 

01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:01.330
of this region not the past how we used
it so we've got building capacity to

01:36:01.330 --> 01:36:01.340
it so we've got building capacity to
 

01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:02.799
it so we've got building capacity to
serve rural communities building

01:36:02.799 --> 01:36:02.809
serve rural communities building
 

01:36:02.809 --> 01:36:05.319
serve rural communities building

the downstream opportunities to say
we're not replacing pipe for pipe

01:36:14.199 --> 01:36:14.209
we're not replacing pipe for pipe
 

01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:16.359
we're not replacing pipe for pipe
we're actually looking at what the

01:36:16.359 --> 01:36:16.369
we're actually looking at what the
 

01:36:16.369 --> 01:36:19.000
we're actually looking at what the
future of this region looks like and we

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:19.010
future of this region looks like and we
 

01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:21.759
future of this region looks like and we
want infrastructure to be in place so

01:36:21.759 --> 01:36:21.769
want infrastructure to be in place so
 

01:36:21.769 --> 01:36:23.350
want infrastructure to be in place so
that as these opportunities come about

we can serve them else what I'm working
on that one well Anna noting that the

01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360
on that one well Anna noting that the
 

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.160

last panel ran over a little bit and bit

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:39.170
last panel ran over a little bit and bit
 

01:36:39.170 --> 01:36:40.839
last panel ran over a little bit and bit
into our time how about one more

01:36:40.839 --> 01:36:40.849
into our time how about one more
 

01:36:40.849 --> 01:36:46.449
into our time how about one more
question you've caught me off guard here

01:36:46.449 --> 01:36:46.459
question you've caught me off guard here
 

01:36:46.459 --> 01:36:49.179
question you've caught me off guard here
well let me let me acknowledge that the

01:36:49.179 --> 01:36:49.189
well let me let me acknowledge that the
 

01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:51.640
well let me let me acknowledge that the
moderator of the last session was also

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:51.650
moderator of the last session was also
 

01:36:51.650 --> 01:36:54.100
moderator of the last session was also
your boss so I guess that explains

01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:54.110
your boss so I guess that explains
 

01:36:54.110 --> 01:37:01.589
your boss so I guess that explains
celibate but what at mine that's right

01:37:01.589 --> 01:37:01.599
 
 

01:37:01.599 --> 01:37:04.179
 
so there's a couple of questions related

01:37:04.179 --> 01:37:04.189
so there's a couple of questions related
 

01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:07.359
so there's a couple of questions related
to pipelines okay and the export of this

01:37:07.359 --> 01:37:07.369
to pipelines okay and the export of this
 

01:37:07.369 --> 01:37:10.719
to pipelines okay and the export of this
fuel resource so are there any plans on

01:37:10.719 --> 01:37:10.729
fuel resource so are there any plans on
 

01:37:10.729 --> 01:37:13.239
fuel resource so are there any plans on
thinking about keeping that resource

01:37:13.239 --> 01:37:13.249
thinking about keeping that resource
 

01:37:13.249 --> 01:37:17.080
thinking about keeping that resource
here for both people and workforce and

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:17.090
here for both people and workforce and
 

01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:23.919
here for both people and workforce and
productivity good stays to restate my

01:37:23.919 --> 01:37:23.929
productivity good stays to restate my
 

01:37:23.929 --> 01:37:27.129
productivity good stays to restate my
earlier comment around how large the

01:37:27.129 --> 01:37:27.139
earlier comment around how large the
 

01:37:27.139 --> 01:37:32.859
earlier comment around how large the
resource is the McKinsey study that we

01:37:32.859 --> 01:37:32.869
resource is the McKinsey study that we
 

01:37:32.869 --> 01:37:35.799
resource is the McKinsey study that we
worked on did not model that it was

01:37:35.799 --> 01:37:35.809
worked on did not model that it was
 

01:37:35.809 --> 01:37:39.040
worked on did not model that it was
possible to use all that gas here and so

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:39.050
possible to use all that gas here and so
 

01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:44.049
possible to use all that gas here and so
it makes economic sense to export it out

01:37:44.049 --> 01:37:44.059
it makes economic sense to export it out
 

01:37:44.059 --> 01:37:47.140
it makes economic sense to export it out
of the region and if you can get it to

01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:47.150
of the region and if you can get it to
 

01:37:47.150 --> 01:37:50.379
of the region and if you can get it to
the Gulf Coast the gas can be liquefied

01:37:50.379 --> 01:37:50.389
the Gulf Coast the gas can be liquefied
 

01:37:50.389 --> 01:37:52.629
the Gulf Coast the gas can be liquefied
it can go on a barge and it can go to

01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639
it can go on a barge and it can go to
 

01:37:52.639 --> 01:37:54.819
it can go on a barge and it can go to
any demand center anywhere in the world

01:37:54.819 --> 01:37:54.829
any demand center anywhere in the world
 

01:37:54.829 --> 01:37:59.529
any demand center anywhere in the world
and so you know I think it's better to

01:37:59.529 --> 01:37:59.539
and so you know I think it's better to
 

01:37:59.539 --> 01:38:02.229
and so you know I think it's better to
capture as most economic value as you

01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239
capture as most economic value as you
 

01:38:02.239 --> 01:38:04.299
capture as most economic value as you
can in this region and that's what if

01:38:04.299 --> 01:38:04.309
can in this region and that's what if
 

01:38:04.309 --> 01:38:07.299
can in this region and that's what if
these strategies are successful but it's

01:38:07.299 --> 01:38:07.309
these strategies are successful but it's
 

01:38:07.309 --> 01:38:09.640
these strategies are successful but it's
actually you can't use all the gas here

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:09.650
actually you can't use all the gas here
 

01:38:09.650 --> 01:38:12.399
actually you can't use all the gas here
it's so big is what the study found yeah

01:38:12.399 --> 01:38:12.409
it's so big is what the study found yeah
 

01:38:12.409 --> 01:38:14.589
it's so big is what the study found yeah
I think one of the statistics that we

01:38:14.589 --> 01:38:14.599
I think one of the statistics that we
 

01:38:14.599 --> 01:38:17.300
I think one of the statistics that we
saw and I use this

01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:17.310
saw and I use this
 

01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:19.520
saw and I use this
I'm talking to governor wolf or anybody

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:19.530
I'm talking to governor wolf or anybody
 

01:38:19.530 --> 01:38:21.410
I'm talking to governor wolf or anybody
and Pat this is offense of the

01:38:21.410 --> 01:38:21.420
and Pat this is offense of the
 

01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:24.020
and Pat this is offense of the
regionalization that you've created but

01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:24.030
regionalization that you've created but
 

01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:25.430
regionalization that you've created but
if you just look at what's in

01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440
if you just look at what's in
 

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:28.370
if you just look at what's in
Pennsylvania of the Marcellus and Utica

01:38:28.370 --> 01:38:28.380
Pennsylvania of the Marcellus and Utica
 

01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:30.710
Pennsylvania of the Marcellus and Utica
and just in Pennsylvania it's enough to

01:38:30.710 --> 01:38:30.720
and just in Pennsylvania it's enough to
 

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.780
and just in Pennsylvania it's enough to
power to provide the United States its

01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:32.790
power to provide the United States its
 

01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:34.550
power to provide the United States its
entire energy needs so if there were no

01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560
entire energy needs so if there were no
 

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:36.860
entire energy needs so if there were no
other energy sources other than this for

01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:36.870
other energy sources other than this for
 

01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:39.950
other energy sources other than this for
like the next 15 years and so there's a

01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960
like the next 15 years and so there's a
 

01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:42.650
like the next 15 years and so there's a
lot of gas here and we're never gonna be

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:42.660
lot of gas here and we're never gonna be
 

01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:44.900
lot of gas here and we're never gonna be
able to utilize all of it here and I

01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:44.910
able to utilize all of it here and I
 

01:38:44.910 --> 01:38:47.030
able to utilize all of it here and I
think that's the obvious and I would

01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040
think that's the obvious and I would
 

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:48.500
think that's the obvious and I would
just add from an economic development

01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:48.510
just add from an economic development
 

01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:49.970
just add from an economic development
standpoint I said we're particularly

01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:49.980
standpoint I said we're particularly
 

01:38:49.980 --> 01:38:52.520

we're only at the very very very
beginning first steps so yeah I would

02:00:25.610 --> 02:00:25.620
beginning first steps so yeah I would
 

02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:27.140

02:00:31.730 --> 02:00:31.740
I think it's a trend that is that it
 

02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:35.240
I think it's a trend that is that it
will continue to grow I think it's very

02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:35.250
will continue to grow I think it's very

it's a very imprecise term so I always

02:00:39.250 --> 02:00:39.260
it's a very imprecise term so I always
 

02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:41.270
it's a very imprecise term so I always
when I get asked about impact investing

02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280
when I get asked about impact investing
 

02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:43.820
when I get asked about impact investing
I always try to understand what someone

02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:43.830
I always try to understand what someone
 

02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:46.310
I always try to understand what someone
means by that and there can be there are

02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320
means by that and there can be there are
 

02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:48.950
means by that and there can be there are
there are shades of what that means and

02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960
there are shades of what that means and
 

02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:50.120
there are shades of what that means and
I think some of those shades are

02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:50.130
I think some of those shades are
 

02:00:50.130 --> 02:00:51.980
I think some of those shades are
represented on this panel which is great

02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:51.990
represented on this panel which is great
 

02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:56.210
represented on this panel which is great

venture funds to take that approach so I

02:01:32.150 --> 02:01:32.160
venture funds to take that approach so I
 

02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:33.710

think there's a whole continuum and it's

think there's a whole continuum and it's
 

02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:36.470
think there's a whole continuum and it's
useful to describe it because I think

02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480
useful to describe it because I think
 

02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:40.580

not surrendering any returns I think

02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:51.590
not surrendering any returns I think
 

02:01:51.590 --> 02:01:52.660

that's where we're seeing the trend

that's where we're seeing the trend
 

02:01:52.670 --> 02:01:55.720
that's where we're seeing the trend
start and it will I think continue to

they replicate this I know they're

but I hope that universities are

02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:27.530
but I hope that universities are
 

02:03:27.530 --> 02:03:28.900
but I hope that universities are
starting to look at that also I think

02:03:28.900 --> 02:03:28.910
starting to look at that also I think
 

02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:35.370
starting to look at that also I think
it's a fantastic model

on this but the the question you know
 

02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:39.820
on this but the the question you know
the impact in how you define it and how

the impact in how you define it and how
 

02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:43.000

you measure it is basically nobody's

cracked the code on that there's not a

02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:45.230
cracked the code on that there's not a
 

02:04:45.230 --> 02:04:46.870
cracked the code on that there's not a
consistent framework there's not a

02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:46.880
consistent framework there's not a
 

02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:49.060
consistent framework there's not a
consistent methodology being pursued and

02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:49.070
consistent methodology being pursued and
 

02:04:49.070 --> 02:04:50.709
consistent methodology being pursued and
part of the issue is if you look at a

02:04:50.709 --> 02:04:50.719
part of the issue is if you look at a
 

02:04:50.719 --> 02:04:51.430
part of the issue is if you look at a
framework

02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:51.440
framework
 

02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:53.320
framework
yeah that's used let's say at a fortune

02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:53.330
yeah that's used let's say at a fortune
 

02:04:53.330 --> 02:04:56.530
yeah that's used let's say at a fortune
500 company like iris right that's a

02:04:56.530 --> 02:04:56.540
500 company like iris right that's a
 

02:04:56.540 --> 02:04:58.270
500 company like iris right that's a
retroactive look that's basically

02:04:58.270 --> 02:04:58.280
retroactive look that's basically
 

02:04:58.280 --> 02:05:00.490
retroactive look that's basically
telling you what's happened but you know

02:05:00.490 --> 02:05:00.500
telling you what's happened but you know
 

02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:02.380
telling you what's happened but you know
we're all dealing with technologies that

02:05:02.380 --> 02:05:02.390
we're all dealing with technologies that
 

02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:04.600
we're all dealing with technologies that
are coming out of the lab they're

02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:04.610
are coming out of the lab they're
 

02:05:04.610 --> 02:05:06.940
are coming out of the lab they're
nowhere near scale they're not near the

02:05:06.940 --> 02:05:06.950
nowhere near scale they're not near the
 

02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:09.250
nowhere near scale they're not near the
market or maybe they're just entering

02:05:09.250 --> 02:05:09.260
market or maybe they're just entering
 

02:05:09.260 --> 02:05:12.729
market or maybe they're just entering
the market you really to measure what

02:05:12.729 --> 02:05:12.739
the market you really to measure what
 

02:05:12.739 --> 02:05:14.950
the market you really to measure what
their potential impact will be kind of

02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960
their potential impact will be kind of
 

02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:18.250
their potential impact will be kind of
on a forward-looking basis is incredibly

02:05:18.250 --> 02:05:18.260
on a forward-looking basis is incredibly
 

02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:21.810
on a forward-looking basis is incredibly
difficult in the danger I think is that

02:05:21.810 --> 02:05:21.820
difficult in the danger I think is that
 

02:05:21.820 --> 02:05:24.550
difficult in the danger I think is that
there'll be a propagation of different

02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:24.560
there'll be a propagation of different
 

02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:26.200
there'll be a propagation of different
approaches and methodologies and

02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:26.210
approaches and methodologies and
 

02:05:26.210 --> 02:05:30.040
approaches and methodologies and
suddenly people will get concerned

02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:30.050
suddenly people will get concerned
 

02:05:30.050 --> 02:05:31.930
suddenly people will get concerned
because they don't know who to trust and

02:05:31.930 --> 02:05:31.940
because they don't know who to trust and
 

02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:34.030
because they don't know who to trust and
it may actually scare capital away from

02:05:34.030 --> 02:05:34.040
it may actually scare capital away from
 

02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:36.430
it may actually scare capital away from

02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:37.760
the space particularly those people who
are approaching

02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:37.770
are approaching
 

02:05:37.770 --> 02:05:41.600
are approaching
with an impact lens yeah I I agree and I

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:41.610
with an impact lens yeah I I agree and I
 

02:05:41.610 --> 02:05:43.910
with an impact lens yeah I I agree and I
mean I do a lot of work in a

02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920
mean I do a lot of work in a
 

02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:45.910
mean I do a lot of work in a
conservative part of the country and

02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920
conservative part of the country and
 

02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:50.350
conservative part of the country and
I've had to shift and its ROI first

02:05:50.350 --> 02:05:50.360
I've had to shift and its ROI first
 

02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:53.630
I've had to shift and its ROI first
impact second now impact what does that

02:05:53.630 --> 02:05:53.640
impact second now impact what does that
 

02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:55.790
impact second now impact what does that
mean yeah you want to have a positive

02:05:55.790 --> 02:05:55.800
mean yeah you want to have a positive
 

02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:59.420
mean yeah you want to have a positive
impact on society on the planet who

02:05:59.420 --> 02:05:59.430
impact on society on the planet who
 

02:05:59.430 --> 02:06:02.630
impact on society on the planet who
doesn't but at the end of the day it's

02:06:02.630 --> 02:06:02.640
doesn't but at the end of the day it's
 

02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:04.610
doesn't but at the end of the day it's
it's also about ROI people want to make

02:06:04.610 --> 02:06:04.620
it's also about ROI people want to make
 

02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:09.140
it's also about ROI people want to make
a return on their investment and I thing

02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:09.150
a return on their investment and I thing

a return on their investment and I thing
that I'm talking about now with some

02:06:10.820 --> 02:06:10.830
that I'm talking about now with some
 

02:06:10.830 --> 02:06:14.840
that I'm talking about now with some
folks is that everybody is admitting

02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:14.850
folks is that everybody is admitting
 

02:06:14.850 --> 02:06:16.700
folks is that everybody is admitting
that the climate is changing

02:06:16.700 --> 02:06:16.710
that the climate is changing
 

02:06:16.710 --> 02:06:18.650
that the climate is changing
they just can't say climate change even

02:06:18.650 --> 02:06:18.660
they just can't say climate change even
 

02:06:18.660 --> 02:06:20.870
they just can't say climate change even
Scott Pruett is saying but the climate

02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:20.880
Scott Pruett is saying but the climate
 

02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:23.270
Scott Pruett is saying but the climate
is changing okay we all we all know it

02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280
is changing okay we all we all know it
 

02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:27.410
is changing okay we all we all know it
it's baked in the data is there so why

02:06:27.410 --> 02:06:27.420
it's baked in the data is there so why
 

02:06:27.420 --> 02:06:31.130
it's baked in the data is there so why
aren't we moving faster and I think this

02:06:31.130 --> 02:06:31.140
aren't we moving faster and I think this
 

02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:35.450
aren't we moving faster and I think this
is the biggest arbitrage in human

02:06:35.450 --> 02:06:35.460
is the biggest arbitrage in human
 

02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:39.080
is the biggest arbitrage in human
history for for what's gonna take place

02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:39.090
history for for what's gonna take place
 

02:06:39.090 --> 02:06:41.600
history for for what's gonna take place
over the coming years because if we

02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:41.610
over the coming years because if we
 

02:06:41.610 --> 02:06:44.380
over the coming years because if we
don't change the planet's gonna force

02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:44.390
don't change the planet's gonna force
 

02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:46.820
don't change the planet's gonna force
governments to change and that's gonna

02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:46.830
governments to change and that's gonna
 

02:06:46.830 --> 02:06:51.590
governments to change and that's gonna
lead to a huge amount of capital flow

02:06:51.590 --> 02:06:51.600
lead to a huge amount of capital flow
 

02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:55.790
lead to a huge amount of capital flow
deal flow towards these industries so

02:06:55.790 --> 02:06:55.800
deal flow towards these industries so
 

02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:58.550
deal flow towards these industries so
for me that's the way I've I've started

02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560
for me that's the way I've I've started
 

02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:01.180
for me that's the way I've I've started

let me kind of add the Wall Street

02:07:03.110 --> 02:07:03.120
let me kind of add the Wall Street
 

02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:06.200
let me kind of add the Wall Street
perspective right so again we we have a

02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:06.210
perspective right so again we we have a
 

02:07:06.210 --> 02:07:09.110
perspective right so again we we have a
broker-dealer so not only we've done

02:07:09.110 --> 02:07:09.120
broker-dealer so not only we've done
 

02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:11.270
broker-dealer so not only we've done
seed investment but we also have talked

02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280
seed investment but we also have talked
 

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:13.550
seed investment but we also have talked

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.900
because of the shale revolution
frankly and I I think that is a trend

02:20:39.900 --> 02:20:39.910
frankly and I I think that is a trend
 

02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:43.320
frankly and I I think that is a trend
not to take lightly obviously and when

02:20:43.320 --> 02:20:43.330
not to take lightly obviously and when
 

02:20:43.330 --> 02:20:44.880
not to take lightly obviously and when
you think about long-term price on

02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:44.890
you think about long-term price on
 

02:20:44.890 --> 02:20:47.519
you think about long-term price on
natural gas the other to think about is

02:20:47.519 --> 02:20:47.529
natural gas the other to think about is
 

02:20:47.529 --> 02:20:50.130
natural gas the other to think about is
when electrification of light vehicles

02:20:50.130 --> 02:20:50.140
when electrification of light vehicles
 

02:20:50.140 --> 02:20:54.179
when electrification of light vehicles
takes over and demand for oil drops now

02:20:54.179 --> 02:20:54.189
takes over and demand for oil drops now
 

02:20:54.189 --> 02:20:56.670
takes over and demand for oil drops now
you're gonna see oil become super cheap

02:20:56.670 --> 02:20:56.680
you're gonna see oil become super cheap
 

02:20:56.680 --> 02:20:59.280
you're gonna see oil become super cheap
so if you're a biofuels play trying to

02:20:59.280 --> 02:20:59.290
so if you're a biofuels play trying to
 

02:20:59.290 --> 02:21:00.690
so if you're a biofuels play trying to
compete with super cheap natural gas

02:21:00.690 --> 02:21:00.700
compete with super cheap natural gas
 

02:21:00.700 --> 02:21:02.820
compete with super cheap natural gas
super cheap oil good luck

02:21:02.820 --> 02:21:02.830
