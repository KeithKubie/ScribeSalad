&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Next is Jessie Daniels, Professor
of Sociology at Hunter College.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.990
She studies race and
digital media technologies.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.600
And she is going to share a story

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.960
about how some library
collections can be manipulated

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.550
by hate groups online
with her presentation

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.680
"Extremists in the Archive."

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.980
Jessie.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.000
&gt;&gt; Jessie Daniels: Thanks,
it's great to be here.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.150
I'm here today to talk to you
about extremists in the archive.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.610
And part of what my research
has led me to believe is

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.960
that you can't understand the
world in which we live today

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.870
without understanding
white supremacy.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.960
And by that I mean, both the system
of ideas that sets white people

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.050
above all others and
also the extremist groups

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.640
that I've encountered in some
of my research in the archive.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.260
The first thing that I want to
share with you is this slide.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.600
This is from an extremist
website that I found

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.230
that was called American
civil rights review.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.000
And I actually came upon it
because it was discovered

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.930
by a college student
of mine where I taught

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.160 position:56%
in suburban Long Island at the time.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.000
This was in 2008.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.290
And part of what this
website was arguing

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.090
through white supremacists lens
was that slavery was not that bad.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.000
And they were using Library
of Congress materials,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.760 position:56%
a digital archive of the WPA project

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.130
that interviewed formerly enslaved
people, to make that argument.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.020
So I want to talk about some

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.740
of the unintended consequences
of digitizing archives.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.040
And I want to tell the story

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.850
of how I discovered this
website and how we got to here.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.570
So I want to tell you a
little bit about my research.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.270
In the '90s, I started --
actually in the late '80s,

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.160
but I started publishing in
1997 some research I had done

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.620
on a physical printed
archive of newsletters

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.190
from six different extremist
organizations, including the KKK

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.880
and actually David
Duke's organization,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.600
a bunch of different ones.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.280
And to do this research --
this was my dissertation

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.170
and then became my first book.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.470
To do this research,
I had to travel.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.900
I drove seven hours from where
I was in school at Austin,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.100
Texas, to Montgomery, Alabama.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.320
Where the Southern Poverty Law
Center keeps what they call a clan

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.620
watch archive.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.240
They keep a trove of
these printed newsletters

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.910
of these extremist groups.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.670 position:56%
And I drove there and stood over a
copy machine for three or four days.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.470
And through their generosity,
developed my archive

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.160
for the first publication.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.310
In that research what I argued was

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.490
that white supremacist
rhetoric is gendered.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.560
And by that I mean, that
the things that they say

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.000
about race often have
some other message

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.290
about masculinity or
femininity in them.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.370
I was particularly
fascinated by the way

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.190
that they talked about white men.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.230
And I'll say more about
that in one second.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.900
The second argument I made,
which I think is relevant today,

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.330
is that white supremacist rhetoric
is similar to mainstream political

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.630
and popular culture rhetoric.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.630
So looking at those extremist
publications, I compared them

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.040
to the mainstream rhetoric
at the time of politicians

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.220 position:56%
like Pat Buchanan and Bill
Clinton, to be completely bipartisan

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.380
about it, and also looked
at popular culture themes.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.440
And there was a lot of
resonance between the two.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.270
So I argued that they
were similar in some ways.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.950
And then about the gendered
argument, it sort of came together

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.840
with the argument that
they're similar

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.060
to the mainstream in
an image like this.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.420
So not only did I look at the
text, I also looked at the images

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.290
and line drawings and these
whites supremacist publications.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.180
This one is from Tom Metzger's
White Aryan Resistance Publication.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.990
And what you see here is a
line drawing of a white man.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.620
He's wearing a baseball cap,
I don't know that it's red.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.460
But he has on a construction vest.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.960
And in the background are bridges
and cities and an airplane.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.140
The message here is that
white men built this nation

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.230
and white men are this nation.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.470
And my argument about
the mainstream,

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.530
you can see in a more
recent example from --

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.940
this is the History Channel, right.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.640
They're doing a series on
the Men who Built America.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.200
The American economy was linked
by railroads, fueled by oil,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.500
and built by steel, right.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.770
The same kind of rhetoric.

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.980
And my argument about white
supremacy is that it erases

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.420
and ignores the labor of people
of color, of Native Americans

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.720
who were in this land before.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.140
So that's the work
that I did early on.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.980
Then the Internet happened.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.750
Now, I know for those of
you sitting in this session,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.260
you know that the Internet
happened well before 1997.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.180
But it was really starting
to take off in higher ed,

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.500
and I started using the Internet
in my classes and teaching with it.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.000
I also began wondering how was the
Internet changing white supremacy.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.810
I kept following those same groups
that I had looked at and analyzed

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.220
in the printed publication,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.170
and I wanted to know how it
was changing those groups.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.780
So I started work on the second
book, called Cyber Racism,

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.570
and part of what I found
is that instead of having

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.300 position:56%
to drive seven hours to the
Southern Poverty Law Center archive,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.200
the white supremacist rhetoric

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.540
that I had studied before was
now much easier to access, right.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.340
I could find it in my living
room and dial it up that way.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.800
It was also global, so that
people were making connections

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.350
across the globe around
white supremacy.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.740
And it was more participatory.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.220
People were contributing
their own takes on it.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.140
But the point is it made
my research much easier

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.790
and it also made it easier
for these groups to connect.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.740
So this is one of the places that
I studied in the cyber racism book.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.980
This is Stormfront, you
may have heard of it.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.910
It's the longest running white
supremacist portal online.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.180
And I spent lots of hours
there so you don't have to.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.160
When I finished research
for the book in 2008,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.370
they had about 129,000
registered users.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.660
When I checked last
week, there at 325,683.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.160
And that number only
goes up, or it has so far

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.390
since I've been researching it.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.640 position:56%
On the night President Obama was
elected in 2008, so many people went

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.850
to Stormfront that they
crashed the servers there.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.780
So I was concerned about
the extremist groups,

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.920
but I equally I was
concerned about my students.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.270
I was teaching at the time

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.670
in a suburban private
university on Long Island.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.610
And I was concerned
about how they were going

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.380 position:56%
to stumble upon white supremacist
rhetoric online just in their course

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.150
of doing research for their term
papers and that sort of thing.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.550
So I want to tell this one
story about taking my students

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.390
on Long Island into a computer lab.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.940
This is in the early '90s.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.240
It was before Google even.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.010
That'll tell you how
long ago it was.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.680
And so we were using different
kinds of search engines: Yahoo,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.570
AltaVista -- what's another one?

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.960
Anyway, lots of different
search engines

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.610
that have gone by the wayside now.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.090
Two students come in
and one student typed.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.780
The first thing that
that student typed

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.480 position:56%
in was KKK.com into a search engine.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.870
And the next student, another
student in that same class,

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.140
typed in Martin Luther
King into a search engine.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.100
They both ended up at
white supremacist sites.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.470
And I said, that's
really what I'm interested

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.830
in in this work is understanding
my students' search patterns

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.920
and how they might stumble upon
white supremacist rhetoric.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.180
Now, this is one of the
sites, this is the site

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.480
that my student came upon.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.250 position:56%
And how I found it was through them.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.920 position:56%
This is what I refer to, it
appears to be a tribute to Dr. King,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.290
but in fact, it's run by
Stormfront, that large portal

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.330
that I showed you just previously.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:48.550
So this is what I came to
call a cloaked website.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.110
Like the one that I started the
presentation with that was talking

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.730
about slavery, what both of
these sites and lots of others

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.640
that I could tell you
about later do is

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.100
that they intentionally
disguise authorship in order

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.010
to conceal a political
agenda, right.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:10.140
In some ways these cloaked websites
were precursors to today's news.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.410
Part of what makes them difficult
to decipher is it's not clear

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.140
who is publishing them and
what their point of view is.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.000
So this was especially difficult
for my students in college classes,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.190
even though we were talking about
some of these issues already,

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.240 position:56%
they struggle to make sense of them.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.170
So this is what I decided
to do in terms

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.750
of my research is I would ask
young people, actually younger

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.050
than college students -- so I
recruited participants who were 15

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:41.530
to 19 years old, all from New York,
all from fairly good high schools.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.200
And ask them to try and make
sense of these search results.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.090
Like if they searched for
information on Dr. King

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.090
and they came across this site,
how would they make sense of it.

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:54.980
And then, I also asked them
to evaluate pairs of websites.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.190
So I would pair a cloaked site

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:01.600
with a legitimate civil
rights organization site.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.370
So this is a pairing here of a
Martin Luther King cloak site

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.060
and then the site from the
King family and their archive

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.000
of King's papers and
that sort of thing.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.870
And then the second pairing
I did was actually a Library

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.170
of Congress site.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.170
I paired that cloaked site, the
American civil rights review

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.850
that has the slavery information
from WPA, with the Voices

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.560
of Civil Rights, which was created
and hosted here at the Library

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.510 position:56%
of Congress, and asked young people,
so how would you make sense of this.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.840
So what I found was interesting
in terms of their understanding

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.140
of this material and
how they made sense

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.470
of information from the archive.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.780 position:56%
The first thing, and this is the
bright spot and the encouraging part

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.530
of my talk, which is that
they were very savvy.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:53.400 position:56%
Even in a 2007/2008 when I was doing
this analysis, they were very savvy

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.870
about the way that
websites looked, right.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.940
They picked up on graphic
user interface.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.760
They picked up on colors that
were not good and on fonts

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.440
that were not clear or
didn't look sophisticated.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.730 position:56%
This one a young person said, this
site looks like someone, you know --

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.860
just an individual created it, it
doesn't look very professional.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.710
So she said she wouldn't trust it,

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.170
wouldn't trust the
information there, right.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.670
So the good news is that
they're very sophisticated

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.050
about the look of sites.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.160
The bad news, as we know now,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.670
is that all it takes really is
a much better graphic designer

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:27.000
to fool someone with information.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.290 position:56%
So the other thing that I asked them
about was the content of the site.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.620
So beyond the look of the site,
how do you evaluate the content

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.040
that you're looking at there.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.200
And this is a page further
into that one about slavery.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.910
And what's interesting, what
I wanted to point out here is

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:46.730 position:56%
that part of what this white
supremacist Joe Weltner had done was

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.200
to -- sorry, Frank Weltner.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.530
What he had done was he had taken
this language of multiculturalism,

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:58.520
of forgotten black voices,
and then taken the WPA quotes

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.780
of formerly enslaved people --
who would say things like, yes,

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.810
we were allowed to grow
vegetables when we were enslaved .

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.200
And takes those out of
context and reframes them

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.200
in a white supremacist
context, right.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.040
For some of the young
people I talked to,

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.160 position:56%
this was very hard to make sense of.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.200
And this is some of what they said.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.990
One young person said, I mean --

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.640
looking at this site
I just showed you.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.560
I mean, I don't think I
would disagree with it.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.270
I'm sure there are some
slaves that were treated well,

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.080
so I can understand
their point of view.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.150
There's always two
sides to everything.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:33.740 position:56%
Now, as an educator, this is a
little horrifying, and I'm sure some

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.040
of you share that as well.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.760
One of the other participants
I talked to read this material

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.800
and said, I don't know about this
because I've read other things

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.170
about slavery, and I know that
that this isn't true, right.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.620
So she was able through
a kind of, you know,

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.180
what I would call a burgeoning
critical race consciousness

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.750
to make sense of this
site through other things

00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.350
that she had read outside
the context of that one site.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:04.570
So in conclusion, I
just want to say this.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:10.020
So my research really sits,
kind of by accident in a way,

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.240
on either side of the
Internet, right.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.190
This analysis in the printed only
newsletters of white supremacists

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.150
and then in the Internet
era of their work.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:23.560
And what I can tell you is that,
whether in a printed archive

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.180
at the Southern Poverty Law
Center, or in a digital archive

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:31.980 position:56%
at the Library of Congress, the
goal of white supremacy is the same.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.240
Both before and after the Internet.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.320
And that is to roll back
hard-won social, legal,

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.920
political, and moral victories.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:48.560
And what we know is that the
Internet and digital archives,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.990
unfortunately, make
this even easier.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:52.790
Thanks very much.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:56.050
[applause].

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.690
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
