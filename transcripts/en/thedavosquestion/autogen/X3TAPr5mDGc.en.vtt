My name is Maria Angela Villalba from the
Philippines.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.350
I run the political enterprise for Unlad Kabayan,
it's a very lofty one.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.320
Now, the question of, "Will geopolitical conflicts
outweigh the economic prices in East Asia"

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.000
is a difficult question.
And it really depends, one, on how long this

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.540
economic crisis will last. If it deepens,
it can be an area that people will concentrate

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.370
on.
However, if there is a recovery and the geopolitical

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.620
conflicts intensify, as it is, for instance
in Pakistan, North Korea, in Japan, and here

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.159
we have a brewing thing in Iran.
Now if these develop any faster, and the recovery

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.410
in the economy, the recovery in the developing
resources, for global areas, those areas of

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.380
conflict, we can gather those, for cooperation.
Involve the players in the global economy

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.920
who care, like Britain, and that is for the
players, to really win a new war.
