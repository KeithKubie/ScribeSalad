00:00:07.296 --> 00:00:09.736
&gt;&gt;Katherine: How often do
you use a device like this,

00:00:09.736 --> 00:00:14.206
as opposed to the mountain tops
when there's an emergency situation?

00:00:14.706 --> 00:00:18.056
&gt;&gt;Emergencies that happen outside of
our range of coverage right now, we--

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:20.056
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Every Tuesday
and Thursday afternoon,

00:00:20.296 --> 00:00:23.006
High Tech High junior
Katie Anderson reports

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.156
in at San Diego police
headquarters for her internship.

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:27.796
&gt;&gt;So would this work
in a moving vehicle?

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.226
&gt;&gt;Yes, it would, as long as
you're within line of sight

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:31.726
and the antennas are near a window.

00:00:32.396 --> 00:00:34.856
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Anderson is working
with the public safety department

00:00:34.856 --> 00:00:36.186
to improve communications

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:39.296
with helicopter pilots
flying emergency missions,

00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:42.466
like tracking carjackers
and fighting wildfires.

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:43.636
&gt;&gt;Katherine: So it's just two passes.

00:00:43.636 --> 00:00:45.976
It's this one, and
then you do it again,

00:00:45.976 --> 00:00:48.896
but it's bumped twenty two
point five degrees to--

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:51.526
&gt;&gt;Sara: Right, What I care
about are these holes.

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:53.826
&gt;&gt;Hi Katie, I've got
something for you.

00:00:53.826 --> 00:00:54.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Working with adults

00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:57.946
in real world settings is a core
design principle of High Tech High.

00:00:59.196 --> 00:01:02.016
&gt;&gt;The academic internship program
is a program that each and every one

00:01:02.016 --> 00:01:05.346
of our students has the
opportunity to participate in.

00:01:05.346 --> 00:01:06.976
In fact, it's a graduation
requirement.

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.466
We send about a hundred and
fifty students per semester

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.076
out into a real wide
variety of internship sites,

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.246
and in a wide variety of industries.

00:01:15.696 --> 00:01:17.516
&gt;&gt;Sara: The golden
rule is this bridge.

00:01:17.836 --> 00:01:19.936
&gt;&gt;Stacey: It provides them
the opportunity to develop

00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:21.526
and foster relationships with adults

00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:24.206
that typically eleventh graders
don't have the opportunity to do.

00:01:24.206 --> 00:01:26.516
&gt;&gt;And so there are some
challenges out there.

00:01:26.516 --> 00:01:26.646
&gt;&gt;Katherine: Okay.

00:01:26.726 --> 00:01:29.726
&gt;&gt;So we look at your plan and
come up with a different solution.

00:01:30.136 --> 00:01:32.836
&gt;&gt;Stacey: Because High Tech
High is a project based school,

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.746
we really take our
internships to the next level.

00:01:36.106 --> 00:01:38.126
We train our mentors and we push them

00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:40.026
to really empower our
eleventh grade students to work

00:01:40.026 --> 00:01:41.896
on meaningful projects
for their organization.

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:46.076
&gt;&gt;Katherine: I mean, how often
does it bounce off the geography

00:01:46.076 --> 00:01:46.596
in the right way?

00:01:46.676 --> 00:01:49.916
Because most of the time, our
helicopters are below the receivers.

00:01:50.096 --> 00:01:53.416
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The internships
include a two week immersion period

00:01:53.416 --> 00:01:54.936
in the middle of the semester.

00:01:55.426 --> 00:01:57.546
&gt;&gt;Katherine: This is the first
year that they're having immersion,

00:01:57.636 --> 00:02:01.656
so I'm here nine to four
for two weeks and I think

00:02:01.656 --> 00:02:02.786
that it's really great as well.

00:02:02.786 --> 00:02:04.576
It gives me a chance
to get a lot done.

00:02:04.636 --> 00:02:06.056
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For the
rest of the semester,

00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:08.896
Katie spends two afternoons
a week on site.

00:02:09.436 --> 00:02:13.326
&gt;&gt;Sara: Now what do you think about
his concept of flying two heights?

00:02:13.326 --> 00:02:17.716
&gt;&gt;Katherine: I don't like it
because they'll just be hovering

00:02:17.716 --> 00:02:21.796
between a thousand feet and a little
above five hundred feet, right?

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:24.526
&gt;&gt;From the very first day we
started taking her to meetings,

00:02:24.526 --> 00:02:26.186
she's asked great questions.

00:02:26.186 --> 00:02:28.896
She understands the engineering

00:02:28.896 --> 00:02:30.806
and the science behind
what we're trying to do.

00:02:30.806 --> 00:02:34.966
&gt;&gt;Katherine: So if you're mountain
top is here, then this would be--

00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:37.346
this is an aerial view, but
this would be your normal bubble

00:02:37.346 --> 00:02:37.976
of coverage.

00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:40.896
And I'm trying to figure
out where bubbles are,

00:02:40.896 --> 00:02:42.276
where there wouldn't be coverage--

00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:45.386
&gt;&gt;Sara: It's not like we're
having to explain physics to her.

00:02:45.386 --> 00:02:48.806
She already knows a lot of
that, and what she doesn't know,

00:02:48.806 --> 00:02:51.086
she goes on the internet
and researches.

00:02:51.226 --> 00:02:55.396
&gt;&gt;But then Hugh is also putting
in what's called a quad receiver,

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:59.356
which can be angled, so you
get something like this.

00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:01.436
So he wants to know the
range of that as well.

00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:05.106
&gt;&gt;Sara: We're getting a lot
out of this, and her project is

00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:07.566
to build a map that will be used

00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:10.836
by every public safety
agency in the county.

00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:14.156
In the end, when the big one breaks
out, the next natural disaster

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:16.126
or fire, we're going to
go to the map Katie made.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:21.586
So it's gonna be a valuable
project for years to come.

00:03:22.656 --> 00:03:24.616
