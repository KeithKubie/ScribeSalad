ELIZABETH CRONISE
MCLAUGHLIN: Hi.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.569
So it's a privilege to be here.

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:11.402
Thank you all for taking
your time today out

00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:13.360
of your busy day to hear
me talk about warrior

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.430
women in leadership.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.950
Excuse me.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.770
And I'm getting over a little
bit of a cold so if I cough,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.686
I hope you understand.

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:21.094
I'm armed and dangerous
with water up here.

00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:23.260
So this is a topic that's
near and dear to my heart.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.676
I've been doing
women's leadership

00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:26.250
work for really my whole life.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.027
But in my corporate
environment, our Gaia Project

00:00:29.027 --> 00:00:30.610
for Women's Leadership
arm really goes

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.790
into corporations like Google
and plenty of other places,

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.497
and helps women
leaders to achieve.

00:00:35.497 --> 00:00:38.080
One of the things that's really
key to where we find ourselves

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.955
right now, though, at
this moment in history,

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:41.950
is that, as you all
know, we're in the midst

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.255
of a massive cultural shift.

00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:45.970
Really a tectonic shift
in women's leadership.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.620
And that means certain
things right now

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.510
for what women leaders
are doing and the way

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.070
in which we're
operating that is very

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.395
different from the messages
that we've had before.

00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:56.020
And the ways in which leadership
has functioned before as well,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.145
because we're having more
influence than we've ever

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:01.820
had before on the leadership
of companies, institutions,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.569
governments-- not withstanding
where we find ourselves

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.980
at the moment.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.440
And also that we are
in a position where

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.680
our skills as women leaders are
influencing how corporations

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.880
function generally.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.940
So we're going to talk
through today warrior

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.250
women in leadership as
it stands right now,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.460
and give you guys some really
practical tools to walk away

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.007
from in terms of
what this means,

00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:25.090
and what it means for
leadership and what it means

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.256
for professional development,
and also what it means

00:01:27.256 --> 00:01:29.620
for our culture and our world.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.480
One of the things that
I want to just start

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.390
with is, what is a warrior
woman in leadership?

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.320
What does that look
like right now?

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.740
So when I talk about warrior
women, what I'm talking about

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.020
is how we have armed
ourselves for change

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.900
in this corporate and
cultural environment

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.046
that we're in right now.

00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:46.420
Warrior women in
leadership to me

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.760
is about an activist model
of women's leadership.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.260
And we're going to
talk through what

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.420
that looks like in the
context of your everyday.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.090
But we've seen more and
more women really rising

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.120
to create change, especially
in the last 12 months,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.390
I think for obvious reasons.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.098
And we're also obviously,
as I mentioned,

00:02:01.098 --> 00:02:02.740
seeing major cultural
shifts right now.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.840
So one of the things
that is important

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.030
when we talk about warrior
women in leadership

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.979
is the historic
backward-looking viewpoint

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.479
of where we find ourselves.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.700
So traditional masculine
models of leadership

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.520
generally only measure
two metrics that matter.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.892
The time that we invest
and how much money we make,

00:02:17.892 --> 00:02:20.350
whether that's the money we
make for ourselves or the money

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.960
that we make for others.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.290
And those models are
really difficult for women

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.540
to rise within for a
variety of reasons.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.700
Because many of us
choose to have children,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.340
because many of us historically
also do so much more

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.980
work at home than we
do out in the world.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.490
And the metrics that we
measure our success by also

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.224
are different, because
generally speaking, we're

00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:44.140
more concerned with the
quality of our lives--

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.806
and this is a broad
overgeneralization--

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:48.652
but we're more concerned the
quality of our lives in total.

00:02:48.652 --> 00:02:50.110
And this is why we
don't often hear

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.234
men talking about work/life
balance in the same way

00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:53.800
that we do women--

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.370
than men tend to be.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.030
And so one of the things that
is important to think about here

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.261
is, who do we have as
role models for warrior

00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:01.510
women in leadership look like?

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.910
Or what women leaders
look like generally.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.820
And as I talked
through warrior women

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.070
as a concept in the
first stages of getting

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.690
ready for this talk,
one of the things

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.290
that really struck me is that
going back in our history,

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.290
women in general have
lost a lot of our history.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.730
It's been erased
and there's a lot

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.340
that's been written
about this generally.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.790
I really encourage
you to look at it

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.880
because you'll be amazed by what
has been wiped from the history

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.570
books.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.640
But we have had stories
going all the way back

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.240
to the Odyssey of how
men go through journeys

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.010
that make them leaders.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.590
The hero's journey is
a trope that we're all

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.242
deeply familiar with.

00:03:34.242 --> 00:03:35.950
And one of the things
that we haven't had

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.800
historically is the
journey of a heroine.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.680
What does the journey
of a woman look

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.957
like when we are progressing
toward our highest leadership?

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:47.290
And so one of the things that
I want to start with today

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.415
is a discussion of what
the heroine's journey might

00:03:49.415 --> 00:03:51.880
look like in the
context of the history

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.020
that we know of from
the hero's journey.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.499
So the heroine's journey is
one that, as an initial matter,

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:58.540
I want to say this about.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.502
It's not like we go
through this journey once.

00:04:00.502 --> 00:04:02.710
One of the things that the
studies show about the way

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.310
that women learn, for instance,
is that we learn cyclically,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.520
generally, much more than we
learn in a linear fashion.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.860
And so you may have noticed
that my corporate logo,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.397
for instance, is a spiral.

00:04:13.397 --> 00:04:14.480
There's a reason for that.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.360
It's because the
journey that we are

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.120
on as women leaders continues
to cycle around over and over

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.760
again.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.468
So what I'm going to
share with you today

00:04:21.468 --> 00:04:23.470
in the context of this
journey is something

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.852
that I want to make very clear.

00:04:24.852 --> 00:04:26.560
You're not just going
to go through once.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.280
Some heroine's journeys are
harder than others, right?

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.200
We're in a particular
one as a culture

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.690
right now for women leaders
that is quite brutal,

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.370
I think we can all agree.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.760
And yet at the same time,
we cycle back continuously

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.770
to learn over and over
again the things that we

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.270
need to learn on our path.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.490
So as you think through
this for yourself

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.710
in the context of what this
might mean for your life,

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.126
as you think through
what it might

00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:51.820
mean for you in the
context of the women

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.690
you know and the
women you work with,

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.450
please remember that
it's not like this

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.250
is all just an
over and done game.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.980
I wish it was It would probably
be a lot easier on all of us.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.524
So where we start
the warrior woman

00:05:01.524 --> 00:05:03.190
journey, the heroine's
journey, is first

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.660
in the place of illusion.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.010
And when we think about
women's leadership,

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.130
this is the place where
we talk about conformity.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.810
So it's the idea that if
we dress a certain way,

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.797
if we lean in enough.

00:05:16.797 --> 00:05:18.630
And don't get me wrong,
I'm a fan of Sheryl,

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.860
but I have to say I have very
strong opinions about what

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.401
"Lean In" has done
for women leaders,

00:05:22.401 --> 00:05:24.260
and they're not all very good.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.680
If we show up in the right
way as assertive but not

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.870
too assertive, as opinionated
but not too opinionated.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.180
If we smile enough, if we
are people-pleasing enough,

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.261
we will get along just fine
in these traditional masculine

00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:39.260
leadership environments.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.872
That is the place of illusion.

00:05:40.872 --> 00:05:42.830
And I'm going to talk
through a little bit more

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.455
what this looks like
in greater detail,

00:05:44.455 --> 00:05:46.163
but this is where we
started our journey.

00:05:46.163 --> 00:05:47.780
With the belief that
if we cope, if we

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.730
have coping skills
that work for us,

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.196
then everything will be fine.

00:05:52.196 --> 00:05:53.570
Unfortunately, I
think many of us

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.944
can recognize that that's
generally not the way it works.

00:05:55.944 --> 00:05:58.310
And so the next stage
on the heroine's journey

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.662
is the stage of betrayal.

00:05:59.662 --> 00:06:01.370
And this is the place
where you recognize

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.530
that your coping
mechanisms have failed you.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.620
That you can still do it
all, and do it all in the way

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.740
that we've been told you have
to do it to succeed as a woman,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.690
and still not have it happen.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.320
And part of that is
systemic, and part of that

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.209
is because we've been
taught that this is

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:18.500
the only way that we can do it.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.895
Don't worry, we're going
deeper into all of this.

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:22.520
The next stage of
the heroine's journey

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.690
is the one of awakening.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.527
And this is really
the place of choice.

00:06:25.527 --> 00:06:27.110
You have a choice
about whether or not

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.730
you're going to just
continue coping,

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.438
or you have a choice
about whether or not

00:06:30.438 --> 00:06:32.060
you're going to rise and fight.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.070
And I don't necessarily mean
this in the Wonder Woman way,

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.486
but that's kind of a nice
little image to get in your head

00:06:36.486 --> 00:06:37.400
if you would care to.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.150
The awakening is the
moment of recognizing

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.930
that where we have been
can no longer continue

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.180
and where we are going has
to be something different,

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.280
and we are the
agent of that change

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.260
either individually
or collectively.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.910
Then comes the descent.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.700
And this is the really
kind of not nice place

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.500
in the heroine's journey.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.980
This is the place where we
start to recognize the cost.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.960
And we recognize
the cost of what

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.180
we have paid to get
where we are currently,

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.820
we recognize the cost
of continuing to fight,

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.770
we recognize that
nothing is ever

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.390
going to quite be the same
from where we find ourselves.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.870
And by the way, this all may
sound very culturally familiar

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.810
in terms of where we find
ourselves right now as well.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.390
And it is the place where
we choose our tools.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.920
And before we leave
today, I'm going

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.680
to talk through what some of
these tools a.k.a. weapons

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.570
might look like in the context
of warrior women in leadership.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.240
But it is a place
where we determine

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.830
what it is that we need
to succeed in a new model.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.634
The descent.

00:07:33.634 --> 00:07:35.550
The pit at the bottom
of the heroine's journey

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:36.600
is the hurricane.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.050
This is the place where we
experience the maelstrom

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.569
of transformation.

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:43.110
Some of you who
follow me on Facebook

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.480
know that I have this thing that
I talk about in terms of where

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.710
we are culturally
right now, which is

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.090
the cauldron of transformation.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.970
The way it feels like everything
is on fire, we're boiling,

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.370
so much is changing in our
culture and in our world right

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.810
now, and in our nation.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.270
And it's swirling all around us.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.770
The dangerous point
of the hurricane

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.360
is that sometimes there
are points of relief.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.820
It's like the eye of the storm
and we're like, oh, maybe

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:03.780
it's not quite so bad.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.029
Maybe I can let my guard down.

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:06.577
Maybe I don't have
to fight so hard.

00:08:06.577 --> 00:08:08.160
And then lo and
behold, the next thing

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.600
you know, the next
day you're back in it

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.040
and we're off to
the races again.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.623
So the hurricane is
really the bottom,

00:08:12.623 --> 00:08:16.650
and it's where we need the
most tools that we can possibly

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.860
prepare ourselves for.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.962
The next stage is loss.

00:08:19.962 --> 00:08:21.920
And this is really the
place where we come face

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.900
to face with the
grief of what we

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.110
have to sacrifice
in order to move on

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.067
to a new way of doing things.

00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:29.900
This is a place, by the
way, that many of us

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.929
find ourselves in right now.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.059
As I mentioned, I host
this daily broadcast

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.860
on Facebook called
Resistance Live,

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.780
and just last night I
had to post something

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.498
about I know everybody
feels like they're

00:08:40.498 --> 00:08:42.289
in a pit of despair
and in the pit of grief

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.497
based on what has happened
in the last couple of days

00:08:44.497 --> 00:08:45.680
in our nation.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.290
Please recognize
the grief is real,

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.500
and also recognize that
this place that we're in

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.330
is not going to last forever.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.370
Lost on the heroine's
journey necessarily

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.380
leads to intervention.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.311
Now some of you who may know
the historic heroes journeys

00:09:00.311 --> 00:09:02.060
may recognize this is
the point where like

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.710
the gods send in the tools.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.730
Right?

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.410
You know, Zeus kind of throws
down the lightning bolts

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.201
and all of a sudden
everything gets better.

00:09:08.201 --> 00:09:10.130
In our case, intervention
is actually really

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.300
about connection.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.300
Because it's about
taking on our own agency

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.300
and connecting with other
women to move forward.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.670
And again, we're going
to talk through this

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:17.782
in a bit more depth.

00:09:17.782 --> 00:09:19.490
But intervention is
the moment of change.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.890
It's a moment where we
adopt our own agency

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.910
and step forward to
make the world more

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.300
of what we want as women.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.609
And then rebirth.

00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:30.650
That's the place where we
really build the future

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.525
and continue to move
forward toward the world

00:09:32.525 --> 00:09:33.780
that we want to live in.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.590
And then we return to
our home territory,

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.820
back to the top of the cycle.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.070
And again remember we're
spiraling through all of this

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:41.130
all the time.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.090
So rebirth and return
is really about return

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.670
to a place of stasis,
not return to the place

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.140
that we were before.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.850
And so the journey
of the warrior woman

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.590
is one that, and
this is going to be

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:55.200
a theme in what we discuss next,
is a place of constant growth.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.230
It's not like the
change ever stops.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.280
It may ease up
from time to time,

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.620
but the growth is continuous.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.100
So where does this
take us in the context

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.210
of women in leadership?

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.460
And particularly in corporate,
but also in government,

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.430
and politics, and
nonprofit, in our lives,

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.180
and how we move forward.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.830
So the place we start
on this is at the place

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.190
of illusion, which is that
what we were promised is a lie.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.260
And this one is a
particularly tough one,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.770
I think, for a lot
of us to swallow,

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.400
because for many of us who
came up as women leaders, what

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.130
we were told was, again, you
do all these things right

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.480
and it's going to be just fine.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.090
Right?

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.520
All you have to
do is x, y, and z,

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.140
and every time that you
don't quite make it,

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.510
there's just one more little
thing that you need to do.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.370
You add to that
the myth that women

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.590
have been indoctrinated
with, which is the idea

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.060
that we can have it all.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:41.600
Right?

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.790
That there is an
all to even have.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.340
And that if we do all the right
things in terms of our home

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.819
life and our work
life, and we cope

00:10:48.819 --> 00:10:50.610
and we hire the right
help when we need it,

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.300
or we seek out other resources
just to make it all work,

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.260
that somehow we're going to
hit some perfect balance,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.970
it's going to allow us to feel
like we've hit some arbitrary

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.230
measure of success.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.080
This whole thing is a lie.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.360
And the key point
about this illusion

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.100
that I want to just
make at the moment

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.040
is that we're starting to see
all of this disintegrate right

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:10.970
now in our culture.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:11.660
Right?

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.320
The idea that, again--

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.867
me too maps very
strongly onto what

00:11:14.867 --> 00:11:16.700
I'm going to talk about
today-- but the idea

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.030
that we have to just put
up with a certain degree

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.870
of discrimination.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.800
A little bit of harassment here.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.150
We're just not going
to talk about it.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.191
This is just part of what
you have to put up with

00:11:25.191 --> 00:11:27.320
in order to achieve on the job.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.450
All of that, lie.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:30.800
Illusion.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.750
So where does this
take us to now?

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.970
We get to the point of
betrayal next in the journey.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.500
And what I want
to say about this

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.660
is that women's leadership
advocacy has done a lot.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:38.930
Right?

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.460
I don't want to
discount that there

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.730
are some very powerful voices
out there in the leadership

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.340
methodology that I work
in in my industry who

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.510
have done an awful lot
to help women succeed.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.130
But what we have failed
to do is teach women

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.200
how to become their
own best advocates.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.060
To teach women how
to work together

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.190
as change agents in leadership.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.241
And so to me, lifelong
feminist right

00:12:00.241 --> 00:12:01.490
here, I just want to say that.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.680
Very big believer
in the principles

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.470
of equality and equity that
many of us are working toward.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.660
We have not gone far enough in
the context of helping women

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.930
to claim their own authority.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.090
It feels often as
though what we're doing

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.910
is pleading for change
rather than stepping forward

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.250
and effecting change ourselves.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.287
And so the standpoint
of betrayal

00:12:21.287 --> 00:12:23.870
is the point where we recognize
that the coping skills that we

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.820
had before that we
have been taught,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.670
sometimes taught by one another,
are not enough to get us

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.030
where we want to go.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.660
So the next place that
we come to is awakening.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.140
And this is the principle of
why we need warrior women.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.480
So one of the things that
I want to emphasize here

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.510
when I talk about this
is that the impact

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.180
of powerful, embodied
activist women

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.600
leaders on corporate
cultures and the world

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.255
is potentially dramatic.

00:12:50.255 --> 00:12:52.380
Because one of the things
that we have to recognize

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.990
is that we have different
ways of leading than what

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.569
we have seen traditionally.

00:12:56.569 --> 00:12:58.110
And the studies bear
this out, right?

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.050
We are more collaborative,
we are more communicative.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.490
Corporations that
have more women

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.770
on their boards of directors
are investigated less,

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.640
they're more productive,
they're more profitable,

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.598
they generate more revenue,
generally speaking,

00:13:08.598 --> 00:13:09.890
compared to their peers.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.120
And all of this has
to do with the fact

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.580
that women, as leaders, connect.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.250
So warrior women in
every environment

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.410
can make a difference,
assuming that we

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.800
are empowered to step
forward and create change.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.470
And so the point of awakening
is the point that each one of us

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.260
decides that we are going
to step forward and claim

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.322
our ability to advocate for
different models of leadership.

00:13:32.322 --> 00:13:33.780
And I want to
encourage all of you,

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.863
no matter where you find
yourselves in your career

00:13:35.863 --> 00:13:38.190
points at this point,
to think about what's

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.590
the choice that you have
in front of you right now

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.990
to make more of a
difference in your lives,

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.320
in your working environments,
in your culture, in your world.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.570
What's the choice that you
are faced with right now

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.964
that may lead you to become
more of a voice for the change

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:53.380
that you want to
see in the world?

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.870
Because it benefits everything.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.412
It impacts everything
that we do right now.

00:13:58.412 --> 00:14:00.120
So this brings me to
a point of critique.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.554
Here we are in the descent.

00:14:01.554 --> 00:14:02.970
And one of the
things that you all

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:06.000
may remember from
back in 2016 is

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.600
that when we had Hillary
Clinton running for president,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.160
we saw a lot of
these what I like

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160
to refer to as lady power
movements or commodity

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:14.790
feminism.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:15.480
Right?

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.810
All of these kind
of like powder pink

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.230
websites for
women's empowerment,

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.700
and if you just
wear the right suit

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.990
you put on the
right pair of heels,

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:23.156
everything's going to be OK.

00:14:23.156 --> 00:14:25.410
And I will admit
that in my industry,

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:26.550
I worked for some of these.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.600
What a lot of
people don't know is

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.150
that I actually used to
collaborate with Ivanka Trump

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.040
many moons ago.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.590
But that is a prime example
of commodity feminism.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:39.490
It's selling a solution that
is not internal to yourself.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.670
And so part of the
messaging here in terms

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.480
of how do we build stronger
women's leadership,

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.060
it has to be about
self origination.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.060
One of the things that I
talk about all the time

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.690
in corporate environments where
I train and teach women leaders

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.360
is the idea that when we
change what's on the inside,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.710
we inevitably change
what's on the outside.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.800
And so it's not like
there is some easy,

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:04.170
one size fits all solution
that shifts us toward equity.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.760
We have to be
empowered internally

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.990
to make the shifts that are
necessary to step forward

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.390
to effect change.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.817
So combining feminism
is the descent.

00:15:11.817 --> 00:15:13.650
And by the way, this
is also the point where

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.360
we start to recognize the cost.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.050
Right?

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.840
Where we start to look
inside ourselves and see,

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.076
I've been guilted,
I have been shamed

00:15:21.076 --> 00:15:22.200
into not being good enough.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.692
I have been told that
my voice is meaningless.

00:15:24.692 --> 00:15:27.150
What does that mean in terms
of what are the tools that I'm

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.470
going to pick up next?

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.450
How can I communicate
more effectively?

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.100
How do I need to
refine the way that I

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.790
operate in every environment
so that I'm using my voice?

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.560
And so one of the
things that we talk

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.960
about when we talk about
tools, and I talk about this

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.970
in just a couple minutes
a little bit more,

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:46.830
is the idea that we do need
to adopt new weapons as women

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:47.860
in leadership.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.240
So that may look like things
like nonviolent communication.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.920
And for those of
you who don't know,

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.990
nonviolent
communication strategies

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:57.450
were developed by Marshall
Rosenberg in the 1970s,

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.216
and there are means by which
you can effectively communicate

00:16:00.216 --> 00:16:01.590
your needs and
wants so that they

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:04.173
are heard from the perspective
of the person on the other side

00:16:04.173 --> 00:16:06.309
of the table from
you with compassion.

00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:08.850
This is a skill set, by the way,
that I think everybody needs

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.680
in every corporate environment.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.100
It is very much about what I
experience, what I witness,

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.775
what I value, and
then requesting buy in

00:16:16.775 --> 00:16:18.480
in a collaborative way.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.030
That skill set is one that
for women in leadership

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.160
is absolutely
critical because we

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.650
need to be able to learn
to advocate in ways that

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.950
are different from pounding the
table to demand what we want.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.320
Very much traditional
masculine leadership model.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.320
Whereas our collaborative
means of asking for change

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.510
and propelling forward
in communication

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.930
can actually shift things
and help others to see

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.980
the value of what we're after.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.114
So that's one tool.

00:16:43.114 --> 00:16:45.780
But I will also just add that in
a lot of corporate environments

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.081
these days, there's a
lot of toxicity underway

00:16:48.081 --> 00:16:50.580
and some of the tools that we
need to think about empowering

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.880
ourselves with are tools
that 5, 10 years ago,

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.710
I couldn't teach in
corporate environments.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.410
Things like, how do you protect
your energy so that when

00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.290
you're under attack--

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.510
which we're about to
get to in a minute,

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.160
we're getting into
the hurricane--

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.310
you know that you're not
taking on and internalizing

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.170
the negative messaging
you're getting?

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.829
How can you step forward and
feel empowered in your body

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:13.410
and in your
presentation so that you

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.390
are making an impact that
shows others that you

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:16.980
are not to be messed with.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.569
All of these skill
sets and tools

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:20.276
are new ones that
we need to learn.

00:17:20.276 --> 00:17:22.109
And so one of the things
that I do recommend

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.660
for women leaders who are in
the ground, on the battlefield

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.450
everyday with this,
is that you think

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:32.260
through how the experience that
you have as a warrior woman

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.640
is affecting you.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.680
Are you internalizing
negative messaging?

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.960
Are you having a
hard time with how

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.730
you can advocate and
succeed and keep going?

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.820
You may need to refine
your skill set in this way.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.819
And these are the baseline,
on the ground skills

00:17:44.819 --> 00:17:47.560
that I teach everyday in
corporate environments.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.530
But it is an important
point of recognition

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:55.120
that we need new
tools for new times.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.989
So now we get to the hurricane.

00:17:56.989 --> 00:17:58.780
And this is how warrior
women are punished.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.046
So one of the things
that I like to be

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:02.920
very blunt about in the
warrior women journey

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.270
that I'm talking about today is
nobody is saying this is easy.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.780
Right?

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.390
No one is saying
that like, woo, we're

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.950
all going to step forward in
life, kick some ass, and win,

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.174
it's all just going to
get better overnight.

00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:13.840
Warrior women are
punished relentlessly.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.010
All we have to do is look
at the 2016 election.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.970
It's about how you talk,
the sound of your voice,

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.670
how you laugh, what
you wear, your hair,

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.550
your makeup, your body,
whether or not you're

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.380
meeting certain
codes that convey

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.210
certain bits of information
that make you qualified or not.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:30.880
And I will also
just add that as we

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.770
work to transform
our culture and we

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.870
work to transform our
society, privilege

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:36.310
is a hard thing to let go of.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.940
Right?

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.940
We see the experience
right now of old ways

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.050
of doing things, old
models of leadership,

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:45.850
old means of operation clinging
on by their fingernails

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.160
to avoid any change
in the world.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.270
And one of the things that
means is that crazy attacks

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.350
will come out of nowhere.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.890
Pizza parlors in Washington
DC come to mind, for instance.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:00.366
The level at which we
have to be prepared

00:19:00.366 --> 00:19:02.490
to go to battle for the
world that we want to build

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:03.640
is significant.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.720
And as well, it's critical
in this environment

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.750
that we work together
to hold one another up.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.210
So one of the things
that I talk about when

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.440
we talk about the importance of
collaboration as a way through

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.250
and connection as
a way through is

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.780
the issue of why we're
better off together.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.570
So one of the things that I want
to point out here, by the way,

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.630
is that traditional male
models of leadership

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.952
encourage women to
compete with one another.

00:19:27.952 --> 00:19:30.160
That's because we've been
told that there's only room

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.780
for so many of us at the top.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.350
That, by the way, is
part of the big lie.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:36.910
And one of the
things that it means

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.740
is that when we are
competing with one another,

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.281
when we are tearing
one another down,

00:19:40.281 --> 00:19:42.700
when we are not helping
to lift other women up

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.190
in the corporate
environment or elsewhere,

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:48.010
we are not focused on
how we can work together

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.840
to actually effect change.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.120
It's a really convenient
self-reinforcing mechanism

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.703
of patriarchy that women like
to tear each other down and beat

00:19:54.703 --> 00:19:55.870
each other up.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.330
And so one of the things
that I really encourage here

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.350
is that we think about
how we can instead

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.990
adopt a model-- this is
a very serious thought

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:07.840
leadership pivot, but instead
adopt a model that says when

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.340
one of us wins, we all rise.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.971
This is a very hard thing for
women to internalize, honestly,

00:20:11.971 --> 00:20:14.470
because we've been raised in a
culture that says that's just

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.090
not the way it works.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:19.635
But my standpoint on
this is the following.

00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:21.760
When we recognize how much
damage we've done to one

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.620
another-- and this is really
why we're sitting in the place

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.120
of lose when we
talk about this--

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.830
how much harm we've
done to one another

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.050
by not adopting a thought
process that says,

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.470
let me see how I can
help my sister up.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:34.660
We recognize all
the time that's been

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.810
lost that would have
effected change before now,

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.374
and it also propels us to make
change more in the future.

00:20:40.374 --> 00:20:42.040
So the image I like
to work with on this

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.569
is the idea of an ever-ascending
pillar of humanity.

00:20:45.569 --> 00:20:47.860
Women, if you would like to
think about it in that way,

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.460
it can just be women, but
I honestly think about it

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.410
as gender neutral.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.960
And the idea of it is that
we leave no one behind

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.750
in hopelessness.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.715
We leave no one behind
without opportunity.

00:20:55.715 --> 00:20:58.090
And so when one of our sisters
is falling off the pillar,

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.465
you are the person
who leans down

00:20:59.465 --> 00:21:01.940
with your hand to grab
her and pull her back up.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:05.530
This as an image, as a
metaphor functions so well

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.596
in the idea of how we can effect
change in the environments

00:21:08.596 --> 00:21:09.220
that we are in.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.620
Because when we see someone
struggling, another woman

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.750
struggling, when we see
another woman working

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.230
so hard to succeed, what can
we do to help lift her up?

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:18.910
Rather than saying,
oh, she sucks,

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.550
let me just let her fail
over there on her own.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.310
The more that we can consider
the collaborative nature of how

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:27.100
we can work together and abandon
this idea of the zero sum

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.402
game--

00:21:28.402 --> 00:21:30.610
by the way, the quote I
always refer to on this front

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:31.760
is Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.954
She was asked one time
how many women needed

00:21:33.954 --> 00:21:36.370
to be on the Supreme Court to
make her happy and she said,

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:37.210
nine.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.019
And the reporter was
horrified by that story.

00:21:40.019 --> 00:21:40.810
And she said, what?

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.260
You know, for centuries it was
nine men on the Supreme Court.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.740
What's wrong with the idea of
all women on the Supreme Court

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:48.700
all put together?

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.650
And it's such a shocking
idea to us, right?

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.600
Because we've been
convinced that there's just

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.558
this tiny little slot
that we have to fit into.

00:21:54.558 --> 00:21:57.460
So the pivot of abandoning
the zero sum game,

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.310
and then moving toward a place
of collective and collaborative

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:04.060
advocacy as women makes
a huge difference in what

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.450
we're able to accomplish.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.740
And so that takes us to
several points of intervention

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.204
here, one of which is how to
be a warrior woman at work.

00:22:12.204 --> 00:22:14.620
And we're going to talk through
a couple of different ways

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.060
in which we can be warrior women
here to really effect change.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.630
And I'll just say
to all the guys

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.463
in the room I want to
just really appreciate

00:22:21.463 --> 00:22:24.040
your listening to all of this
too because the skill sets

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.330
are honestly gender neutral.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.480
But from the perspective
of what warrior women need

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.560
to do in the workplace, we're
at a really interesting turning

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.560
point right now.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.820
So to me, this is
about a refusal

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.570
to accept the status quo.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.270
So if you are in a
working environment

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:43.690
where you've seen instances
of unconscious bias

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.700
and you have not
shouted it out, this

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.230
is now where it needs to start.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.727
If you are aware
in your workplace

00:22:48.727 --> 00:22:50.560
that somebody has been
discriminated against

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.470
or harassed, silence
is no longer an option.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:54.990
We are really in
a place right now

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:58.300
from the standpoint of advocacy
where we're at zero tolerance.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.480
And again, me too is a
prime example of this

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.240
because you see all the
seething frustration

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.510
underneath the surface of what
women and others, it's not just

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.480
women, but women in
predominant numbers

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.360
have experience that
has caused such rage.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.050
Such as rage at all the
dreams that have been lost,

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.510
all the opportunities that
have been taken from us,

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.180
the experiences that have
been mapped onto our bodies.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:25.710
And from the perspective of
how we shift this, some of it

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.630
has to be about
speaking the unspoken.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:28.220
Right?

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.970
For the first time
ever, saying the things

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.160
that we have been told we
are not allowed to say.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.535
Telling stories that we've
been told over and over again

00:23:34.535 --> 00:23:36.290
that we are not allowed to tell.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.640
And simply the use of
our voices in that way

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.520
in work environments changes
the corporate culture.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.430
And I'll tell you, I do work
inside investment banks,

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.160
huge financial institutions,
publicly traded companies

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.510
all the time.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.660
The ability of women when they
are empowered to actually speak

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.130
the truth of their experiences
in those environments

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.190
can change those
cultures overnight.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.380
Because all of a sudden
it's not like there

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.230
are unspoken things,
hidden stories that

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.020
are oppressing certain
qualities and preventing women

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.390
fundamentally from living
out their true gifts.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:07.007
Right?

00:24:07.007 --> 00:24:09.090
Because this is really
what it's all about for me.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.680
It's about talent and
it's about why we're here.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.260
It's about talent and purpose.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.140
And so one of the other things
that's really important to me

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.990
when I talk about warrior
women in leadership at work

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.830
is that we think
through why we're here.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:22.740
What's the purpose?

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.070
Right?

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.486
And if we look
back at the metrics

00:24:24.486 --> 00:24:27.540
I started with of traditional
masculine models of leadership

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.372
only valuing money and
time, what warrior women

00:24:30.372 --> 00:24:32.580
and women in general in
leadership bring to the table

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.000
is an idea that we are all here
with certain gifts that can be

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.650
contributed to the collective.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.440
And the metric that I talk about
when I go in even in gender

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.360
neutral environments to
teach about leadership

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.060
is the idea that we
shift from that metric

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.620
toward a metric of growth.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.790
Continuous growth.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.860
Continuous growth of service.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.890
And part of that requires
each and every one of us

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.860
to be able to recognize
the gifts and the purpose

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.940
for why we're here,
fundamentally.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.560
So to me, one of the things that
has to happen in order for us

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.230
to be able to fully embody our
gifts, to live on our purpose,

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.440
to serve out in the way
that we need to serve

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.250
is that those stories are taken
away so that the true totality

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.360
of our voices can be heard.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.069
And so part of this aspect
of stepping completely

00:25:16.069 --> 00:25:17.610
into our leadership
was warrior women

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:20.280
has to be about that
use of voice that

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.720
then allows us to contribute
our gifts in different ways.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.190
Does that make
sense to everybody?

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:25.297
I hope so.

00:25:25.297 --> 00:25:26.880
And you know, one
of the things that I

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.838
want to say about this
is well just while we're

00:25:28.838 --> 00:25:32.400
on the topic of purpose is that
if we are measuring success

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.010
by consistent
standards of growth,

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.230
are we growing ourselves?

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:37.320
Are we growing our teams?

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.456
And this is not like the
bottom line revenue growth

00:25:39.456 --> 00:25:40.580
we're talking about, right?

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.102
It's about the
growth of the impact

00:25:42.102 --> 00:25:43.560
that you want to
make in the world.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.290
If we are focused
on that, then we

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:49.420
are asking different questions
about what success looks like.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.260
And this is where we get to
have a true benefit for women

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.100
in leadership because if we are
modeling success on our growth,

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.410
on our collaboration, on
the difference that we make

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:02.040
in the world, then
inherently we care more

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.176
about things like the
quality of our lives.

00:26:04.176 --> 00:26:05.550
We care more about
whether or not

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:08.070
we can create work
environments where

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:11.070
women can contribute even if
they've got children at home.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:13.080
We work to create
cultural shifts that

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:17.190
allow for childcare to be
absolutely available to all

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.410
of us so that we have an
opportunity to contribute

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.120
at the totality of our gifts.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.150
So the mental pivot
away from money and time

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.790
as the only metric towards
different models of success

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:28.210
is really key here.

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.420
And I hope that makes sense.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.360
OK.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.544
Just a little bit on
warrior womaning at home.

00:26:33.544 --> 00:26:35.710
One of the things that I
just want to point out here

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:40.900
is that even in households
where women are primary earners,

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.450
we still do 2/3 of
the housework and we

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:47.290
do right now at this moment
in time 50 percent more

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:48.850
childcare than women
did in the 50s.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:49.450
Believe it or not.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:51.040
That's because models of
parenting have changed.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.290
Pew Research, if you go
look at these numbers,

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:54.940
it's astonishing.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.734
One of the things that
I want to make plain

00:26:56.734 --> 00:26:58.150
when we talk about
cultural shifts

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:01.476
here is that everything that we
do, by the way, is political.

00:27:01.476 --> 00:27:03.100
I mean, I think this
is kind of a given

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.330
if you've been in
a feminist movement

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:05.746
at all in any way,
shape, or form.

00:27:05.746 --> 00:27:07.540
But the most intimate
conversations

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:12.010
that we have about our needs
and being supported inevitably

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.420
impact the way that
we are in the world.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.500
And so one of the things
that is key here in the way

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.350
that I think about this
is that if we are not

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:23.350
able to ask for what we need
in our home environments,

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.750
it also therefore becomes
much more difficult for us

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.520
to ask for it in the world.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.104
And so even at the tiny
baseline conversations

00:27:30.104 --> 00:27:32.020
that we have with our
partners and our spouses

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.760
about like who's
doing the dishes.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.720
Right?

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.340
Who's taking care of the kids?

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.480
Do we need help?

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.294
How can I get help?

00:27:38.294 --> 00:27:40.210
I myself am a single mom
and I'm really big on

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:41.919
like, can we create
collaborative models

00:27:41.919 --> 00:27:43.960
in our communities that
can help to support women

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.300
in different ways that maybe
have not been discussed

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.430
before that are outside
of our old school

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:51.550
historic model of women
doing women's work at home,

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.182
and men being out
working in the world?

00:27:53.182 --> 00:27:55.390
We need to start getting
creative about the solutions

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:56.710
that we seek here.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:58.169
Those proactive
conversations where

00:27:58.169 --> 00:27:59.626
we draw a line in
the sand and say,

00:27:59.626 --> 00:28:01.060
this isn't working
for me anymore,

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.940
let me think creatively about
how to make it different,

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.830
inevitably lead us
to places of being

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:08.200
able to have more
high-stakes conversations out

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.010
in the world at large.

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:11.630
And so we can't forget that.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:12.130
Right?

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:13.810
And I also just want to
mention one other thing here.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:15.610
I do not believe in
work/life balance.

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:17.490
I think again it's
like a total myth

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.400
that it could even be possible.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.990
I think what is
possible, however,

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:23.440
is to have lives that are in
alignment with what we value.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.200
And for each of us,
that's a unique metric.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:26.770
Right?

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:28.240
What do I value most in my life?

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.630
How do I create a life
that gives me that?

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.040
And if we are not thinking
about that individually

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.650
for ourselves, we also can't
create solutions for it

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:36.770
in the collective.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:38.690
So starting at the
baseline of, what

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:42.340
do I need most in my own home,
is a really important way

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.950
to lead to being able and
more courageous to have

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:48.660
higher-stakes conversations
in other places.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.160
OK.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.840
And lastly, the
point of intervention

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.590
of how to be a warrior
woman in the world.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:55.442
So one of the things
about activist women's

00:28:55.442 --> 00:28:57.650
leadership that to me is so
compelling at this moment

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.797
in time is that we are in
a place where we actually

00:28:59.797 --> 00:29:01.880
have an opportunity and
make a massive difference.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.920
Like the world is
cracking open right now.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.740
And the opportunity for change
and to create a future that we

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.420
want to live in
is more compelling

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.140
now and more
possible now, I even

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.310
think, despite the dark days
that we seem to be living in,

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.300
than it's been for
quite some time.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.420
I think we can all-- you
know, I'm 46 years old.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.150
Those of us who are
60s and 70s babies

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.970
may have some vague recollection
of other historic turning

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:25.340
points in time where
opportunities like this

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.110
felt like they were possible.

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.630
This moment feels
particularly rich to me.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:34.050
And I want to remind you all
of that in lots of mythologies,

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:36.050
the cremation ground, the
place where everything

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:38.930
is burned to ash, is actually
the most fertile place

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:39.626
for growth.

00:29:39.626 --> 00:29:41.750
It's the place where you
can plant seeds and create

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.010
a future.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.604
And so where we find ourselves
right now really has to be--

00:29:45.604 --> 00:29:48.020
and I'm such a big advocate
for this in my daily existence

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.210
broadcasts-- a place where
we think about the future

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:53.420
that we want to live in to, and
we start living from that place

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.360
right now.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:58.490
So that means, for
instance, that we don't--

00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:59.300
how shall I put it?

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.522
We don't get down in the
gutter and fight dirty

00:30:02.522 --> 00:30:04.730
if that's not the future
that we want to live in too.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:07.550
And it means that if we make
choices about how we advocate.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.920
We advocate from a place
of kindness and compassion

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.000
and acceptance.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.430
It also means that we
are constantly working

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.960
toward the future that we want.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.534
And so to me, part
of this as well

00:30:17.534 --> 00:30:19.700
is about how do we stand
up and fight for the future

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.520
that we want in our
world, for our children,

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.760
in government, in the corporate
environments that we work in?

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.960
How, every day, can we step
into modeling the future

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.010
that we want to live in?

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:32.020
Not easy.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.110
I to say this is not easy.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:34.760
Managing our
emotions, especially

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.460
in times of turmoil and stress
and trauma in our nation,

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.110
is really, really hard.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:41.286
And we have to
envision the world

00:30:41.286 --> 00:30:42.410
that we want to live in to.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:43.930
We're the people who are
going to lead the way on that,

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:44.450
by the way.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:46.580
I mean, I hope that makes
sense that women who

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.470
step forward and
really own this moment

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:50.096
and take it through
the transformation.

00:30:50.096 --> 00:30:51.678
You know, this is
like a birth process

00:30:51.678 --> 00:30:53.720
we're in right now as a
culture and as a country.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.484
We know how to
give birth, right?

00:30:55.484 --> 00:30:56.900
And one of the
things that I think

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.720
is key there is that we
have to claim it, right?

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.970
No one swooping in to save
us on this front, right?

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:03.410
We have to be the
people who lead

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.200
the change at this moment in
time, to build that future,

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.290
because we can see it.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:09.445
So it's a very
unique opportunity

00:31:09.445 --> 00:31:10.820
where we are right
now, honestly.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:15.080
And if I could kind of leave
everybody with a thought

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:19.310
here about what
we're leading into.

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:22.610
The question I get asked
more often than not is,

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:24.920
why or what is this vision
that you have of the future?

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.720
What is this going to look
like when we get there?

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.640
I did a speaking tour this fall
and that was the number one

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.350
question that I got
asked in every location

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:32.720
around the country was, what's
this vision of the future

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.320
that you have for women
and for all of us?

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.630
And so to me, the
point of this is

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:41.690
that we have an opportunity
now to create a world where

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:43.190
there is equity.

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.730
Where from the standpoint of
even just corporate hiring

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.500
and recruiting
policies, like where

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.370
are we going to recruit the next
generation of women leaders.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:51.860
We can do all of
that differently.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.740
Where we can do
things like pay equity

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.240
analyzes inside our companies
and see how people are getting

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:56.810
paid.

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.480
From that all the
way up to how do

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.630
we create a place where no one
is left behind in hopelessness.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.720
A government that
represents all of us.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.200
A world where everyone
has opportunity.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.800
What does that look like?

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.990
To me, it looks
like a place where

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:14.060
we know that every
human life has value,

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.870
and where we step outside of the
arbitrary hierarchies of race,

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:21.440
and gender, and national
origin, and preference,

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.470
and everything
else, orientation,

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:26.540
and think through
the idea that--

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.790
the idea that there's an
arbitrary hierarchy of humans

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:29.331
is just that.

00:32:29.331 --> 00:32:30.050
It's just a myth.

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:30.554
Right?

00:32:30.554 --> 00:32:31.970
And so if we
approach the world we

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:34.490
want to live in from a place
of all of us having equality

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:37.340
and equity and value,
that means necessarily

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.800
that we can't have policies
that benefit some of us

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.030
don't benefit others.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:41.810
Right?

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:45.680
That create artificial
differences between us

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.800
as humans.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.060
And so to me, this is kind
of like the big kahuna.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.570
We're in a big kahuna
moment right now.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:54.290
And warrior women
will change the world

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.570
by being the people
who write the path.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:58.820
Right?

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.299
I know a lot of this has been
a lot more esoteric and heady

00:33:01.299 --> 00:33:02.840
than I anticipated
it was going to be

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.210
when I ran through it this
morning for the four time.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.050
But I think I'm going
to wind down there

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:09.191
and just say that for all
the women in the room,

00:33:09.191 --> 00:33:11.690
I really want to encourage you
to think through like, what's

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.000
the next step to taking your
voice to the next level?

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.910
And where can you step more
fully into your own leadership?

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:20.596
Take up new skills and
new armor and new weapons

00:33:20.596 --> 00:33:22.220
to change the world
and make it better,

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.700
and to recognize as well that
your heroine's journey is

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:26.960
your own story.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.760
And you get to choose
how you live it.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.520
And that inevitably there
is a heroine and a warrior

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.840
woman in all of us, I think.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.550
That's what I believe.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:38.044
And how we get there
is within our own path,

00:33:38.044 --> 00:33:39.710
and our own story,
and our own divining.

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:41.251
But that it's really
critical that we

00:33:41.251 --> 00:33:42.740
are action-oriented in it.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.641
That we claim it
ourselves rather than

00:33:44.641 --> 00:33:46.140
allowing ourselves
to just be pushed

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.580
through the flow of
our lives, we really

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.890
need to swim with the current.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:50.410
If that makes sense.

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:52.016
And step fully into
the opportunities

00:33:52.016 --> 00:33:53.890
that are there for us
to battle for the world

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:55.340
that we want to live in.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.617
So I think that's it for today.

00:33:57.617 --> 00:33:59.950
Very heady and esoteric, but
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:02.770
I'm more than happy to take some
questions if you would like.

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:03.436
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:34:03.436 --> 00:34:05.700
Thanks for coming in.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.469
I have many, many questions,
but I'll limit it to one.

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:08.729
ELIZABETH CRONISE
MCLAUGHLIN: That's fine.

00:34:08.729 --> 00:34:09.929
You can ask many,
many questions.

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:10.830
I'm good with that.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:11.919
AUDIENCE: Yeah, maybe
we could talk after--

00:34:11.919 --> 00:34:12.179
ELIZABETH CRONISE
MCLAUGHLIN: OK.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:13.142
Sure

00:34:13.142 --> 00:34:14.600
AUDIENCE: But my
question is around

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:19.520
I try my best to subscribe
to feminism blogs,

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.570
and listen to different
speakers, and promote.

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:26.150
But then I feel that
when I am sometimes

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:30.530
asked to summarize
what I've heard,

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.050
I have a very difficult
time summarizing it.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.060
Because I don't
live the experiences

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.781
that many women experience.

00:34:36.781 --> 00:34:38.239
ELIZABETH CRONISE
MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:40.489
AUDIENCE: And do you have tips?

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:41.409
If you can help with--

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:41.869
ELIZABETH CRONISE
MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah.

00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:43.285
Well so let me ask
you a question.

00:34:43.285 --> 00:34:45.650
When are you asked
to summarize it?

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.110
AUDIENCE: Generally
with other men.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:47.659
ELIZABETH CRONISE
MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:48.159
OK.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:48.739
Got it.

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:50.781
So that's a really
interesting point

00:34:50.781 --> 00:34:51.989
because let me just say this.

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:54.679
I am a very big believer that we
are not just at a turning point

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:56.512
for women, we're at a
turning point for men.

00:34:56.512 --> 00:34:59.360
And I talk quite a bit about
the idea of sacred masculinity

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.300
and modeling good
masculinity to other men.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.410
So first of all,
kudos to you for being

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.570
willing to be a change
agent on that front,

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:08.153
because there are a lot of men
who aren't willing to even make

00:35:08.153 --> 00:35:09.050
the effort.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:10.841
But the second thing
I would say about this

00:35:10.841 --> 00:35:16.460
is that there is in some
sense no substitute for men

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.110
talking to women
about their own--

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:19.460
about the experiences of women.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.960
Meaning that you can
summarize to a certain extent,

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.901
and of course you can do it
to the best of your ability.

00:35:24.901 --> 00:35:26.900
And the next thing that
comes out of your mouth,

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.090
if it were me, would
be, by the way, are you

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:30.470
talking to your wife about this?

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.400
Are you talking to
your sister about this?

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.030
Are you talking to your
daughter about her experiences?

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:37.730
So that you're learning it--

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:40.250
and learning it through the
prism of multiple women's

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:42.230
experiences, if
that makes sense.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:44.090
And I will also
just add that there

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:47.237
is nothing wrong with asking,
what can I do to do it better?

00:35:47.237 --> 00:35:49.320
You know, what can I do
to make it better for you?

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.990
What can I do to make it
better for women generally?

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:52.750
How can I be a better advocate?

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:56.570
So I think it's not
just about how can I

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:59.480
summarize what I'm
reading about, but also

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.060
how can I propel men
to be more engaged

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.000
in the conversation about what
healthier masculinity would

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.740
look like, and how to make the
world a better place for women

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.240
generally.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.810
Does that make sense?

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:11.180
Yeah?

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:11.790
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for coming here.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:13.123
Thank you so much for your talk.

00:36:13.123 --> 00:36:16.070
It was actually pretty
nice and very enlightening.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:19.440
You mentioned a couple of times
this idea of a masculine model

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.790
of leadership.

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.670
And I was wondering
what, in your view,

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:28.370
a feminine model of leadership
or a gender neutral model

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:29.780
of leadership would look like?

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.920
ELIZABETH CRONISE MCLAUGHLIN:
So this is a really-- this

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.420
is actually what
we normally do when

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.461
I go in and do corporate
training and consulting.

00:36:34.461 --> 00:36:37.460
So you've given me a nice
little transition here.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.730
So we have something we call the
aligned leadership model, which

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:43.430
is a model that actually
has what we would consider

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:45.650
to be like more feminine
qualities of leadership

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:46.340
attached to it.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.620
It is fundamentally an
emotionally intelligent model

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.402
of leadership.

00:36:49.402 --> 00:36:51.860
And it starts from the place
of thinking through leadership

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:52.679
from--

00:36:52.679 --> 00:36:54.470
I mean, there's 12
points on a pivot wheel.

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:56.520
It would take me a whole
other hour to go through it.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.010
But fundamentally it
starts from a place

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:00.320
of the most effective leadership
in today's environment

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.890
being leadership that starts
with curiosity and compassion.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:07.040
And so it's not,
I am the King, I'm

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.740
the ultimate know it all of
how this company should run.

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.920
But really, more of a
questioning, a consistent

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.380
questioning of how
can we improve?

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.560
What am I good at?

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.889
What is my team good at?

00:37:17.889 --> 00:37:20.180
How can I look at what my
gifts are and where I'm weak,

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.830
and build an organization
that fills in the gaps?

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.940
How can I value everyone's
gifts on my team, right?

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.340
And it also talks
through the concept

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.710
that I shared with you
today of growth as one

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.510
of the main metrics of success.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:36.050
So to me, I wouldn't
want to call it

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:37.460
a feminine model of leadership.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.580
I think it's-- I think
it's far more healthy.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.100
Right?

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.960
Our aligned leadership
model that we teach

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.600
is really about, how do you
create healthy ecosystems

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.730
inside companies where
everyone is functional

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:50.530
and, moreover, that is
holistic, so that it's not just

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:52.280
about what the person
can perform at work.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.070
I mean, you guys are
amazing in here, by the way.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.153
I have to say that of all
the working environments

00:37:56.153 --> 00:37:57.920
that I've stepped
into, this one seems

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.890
to care the most about the
totality of the human beings

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:01.560
who work here.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:05.180
And that is amazing to
me, and truly something

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:08.330
to be honored and
admired and uplifted.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:11.424
But so many environments that I
walk into only care about what

00:38:11.424 --> 00:38:13.340
happens to the individual
in terms of how they

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.380
can provide for the company.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:15.881
Right?

00:38:15.881 --> 00:38:17.713
And how they can perform
when they're there.

00:38:17.713 --> 00:38:19.190
And if somebody's
spouse is dying,

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:21.740
or someone's child is
having a crisis, who

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:25.610
cares as long as the
bottom line needs are met?

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:27.290
Aligned leadership,
to me, is really

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:29.955
about recognizing that
we're all connected.

00:38:29.955 --> 00:38:32.330
That organizations are only
as healthy as the individuals

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:33.500
who are within them.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.440
And that just in the
same way that each of us

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.930
have gifts to
contribute to the world,

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:40.350
organizations do as well.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:42.680
And so mission is really
critical and important,

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.990
and making decisions
based on mission

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.630
that are aligned with
also all the individuals

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:50.390
that make up that mission
creates environments

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:52.870
that people want to live in,
and work in, and are loyal to,

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:54.560
and that you can't
imagine leaving.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.107
And just having
talked to some of you

00:38:56.107 --> 00:38:58.190
today as I was walking
around before here, I mean,

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:59.450
that's very present here.

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:00.170
Right?

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:02.090
That degree of respect
and understanding

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:04.560
of the way in which everybody
who works here is connected

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.060
and the needs of
everyone being met.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.060
So that to me is
about as close as I

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.244
can get without doing
like a full blown all day

00:39:10.244 --> 00:39:12.660
long training like I normally
do in corporate environments

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.240
like this.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.392
But yeah, it really is
about emotional intelligence

00:39:16.392 --> 00:39:17.600
fundamentally as a principle.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.280
And then mission and
purpose and making

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.530
all of your decisions about
your people and the people

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:23.450
who work for you as
if we're a family.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:24.520
Because we are.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.310
Right?

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:26.680
Make sense?

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.430
AUDIENCE: I had a
question about something

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:29.346
you mentioned earlier.

00:39:29.346 --> 00:39:31.400
Earlier you said that
the stories of many women

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.150
had been erased.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:33.900
Is there some place
we could go to look at

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.056
and we could find those stories
that have been repressed?

00:39:36.056 --> 00:39:37.610
MCLAUGHLIN: Well so if
they've been erased,

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:38.943
you have to do a lot of digging.

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:42.560
So I would tell a story
about this that's kind of--

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.280
that really brought
this home to me.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.738
But I will tell
you that it took me

00:39:45.738 --> 00:39:48.330
about three hours of like
serious, serious digging

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.670
on the internet to find anything
that remotely looked like.

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:55.710
So my maiden name is
Cronise, as you all know.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.090
And my father is
really into ancestry.

00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:59.940
So one of the things
that we discovered

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.555
when he did all of this
work is that our family

00:40:02.555 --> 00:40:03.930
on my father's
side is originally

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:04.920
from Alsace-Lorraine.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:09.000
And the spelling of our
name originally in German

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.860
means iron crown.

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.110
And so I went digging
because my father was--

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.420
we were ironworkers apparently
and the 15th century.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.890
You know, my dad's gone all
the way back through all this.

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:19.260
But I went digging to see,
well, what's the reference

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.030
point for this name?

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:23.760
I discovered in like
three hours of kind

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.510
of falling down a rabbit hole--

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:29.100
this is the old lawyer
in me, the researcher--

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.860
that there was this thing
called the iron crown.

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:34.020
Some of you may
know historically.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.060
But the iron crown
was originally

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:41.972
commissioned by a queen in the
third century whose name I'm

00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:43.680
now going to forget
because nobody's ever

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.840
heard of her because the history
has been completely erased.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.050
But I did a whole podcast.

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:49.425
I run this podcast called The
Women's Leadership Podcast.

00:40:49.425 --> 00:40:51.530
I did a podcast on
just this experience

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:54.060
of recognizing that there had
been a woman who basically had

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:58.260
been the head of something
the size of the Ottoman Empire

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.990
at some point in our history
that none of us know about.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:02.850
Like I literally had
not heard of this woman

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:04.891
ever before until I went
digging for all of this,

00:41:04.891 --> 00:41:07.230
because the stories that
we are taught about history

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:08.633
are the stories of men.

00:41:08.633 --> 00:41:11.132
And so to some extent it's about
your degree of-- we're back

00:41:11.132 --> 00:41:12.120
to curiosity again--

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.790
your degree of curiosity
about women's history.

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.950
And to some extent, it's
also about recognizing

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:20.130
that many of our traditions have
always been oral traditions.

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:21.810
And so this is one
of the reasons why

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:23.830
women's storytelling
still is really important,

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:25.664
and one of the reasons
why I encourage women

00:41:25.664 --> 00:41:28.204
who want to know about even the
history of their own families

00:41:28.204 --> 00:41:30.570
to go into their grandmothers
on tape before they die.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.490
Because otherwise it
gets lost if it's not

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:33.448
written down somewhere.

00:41:33.448 --> 00:41:35.490
So I wish I could
say that there was

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:38.190
like a magic
un-eraser button that

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:40.380
would bring all of this
back, but I think some of it

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.130
has to be about how far
are you as an individual

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:45.820
willing to do the dig, to then
share it with the collective.

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.820
I mean, this is a great
opportunity, by the way,

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:48.450
for a project.

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:50.741
Like somebody should start
a reclaiming women's history

00:41:50.741 --> 00:41:52.410
project, if it's
not done already,

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:56.440
just so that we can start to
see like all the gaps there.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.450
Yeah.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:59.400
So that's my answer to that.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.520
Individual choice, I
think, at this point.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:08.880
AUDIENCE: So I am lucky to
be in a leadership position,

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:13.470
and I have a team that
has one other woman on it

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:14.760
and the rest are men.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.010
And the team that I
lead are generally

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:21.330
somewhere in the range of about
15 years behind me career-wise.

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:27.330
And what I've tried to
do is to adapt my style

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:29.190
to the needs of each
person on the team,

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:30.810
because they are very different.

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:33.480
Their experiences are different,
their communication styles

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.340
are different.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:40.440
And try to give that
hand up to all of them.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.530
And what I have found
in the last year or two

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:47.730
is that I sometimes
have people call me

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:51.930
out as favoring the
woman on the team

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:55.080
even though when I sit down
and talk to them about all

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:59.160
of the ways that I'm investing
in their careers and the things

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:02.340
that I'm doing for them,
they recognize that they're

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.530
getting as much or more.

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:06.030
And so you know,
as you were talking

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:11.220
about our responsibility of
kind of bringing up other women,

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:15.322
you know, what about the people
who stand on the sidelines

00:43:15.322 --> 00:43:17.280
and go, well see, you're
just playing favorites

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.280
and that's just no better?

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:18.980
ELIZABETH CRONISE
MCLAUGHLIN: Right.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.070
Right.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:21.962
So it's hard to
give up privilege.

00:43:21.962 --> 00:43:24.420
You know, as I said, it's really
hard to give up privilege.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:27.840
And some of what the
communication that we all need

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:33.360
to learn, I think, to do
better is also to say equity

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.770
is not about playing favorites.

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:35.280
Right?

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.740
Meaning that, and
the image that I

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.780
share with people about
equity versus equality

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.439
is that in order to reach
true equity culturally,

00:43:42.439 --> 00:43:44.730
you do have to lift up people
who historically have not

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.590
had the extra lift.

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:47.130
Right?

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:50.260
It's like, think about
it from this perspective.

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:52.950
The image that I've seen on
this that's so descriptive

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:55.320
is you've got people at
three different heights

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.190
behind the fence.

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.847
Right?

00:43:56.847 --> 00:43:58.680
And equality is that
everybody gets to stand

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.220
at the same place on the fence.

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.430
Equity is that everybody
can see over it.

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:02.970
Right?

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:06.170
And so sometimes that means that
from a historic perspective,

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:07.860
you have to do
things differently

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.030
in order to create equity.

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:10.170
There will be a
point, hopefully,

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:12.044
in the future where we
don't have to do that.

00:44:12.044 --> 00:44:15.000
But to me, first of all,
that's not playing favorites

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.410
so I wouldn't call it that.

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:17.010
I guess that's the thing.

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:18.690
You can shout it out
and say, actually

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:19.610
that's not what I'm doing.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:20.970
And do what you're
already doing there,

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:22.636
which I think it sound
like, I hope it's

00:44:22.636 --> 00:44:24.750
working to a certain extent.

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:26.430
But the flip side
of that as well

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:29.016
is that if we do
not actually start

00:44:29.016 --> 00:44:31.140
to make different choices
in corporate environments

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.200
as leaders, nothing shifts.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:33.890
Right?

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:36.300
Like my biggest client is a
publicly traded investment

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.590
bank.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:41.130
And they discovered-- they
did some research last year

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:44.700
and they discovered that only
4.7% of their senior executives

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:49.265
are women, even though
they hire 35% as women.

00:44:49.265 --> 00:44:51.390
And they're losing people
and they've never kind of

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:52.260
investigated why.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.814
Which is crazy to me, but
they're never looked at it.

00:44:54.814 --> 00:44:56.730
One of the things that
I've had to say to them

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.280
is, why are you not recruiting
at historically women's

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.000
colleges?

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:00.570
Right?

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:02.761
Why are you not thinking
about maybe the fact

00:45:02.761 --> 00:45:05.010
that you need to provide
different kinds of leadership

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:07.530
training for women so that
they understand how to navigate

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:08.700
this environment better?

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:11.080
Why are your senior male
leaders not signing on

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:14.640
to initiatives that say,
we're making a commitment

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.680
as an organization
to gender parity,

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.940
and here's what we're
willing to do about it.

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.830
Here's the investment that
we're willing to make,

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.163
here's the training programs
that we want to ascribe to.

00:45:22.163 --> 00:45:24.330
Because the other thing
is that the unfortunate

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:27.090
thing about being a woman leader
right now in some environments

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:29.640
is that you have to do the
emotional labor of educating

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.770
people about what it is
that needs to change.

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:35.550
And it is so much easier
if senior male leaders also

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:38.970
sign onto that as allies
so that the messaging comes

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:39.760
from other men.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.260
Right?

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.340
We're back to this issue of
how can you kind of like--

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.520
how can other men work as
allies to educate other men

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.144
about the benefits
of what's happening?

00:45:46.144 --> 00:45:48.000
So I don't know.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.250
I don't want to tell you
what all the solutions should

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:52.140
be for you, but it
does sound to me

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.050
like you need some male allies
as well on this front who

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:58.800
can communicate this to your
team in ways that make sense,

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.810
so that you're not the
one that is bearing

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.480
the burden of doing
the right thing

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.510
and having them feel
like that's unfair.

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:07.355
Helpful?

00:46:07.355 --> 00:46:07.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:08.730
And it was more--

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:11.830
I mean, I feel like on our team,
we have very good communication

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:15.540
and we talked through this and
everybody's on the same page.

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.510
But as I look around and
you use that analogy of kind

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.820
of giving a hand
up to other women,

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.730
it is something that everybody
kind of has to think through

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.160
in terms of, is this
going to be misperceived

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.320
as preferential treatment?

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.000
Or what's the best
way to communicate

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.020
that it isn't really?

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.640
And I think you did a
good job of covering that.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.050
Thank you.

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.477
ELIZABETH CRONISE
MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah.

00:46:33.477 --> 00:46:34.760
You're welcome.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:35.700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.700
I wanted to get your
thoughts on this situation.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:41.060
It's not happening in this
company, another company,

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.320
to a friend of mine.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:46.250
She wanted to switch teams
within the same company, had

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:48.380
an offer with another team.

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.660
She was pregnant.

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.556
A few weeks before
her delivery, she

00:46:52.556 --> 00:46:55.100
talks to the manager,
a new manager,

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.010
is offered this position.

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:00.020
She plays the devil's
advocate, saying

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.480
hey I'm going to be
gone a few months.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.610
I totally understand
that, was the response.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:06.950
We still want you here,
we value you here.

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:09.200
Baby is born, it's
been two months now.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.870
Now she gets a call
saying, we think

00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:14.590
this position is no
longer a great fit,

00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:17.600
we are not sure we
would value you as much.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.100
It's a pretty reputed company,
I can't tell you which it is.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.130
A very close friend of mine.

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:24.050
I'm angry.

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:26.649
And the manager
talks to her saying,

00:47:26.649 --> 00:47:28.940
I want to grow the people
who are currently in the team

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:30.622
to be the manager.

00:47:30.622 --> 00:47:32.830
Well nothing's changed, her
pregnancy hasn't changed,

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:34.980
the same people continue
to be in the team.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.020
Now there's suddenly a question.

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.780
Now the way she's
responding is she's

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:40.988
being the mentoring role
for this manager and saying,

00:47:40.988 --> 00:47:43.850
hey, do what's
right for the team.

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:45.770
So business-wise, the
right thing for the team

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:47.660
is not to wait for a
couple of more months

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.890
for her to get done back?

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:51.515
And which is what is
likely the manager

00:47:51.515 --> 00:47:53.810
is hoping to hear from her.

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:55.670
And I don't want her
to be in a position

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:59.060
where she's no longer
going to be as much valued.

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:01.849
The other options
are, we create one--

00:48:01.849 --> 00:48:03.390
we'll create a new
opportunity that's

00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:05.587
like one third of what
you were supposed to own.

00:48:05.587 --> 00:48:07.670
It doesn't make sense from
owning the whole thing,

00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:09.540
why would I go back
to owning a third?

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:11.690
This is a big corporation here.

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:14.150
I don't want her to fight
against this corporation.

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:17.430
Her career would be
ruined after this.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:18.980
And so she--

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:22.300
I mean, if you just wear the
business hat, it feels like,

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.830
yeah the manager made a
stupid mistake probably

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:26.330
to offer her a job
and she's going

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:27.450
to disappear in a few months.

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:29.533
But I was happy that he
did thinking the long term

00:48:29.533 --> 00:48:32.700
potential and the
long term value.

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.100
What do you typically recommend?

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.990
I'm sure this is just
one of many instances

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:37.820
that are happening
out there today.

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:38.450
ELIZABETH CRONISE
MCLAUGHLIN: It's true.

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:39.874
You know, I have
to say that it's

00:48:39.874 --> 00:48:42.290
really unfortunate because I
hear stories like this a lot.

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:45.530
Pregnancy discrimination
is still very real.

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:47.800
To the point where when I'm
coaching women leaders one

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.970
on one, we have conversations
proactively when

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:52.604
they want to even get pregnant
about how they have to prepare

00:48:52.604 --> 00:48:54.020
their team for
that, how they have

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:56.630
to prepare their senior
leadership for it,

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:57.620
how to disclose it.

00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:58.820
Women I coached through
job transitions,

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:00.903
like, when do I tell people
I'm pregnant while I'm

00:49:00.903 --> 00:49:01.850
interviewing?

00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:04.010
These are all incredibly
difficult questions

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:05.570
that we still have
to think about.

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:06.680
Which is crazy to me.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:09.630
But all that said, for
your friend's situation,

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:12.560
you know, I guess
the lawyer in me

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.800
initially says she couldn't
find a good employment lawyer

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:19.550
and actually ask some questions
about what the strategy there

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:21.039
has to be from a
legal standpoint.

00:49:21.039 --> 00:49:22.580
And I know you don't
want her to sue,

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:24.350
but I will tell you
that the employment

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:28.520
lawyers that my company refers
our clients to help people

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.370
negotiate situations
like this so

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:32.810
that they walk the edge of it.

00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:35.990
Meaning that, that manager
knows that he's doing something

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:37.170
that's not quite right.

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:38.240
You know, I mean
it's obvious, or he

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.260
wouldn't be having
the conversation

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.610
the way that he's having it.

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:43.259
If she is able to come back
with something that says,

00:49:43.259 --> 00:49:45.050
you made me this offer
when I was pregnant,

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:45.900
you knew that I was pregnant.

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.490
I understand you now
want to grow the team,

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:49.198
but this is the offer
that was made to me

00:49:49.198 --> 00:49:51.740
and I still add value here.

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:56.120
With the right kind of language
that like basically signals

00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:58.550
that she knows what
her rights are,

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:00.930
that may actually help the
situation dramatically.

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:02.186
And I can give you the number.

00:50:02.186 --> 00:50:04.310
I have a very dear friend
who is like the past head

00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:07.420
of the employment bar in
DC and knows everybody

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:09.170
in the country who
does this kind of work,

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:11.289
and could find her
someone to talk to.

00:50:11.289 --> 00:50:12.830
But that would be
an initial strategy

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:14.510
that I would want
to approach it from.

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:16.843
And then from the place of
thinking through the business

00:50:16.843 --> 00:50:22.210
end of it, you know, the
idea of what value you add.

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:23.600
Her value has not changed.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:27.547
And so to me, I don't see
that there's any business--

00:50:27.547 --> 00:50:28.880
I don't think he made a mistake.

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.880
I think what's happening
now is that he's second

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:33.582
guessing for all the traditional
stereotypical reasons.

00:50:33.582 --> 00:50:34.790
Is she going to be available?

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:36.170
She's going to have
a baby at home.

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:38.480
Is she going to be as dedicated
to the job as she was before?

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:39.979
You know, all these
sorts of issues.

00:50:39.979 --> 00:50:43.880
And some of that has to be about
her taking the lead to say,

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.210
I'm here, I'm available,
I'm ready, I want this,

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:47.884
I'm going to do it.

00:50:47.884 --> 00:50:50.300
Nothing's going to fall through
the cracks, I'm committed.

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.790
It sucks that women have to
have these conversations still

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.170
forward looking, but they do.

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:58.610
And so I think it's got to
be the combination of her

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:01.920
an self-advocacy, to bring us
back to where we've been today.

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.820
And also she definitely needs
a lawyer to just talk to.

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:06.500
And I'm more than happy to give
me that number after the fact

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:07.490
if you would like.

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.900
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:08.370
ELIZABETH CRONISE
MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah.

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:09.990
SPEAKER: So that's all the
time we have for questions.

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:11.270
Thank you very much,
everybody, for coming.

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:12.230
And thank you very
much, Elizabeth,

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:13.410
for coming to talk to us.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:15.660
ELIZABETH CRONISE MCLAUGHLIN:

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:19.460
