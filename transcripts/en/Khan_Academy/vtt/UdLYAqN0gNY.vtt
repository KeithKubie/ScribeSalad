00:00:00.017 --> 00:00:01.611
- [Voiceover] So we're
asked which function

00:00:01.611 --> 00:00:04.021
has the greater y-intercept?

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:07.157
So, the y-intercept is the y-coordinate

00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:09.328
when x is equal to zero.

00:00:09.328 --> 00:00:12.289
So, f of zero, when x is equal to zero,

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:14.433
the function is equal to, let's see,

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:17.103
f of zero is going to be equal to

00:00:17.103 --> 00:00:20.923
zero minus zero, plus four,
is going to be equal to four.

00:00:20.923 --> 00:00:22.389
So this function right over here,

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:25.025
it has a y-intercept of four.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:29.518
So it would intersect the
y-axis right over there.

00:00:29.518 --> 00:00:31.689
While the function that
we're comparing it to,

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.454
g of x, we're looking at its graph,

00:00:33.454 --> 00:00:35.323
y is equal to g of x,

00:00:35.323 --> 00:00:37.958
its y-intercept is right over here,

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.791
at y is equal to three.

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:43.787
So which function has
a greater y-intercept?

00:00:43.787 --> 00:00:45.640
Well, it's going to be f of x.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.451
F of x has a greater
y-intercept than g of x does.

00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:51.798
Let's do a few more of these

00:00:51.798 --> 00:00:53.260
where we're comparing different functions.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.987
One of them that has a visual depiction,

00:00:56.987 --> 00:00:59.054
and one of them where we're
just given the equation.

00:00:59.054 --> 00:01:01.991
How many roots do the
functions have in common?

00:01:01.991 --> 00:01:04.758
Well, g of x, we can see their roots.

00:01:04.758 --> 00:01:07.837
The roots are, x equals negative one

00:01:07.837 --> 00:01:11.017
and x is equal to two.

00:01:11.017 --> 00:01:13.427
So these two functions, at most,

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:14.925
are going to have two roots in common,

00:01:14.925 --> 00:01:17.920
because this g of x only has two roots.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.290
There's a couple of
ways we could tackle it.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.983
We could just try to find f's roots,

00:01:21.983 --> 00:01:25.156
or we could plug in
either one of these values

00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:29.054
and see if it makes the
function equal to a zero.

00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:31.225
I'll do the first way,
I'll try to factor this.

00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:35.393
So let's see, what two numbers,
if I add them I get one,

00:01:35.393 --> 00:01:38.191
'cause that's the coefficient
here, or implicitly there.

00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:40.722
And if I take the product,
I get negative six.

00:01:40.722 --> 00:01:42.289
Well, their gonna have
to have different signs

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:43.555
since their product is negative.

00:01:43.555 --> 00:01:46.817
So, let's see, negative
three and positive two.

00:01:46.817 --> 00:01:48.953
No, actually, the other way
around 'cause it's positive one.

00:01:48.953 --> 00:01:50.590
So positive three, and negative two.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.590
So this is equal to x plus
three, times x minus two.

00:01:55.722 --> 00:01:58.427
So f of x is going to have zeros when

00:01:58.427 --> 00:02:01.550
x is equal to negative three.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.385
X is equal to negative three.

00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:06.159
Or, x is equal to two.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.193
These are the two zeros.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:08.493
If x is equal to negative three,

00:02:08.493 --> 00:02:11.024
this expression becomes zero.

00:02:11.024 --> 00:02:12.990
Zero times anything is zero.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.389
If x equals two, this
expression becomes zero,

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:16.887
and zero times anything is zero.

00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:19.615
So f of negative three is
zero, and f of two is zero.

00:02:19.615 --> 00:02:21.891
These are the zeros of that function.

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:24.085
So let's see, which of
these are in common?

00:02:24.085 --> 00:02:26.593
Well, negative three is out
here, that's not in common.

00:02:26.593 --> 00:02:28.509
X equals two is in common,

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:32.189
so they only have one common
zero right over there.

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.136
So how many roots do the
functions have in common?

00:02:36.136 --> 00:02:37.321
One.

00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:38.522
All right.

00:02:38.522 --> 00:02:40.623
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:40.623 --> 00:02:44.588
And they ask us, "Do the functions
have the same concavity?"

00:02:44.588 --> 00:02:48.846
And one way to think about concavity is

00:02:48.846 --> 00:02:51.717
whether it's opening upwards
or opening downwards.

00:02:51.717 --> 00:02:55.631
So this is often viewed
as concave upwards,

00:02:55.631 --> 00:02:58.708
and this is viewed as concave downwards.

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:02.387
Concave downwards.

00:03:02.387 --> 00:03:04.825
And the key realization is,

00:03:04.825 --> 00:03:07.787
well, if you just look at this
blue, if you look at g of x

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:09.956
right over here, it is concave downwards.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:11.791
So the question is, "Would this be concave

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:12.952
"downwards or upwards?"

00:03:12.952 --> 00:03:14.894
And the key here is the coefficient on

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:19.894
the second degree term,
on the x squared term.

00:03:19.894 --> 00:03:22.019
If the coefficient is positive,

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.318
you're going to be concave upwards,

00:03:24.318 --> 00:03:27.452
because as x gets suitably
far away from zero,

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:30.355
this term is going to
overpower everything else,

00:03:30.355 --> 00:03:32.387
and it's going to become positive.

00:03:32.387 --> 00:03:35.289
So as x gets further and further away,

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:36.983
we're not even further away from zero,

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:38.853
as x gets further and
further away from the vertex,

00:03:38.853 --> 00:03:41.873
as x gets further and
further away from the vertex,

00:03:41.873 --> 00:03:43.892
this term dominates everything else,

00:03:43.892 --> 00:03:46.458
and we get more and more positive values.

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:49.419
And so that's why if your
coefficient is positive,

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.195
you're going to have concave upwards,

00:03:51.195 --> 00:03:53.087
a concave upwards graph.

00:03:53.087 --> 00:03:54.759
And so if this is concave upwards,

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.791
this one is clearly concave downwards.

00:03:56.791 --> 00:04:00.959
They do not have the
same concavity, so no.

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.989
If this was negative
four x squared minus 108,

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.789
then it would be concave
downwards and we would say yes.

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:09.356
Anyway, hopefully you
found that interesting.
