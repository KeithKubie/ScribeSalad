00:00:01.381 --> 00:00:03.534
- [Nathan] Having a professional
maid come to your home

00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:05.652
is one of life's great luxuries.

00:00:05.652 --> 00:00:08.352
But what begins as a desire
to have a tidy house,

00:00:08.352 --> 00:00:11.208
often turns into a day
long dance where your home

00:00:11.208 --> 00:00:12.380
isn't fully yours.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.035
- Ah, is okay if I go?

00:00:14.035 --> 00:00:15.721
- Oh, you wanna clean here?
- Cleaning around here?

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:16.919
- Oh, yeah, sure.

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:20.100
A house clean is a full day inconvenience.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.697
And that gave me an idea that would help

00:00:21.697 --> 00:00:24.014
Candy Pularez of The Help maid service

00:00:24.014 --> 00:00:26.541
in Glendale California offer her customers

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:28.116
a speedier clean.

00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:29.605
Nathan.
- How are you doing?

00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:31.790
- I always do a weak handshake up front

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.728
to establish that I'm not a threat.

00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:35.951
- Okay (laughs awkwardly)

00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:37.951
Okay, that's nice, cool.

00:00:38.874 --> 00:00:39.777
- [Nathan] And after some small talk,

00:00:39.777 --> 00:00:41.328
we got down to business.

00:00:41.328 --> 00:00:43.721
- A lot of people just want
two people there for two hours

00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:46.601
and they usually can do a
general cleaning of things.

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:50.841
- So, one maid takes four hours,
two maids takes two hours?

00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:51.674
- Mm hmm.

00:00:51.674 --> 00:00:53.926
- By that logic, 40 maids could clean

00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:55.843
a house in six minutes.

00:00:57.245 --> 00:00:58.782
- Yes.

00:00:58.782 --> 00:01:00.023
- [Nathan] By offering to clean houses

00:01:00.023 --> 00:01:01.437
40 maids at a time,

00:01:01.437 --> 00:01:03.518
Candy would not only
double the amount of jobs

00:01:03.518 --> 00:01:04.884
she could do in a day,

00:01:04.884 --> 00:01:07.613
but her customers would
likely pay a premium fee

00:01:07.613 --> 00:01:09.602
for a service that allows
them to have a spotless

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.710
home in the time it takes to go out

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.582
and grab a cup of coffee.

00:01:13.582 --> 00:01:16.037
The Plan, for The Help to
offer the fastest clean

00:01:16.037 --> 00:01:18.790
in the country with 40 maids.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.784
- Well if a customer asked for that,

00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:22.510
if they want 20 people, 40 people,

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.220
in their house, I could provide
it 'cause I have the teams,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.392
but they've never really
asked for a turbo clean

00:01:27.392 --> 00:01:28.447
or anything like that.

00:01:28.447 --> 00:01:30.092
- No one knows to ask for something

00:01:30.092 --> 00:01:32.272
that hasn't been invented yet.

00:01:32.272 --> 00:01:34.775
- It just, I don't know how it would work.

00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:37.400
- Candy was intrigued, but
knowing that coordination

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.872
would be our biggest challenge,

00:01:38.872 --> 00:01:40.774
I first needed to do a test.

00:01:40.774 --> 00:01:43.421
So, I found a guy who was
willing to try out the service.

00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:45.703
Do you know the measurements of this room?

00:01:45.703 --> 00:01:47.194
And mapped out a detailed floor plan

00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:49.515
of the inside of his house.

00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:51.509
Oh, is there something?

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.049
- Yeah, I think somebody
stepped in dog shit outside

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.363
and brought it in here, so.

00:01:56.363 --> 00:01:58.696
- Oh, I hope that wasn't me.

00:02:02.014 --> 00:02:04.438
So, I guess they'll get that too then.

00:02:04.438 --> 00:02:06.563
- That'd be great.

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:07.763
- With a house to clean,

00:02:07.763 --> 00:02:10.476
the next day I had Candy
assemble four of her best maids

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:12.942
back at the office to be team leaders.

00:02:12.942 --> 00:02:15.847
Seven in the kitchen,
five in the living room.

00:02:15.847 --> 00:02:17.324
And together we came up with a

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:20.785
sure fire plan to execute
a six minute clean.

00:02:20.785 --> 00:02:22.593
For this to work the maids would have

00:02:22.593 --> 00:02:23.743
to travel together.

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:26.489
So, I had a bus rented and
outfitted with branding

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.313
and I parked it at a central location

00:02:28.313 --> 00:02:30.084
where all the maids could meet.

00:02:30.084 --> 00:02:31.792
Candy was able to assemble the 40

00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:33.472
we needed from her roster

00:02:33.472 --> 00:02:35.324
and after dividing them into groups,

00:02:35.324 --> 00:02:37.294
the team leaders assigned each individual

00:02:37.294 --> 00:02:39.305
maid a specific task.

00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:41.539
And after all the maids
loaded on to the bus,

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.619
Candy had to head back to the office,

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:45.750
so it was all up to me to make this work.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.583
- Let's do this.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:47.549
- Okay!

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.677
- Okay, come on!

00:02:49.677 --> 00:02:50.510
- Knowing that this would

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.485
have to be executed like clockwork,

00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:54.257
while on route to the house I made sure

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:57.274
that each maid had her
individual role down pat.

00:02:57.274 --> 00:02:58.805
What's your job?

00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:03.042
- I'm doing the mopping
under the bed, the um, bed.

00:03:03.042 --> 00:03:04.181
- You seem a bit unsure, so I just,

00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:06.995
you can't be second
guessing when we're in there

00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:09.268
it's gonna go really fast.

00:03:09.268 --> 00:03:11.303
What's you're job?

00:03:11.303 --> 00:03:12.344
The sink?

00:03:12.344 --> 00:03:14.133
Is that gonna take six minutes, the sink?

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:15.073
- Mhm, yeah.

00:03:15.073 --> 00:03:17.612
- It will, it'll take six minutes?

00:03:17.612 --> 00:03:18.536
Okay.

00:03:18.536 --> 00:03:21.221
- Moments later we arrived
at the client's home.

00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:23.787
There was nothing more I
could do to prepare them now.

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:25.450
Alright, we're gonna do this.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.488
- Okay, now?

00:03:26.488 --> 00:03:27.321
- Yes.

00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:28.345
- The future of my concept

00:03:28.345 --> 00:03:30.983
was in the hands of a bus full of maids.

00:03:30.983 --> 00:03:32.630
Alright, ready?

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.915
Go!

00:03:33.915 --> 00:03:37.248
(chattering in Spanish)

00:03:39.776 --> 00:03:41.584
Faster, go, go, go, go, go!

00:03:41.584 --> 00:03:44.251
(upbeat music)

00:03:45.175 --> 00:03:46.400
Pick up the pace!

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.835
(upbeat music)

00:03:49.835 --> 00:03:50.668
Hurry in.

00:03:50.668 --> 00:03:53.335
(upbeat music)

00:03:55.756 --> 00:03:56.975
It's cool, huh?

00:03:56.975 --> 00:03:59.534
- Oh, yeah, this is amazing.

00:03:59.534 --> 00:04:02.201
(upbeat music)

00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:13.631
- Are you in a relationship right now?

00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:16.714
- L.A. is a really tough town to meet

00:04:18.087 --> 00:04:20.525
good people, so I guess it makes me

00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:22.715
in between relationships.

00:04:22.715 --> 00:04:25.382
(upbeat music)

00:04:29.826 --> 00:04:31.830
- How was your last relationship?

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.236
- Um, you know, we were pretty serious

00:04:35.236 --> 00:04:37.770
and played house for a while

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.603
yada, yada, yada, she
married her ex-boyfriend

00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:45.000
and I'm in LA training dogs.

00:04:48.105 --> 00:04:49.631
- Oh, crap.

00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:52.298
(upbeat music)

00:04:56.708 --> 00:05:00.041
Hurry, hurry, hurry, as fast as you can!

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.687
Let's go guys, come on.

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:07.104
Great job, come on guys.

00:05:09.128 --> 00:05:10.211
Come on guys.

00:05:12.787 --> 00:05:14.309
Once all 40 maids were out,

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:17.455
I brought Jim in to see if he
was satisfied with his clean.

00:05:17.455 --> 00:05:20.173
- It hasn't looked this
good since we moved in,

00:05:20.173 --> 00:05:22.175
realistically, it hasn't
looked this good since

00:05:22.175 --> 00:05:23.284
we moved in.

00:05:23.284 --> 00:05:25.204
This place was dirty
too, I mean, you know.

00:05:25.204 --> 00:05:27.375
- Yeah, it looked terrible.

00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:30.266
Alright guys, we didn't hit
our six minutes exactly,

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:33.780
we were eight minutes and 16 seconds.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.245
Regardless, Jim was very
happy with his clean.

00:05:36.245 --> 00:05:38.315
- Amazing job, y'all did a wonderful job,

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:40.006
thank you very much.

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.668
Absolutely.

00:05:41.668 --> 00:05:42.811
- What do you think of Jim?

00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:45.651
He's such a great guy
for hosting you, huh?

00:05:45.651 --> 00:05:47.423
(laughter)

00:05:47.423 --> 00:05:50.590
And he's single, ladies, I don't know.

00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:54.719
You interested in any of them, or?

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.202
- You're very kind but
they did all the hard work

00:05:57.202 --> 00:05:59.958
they deserve the applause,
they really did a good job.

00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958
- He could do some hard work on you.

00:06:05.413 --> 00:06:08.080
(clears throat)

00:06:09.234 --> 00:06:10.613
(sighs)

00:06:10.613 --> 00:06:11.446
Alright.

00:06:11.446 --> 00:06:14.113
(upbeat music)
