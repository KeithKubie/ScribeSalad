00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.710
 

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.480
We have four different
expressions here,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.990
and what I want
you to do is think

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.385
about which of these expressions
are equal to negative 2/3.

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:13.930
And I encourage you now
to pause this video,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.570
and try this on your own.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.860
So let's go to this first
expression right over here.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.610
I have 1/9, and I'm
going to add to that 5/9.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.380
So how many ninths
am I going to have?

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.162
Well, I had 1/9, now I'm adding
5/9, so I'm going to have 6/9.

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:34.120
If I have one of something
and I have five more

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.828
of that same something--
so in this case,

00:00:35.828 --> 00:00:39.480
that something is a ninth--
1/9 plus 5/9 is 6/9.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.170
Now, can we simplify
this in any way?

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.320
Well, both six and nine are
divisible by 3, so let's

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.200
divide them both by 3 to try to
get this fraction in a simpler

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.000
form.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.300
6 divided by 3 is 2.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.120
9 divided by 3 is 3.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.620
So this is 2/3, while what
we're trying to get to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.940
is negative 2/3.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.510
So these are not equal.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.630
This expression does
not equal negative 2/3,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.960
so I'll write "no" for that one.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.120
Now let's go to this green
expression right over here.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.020
Give myself a little bit
more real estate to work in.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.790
Now, we have negative
1/6 plus negative 1/2.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.665
Now, we can view this
as being the same thing

00:01:19.665 --> 00:01:21.998
as-- just to clarify, right
now the negative is in front

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:23.550
of the entire 1/6,
the negative's

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.290
in front of the entire 1/2.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.690
But this is the same
thing as negative 1/6,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.080
plus negative 1/2.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.160
Negative 1/2 is the same thing
as negative 1 divided by 2

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.462
is one way to think about it.

00:01:39.462 --> 00:01:40.920
And the whole reason
why I did this

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.790
is so we can simplify what the
negatives are right now only

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.830
in our numerator.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.260
So whenever we
add two fractions,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.540
we want to have the
same denominator.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.970
And we see that 6 is
already a multiple of 2,

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.510
so we could leave this first
fraction the way it is.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.716
We can rewrite it
as negative 1/6.

00:01:59.716 --> 00:02:01.590
And then the second
fraction, we can write it

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.390
as something over 6.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.390
Well, to go from 2 to 6,
we have to multiply by 3.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.660
So let's also multiply
the numerator by 3,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.700
negative 1 times
3 is negative 3.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.120
So if I have negative 1/6 sixth
and I add to that negative 3/6,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.740
this is going to be negative 1
plus negative 3 sixths, which

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.390
is equal to negative 4/6.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.790
Now, let's see if
we can simplify it.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.310
Both negative 4-- I guess
we can say both four

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.840
and six are divisible by 2, so
let's divide them both by 2.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.430
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.140
And in the numerator, we're
left with negative 4 divided

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.080
by 2 is negative 2.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.650
6 divided by 2 is 3.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.230
Negative 2 divided by 3.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.590
Well, that's the same thing
as negative 2/3, which

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.140
is exactly what our goal
value we're trying to get to.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.360
So, yes, this thing in green
is equal to negative 2/3.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.810
Now let's go over here.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.170
So we have negative
1.3 times negative 2.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.360
Well, if you multiply a
negative times a negative,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.120
we're going to get a
positive, and we're

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.306
going to get a
positive 1/3 times 2.

00:03:11.306 --> 00:03:12.680
So one way to
think about this is

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.170
going to be the same thing
as one third times 2,

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.782
which is the same thing.

00:03:17.782 --> 00:03:19.740
And there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.700
If you have 1/3 and now you're
going to multiply it by 2,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.390
we now have 2/3.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.340
You now have 2/3.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.370
Another way to
think about this is

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.970
that this is the same thing
as 2/3 times 2 over 1.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.680
And you know that when we
multiply two fractions,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.330
so this time we've expressed
the 2 as a fraction,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.120
we can multiply the numerators.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.150
So it's 1 times 2 over the
product of their denominators,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.080
3 times 1, which is 2 over 3.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.980
So either way you look at it,
this goes to positive 2/3.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.150
A negative times a
negative is a positive.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.690
So it gets us to positive
2/3 not negative 2/3,

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.115
so like this first one, no, it
does not equal negative 2/3.

00:04:06.115 --> 00:04:07.240
Now let's look at this one.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.970
Negative 1/3
divided by one half.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.245
So when you divide
by a fraction,

00:04:13.245 --> 00:04:16.589
so when you take
negative 1/3, dividing--

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.540
let me write it this way.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.250
So negative 1/3
divided by 1/2, this

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.500
is the same thing
as negative 1/3--

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.860
and let me color code it just
so you see what I'm doing.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.600
So let me make that green color.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.080
Let me make this a blue color.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.350
So negative 1/3
divided by 1/2 half

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.280
is the same thing
as negative 1/3

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:47.840
times the reciprocal of
1/2, so times 2 over 1.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.510
 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.340
And what is this
going to be equal to?

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.130
Well, we could assume
instead of just doing this

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.470
as negative 1/3, we could do
this as negative 1 divided

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.620
by 3, that might help us keep
track of the signs a little bit

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.409
more.

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.200
And let me actually
write it that way, just

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.533
to make it a little bit clearer.

00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:09.980
 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.260
Let me write this as
negative 1 divided by 3.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:21.770
So our numerator is now going
to be negative 1 times 2.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.250
When you multiply two
fractions, you just

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.750
multiply the two numerators
to get the new numerator,

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.370
and it's over 3 times 1.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.722
 

00:05:33.722 --> 00:05:35.930
And you normally wouldn't
have to do all these steps,

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.596
but I'm just doing
them to make sure you

00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:38.844
understand what's going on.

00:05:38.844 --> 00:05:41.010
And so this is going to be
equal to negative 1 times

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.790
2 is negative 2.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.580
And 3 times 1 is positive 3.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.060
Negative 2 over 3?

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.890
Well, that's the same
thing as negative 2/3.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.160
So this one works out.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.200
It is equal to negative 2/3.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.700
