00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.140
 this capsule we will introduce the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.779
 first round logic concept 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.099
 and then we will see that the euro that the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.639
 logic of the first role can play in 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.500
 artificial intelligence 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.179
 so the purpose of this capsule and 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.670
 the ones that will follow 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.529
 it's going to be to understand what the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.990
 first-time logic so between 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.460
 others know the syntax the logic 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.920
 of first rank may have commented on this 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.439
 we can describe facts in language 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.590
 natural in a logical form of 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.309
 first order and we also want to see 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.620
 and know how to make 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.879
 deductive reasoning in logic of 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.460
 leading roles ie is in 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.450
 able to demonstrate or prove 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.379
 new made from a base 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:58.559
 initial fact with what's called 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:01:00.120
 the proof by resolution the one we see 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.510
 the logic of the first role is actually 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.720
 a language that will be useful for 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.860
 describe knowledge in a 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.170
 premium context in intelligence 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.700
 artificially noted that research 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.740
 heuristic that we were able to 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.259
 solve several problems under the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.530
 form of a search in a serious of 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.020
 tops and for a problem you have me account 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.790
 complete that it's going to be often building 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.009
 problematic to describe in one form 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.970
 symbolic or and mathematics or even 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.180
 in a computer 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.700
 what do these ethologists 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.200
 6.1 and at the expense of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.790
 knowledge of an expert also the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.400
 transitions between the states of the lyrics 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.210
 will not always go obvious from a 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.979
 side that in a computer what would 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.369
 helpful actually it would be to have a 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.840
 language to represent the set of 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.950
 his knowledge that we want to exploit 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.049
 in our intelligence system 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.909
 artificial training or even a language 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.369
 which would represent the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.930
 knowledge of this experience and who 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.729
 allows me to easily make 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.740
 logical deductions from his 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.009
 knowledge to be able to 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.039
 reason logically in this 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.090
 knowledge area of ​​the expert 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.440
 so for his vote used what we 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.060
 calls the first two logic 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.270
 which sometimes also called calculates the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.730
 predicate so that's the basis of 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.050
 many is the basis of many 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.920
 representation list formats of 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.020
 intelligence knowledge 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.470
 artificial and it will allow us to 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.430
 make deductive reasoning that goes 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.660
 among others allow us to 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.920
 develop what we will call 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.700
 expert systems ie 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.160
 systems that captured the expertise 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.660
 of an expert and which are systems that 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.750
 are able to exploit this 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.540
 block expertise to reproduce it and 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.720
 make recommendations in a 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.720
 given problem 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.450
 originally we made the logic of 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.280
 first order is really a model 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.500
 mathematical deductive reasoning 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.440
 not deductive reasoning we mean 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.110
 a process that makes it possible to 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.630
 the expression inference will read 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.910
 true expression from facts 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.230
 known to the world and then some 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.110
 assumptions that we make with respect to this 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.610
 world there and so the ability to 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.260
 model a deductive reasoning go 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.070
 allow us thereafter to 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.130
 program this reasoning support so 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.320
 to make a design of what I called 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.820
 expert systems that's why 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.340
 it's important to see the formalism 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.860
 mathematical first order logic 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.330
 to know then we must have described 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.480
 the language comment on what we can 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.100
 the printer and then simulate the kind of 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.360
 expertise that can be modeled with 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.360
 first order logic 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.730
 but some examples of one can make the 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.269
 deductive reasoning so 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.950
 imagine that we are in the time of 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.820
 Rome and then we have different sons on 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.100
 a given situation 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.200
 so we have to marcus and we do not 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.680
 mark it is a marcus person is a 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.560
 pean bridge 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.250
 all firefighters are Caesar Romans 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.250
 is a leader 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.320
 everyone is loyal to someone all 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.330
 the Romans are loyal to Caesar or the 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.890
 the only leaders 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.450
 no one tries this sinister have known 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.340
 to which she is not loyal and 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.350
 finally marcus tried to murder 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.160
 Caesar so let's imagine we all have this 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.330
 what is our knowledge base 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.530
 let's imagine now that we want we want 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.570
 prove that marcus to grab it from 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.039
 of all these facts then this is a 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.000
 review made that we will review the capsules 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.260
 who 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.540
 who will follow because it's a 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.190
 relatively healthy example pretty much 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.140
 maybe such a sign that it's not 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.880
 truly representative has refueled 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.260
 problems that will take shape 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.750
 very similar that is to say we will 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.570
 want to prove something from 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.700
 of a knowledge base so a 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.290
 problem that will seem maybe a 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.310
 little bit more useful it's on a 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.890
 patient who has several symptoms that 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.450
 registered in our knowledge base 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.400
 we know what the rules of 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.590
 causality between symptoms and 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.480
 pathologies and that we struggled 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.140
 causality on treatments that we 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.780
 could offer ben patients in this 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.520
 case also an application problem when 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.350
 even nothing to solve is to infer that the 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.270
 the patient's disease and in addition is in 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.970
 able to say what is the treatment 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.280
 suitable for special so with the 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.480
 first-order logic and among others 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.800
 the proof by resolution is something 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.410
 something we will be able to try to 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.240
 solve is another problem that 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.790
 basically the same thing 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.710
 but in the automotive world 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.480
 we could have a car for 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.680
 which one wants to diagnose what is it 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.080
 his problem 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.419
 so that's why we need 5 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.650
 tons we get a little trash to talk 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.360
 of symptoms for a car but it's 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.669
 in fact the equivalent of 70 for a 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.870
 nobody so what are the problems 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:47.280
 associated vehicles that we observe is 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.540
 what are the rules of causality 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.830
 for mechanics that could not go up 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.560
 to be able to say what is it 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.580
 the problem source the storm to solve 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.350
 for another vehicle 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.270
 so that's exactly the same type of 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.940
 problem we have knowledge bases 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.380
 then we would like to prove doing the 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.570
 demonstration of something in this 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.550
 case demonstrate what is the problem 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.220
 associated with our vehicle then in this 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:13.470
 this is what the disease this to 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:15.510
 patients so I have not seen the system 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.150
 expert before we will not see that in the 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.190
 detail in these capsules 6 but so 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.100
 general the system expert this system where 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.320
 we have a knowledge base that 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.620
 we were specified by an expert so 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.020
 who has formulated us all of 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.979
 facts on a given area that this 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.900
 nobody knows at this 200 we will see 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:39.540
 other potentially new facts that 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.280
 are brought so it could be 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.290
 a knowledge base to be 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.030
 the knowledge set of a doctor 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.040
 in relation to medicine then challenge it 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.130
 could be observed symptoms 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.210
 in a patient and expert systems 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.190
 will then be able to make a 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.740
 interrogation ie to ask a 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.780
 some questions in relation to a 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.380
 possible illness for our patient by 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.240
 example and to first order logic 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.410
 gold a search engine that will do 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.200
 of reasoning then who is going to be in 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.470
 able to give us an answer to the 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.470
 any end 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.890
 we can also use the logic of 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:20.460
 first run in planning in this case 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:21.960
 also we have an agent and imagine that 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.000
 our agent can run multiple 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.430
 tasks in a given environment like 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.390
 a robot that can manipulate objects 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:33.030
 in his environment and imagine 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.200
 we want to give a goal to our age 

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.700
 we want them to do something 

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.750
 thing for example our good would like 

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.550
 that they move 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:43.950
 some objects from one place to another 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:46.140
 and I do not look at your list of 

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.550
 business operations by so the list 

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.260
 business operations to accomplish 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.160
 the goal is not to code advanced so we 

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.120
 is really in a context 

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.920
 artificial intelligence 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:58.710
 we want the agent phase ii by itself 

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:01.490
 even planning so the list of 

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:03.780
 offered actions to reach the goal 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.070
 so we've already seen algorithms 

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.580
 how stars that allows us to do 

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:11.340
 that if we specify the goal before we 

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.380
 can build a graffiti at all this 

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.750
 environment where when we reach the 

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.980
 purpose we know that our research must 

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.000
 stop and then do a search 

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:22.410
 with canvas with logistics that 

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.210
 some properties well there we are sure 

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:27.080
 we will have found when the strike 

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:29.100
 in order to exist the necessary plan 

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.080
 the benefit of first-order logic 

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.330
 you know we will have known a lot more 

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:37.050
 easy to build this graph the child 

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:39.630
 so we will be able to formulate with the 

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:42.090
 logic of the first run all of 

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.320
 facts knowledge of actions 

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.660
 possible consequences of actions 

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.790
 of this agent their in their environment 

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:50.100
 and that that allows you to the same 

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.450
 system to actually solve several 

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.779
 possible tasks 

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:55.829
 so it's going to be easy for 

00:08:52.779 --> 00:08:58.149
 to change the purpose and name it in fact a 

00:08:55.829 --> 00:09:00.670
 very big not what we will see language 

00:08:58.149 --> 00:09:02.589
 now to describe the goals so that's 

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:06.839
 is going to be a simplified way 

00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:09.370
 then well formal to specify braids 

00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:11.139
 very precisely what is the goal 

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.910
 when we want our agents to solve 

00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:15.879
 wood hero encloses specified multiple 

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:17.829
 so in the world of the web was what we have 

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:20.470
 seen in another capture which one 

00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:21.490
 could for a given situation say 

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.139
 inside we want them to find 

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:25.269
 their or in another we could say 

00:09:23.139 --> 00:09:26.980
 you are the web can he have a language 

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:29.649
 are a language that allows me to 

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.209
 to formulate his two things there we go 

00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:33.550
 can use the same system for 

00:09:31.209 --> 00:09:35.350
 solve the same problem of plastic 

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.970
 planning ie determining the 

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:40.120
 list of actions to be found during 

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.980
 where to find the group is therefore alone 

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:49.779
 advantage of the utility of the logic of 

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:51.699
 first order in planning so in 

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:53.379
 logical the first rank which is going 

00:09:51.699 --> 00:09:55.839
 distinguish two aspects that we want 

00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:59.500
 cover in the capsules that are 

00:09:55.839 --> 00:10:01.269
 so come in fact the veracity of a 

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.769
 expression to logic the veracity 

00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:03.879
 logic of an expression goes depends on 

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:06.639
 two things it will depend on doing 

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:09.339
 defection true that we do not suppose 

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:11.259
 have a given situation so by 

00:10:09.339 --> 00:10:13.480
 example that all people are 

00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:15.160
 dead she a patient some 

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.620
 temperature or that a car starts 

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.389
 association of facts that can be described 

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.220
 that we will describe according to some 

00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:22.899
 syntax between the syntax of logic 

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.100
 first rank so this is the first 

00:10:22.899 --> 00:10:25.720
 something we will have to review how 

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:29.019
 Can we take those facts? 

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:32.410
 then describe them in a language the 

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:33.610
 logical language of first rank and so 

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.139
 that will allow us, among other things, 

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.970
 specific what is true to 

00:10:35.139 --> 00:10:38.110
 to know exactly how weak it is 

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.250
 that all people are dead 

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:42.730
 she is true that passionate 

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:46.000
 temperature of 40 degrees thus killed and 

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:47.949
 another part another another another 

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.559
 aspect that will need to demonstrate 

00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:52.360
 the veracity of a new expression of 

00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:53.920
 make the new deduction 

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.429
 expressions their logical expression 

00:10:53.920 --> 00:11:00.730
 that they're real it's going to actually depend 

00:10:57.429 --> 00:11:02.559
 of syntactic manipulation from 

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.509
 facts that are green that will us 

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:05.630
 allow for new derivatives 

00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:09.140
 expressions 

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:11.810
 so if we have the fact that being a 

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.340
 no one imply immortal and that 

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:15.620
 dupont is a person 

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.540
 Well, it turns out that we can deduce 

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.520
 so let it be there a person 

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.830
 let's apply is deadly and that in addition to the 

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.660
 bridge is a person who can 

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:26.270
 logically deduce that dupont is dead 

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.190
 she's actually doing this reasoning 

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:30.050
 there what we will see what we can do 

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:33.020
 syntactic manipulations one can 

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:35.440
 to convert the facts that we have plessis 

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:38.900
 in a slightly more mathematical form 

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:42.320
 so pay that implies m 2 x for 

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:44.450
 all x and peace has therefore explained even x 

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.450
 for all and that would be a way 

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:49.670
 to express one's personality 

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.160
 immortal can be a way of saying 

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:55.220
 that a person to a person is so 

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:57.050
 there is a person called to and to 

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.970
 from that way purely this 

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.420
 accident is able to tell true that 

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:03.230
 m 

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:06.080
 to is also true and it was done without 

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.220
 senna noticed that t as and pie x are 

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.230
 basically the same thing it's 

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.660
 just that one just needs to 

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:14.630
 take support of assigning it to x and 

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:17.030
 barley is a country x so to associate 

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:20.960
 ap one so that will mean that pea 

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:23.540
 imply my and so I could add 

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:26.420
 our knowledge base and so me 

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.530
 the game describes them in words so no 

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.810
 very strong even is what we will see 

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:31.610
 is that this title of deductions the man 

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.650
 we will be able to formalize it on the form 

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.150
 of a difference rule faced took the 

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:37.430
 resolution that goes is a rule when 

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.500
 even pretty flexible and general then who 

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:42.110
 will allow us to do several 

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.310
 types of logic manipulations purely 

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.930
 syntactically that is to say that we are 

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:48.320
 simply manipulate the symbols 

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:49.640
 associated with the truth they were 

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.770
 expressed in the knowledge base 

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.450
 for like that in derivatives again 

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:56.290
 again in the form of the 

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:56.290
 first order logic
