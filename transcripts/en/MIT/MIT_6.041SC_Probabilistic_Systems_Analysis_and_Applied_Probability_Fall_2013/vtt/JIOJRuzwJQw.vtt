00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.040
 

00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.710
Hey, guys.

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.020
Welcome back.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.680
Today, we're going to do another
fun problem, which is

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.980
a drill problem on joint PMFs.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.330
And the goal is that you will
feel more comfortable by the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.830
end of this problem,
manipulating joint PMFs.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.490
And we'll also review some ideas
about independents in

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.380
the process.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.440
So just to go over what
I've drawn here, we

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.090
are given an xy plane.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.810
And we're told what
the PMF is.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.080
And it's plotted for you here.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.220
What these stars indicate
is simply that

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.130
there is a value there.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.230
But we don't know what it is.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.750
It could be anything
between 0 and 1.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.600
And so we're given this
list of questions.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.590
And we're just going
to work through

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.000
them linearly together.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.970
So we start off pretty simply.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.900
We want to compute, in part a,
the probability that x takes

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.590
on a value of 1.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.690
So for those of you who like
formulas, I'm going to use the

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.390
formula, which is usually
referred to as

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.380
marginalization.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.740
So the marginal over
x is given by

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.840
summing over the joint.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.170
So here we are interested in the
probability that x is 1.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.650
So I'm just going to freeze
the value of 1 here.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.365
And we sum over y.

00:01:17.365 --> 00:01:20.530
And in particular,
1, 2, and 3.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:28.230
So carrying this out, this is
the Pxy of 1, 1, plus Pxy of

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.290
1, 2, plus Pxy 1, 3.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.990
And this, of course, reading
from the graph, is 1/12 plus

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.700
2/12 plus 1/12, which is
equal to 4/12, or 1/3.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.340
So now you guys know
the formula.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.040
Hopefully you'll remember the
term marginalization.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.170
But I want to point out that
intuitively you can come up

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.040
with the answer much faster.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.010
So the probability that x is
equal to 1 is the probability

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.840
that this dot happens
or this dot

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.320
happens or this dot happens.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.280
Now, these dots, or outcomes,
they're disjoint.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.320
So you can just sum the
probability to get the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.280
probability of one of these
things happening.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.310
So it's the same computation.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.300
And you'll probably get there
a little bit faster.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.940
So we're done with a already,
which is great.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.050
So for part b, conditioning on
x is equal to 1, we want to

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.850
sketch the PMF of y.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.380
So if x is equal to
1 we are suddenly

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.510
living in this universe.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.440
y can take values of 1, 2,
or 3 with these relative

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.840
frequencies.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.790
So let's draw this here.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.400
So this is y.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.550
I said, already, y can take on
a value of 1. y can take on a

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.270
value of 2.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.680
Or it can take on
a value of 3.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.700
And we're plotting here, Py
given x, y, conditioned on x

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.390
is equal to 1.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.950
OK, so what I mean by preserving
the relative

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.925
frequencies is that in
unconditional world this is

00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:10.320
dot is twice as likely
to happen as either

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.470
this dot or this dot.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.110
And that relative likelihood
remains the same after

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.590
conditioning.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.540
And the reason why we have to
change these values is because

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.820
they have to sum to 1.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.410
So in other words, we have
to scale them up.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.420
So you can use a formula.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.780
But again, I'm here to show
you faster ways of

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.390
thinking about it.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.620
So my little algorithm for
figuring out conditional PMFs

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.600
is to take the numerators--

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.500
so 1, 2, and 1--

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.390
and sum them.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.300
So here that gives us 4.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.120
And then to preserve the
relative frequency, you

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.630
actually keep the same
numerators but divide it by

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.820
the sum, which you
just computed.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.530
So I'm going fast.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.950
I'll review in a second.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.390
But this is what you will
end up getting.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.890
So to recap, I did 1 plus 2
plus 1, which is 4, to get

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.570
these denominators.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.080
And so I skipped a step here.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.880
This is really 2/4, which
is 1/2, obviously.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.030
So you add these
guys to get 4.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.710
And then you keep the
numerators and just

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.649
divide them by 4.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:20.040
So 1/4, 2/4, which
is 1/2 and 1/4.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.959
And that's what we mean
by preserving

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.230
the relative frequency.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.730
Except so this thing now sums
to 1, which is what we want.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.520
OK, so we're done with part b.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.490
Part c actually follows almost
immediately from part b.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.540
In part c we're interested in
computing the conditional

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.970
expectation of y given
that x is equal to 1.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.550
So we've already done most of
the legwork because we have

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.070
the conditional PMF
that we need.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.390
And so expectation, you guys
have calculated a bunch of

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.060
these by now.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.350
So I'm just going to
appeal to your

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.640
intuition and to symmetry.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.490
Expectation acts like
center of mass.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.200
This is a symmetrical
distribution of mass.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.960
And so the center is
right here at 2.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.660
So this is simply 2.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.110
And if that went too fast,
just convince yourselves.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.050
Use the normal formula
for expectations.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.240
And your answer will
agree with ours.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.670
OK, so d is a really
cool question.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.140
Because you can do
a lot of math.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.810
Or you can think and ask
yourself, at the most

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.330
fundamental level, what
is independents?

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.290
And if you think that
way you'll come to

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.120
the answer very easily.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.740
So essentially, I rephrased this
to truncate it from the

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.940
problem statement that
you guys are reading.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.710
But the idea is that
these stars are

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.820
unknown probability masses.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.620
And this question is asking can
you figure out a way of

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.390
assigning numbers between 0
and 1 to these values such

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.395
that you end up with a valid
probability mass function, so

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:06.020
everything sums to 1 and such
that x and y are independent?

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.300
So it seems hard a priori.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.470
But let's think about
it a bit.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.540
And in the meantime I'm
going to erase this

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.390
so I have more room.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.580
What does it mean for x and
y to be independent?

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.480
Well, it means that they don't,
essentially, have

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.760
information about each other.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.360
So if I tell you something about
x and if x and y are

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.430
independent, your belief about
y shouldn't change.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.010
In other words, if you're a
rational person, x shouldn't

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.950
change your belief about y.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.890
So let's look more closely
at this diagram.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.090
Now, the number 0 should
be popping out to you.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.500
Because this essentially means
that the 0.31 can't happen.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.850
Or it happens with
0 probability.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.630
So let's say fix x equal to 3.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.750
If you condition on x is equal
to 3, as I just said, this

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.320
outcome can't happen.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.740
So y could only take on
values of 2 or 3.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.760
However, if you condition on x
is equal to 1, y could take on

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.235
a value of 1 with probability
1/4 as we computed in the

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:17.080
other problem.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.550
It could take on a value of
2 with probability of 1/2.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.220
Or it could take on a value
of 3 with probability 1/4.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.410
So these are actually very
different cases, right?

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.450
Because if you observe
x is equal to 3 y can

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.950
only be 2 or 3.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:35.030
But if you observe x is equal
to 1, y can be 1, 2, or 3.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:40.510
So actually, x, no matter what
values these stars have on, x

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.000
always tells you something
about y.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.410
Therefore, the answer to
this, part d, is no.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.600
So let's put a no with
an exclamation point.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.730
So I like that problem a lot.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.960
And hopefully it clarifies
independents for you guys.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.240
So parts e and f, we're going
to be thinking about

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.390
independents again.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.330
To go over what the problem
statement gives you, we

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.900
defined this event, b, which
is the event that x is less

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.640
than or equal to 2 and y is
less than or equal to 2.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.250
So let's get some colors.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.510
So do bright pink.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.170
So that means we're essentially

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.500
living in this world.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.320
There's only those four dots.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.370
And we're also told a very
important piece of information

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:30.870
that conditions on B. x and y
are conditionally independent.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.409
OK, so part e, now that
we have this.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:36.860
And by the way, these two
assumptions apply to both

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.100
parts e and part f.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.920
So in part e, we want to
find out Pxy of 2, 2.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.090
Or in English, what is the
probability that x takes on a

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.650
value of 2 and y takes
on a value of 2?

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.630
So determine the value
of this star.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:09:01.090
And the whole trick here is that
the possible values that

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.500
this star could take on are
constrained by the fact that

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.210
we need to make sure that x
and y are conditionally

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:11.310
independent given B.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:17.670
So my claim is that if two
random variables are

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:22.040
independent and you condition
on one of them, say we

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.050
condition on x.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.180
If you condition on different
values of x, the relative

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.460
frequencies of y should
be the same.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.930
So here, the relative frequency,
condition on x is

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.060
equal to 1.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.500
The relative frequencies
of y are 2 to 1.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.170
This outcome is twice as likely
to happen as this one.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.370
If we condition on 2 this
outcome needs to be twice as

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.990
likely to happen as
this outcome.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:51.210
If they weren't, x would tell
you information about y.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.450
Because you would know that the
distribution over 2 and 1

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.530
would be different.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:57.900
OK?

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.940
So because the relative
frequencies have to be the

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:06.440
same and 2/12 is 2 times
1/12 this guy must

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.800
also be 2 times 2/12.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.860
So that gives us our
answer for part e.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.220
Let me write up here.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:26.340
Part e, we need Pxy 2, 2
to be equal to 4/12.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:32.630
And again, the way we got this
is simply we need x and y to

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:37.250
be conditionally independent
given B. And if this were

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:43.530
anything other than 4 the
relative frequency of y is

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.960
equal to 2 to 1 would be
different from over here.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.540
So here condition on
x is equal to 1.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.250
The outcome, y is equal to 2
is twice as likely as x is

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.990
equal to 1.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:59.510
Here, if we put a value of 4/12
and you condition on x is

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:05.090
equal to 2, the outcome y is
equal to 2 is still twice as

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.610
likely as the outcome
y is equal to 1.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.630
And if you put any other number
there the relative

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.080
frequencies would
be different.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.050
So x would be telling you
something about y.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.491
So there would not be
independent condition on B.

00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:19.730
OK, that was a mouthful.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.860
But hopefully you guys
have it now.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:28.080
And lastly, we have part f,
which follows pretty directly

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.900
from part e.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.550
So we were still in the
unconditional universe.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.840
In part e, we were figuring out
what's the value of star

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.010
in the whole unconditional
universe?

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.890
Now, in part f, we want the
value of star in the

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.250
conditional universe
where B occurred.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:49.180
So let's come over here and plot
a new graph so we don't

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.130
confuse ourselves.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.442
So we have xy.

00:11:53.442 --> 00:11:55.130
x can be 1 or 2.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.740
Y could be 1 or 2.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.690
So we have a plot that looks
something like this.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:05.360
And so again, same argument
as before.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.430
Let me just fill this in.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.930
From part e, we have
that this is 4/12.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.880
And we're going to use
my algorithm again.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.340
So in the conditional world,
the relative frequencies of

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.990
these four dots should
be the same.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:19.000
But you need to scale them up so
that if you sum over all of

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.780
them the probability
sums to 1.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.470
So you have a valid PMF.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.840
So my algorithm from before
was to add up all the

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.920
numerators.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.520
So 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus
2 gives you 9.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.060
And then to preserve the
relative frequency you keep

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.320
the same numerator.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.530
So here we had a
numerator of 1.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.790
That becomes 1/9.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.490
Here we had a numerator of 2.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.290
This becomes 2/9.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.900
Here we had a numerator of 4.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.310
That becomes 4/9.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.510
Here we had a numerator
of 2, so 2/9.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:51.040
And indeed, the relative
frequencies are preserved.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.870
And they all sum to 1.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.340
So our answer for part f--

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.720
let's box it here--

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:03.780
is that Pxy 2, 2 conditioned
on B is equal to 4/9,

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.910
is just that guy.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.020
So we're done.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.780
Hopefully that wasn't
too painful.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.400
And this is a good drill
problem, because we got more

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.880
comfortable working with
PMFs, joint PMFs.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.700
We went over marginalization.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.560
We went over conditioning.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.600
We went over into
independents.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:30.500
And I also gave you this quick
algorithm for figuring out

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.310
what conditional PMFs
are if you don't

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.840
want to use the formulas.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.190
Namely, you sum all of the
numerators to get a new

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.280
denominator and then divide all
the old numerators by the

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.020
new denominator you computed.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.350
So I hope that was helpful.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.600
I'll see you next time.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.420
