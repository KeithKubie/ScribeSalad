00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.790
The school of AI that works on cognitive architectures makes sort of

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.190
fundamental assumptions about the nature of cognitive agents.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.530
First, that cognitive agents are goal oriented, or goal directed.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.460
They have goals and they take actions in the pursuit of those goals.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.149
Second, that these cognitive agents live in a rich, complex,

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:26.650
dynamic environments. Third, this cognitive agent used knowledge of the world in

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.020
order to pursue their goals in this rich complex dynamic environments. Fourth,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.373
that this knowledge is particular abstraction that captures the important things

00:00:37.373 --> 00:00:43.950
about the world that the level of abstraction and removes all the details. And

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.550
at that level of abstraction, knowledge is captured in the form of symbols.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.800
Fifth, the cognitive agents are very flexible.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.160
The behavior is dependent upon the environment. As environment changes, so

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.160
does the behavior. And sixth cognitive agents learn from their experiences.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.150
They're constantly learning as they interact with the world.
