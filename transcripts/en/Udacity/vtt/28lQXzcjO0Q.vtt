00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.670
Let's talk now about adding and
subtracting integers.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.148
Here's a vocabulary word
you should write down.

00:00:08.148 --> 00:00:12.680
A Sum is the result of
adding numbers together.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.878
Now if my bank account is overdrawn
by $20 and I write a check for $15.

00:00:18.878 --> 00:00:20.940
What is my new bank account balance?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.630
Write your answer here.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.468
Don't worry about
including a dollar sign.

00:00:25.468 --> 00:00:27.639
