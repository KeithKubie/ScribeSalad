00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.050
Superheroes may rely on supervillains for
action and drama, seeing their powers turned

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.990
against them or pushed to their limits, but
you don’t need heat vision or super-strength

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.299
to be truly terrifying.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.320
Sometimes, all it takes is a criminal blessed
with determination, and an opponent pushing

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.789
them to their true potential.

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.850
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Most Dangerous
Comic Book Criminals.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.850
The Joker

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.440
No one knows his story, his motivations, or
his endgame - but everyone knows his name:

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.250
Joker.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.289
Over the years, Batman's arch-nemesis has
been portrayed as a serial killer, a crime

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.190
boss, a madman, and an agent of chaos, in
nearly every form of entertainment.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.780
Every fan may have their favourite, but The
Joker is so fragmented and crazed, it's impossible

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.920
to even call one version more faithful than
any other.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.760
Without any superpower, super weapon, or even
backup, Joker's calculated mayhem hasn't just

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.170
made him a comic book icon, but one of the
most complicated and terrifying villains in

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.170
history.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.860
Not bad for a guy with nothing but a knife,
a pistol, and a plan.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.860
Kingpin

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.420
He may not be much to look at, but Wilson
Fisk has proven to be not only one of the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.820
most brilliant and ruthless crime bosses the
comic book world has ever seen, but a physical

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.230
threat capable of fighting some of Marvel’s
most impressive heroes.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.350
Bullied in his childhood because of his weight,
Fisk hit the gym, turning his former bullies

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.500
into henchmen, and beginning his rise to the
top of Hell’s Kitchen’s underworld, letting

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.159
his fists and wits do the talking, eventually
becoming the Kingpin of Crime.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.510
Don’t be fooled by the lack of a gun or
club, either: The Kingpin prefers to kill

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.570
with his bare hands, and whatever furniture
is nearby.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.600
He may not be a supervillain, but a man with
his talents for organized crime who can beat

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.840
Daredevil and Spider-Man in a fight deserves
more credit than he’s usually given.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.840
Killer Croc

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.840
Born with a rare genetic condition that caused
his skin to grow hard and scaly like a reptile,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:56.979
Waylon Jones was an outcast, bullied by schoolmates
and abused and abandoned by an alcoholic aunt.

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.140
As he grew bigger and badder, a job wrestling
alligators for the circus seemed a waste of

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.140
his talents.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.829
Waylon knew how to be tough, and knew a life
of crime was his destiny.

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.039
Taking the name Killer Croc, he set out to
organize and rule the criminals of Gotham

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.690
City, proving a serious player even without
his bulletproof skin and superstrength.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.549
He would do battle with Batman too many times
to count, but what he lacked in brains, he

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:17.890
made up for in brutality.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.370
Did we mention he's also a cannibal?

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.909
The Darkness

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.579
As one of the few comic criminals who is neither
good or evil, Jackie Estacado began his life

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.930
as an orphan, adopted into the Franchetti
crime family at the tender age of 6.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.120
Making his first kill at the age of 16, Jackie
would become the family’s most skilled and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.870
ruthless hitman, doing more than just killing
his targets to send a message.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.650
But on his 21st birthday, he learned that
his induction into the mafia was no coincidence:

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.640
he was the latest in a long line of men entrusted
with The Darkness: an ancient force granting

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.260
its host nearly limitless power.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.200
In the hands of Jackie, the power to create
any weapon or creature as long as he stayed

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.680
in the shadows was a perfect fit, seeking
vengeance on all who had wronged him in the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.680
past.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.690
With the power to take on Superman himself,
Jackie took over the crime family with ease,

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.599
putting his skills learned on the streets
to work taking over an entire country.

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.599
The Riddler

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.359
Unlike most criminal masterminds, the Prince
of Puzzlers can't resist telling the absolute

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.359
truth.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.029
But his need to prove he's the smartest person
in the room means The Riddler can't do anything

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.029
simply.

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.549
His green costume and obsession with riddles
and brainteasers made Edward Nigma a bit of

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.739
a joke to mainstream audiences, but comic
fans have seen him develop into a twisted,

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.569
terrifying and truly dangerous criminal over
the years.

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.109
The well-known "Hush" storyline saw Riddler
pulling the strings behind every single Batman

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.150
villain as part of his plan to bring down
Bruce Wayne once and for all.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.120
More recently, "Batman: Zero Year" saw Riddler
take complete control over Gotham, turning

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.299
the city to ruins until a citizen could solve
his riddles.

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.549
Puzzles aren't too scary, but in the hands
of The Riddler, they can be fatal.

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:47.549
Carnage

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.529
Spider-Man knew that the Alien symbiotic behind
his black suit was bad news, and when it merged

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:55.389
with Eddie Brock to become Venom, his most
popular enemy was born.

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.029
But not his most dangerous.

00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:01.199
When Brock found himself sharing a cell with
serial killer psychopath Cletus Kasady, he

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.139
wanted out - fast.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:07.430
His alien partner came to the rescue, but
left its child behind, soon entering Kasady's

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.139
bloodstream - and just like that, Carnage
was born.

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.599
What was most horrifying about the murderous
rampages that followed wasn't the villain's

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.060
powers, but placing them in Kasady's hands.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.980
It was the madman's belief that murder was
the mark of true courage that made him a menace,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.620
meaning he's just as deadly without the suit.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.169
He was created to show what DC's Joker could
do if given superpowers, and Carnage has yet

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.129
to disappoint.

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:30.129
Bullseye

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.539
Putting his skills with throwing projectiles
to use as a baseball player, the pitcher who

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.889
would become known as “Bullseye” found
throwing a no-hitter too boring.

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.759
Killing the batter with a ball to the head
sent him on his path of murders-for-hire,

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:44.110
becoming one of the deadliest assassins the
Marvel Universe has ever seen.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.659
But becoming a soldier of fortune for villains
like The Kingpin wasn’t enough – Bullseye

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.380
wanted fame as well.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.830
Bragging to New York’s Daily Bugle about
his many kills and the fact that he “never

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.110
misses” put Daredevil on his tail – and
the two have been at war ever since.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.580
If his mastery of martial arts, guns and blades
wasn’t deadly enough.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.550
Bullseye can turn toothpicks, paperclips,
and even his own teeth into lethal weapons.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.870
For the right price, of course.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.870
Arcade

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.729
Who says insanity and homicidal tendencies
can’t be profitable?

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.560
The Marvel villain known as “Arcade” learned
there’s good money in killing, and as is

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.909
usually the case, bigger is better.

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.139
When the pampered young man was cut off by
his wealthy father, he killed him, and took

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.280
the money for himself.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.960
Flush with cash and realizing his love of
murder, Arcade became a globetrotting assassin.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.039
But when the murder game became too boring,
he hatched a different plan: he’d build

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.150
his own deathtrap known as “Murderworld,”
and drop his targets into the fatal theme

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.710
park to give them a fighting chance.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.409
The villain’s similarities to DC’s Joker
are obvious, but his one-of-a-kind humor and

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.569
genuine thrill at seeing his victims attempt
to escape made him a hit, appearing alongside

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:43.400
many of Marvel’s most well-known heroes.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.949
Even if that meant he racked up more failures
than kills.

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:48.030
Two-Face

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.060
What’s more tragic than seeing an embodiment
of law and order flipped on its head, embracing

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.110
crime, chaos and violence instead?

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.500
The answer is a man who can’t even decide
between the two.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.860
Every Batman fan knows the tragic story of
Harvey Dent, once an upstanding District Attorney

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.349
who develops a split personality when half
of his face is burned with acid.

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.030
Although the darker side of his character
may be more than a little crazed, it still

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.659
has access to the brilliant intelligence and
knowledge of Gotham’s underworld.

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:18.650
The result is Two-Face, a crime boss who sees
every attack against Gotham as an opportunity.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.629
But what makes the villain truly dangerous
is his signature coin, used to make nearly

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:24.870
every decision facing his fractured mind.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.539
Sure, he may have become predictable over
the years, but when the flip of a coin means

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:33.181
Harvey Dent may help Batman save the day – or
commit an unspeakable act of violence, he

00:06:33.181 --> 00:06:37.919
becomes a villain unlike any other the Dark
Knight has had to face.

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:38.919
Prometheus

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:42.900
If there’s one criminal in the world of
DC Comics who is truly underrated, it has

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.080
to be Prometheus.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.199
Raised by two criminals, the young boy travelled
across America, learning the outlaw life until

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.080
his parents were shot down by police.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.949
Just as Bruce Wayne dedicated his life to
avenging his parents, Prometheus did the same.

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:57.830
Spending time in South American fighting pits,
working as an African mercenary and as an

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.319
international terrorist, Prometheus became
a true student of crime and violence, eventually

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.169
killing the cops who killed his parents, and
turning his finely-tuned skills to bringing

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:07.280
down the Justice League.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.599
He may have required some gadgets to get the
job done, but an everyday criminal who can

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:15.569
take down Batman, Green Lantern, and Martian
Manhunter deserves some respect.

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:18.150
So what do you think of our list?
