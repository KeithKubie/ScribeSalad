1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,760
Okay. Ready? Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm
Robert Krulwich and this is Radiolab.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,090
Today we've got a story about the
crazy power of words in particular,

3
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:12,050
60 words, single sentence that it is,

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,920
has you could say defined America
for the last 12 years and uh,

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,090
yeah, and the place to start is
a difficult one. This Justin,

6
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:24,390
you were looking at obviously a
very disturbing live shot there.

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,480
September 11th, 2001 8:46 AM

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,640
a plane has crashed into
the World Trade Center.

9
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:32,540
We don't know anything more
than that. We don't know.

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,730
This is a day that anyone
who is old enough to remember
does remember we have no

11
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:39,760
idea. You can remember where we
were on board or who we were with.

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,000
So you have no idea. Rather right.
Rather write one another plane.

13
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,840
Just oh my God. Another plane has jet kit

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,310
and of course we can remember how he felt.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,050
Tell me what you just saw. Oh, fell down.

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,730
Let's go see what happened.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,190
It just the worst attack
ever on American soil.

18
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,090
If you really want to understand
the world we live in now,

19
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,171
you've got to jump ahead.

20
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:16,730
One day to September 12th two a corner
office in the White House where there's a

21
00:01:16,731 --> 00:01:21,680
lawyer sitting at a computer trying to
figure out how are we going to declare

22
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:22,514
war.

23
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,740
And one of the things that everybody
realizes after sort of an initial

24
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:30,920
discussion is yes, we'd
like to declare war,

25
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:35,330
but we have no idea upon whom we should
declare war. That is Gregory Johnson,

26
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,920
the Michael Hastings national
security reporting fellow at buzzfeed.

27
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,340
Now the reason this lawyer man
by the name of Timothy Flanagan,

28
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,860
the reason Flanagan is sitting
at a computer in an office,

29
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:49,130
it's because then president
George Bush had to do something.

30
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:51,380
He had to act and he
didn't want to act alone.

31
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,930
You want it congressional
approval, right? I mean,

32
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:57,680
technically in an emergency
president can defend the country,

33
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,310
is the commander in chief. After all, he
doesn't have to go to Congress and say,

34
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:04,610
Hey, do I have authorization
to use force? Not An emergency.

35
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,930
That's been with us by the way,

36
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,410
senior fellow in governance studies
at the Brookings Institution.

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,570
But President Bush needed
congress on his side.

38
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:14,660
He felt it was important
that we project unity,

39
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,790
that we're all standing together as one
and second, if this was an act of war,

40
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,330
the power to declare war in the
constitution is given to Congress,

41
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,880
not to the executive. When
Congress declares war,

42
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,170
suddenly the president has a
very clear and powerful mandate.

43
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,580
[inaudible].

44
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,240
Now,

45
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,650
the declaration of war is kind of a
dead instrument of international law.

46
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,880
I mean, nobody's declared
war since World War II,

47
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,470
but the modern incarnation
of the declaration of war
is the authorization to use

48
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:50,840
force, the authorization to use force,

49
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,810
what's called the authorization
for the use of military force,

50
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,140
or as it's commonly
referred to the a u m f.

51
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,110
Right? So our lawyer in
the White House Flannigan,

52
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,010
he's given a task go right in AUMF that
Congress can send to the president.

53
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:07,450
He really has no idea.

54
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:12,280
So he goes back to the last time that the
u s did this last time congress passed

55
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:16,000
one of these things. He does a quick
sort of search on his computer. Boom,

56
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,010
finds it. 1991 Iraq.

57
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,510
The Gulf War Flannigan grabs the text
and then he copies that into a word

58
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:26,290
document and that becomes his
template. He makes some cuts,

59
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:30,970
he makes some changes, he deletes
some words. Then he hits send

60
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,040
our war on Tara, a just
war and he sets in motion.

61
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:41,041
This be will during series of events by
U s drone strike in early to al Qaeda

62
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,090
and the wall, Wayne trapes. Hey madness.

63
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:47,380
That is basically the world. We live in.

64
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,420
15 members of a wedding procession or
killed by us and if you're like me,

65
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,700
bizarre, even sadistic treatment,

66
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,920
you're like me and you find yourself
flipping through the channels,

67
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:59,920
see the news, basically ignoring it,
but then every so often thinking,

68
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,640
wait a second.

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,230
Terrorism targets in Africa from Libya
now the U S air for drone strike in

70
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:06,610
southern Somalia. Wait, wait,

71
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,890
how are we doing this in
all these different places?

72
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:13,450
100 presenters are on a hunger strike
and like that protest of their indefinite

73
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:17,290
detention. How? How? How are we
detaining people for so long? Is that,

74
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,190
is it okay to do that? We'll just
who signed off on this, you know,

75
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,950
and it turns out we all did
because it was in that document.

76
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,730
This is the legal foundation for
everything that the u s has done.

77
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:34,731
Everything from Guantanamo Bay to drone
strikes to secret renditions to seal

78
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:39,060
rates. It's all been hung off these
60 words and that's the crazy part,

79
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:41,580
the body of this document,
the part that really matters.

80
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,460
And the reason that when I was reading
Gregory's reporting on this, I was like,

81
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:46,140
what is it?

82
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:50,280
It all goes back to one
single sentence, 60 words,

83
00:04:50,281 --> 00:04:54,330
one sentence. Can you read it? Absolutely.

84
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,440
That the president is authorized to
use all necessary and appropriate force

85
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,520
against those nations organizations
or persons he determines,

86
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:08,130
planned, authorize, committed,

87
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,430
or aided the terrorist attacks that
occurred on September 11 2001 or harbored

88
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:19,130
such organizations or persons in
order to prevent any future acts of

89
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:24,120
international terrorism against
the United States by such nations,

90
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,690
organizations or persons. 60 words

91
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,230
[inaudible]

92
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,160
today, a collaboration with buzzfeed
and with reporter Gregory Johnson.

93
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,900
We're going to try to decode those words
and ask where do those words come from

94
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:43,900
and how could they come
to mean what they mean,

95
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,620
which is not what you think they know
and how did they end up leading us into

96
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:50,410
what is arguably the longest
war in American history.

97
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,400
[inaudible]

98
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,010
and nobody saw it coming. Absolutely.
No, but that's the weirdest as well.

99
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,090
Nobody minus one. Let's start there.

100
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,800
Maybe you should introduce
us to Barbara Lee. Right.

101
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:10,940
Barbara Lee is a congresswoman
from right around Berkeley,

102
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,050
California. [inaudible] hello?
Hello. Hello. Hi. It's Barbara.

103
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,220
And she is someone who
has been in many ways,

104
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:23,990
a lifelong activist going all the way
back to when she was 15 in high school in

105
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:27,560
San Fernando Valley because I wanted
to be a cheerleader. But you know,

106
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:30,800
since this was the early sixties
you had to have certain criteria,

107
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:34,820
like at least whether it was stated
or not being blind and blue eyes,

108
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,200
that would've been hard for you. I
would figure that was really hard.

109
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:43,310
So I went to the NAACP. She got them to
pressure the school to change the rules,

110
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,820
and I won. And she became the
first black cheerleader, um, at,

111
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:50,960
at her high school. Yeah. Yeah.
That's just by way of introduction.

112
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:53,030
Fast forward many years, she
becomes a congress woman.

113
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,610
She gets elected to a
second term, and on that day

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,030
there is smoke pouring out of the
Pentagon. She was at the capitol.

115
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,870
No one knew where to go. So then the
police officers just said, run, run, run,

116
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,810
go, go, go. This was an apparent
terrorist attack on our country.

117
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:09,200
So I ran out of the capitol.
Wow. Down Pennsylvania Avenue.

118
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,700
I remember looking back and saw a
lot of smoke, which was, you know,

119
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:17,240
the Pentagon, you know, clearly
the country's under attack.

120
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:21,830
Clearly people have died. Clearly,
we've got to deal with whoever did this,

121
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,990
whatever it takes. Fast forward
two days, September 13th,

122
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,710
Barbara Lee's back at the capitol to
meet with her democratic colleagues to

123
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:33,290
review that document that
Flanagan had sent over.

124
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,650
The mood in the room was
very somber and very angry.

125
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,610
The thing we have to keep in mind when
we're talking about this is all of this

126
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:45,611
was done within 72 hours after the
worst terrorist attack in United States

127
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:51,191
history and very confused what
would be the appropriate response.

128
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,300
So as she and her colleagues
read those 60 words,

129
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,930
there was a lot of debate going
on back and forth. Oh yes. Oh yes.

130
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:02,600
From everyone. Because this
actually wasn't the first draft.

131
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:07,601
Flanagan had sent one over the night
before September 12 2001 and that one was

132
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,400
something that almost no one
agreed to. According to Gregory,

133
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:12,410
that early draft had a
few extra lines in it.

134
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,590
One gave the president the power to
preempt any future acts of aggression

135
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:22,460
against the United States and Barbara
Lee and her colleagues knew that look,

136
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,540
so many things can be packed
into this word aggression,

137
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,030
that if we sign on to this, that if
we give the president this power,

138
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,290
the president may never have to come
back to Congress ever again and request

139
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:41,120
authorization for military force because
he can say that anything is aggression

140
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,090
and we're also giving him
the power to preempt. Two,

141
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,260
they kicked it back to the White House.

142
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:48,860
Flanagan took out those words and
now they have this new draft that the

143
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:53,540
president is authorized to use
all necessary inappropriate force,

144
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,040
which is what you heard. It's still,

145
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,100
when Barbara read that and saw phrases
like all necessary inappropriate force,

146
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:03,090
she thought, what does that even
mean? I said, this is too broad.

147
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,660
It's not definitive. It's
open-ended, and as she was speaking,

148
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:09,330
this is taking place in the
basement of the Capitol building.

149
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,820
She sees some of her democratic
colleagues start to nod. Yup.

150
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,860
People were nodding.

151
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:17,640
People were nodding because everybody
there knew the danger of ill-defined

152
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,970
words. You just had to go back
50 years to the Gulf of Tonkin,

153
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,510
Gulf of Tonkin and talking Tonkin.
Todd can with an n. Yes. To explain it.

154
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,760
My thought about America as
president and commander in chief

155
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,660
1964 LBJ announces at two American ships.

156
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,050
So you asked the straw yours, correct,

157
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,450
Denise,

158
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,140
Gulf of Tonkin off the coast of Vietnam
or torpedoed by North Vietnamese,

159
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,290
both by a number of hostile vessels.

160
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,850
People now argue that one of these
attacks never even happened. Nonetheless,

161
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,090
President Johnson wanted to
strike back, so he asked Congress,

162
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,420
I asked a resolution,

163
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,110
which they did, giving
them the power to quote,

164
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,440
take all necessary measures to repel any
armed attack against the forces of the

165
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:05,440
United States and to
prevent further aggression.

166
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,370
Making it clear that our government is
United in its determination to take all

167
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,940
necessary measures and support a freedom
and in the fence of peace in Southeast

168
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,450
Asia.

169
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,640
Now, it is the broad
language of that document.

170
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:25,750
Most people believe that opened the door
to the worst part of the Vietnam War.

171
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,310
[inaudible] the rangers and Marines,
the casualty mostly from hidden sniper,

172
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,400
thousands and thousands of casualty. Keep
dropping. There's nothing you can do.

173
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,130
Horrific atrocities.

174
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:36,781
Shawn was,

175
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:41,781
had been made that troops Carroll as
many as 567 south Vietnamese civilians

176
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,640
during the sleep in March, 1968

177
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,160
and in a television interview in 1969
when President Johnson was asked to

178
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:51,950
justify it all, he said, you
can't just blame [inaudible].

179
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,870
Yeah, Congress gave us this
authority in August, 1964

180
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,780
the new whatever made me not
sure that's pretty far reaching.

181
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,200
That's the sky's the limit. So

182
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,510
the lessons of the Gulf,
Tongan and Vietnam,

183
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:12,890
that was very much in the air in
that meeting on September 13th,

184
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,030
2001 several key leaders hope to
avoid a repeat of the 1964 Tonkin Gulf

185
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:17,720
resolution.

186
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,420
So it was understandable that when
Barbara Lee stood up and said to her

187
00:11:20,421 --> 00:11:22,970
colleagues that she was worried
about some of this language,

188
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,800
people were nodding, people were nodding.

189
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,120
So there was a lot of uncertainty
about what to do. But in the end,

190
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,420
those concerns were ultimately
outweighed by another desire.

191
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,540
We've got to be unified
with the president. We can't
show political divisions.

192
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,110
Let's have the nation. Let's have
Congress speaking with one voice.

193
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,000
It was a time for unity and for action,

194
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:44,840
and so walking out of that democratic
caucus meeting on the evening of September

195
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,770
13th congressional leadership decided
that these 60 words, this is the version,

196
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,630
there's no going back
to the drawing board.

197
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,080
And so that 10:00 AM September 14
2001 said it will come to order.

198
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:59,890
The Senate is gabbled into
session. Cork will call the roll.

199
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,060
Dashiell calls a vote.
Mr Akaka, Mr Allard,

200
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,820
Mr. Allen, there are 98 senators
on the floor. Mr Durban,

201
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,900
Mr Voinovich, all 98 of them vote. Yay.

202
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,010
No senator voted in the negative. So
that was a sweep. Yeah. Later in the day,

203
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:21,280
the resolution would go to the house
where Barbara Lee was a representative.

204
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,061
Daschel had x.

205
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:25,420
You rushed the vote through the Senate
because the White House has called for a

206
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:30,130
national prayer meeting at the National
Cathedral for the victims of nine 11

207
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,520
that's supposed to start right at
noon. And so right after the vote,

208
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,880
all the senators pour out of the
capitol and get onto the buses.

209
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,120
I'm trying to get through the drizzle.
It was actually raining that day. No,

210
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:41,790
at that moment, Barbara League,

211
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,080
she hadn't decided how it is
that she was going to vote.

212
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,570
I struggled with it for
the previous two nights.

213
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:50,950
September 12th and 13th she stayed
up late, calling back to advisers,

214
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:54,960
to friends in California. We talked
every day, including this guy.

215
00:12:54,961 --> 00:12:56,220
This is Ron Dellums.

216
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,570
I serve for over 27 years in the
u s house of Representatives.

217
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,300
Barbara used to be his chief
of staff and when he resigned,

218
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,970
she won his congressional seat.
You know, she would say, well,

219
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,640
what about this and what
do you think about that?

220
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,650
And we kind of talked through the,

221
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,510
the emotional state of the
country that we are feeling pain,

222
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,000
anger. We're shocked.

223
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,270
Both Barbara and Ron were trained
as psychiatric social workers.

224
00:13:21,271 --> 00:13:24,360
So they both knew that when a person
is feeling all of those things,

225
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,580
it's generally better to do nothing. Yeah.

226
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:31,581
Psychology One oh one you don't make
decisions when you're morning afraid.

227
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,710
On the other hand, I believe
you know in unity too,

228
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,890
I want to be unified with the president
when the country is under attack.

229
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,730
I understood and he didn't tell me.
He didn't say which way I should vote,

230
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,330
but I did say to her,
Barbara, however you vote,

231
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:51,120
I will always respect you. You will always
be friend. You will always be family.

232
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,020
So at that moment with the memorial
service about to start in a few hours till

233
00:13:55,021 --> 00:13:55,854
the House vote,

234
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,160
Barbara Lee was at the capitol that was
in the cloak room and since she wasn't

235
00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:02,040
sure how she was going to vote, she
planned to skip the memorial service.

236
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,050
She wanted to stay. She wanted to think,

237
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,670
and then I don't know what it was.

238
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,040
May have been the spirit
move in me, I don't know.

239
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:13,700
But at the very last minute
she was drinking actually
a can of Ginger Ale at the

240
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:16,100
time. I said, I think I'm
going to go and I just ran out.

241
00:14:16,101 --> 00:14:17,900
I probably was the last one on the bus.

242
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:21,530
I had the can of Ginger Ale in my hand
and ran down the steps and got on the

243
00:14:21,531 --> 00:14:26,440
bus. She got to the Cathedral.

244
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:31,030
The House buses arrived about 30
minutes or so before the opening.

245
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,070
And so for, for 30 minutes,

246
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:36,440
she's in the cathedral about halfway
back listening to the Oregon,

247
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,970
thinking about the families
in those who were killed.

248
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,870
There are people around her who are
sort of whispering the pain and anguish.

249
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:50,760
The few people who are crying. I said,

250
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:52,010
I gotta pray over this. And

251
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,600
she's just wrestling with her boat.

252
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,210
[inaudible]

253
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:01,530
her heart is saying one thing, this is
too broad and her head is saying unity.

254
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,830
How is it that you can be against
the president at this point?

255
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:07,550
[inaudible]

256
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,300
speaking of the president, eventually
President Bush takes the podium.

257
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,940
We are here in the
middle hour of our grief.

258
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,860
Yes, three days removed from these
events. Americans do not yet have

259
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,470
the distance of history,

260
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:31,040
but our responsibility to
history is already clear

261
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,850
to answer these attacks
and rid the world of evil.

262
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,910
And then as soon as
President Bush steps down,

263
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,450
everyone in the congregation stands up.

264
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:46,880
[inaudible]

265
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,770
and, and they, they sing the
battle hymn of the republic

266
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:53,960
[inaudible]

267
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,990
which is a very powerful,
a very moving, um,

268
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,630
piece of music,

269
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,160
but it's not the sort of thing that is
typically sung at a memorial service.

270
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:08,020
It's a, it's a very forward
and almost aggressive sounding.

271
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,120
Has the phrase terrible with sewer. Yeah.

272
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,933
[inaudible] [inaudible]

273
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:30,910
[inaudible]

274
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,743
Oh my God.

275
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:37,140
It was not quite what I
expected in a memorial service.

276
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,160
But the second speaker,

277
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,600
a reverend by the name of Nathan Baxter
got up and he gave a reading from

278
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:45,980
Jeremiah 31

279
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:51,010
when ancient Israel's suffered the
excruciating pain and tragedy of militant

280
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,270
aggression and destruction.

281
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,250
Hearing that all over again takes me
right back there and I remember, oh,

282
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,180
voices heard in Ramo
lamenting and better weeping,

283
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,060
weeping Rachel weeping for her children,

284
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:11,930
weeping for her children when
he spoke. That's when, to me,

285
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:15,730
it was the memorial. And
then that Assurant, he,

286
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,150
he started to pray

287
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,230
for the healing of our grief stricken
hearts for the souls and sacred memory of

288
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:25,780
those who have been lost.

289
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,650
And he said something that
really struck Barbara Lee.

290
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,780
Let us also pray for
divine wisdom. He said,

291
00:17:34,781 --> 00:17:36,730
as we ask that as we act,

292
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,330
we've not become the evil we deploy

293
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,520
that evil that we deplore.

294
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,100
When he said that I became very,

295
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:52,830
it was the sense of peace
and calm came over me.

296
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,440
Uh,

297
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,120
and Barbara Lee says it was right. Yeah.

298
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:58,690
[inaudible]

299
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,620
but she knew what she'd do.

300
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:05,150
The clerk report the title House Joint
Resolution 64 joint resolution to

301
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:07,630
authorize the use of United States army.

302
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,070
Later that evening, the house
opens up its debate on the AUMF

303
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,083
speaker.

304
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,080
I rise in support of this resolution
which authorizes the president to use all

305
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:17,920
force necessary

306
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,980
Sarah and congressperson after
congressperson. Mr Speaker stands up.

307
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,860
I rise in support of this
resolution that's just bigger.

308
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:29,890
I rise tonight to fully
endorse and authorize the use
of force one after another

309
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,050
or I rise in support of the authorization.

310
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,300
I rise today in support
of this resolution.

311
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:39,890
We will rally behind our president
16 in a row until Joel Wellman from

312
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:43,430
California is recognized for a minute
and a half. We get to Barbara Lee,

313
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,900
Mr Speaker members I rise today. Really
what that [inaudible] very heavy heart,

314
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,490
one that is filled with sorrow for the
families and the loved ones who were

315
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:54,140
killed and injured this week.

316
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,100
Only the most foolish and the most cows
would not understand the grief that has

317
00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:03,350
really gripped our people and
millions across the world.

318
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,230
[inaudible]

319
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,160
I have agonized over this vote,

320
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,580
but I came to grips with it today and
I came to grips with opposing this

321
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:18,831
resolution during the very painful
yet very beautiful memorial service

322
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:25,530
as a member of the clergy
so eloquently said,

323
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,170
as we act,

324
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,350
let us not become the evil that we deplore

325
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,260
just after the vote,

326
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:44,040
Barbara Lee says she was in the cloak
room again and she starts getting accosted

327
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,040
by colleagues. All of these friends
are coming up to her and saying,

328
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,550
you've got to go back. You.
You cannot vote this way.

329
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,760
As I brought changing my vote, one
of them actually said to her, look,

330
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,360
you've done so much on HIV.
You've done so much on aids.

331
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,840
This vote is going to take you
out. Think of the bigger picture.

332
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,540
They are saying, you're dead.
Yeah, but that's the right vote.

333
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,960
I'm not going to give any president the
authority to go to war and we don't know

334
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,040
when we're doing. You know, the only
congress can declare a war. Yeah.

335
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,770
It helped me on this guys, uh,
has the houseboat. Uh, okay.

336
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:16,350
The house is just now finished that boat

337
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,640
and uh,

338
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:25,641
we see one no vote or the final
vote for the house was 420 to one.

339
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,820
We know what's a democrat. We don't
yet know who will figure that out.

340
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,810
Well in a moment or so,
but that vote is now. Yep.

341
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,940
Barbara Lee was the only person in the
Senate or the house to cast a no vote.

342
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,950
That must've been a very lonely moment,
to be perfectly honest with you.

343
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:48,250
I said some prayers for my friend.

344
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,540
This was the right thing to do.
And you know, boats like this,

345
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,380
you have to be ready to,
to pay the consequences.

346
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:01,210
Over the next few weeks and months,
her office was inundated with letters.

347
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,660
Barbara Lee, you are a traitor and a
disgrace to the office that you hold.

348
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:07,090
You can find all these letters
archived at Mills College.

349
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:11,500
You weren't played on American society,
terrorist yourself. So much hatred.

350
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,010
I don't know why you decided to place
yourself into the camp of terrorists.

351
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,890
Those attacks came and they came
and they came. Septate head line,

352
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,590
death threats. No, off to hell with
you. You Benedict. Arnold wanted beans.

353
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,210
So I had to have security
day and night up yours.

354
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,260
Thanks for supporting the top hand.
Hey Hanway proper Ellie, what are you,

355
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,490
what do you believe in?

356
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,980
If you go to Mills College in
Oakland and we sent a reporter there,

357
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:37,820
you will find 60,000 letters. They're
not all negative but most are killed.

358
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,960
But Congressman Lisa,

359
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,880
she never faltered because right after
the vote and she was in her office,

360
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,760
my dad called me, lieutenant colonel
retired in the army. He said,

361
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:49,560
I'm really proud of you. You know,

362
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:53,760
and my dad had been in Korea
and World War II and he,

363
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:58,050
he sees it the way I see it because I
really wasn't sure what he was saying

364
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:02,670
cause you know, I really wasn't
sure which you thought. All right,

365
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,960
Daddy's proud of me.

366
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,270
[inaudible]

367
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,730
now we should note that Barbara
Lee is still a congress woman.

368
00:22:07,731 --> 00:22:10,160
She did not pay the
price for that no vote.

369
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,650
And whenever you think of of her vote,

370
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,470
whether you think it was the right
thing to do with the wrong thing to do,

371
00:22:15,471 --> 00:22:19,400
what is interesting to me is that as we're
sitting here looking back on 12 years

372
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:19,791
of war,

373
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:24,590
she was sitting there 12 years ago looking
forward and maybe she saw something

374
00:22:24,591 --> 00:22:27,980
about how this would play out,
but how these, these words,

375
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:31,490
these 60 words would
start to grow and expand.

376
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:33,763
That's next

377
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,370

Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm
Robert Krulwich, Radiolab,

394
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:45,351
and today 60 words is the collaboration
with buzz feed and report or Gregory

395
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:46,400
Johnson.

396
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,020
The story is based on a,

397
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:53,050
an article that Gregory wrote about the
60 simple words that have really defined

398
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:56,150
American counter terrorism
for more than a decade.

399
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:01,180
It's called the authorization for use of
military force that shortened do a u m

400
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,360
F and it was passed by Congress three
days after September 11th and here it is

401
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,190
again read by Senator John McCain,

402
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,930
which says the president is authorized
to use all necessary inappropriate force

403
00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:15,490
against those nations organizations
or persons. He determines planned,

404
00:24:15,491 --> 00:24:16,660
authorized, committed,

405
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,730
or aided the terrorist attacks that
occurred on September 11 2001 are harbored

406
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:26,020
such organizations or persons in
order to prevent any future action of

407
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:30,950
international terrorism against the United
States by such nations organizations.

408
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:31,270
Sure.

409
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,850
All right, so why would we be
looking at that boring ass sentence?

410
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,730
He seems seamless almost of
saying it. Yeah, he does.

411
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,980
Can I just be honest with
you for a second? Yeah, yeah.

412
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,080
I generally move through the world
with the assumption which is,

413
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,190
which has been proven over
and over again to be true.

414
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,380
That I don't know how the world works.

415
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,870
Like somehow I missed that
day at school or something.

416
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,510
Are you referring to
something specific like a no,

417
00:24:56,511 --> 00:25:00,740
I'm free to a general sense that somehow
like Oz is out there behind the curtain

418
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:03,800
pulling levers and I'm just always going
to be stuck on this side, you know?

419
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,010
Yeah. I think it's what motivates
the show for me. Is it like I just,

420
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,300
I feel kind of stupid most of the time
and these shows are a way to engage the

421
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,240
world and really examine
the world. Right, exactly.

422
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,380
And when it comes to these matters of
national security, I really feel clueless.

423
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,300
And so when I read Gregory's article, uh,

424
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:25,130
I felt like I understood something
crucial for the first time.

425
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,980
But the way words actually
operate in the world,

426
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,670
because like again, this sentence,
this totally boring sentence,

427
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,910
this is the legal foundation for
everything that the u s has done.

428
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:37,730
Everything from Guantanamo
Bay to drone strikes

429
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,440
to secret renditions to seal rates.
It's all been hung off. These 60 words.

430
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:45,230
One lawyer who was in the Bush
administration said, look,

431
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,570
this sentence is like a Christmas tree.

432
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,160
All sorts of things have been
hung off of this. But how, how?

433
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,950
Cause you read the thing and you don't
see any mention of Guantanamo Bay in

434
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:02,260
those 60 words. It
doesn't mention detention.

435
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,600
It doesn't mention drone strikes.

436
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:08,600
It doesn't mention drone strikes
against American citizens. You guys.

437
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,760
So that guy. So one of the first folks
we call to help us decode this. That's a,

438
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,140
that's John Bellinger.

439
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:18,910
I served as the [inaudible] Sir for the
National Security Council from 2001 to

440
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:23,911
2005 and as the legal advisor for the
Department of state from 2005 to 2009,

441
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,480
you can't do any speed dating
within with a credential like that,

442
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,840
cause the date will be over yet. That's
my congressional testimony voice.

443
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,340
And we asked them like, okay, so a
detention isn't anywhere in this document.

444
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:38,710
So how do you read detention
from these 60 words?

445
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:43,620
The argument with which I am comfortable
as illegal matter is he says,

446
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:47,550
if you go eight words into those 60
words and you get to the phrase all

447
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:51,770
necessary and appropriate force.
Oh, necessary, right? Yeah.

448
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,600
You got to ask yourself, what is force?
What does that mean? What do you do?

449
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,320
You know what for us is, if I punch you
in the face, that's the musing for it.

450
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:01,100
That's one kind of force can
use force to kill people. Uh,

451
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,650
but a lesser use of
force is to detain them.

452
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,460
Detention is simply lesser included. Uh,

453
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,600
and the use of force that comes
naturally in a military operation.

454
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,730
It's like a subset of force basically.

455
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:17,670
So if you're authorized to
use force to kill people,

456
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,450
you are also by default authorized
to use force to detain them,

457
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,490
essentially to knock them out of the
battle in other ways and that that forces

458
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:30,230
both necessary and it's appropriate.
And the courts have upheld that.

459
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,220
So that one word force, that is
how you justifying Guantanamo Bay,

460
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,640
all the controversy surrounding
Guantanamo Bay continues.

461
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,840
The authorization to use military
force act has happened at military

462
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:43,674
commissions. At this,

463
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,090
I've been the legal basis for
the detention of thousands
of individuals and many

464
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:51,990
of them have been detained for more than
10 years. None have ever been charged.

465
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:54,270
And the words detention
are never mentioned.

466
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,480
Okay. So that's the tension.
If it gets even trickier,

467
00:27:57,481 --> 00:28:02,280
if you go just a few
words past all necessarily
inappropriate force to what you

468
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:05,880
get to the mention of the enemy, who the
forest is supposed to be used against.

469
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:10,520
That's right. And it seems to
be very limited language. Oh,

470
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:14,820
you mean we can't shoot everybody or
anybody? No, only the people who planned,

471
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:16,020
authorized, committed,

472
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:21,000
or aided the terrorist attacks that
occurred on September 11 2001 oak harbor

473
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,360
sounds much more, it sounds very
much tethered to nine 11 right? Yeah.

474
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,760
Which is why a lot of congress
men and women voted for it.

475
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,960
Joe Biden on the day of
the vote, September 14th,

476
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,130
2001 he says,

477
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,640
look, people don't freak
out about this language.

478
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,840
It's relates to the incident and
there's broad authority related to the

479
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:42,250
incident. It does not relate
to all terrorism every place,

480
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,550
because we're just
talking about all kind of

481
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,950
did this and the Taliban who
have harbored them, right? Nope.

482
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,990
Not necessarily. Gregory Johnson. Again,

483
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:57,170
over time what's happened is there's
been this other sort of catchall category

484
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,530
that has been read into these 60 words,

485
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,440
even though it appears
nowhere in these 60 words,

486
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,570
and that catch all category is
associated forces. Associated Forces.

487
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,930
Yeah. What we've been calling these
61st and 62nd word wrestle time.

488
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,340
It is special and few define
the enemy as al-Qaida,

489
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,140
the Taliban and associated forces.
It's a whole different ballgame. Yeah.

490
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,120
So when you read those, those,

491
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,230
all those words that did not include the
phrase associated forces is nowhere in

492
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:30,000
the text. So where does who then,

493
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,400
why could people cite something
that isn't in the deck?

494
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,790
This is one of the enduring
mysteries of, of this.

495
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:41,040
So the earliest example that we could
find of those two words is in a 2000 and

496
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,310
memo from

497
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,950
Deputy Secretary of Defense,
Paul Wolfowitz. He defines
the enemy as al-Qaida,

498
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,970
the Taliban and associated forces.

499
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:52,570
But the truth is it may have just
been there from the beginning.

500
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,680
What do you mean?

501
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,320
Because according to Ben Witness
from the Brookings Institution,

502
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:01,370
there is a concept in the laws
of war called co belligerency.

503
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:07,100
It's the idea that if you're at war with
person a and person B is on personajes

504
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:13,510
side in the war, you're also
legally at war with person B. Makes

505
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,700
perfect sense. If you think of
it in traditional war terms,

506
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:19,150
cause like we're at war with
Germany, Italy joins their side.

507
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,660
So by default we're at war with Italy
too, right? So just transpose out here.

508
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:27,661
If we're at war with this group called
al Qaeda and a certain set of groups that

509
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,910
aren't them join the war on al Qaeda side,

510
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,510
then you are legally at war with them.
If you don't think about that too hard,

511
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:35,500
it is crystal clear.

512
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:40,890
But then the question that has arisen
over time is how broad do you make that

513
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,470
that circle? Cause the problem
obviously is that we're,

514
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,100
we're not talking about nation states
anymore. We're talking about groups. So,

515
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,060
okay.

516
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:54,010
How close does the link to all Chi Eta
and the people who carried out September

517
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:54,700
11th have to be,

518
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,790
so if you have someone who's connected
to someone who's connected to someone

519
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:01,840
who's connected to someone
who is connected to September
11 is that enough or is

520
00:31:01,841 --> 00:31:05,140
it only three lakes or can you
be an associate and an associate?

521
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,180
Uh,

522
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,870
no, we can't exactly know how broadly
the Obama and Bush administrations have

523
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:13,450
defined those words. And we'll
talk about why in a second.

524
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,240
But you just have to
look at the news, right?

525
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,420
And you could see that like we started
with a war that was in Afghanistan and

526
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:24,220
then spread to a lot of different
places. Pakistan, Libya, Somalia,

527
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,270
Yemen. Yeah.

528
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:29,230
And in Yemen there is a lot of debate
and a lot of discussion about like,

529
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:33,340
is this legal, does this have anything
to do with September 11th anymore?

530
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,940
Cause now the group in Yemen,
all kid in the Arabian peninsula,

531
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:41,860
which is a group that was first formed
in 2009 they have their own hierarchy and

532
00:31:41,861 --> 00:31:42,730
their own structure.

533
00:31:42,731 --> 00:31:47,140
And it's not clear how
and in what fashion.

534
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,540
They take orders from either
Osama bin Laden, why he,

535
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,500
it's still alive or now
I am an [inaudible].

536
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:58,810
So does this make them an associated
force or does it make them part of Al

537
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,330
Qaeda? The answer, at least on good
morning everyone. It is Friday,

538
00:32:02,331 --> 00:32:05,480
September 30th, 2011 market
down on your calendar.

539
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,140
Denver 30th 2011 seemed to be, yes.

540
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:10,600
When the u s assassinated
two members of the group,

541
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,980
this is not confirmed yet,

542
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:15,910
but it could very well have been
a u s Predator drone strike.

543
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:17,530
That is a u s government attack.

544
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:22,070
Pretend to put all this in context
between 2002 and 2014 according to some

545
00:32:22,071 --> 00:32:22,904
estimates,

546
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,710
there've been about 65 drone strikes
in Yemen killing about 400 people.

547
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,080
So much hinges on how you define those
words. So much is in the definition.

548
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:38,000
I asked the Pentagon, I said, who?
What are the list of associated forces?

549
00:32:38,001 --> 00:32:42,290
So all Chi Eta. Yes, U s is a war. That's
clear. What about the other groups?

550
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,210
Al Shabaab, al Qaeda in Iraq. I'll kite in

551
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:45,981
the Islamic McGrath armed Islamic group.

552
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:49,700
I would say of Jemiah as
Amelia Brotherhood of this
brotherhood of that who?

553
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,400
Who are these groups? Who
is the U S at war with?

554
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:56,520
And the Pentagon emailed me back and
they said the list is classified enough

555
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:01,700
republican release. Wait, so we, who
we are at, we're with, we don't know.

556
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,540
I wait. So you're saying when
you approached the Pentagon,

557
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,170
did they say that they will not tell
you the names of the people were at war

558
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:12,980
against? Well, maybe they shouldn't.
It'd be that valuable. Well,

559
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,460
don't you want to know as a citizen
of America who were fighting?

560
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,040
On the other hand, do
I want to know as the,

561
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:24,200
as if the United States has
determined that I am dangerous to it.

562
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,560
If it announces, then that would
give me a certain amount of, uh,

563
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,880
notice which I may perhaps would be
disadvantageous to the United States.

564
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:40,210
It could also though act as a
disincentive for you to take action maybe,

565
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,920
but maybe not. Maybe they will
just get quieter, more dangerous.

566
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,670
I mean it's true. There
might be reasons for this.

567
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,320
They have not wanted to provide
a public list because they,

568
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,800
this is John Bellinger again.
One, the groups move all the time.

569
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:56,860
And so a few say, well these
were associated groups.

570
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:01,000
While then certain people just moved from
Group A to group B and they also want

571
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:02,770
to leave these different groups guessing,

572
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,220
but it still raises democratic concerns
if the American people don't really know

573
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:14,550
who the executive branch
believes is covered by the
AUMF in a democracy and in a

574
00:34:14,981 --> 00:34:18,190
representative democracy
that has to be weighed out.

575
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:23,191
Should the citizens of the United States
know who it is that the United States

576
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:26,260
is targeting for death around the world,

577
00:34:26,261 --> 00:34:28,750
who it is that the United States
is technically at war with?

578
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:32,860
Should war be a decision that the citizens
of a democracy of a representative

579
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:34,340
democracy have a say?

580
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,500
Well, we're a representative
democracy as you just said.

581
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:39,650
So I'm assuming that the chairman
of the House intelligence committee,

582
00:34:39,651 --> 00:34:43,640
he knows every item on that list.
I'm not so sure. Morning everybody.

583
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:47,960
The committee meets today to receive
testimony on the law of armed conflict.

584
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:52,620
One of the more interesting Senate
hearings took place in early 2013

585
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,730
including the status of
the 2001 authorization for
the use of military force.

586
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,900
The AUMF,

587
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:04,130
the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Um, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan,

588
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,140
Chairman of the committee, Senator
McCain is on the committee,

589
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,880
like to welcome our witnesses.

590
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,660
And Gregory says the senators call the
couple of Defense Department officials to

591
00:35:12,661 --> 00:35:13,990
answer questions. Members committee,

592
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,880
thank you for the opportunity to testify
about the legal framework for the u s

593
00:35:17,881 --> 00:35:20,310
military operations to defend our nation.

594
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,430
Cause they wanted to know like now
that we're 12 years into this war,

595
00:35:23,431 --> 00:35:26,310
how are you using this document?
Does it need to be changed?

596
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,080
So the Department of defense officials,

597
00:35:28,081 --> 00:35:30,930
and there were four of
them came and said, look,

598
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,460
I believe that existing authorities
are adequate for this armed conflict.

599
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:40,470
Don't revisit this sentence. Don't
repeal it. This sentence is sufficient.

600
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,410
It gives us all the power that
we need against Okada, yeah.

601
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,890
And associated forces.

602
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,250
And as they're laying out their
case, they say those two words,

603
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,990
associated force, associated
forces and associated forces,

604
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:56,250
associated forces and associated force
and associated forces and associated

605
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,700
forces and they were associated forces,
associated force and associated forces

606
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,660
instead of just nodding along. A lot of
the senators were like, what gentlemen?

607
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,250
I've only been here five months,

608
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:10,240
but this is the most astounding and most
astoundingly disturbing hearing that

609
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,560
I've been to since I've been here.

610
00:36:11,561 --> 00:36:14,350
You guys have essentially rewritten
the constitution here today.

611
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,920
That's Angus king,
independent senator from Maine

612
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,960
and you keep using the
term associated forces.

613
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:24,961
You use it 13 times in your statement
that is not in the AUMF and you said at

614
00:36:25,511 --> 00:36:27,340
one point it suits us very well.

615
00:36:27,341 --> 00:36:30,790
I assume it does suit you
very well because you're
rating it to cover everything

616
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,173
and anything.

617
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:35,210
But one of the most striking moments
of this hearing is when the head of the

618
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:39,140
committee, Senator Carl Levin turns to
one of the DOD officials and asks him,

619
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,310
is there a list

620
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,390
now there, is there an existing list of
groups that are affiliated with al-Qaida

621
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,060
senator there? I'm not
sure there's enlist per se.

622
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:54,870
I'm very familiar with the organizations
that we do consider a right now are

623
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,500
affiliated with al Qaeda and I could
provide you that. Listen, would you,

624
00:36:57,501 --> 00:36:59,390
would you give us that list?
Yes sir. We can do that.

625
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,510
And when you add or subtract names
from that list, would you let us know?

626
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,460
We can do that as well
Mr Chairman to queue.

627
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,880
Let me just see if I understand what you
just said at a committee hearing. Yeah.

628
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,700
Say U S senator asks specifically,

629
00:37:12,701 --> 00:37:16,050
so who's on the list of people
we were allowed to kill, right.

630
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:20,980
That suggested that the
Senate Arms Services Committee
who had oversight really

631
00:37:20,981 --> 00:37:23,950
had no idea she pays one or like alright,

632
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,650
if we don't have any idea who
we're at war with in the Senate,

633
00:37:26,651 --> 00:37:31,240
arms services committee doesn't seem
to have any idea. Then who does? Well,

634
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:36,270
one of the things that became clear to
me as I was reporting on this story was

635
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:40,840
that many of the people who are making
these decisions but had never been

636
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:45,841
elected by anyone to any position and
they were the ones who were making the

637
00:37:45,881 --> 00:37:48,970
decision, not the elected
represented. And so who are they

638
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,850
going to be in YC right
thing? I guess so. Yeah. Yeah.

639
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,000
So we were rooting around for awhile
looking for an answer to that question

640
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,760
until we found this guy.
This is Daniel Kleidman.

641
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:03,680
He's a journalist and I've
covered national security, uh,

642
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:07,540
and counter terrorism for many years
and based on hundreds of confidential

643
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:09,820
interviews that became
his book killer capture.

644
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:13,930
He was able to paint a picture for us
of who makes these decisions and how he

645
00:38:13,931 --> 00:38:18,790
told us about these meetings. You say
it's the s T v s meetings. What are they?

646
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,860
Who's in the room? How
did the events unfold?

647
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,150
Well, these are the, they called them, uh,

648
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:27,600
civets meetings in the
vernacular of the bureaucracy.

649
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,020
It stands for secure video
teleconference meetings.

650
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,560
You described them as a sort of a
massive top secret Google hangout where

651
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,490
literally hundreds

652
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:40,990
of people from throughout the national
security bureaucracy login to decide

653
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:44,260
who's on the list and who isn't and
who should live and who should die.

654
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:47,590
You said literally hundreds,
literally hundreds of people. Now,

655
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,030
many of them are backbenchers.
They're not participating in the call,

656
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:55,420
but they're taking notes before
they get together. In this meeting.

657
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,800
Many of the folks at this meeting,

658
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,380
he says they're given a little packets
of information on each targets.

659
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:03,070
They call them baseball cards because
they sort of look like you got a picture

660
00:39:03,071 --> 00:39:05,650
and some stats like
Yogi Berra on one side,

661
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:08,440
and then you got his batting average
and his hometown on the back,

662
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,980
the terrorist equivalent of all
of that. So who is this person?

663
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,030
Where does he ranked and what kinds of
operations has he been involved in in the

664
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:18,760
past? Eventually a general will
come on the screen and say,

665
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:20,800
here's our target objective Akron.

666
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,740
For some reason he says they always refer
to the targets by the name of American

667
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:27,160
cities. Objective. Toledo general
might say, target is in Yemen.

668
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:30,340
We have a drone over our head, there's
an opportunity to kill this person.

669
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:34,120
Can we legally do it? And
the fascinating thing,

670
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,070
although maybe it won't
come as much of a surprise,

671
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:40,300
is that the people he's making this
pitch to are not generals, but lawyers,

672
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:45,760
Aaron lawyers everywhere. That is
just a basic fact of modern warfare.

673
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:50,200
Says John Bellinger, you
know, have lawyers on the
ground with artillery units,

674
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,410
10 commanders, lawyers in
Kevlar, lawyers and helicopters.

675
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,570
They are lawyers really

676
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,680
almost behind every bomb,

677
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:02,610
just lawyers everywhere. And that's
a very good thing. That's Harold Koh.

678
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:07,611
He was the top lawyer at the
State Department from 2009
to 2013 because it means

679
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:12,450
that we're not just shooting away at
people willy nilly or because we're angry

680
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:17,280
at them or anything. It's a considered
careful decision. Now, Harold Co Cordie,

681
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:21,000
the Dan Klaban's reporting was in those
civets meetings and he would often be

682
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:24,840
the one to answer the general's questions.
Can we legally kill this person?

683
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,030
So we asked him like if lawyers are now
the ones deciding who we are at war with

684
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:34,560
and who we aren't, how do you
do it and unfortunately for us,

685
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,600
I don't know they're going
get into that on this call.

686
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,090
There are multiple methods but
I'm not going to go into that.

687
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,010
He said he couldn't comment on any
of it because it's classified but

688
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,770
Harold Co is a creative lawyer according
to Dan Kleiman who spoke with a lot of

689
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:49,420
people familiar with the process.

690
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,280
Co in particular had a fascinating way
of determining who is and is not an

691
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:55,420
associated force.

692
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,530
In other words we are or aren't at war
with and it seems to be less about the

693
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:04,000
groups as a whole and more about
individuals within the group. For example,

694
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,240
a seniority. That was a
an important issue for Co.

695
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:08,230
If you're going to target a guy,

696
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:11,680
he has to be a senior member
of group like al-Qaida, right?

697
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:14,680
He has to be able to give orders
and he has to be unique within the

698
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:15,281
organization.

699
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:20,281
You couldn't simply under Harold coast
theory go after say a driver or a cook

700
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:25,810
who was in a Al-qaida
or even foot soldiers,

701
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:30,310
uh, because, uh, they were fungible,
meaning they could be easily replaced.

702
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,250
Another criteria was whether
they were externally oriented

703
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,240
for Co. If they were just participants
in a civil war, you couldn't target them.

704
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:42,680
But if they were targeting westerners
or Western interests, then yes.

705
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,170
So if you take Dan Clyde mins
account of Harold Co's criteria as a

706
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:50,960
representative and we personally
have no way of verifying it.

707
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:52,670
But if you take that as the norm,

708
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,200
then maybe there is a strong vetting
process in place. But I interviewed,

709
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,380
um, numerous people who
participated in these meetings.

710
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:02,360
And one of the things that, um,

711
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:07,160
I heard over and over again was it that
there was this kind of an extra bubble

712
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:12,550
momentum toward killing and that the
military people in these meetings could

713
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:16,130
speak with a kind of a tone
of do or die urgency. In fact,

714
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:21,131
two of the people who I quote in my
book used exactly the same metaphor to

715
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:24,890
describe that sense of momentum
that was very difficult to resist.

716
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:30,220
It was like standing on a train track
with a train hurdling towards him at a

717
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,300
hundred miles an hour.
Cause then I guess like

718
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:38,930
the important question for me is
like how often do they say no? Well,

719
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:43,220
it should've been 99 times. Yes.
And one time no. Or 50 times.

720
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:46,880
Yes and 50 times, no. Yeah. How
many nos are there? Well look, I,

721
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:51,410
I'd say I did not come
across many, many examples,

722
00:42:51,411 --> 00:42:53,570
but he did tell us
about this one instance.

723
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:58,660
This was a meeting between the top lawyer
at the Defense Department and then a

724
00:42:58,731 --> 00:43:03,260
man named Jay Johnson and the top lawyer
at the State Department who was then

725
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,740
Harold Harold Co and according
to Dan sources, Harold Koh,

726
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:11,600
j Johnson were faced with determining
the fate of a 40 year old man,

727
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,990
roughly 40 named Schaef Multi-hour Robo.

728
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,000
I think that's the right way
to say his name. I'm not sure.

729
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,950
He's a member of the Smalley group,
l Shabaab. And for context news,

730
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:24,830
World Cup celebrations have turned to
tragedy in the central African nation of

731
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:28,400
Uganda. A few months before this
conversation, this is in 2010,

732
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:33,350
Al Shabaab bombed a rugby club and a
restaurant at the same time in Uganda

733
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:36,980
killing 74 people, breaking
chairs, smashed tables,

734
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,150
and the sounds of pain as rescuers
search for the living and the dead.

735
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,640
So that just happened.

736
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,880
And according to Dan Kleidman at
this moment in intelligence circles,

737
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:51,410
there was a debate raging as to whether
Al Shabaab should or should not be

738
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:53,200
considered an associated force. Okay.

739
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,350
Time their leader had sworn
allegiance to Osama bin Laden,

740
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:02,030
but their agenda was
primarily a local agenda.

741
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:06,350
They had never struck out against
the United States or against American

742
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:08,150
interests in the region.

743
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:11,150
So you've got the top lawyer at the State
Department and the top lawyer at the

744
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:16,070
Pentagon facing off as to whether this
fellow Robo from Al Shabaab should live

745
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:17,360
or die. And how does this work?

746
00:44:17,361 --> 00:44:20,810
Does somebody just like just someone
pound the table? Yes. This was,

747
00:44:20,811 --> 00:44:24,260
this was a very heated
meeting. Jay Johnson, um,

748
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:29,290
argued vehemently that Robo
was covered under the AUMF.

749
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,040
He was after all, a founding
member of al-shabaab.

750
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:37,500
Harold Koh vehemently disagreed. Harold
Co's conclusion based on the evidence.

751
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,910
And the intelligence that he saw was
that Robo was not externally focused.

752
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:42,361
In fact,

753
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:47,160
he belonged to a faction of Al Shabaab
that was arguing against attacking the

754
00:44:47,161 --> 00:44:50,450
United States and other Western
interests. So according to Kleidman,

755
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,030
these two men went back and forth and
back and forth until eventually Harold Koh

756
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:58,050
just drew a hard line and essentially
said, look, if you do this,

757
00:44:58,051 --> 00:45:02,430
you need to know that you will be doing
it over the unambiguous objections of

758
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:06,240
the State Department's legal
advisor. The unambiguous,

759
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:10,620
and that's very strong
language coming from a lawyer.

760
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,680
And the signal that it's sent to the
White House was you will be taking a

761
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,100
military action,

762
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,400
even though the top lawyer at the State
Department has said that this would be

763
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,610
an illegal action. All right. So what
happened? Did they decide not to?

764
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,750
They did not do it.

765
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:26,460
[inaudible]

766
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,910
this is not academic. It's, it's, um,

767
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:32,450
lives depend on which
way the decision goes.

768
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,473
[inaudible]

769
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:40,783
authorized

or eight in the terrorist attacks on

771
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:54,410
September 3rd on September
11 2000 [inaudible]

772
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,000
we'll continue in a moment.

00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,810
hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is Radiolab today.

779
00:46:28,811 --> 00:46:29,980
We've devoted the intro.

780
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:34,720
We're continuing to devote the entire
show to a single sentence. One sentence,

781
00:46:34,721 --> 00:46:36,280
60 words. That's all.

782
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:40,000
It's the 2001 authorization to use
military force was signed into law on

783
00:46:40,001 --> 00:46:41,860
September 18th,

784
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:45,670
2001 and together with buzzfeed and
reporter Gregory Johnson, we have,

785
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:49,690
we have manhandled these words. We
have dissected, we have bisected,

786
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,990
trisector and whatever other kinds
of sectors you could want resected.

787
00:46:52,991 --> 00:46:57,490
Who the AUMF as it's called. Yes. And
you know, we've looked at how the, the,

788
00:46:57,491 --> 00:47:00,520
the sentence has defined the our
last 12 years of counterterrorism.

789
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:05,110
Now how will it define our future?
Gentlemen. Thank you for being here today.

790
00:47:05,111 --> 00:47:05,944
This is a very,

791
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,710
so when we were thinking about that
Senate Arms Services Committee hearing,

792
00:47:08,711 --> 00:47:11,440
we ended up calling someone who
sat on the committee, Tim Kaine,

793
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:14,410
Senator from Virginia and who was
there that day. Yeah, that was a,

794
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:16,420
that was a very uh,

795
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:20,350
kinda hair-raising day and Senator
Kaine told us that one of the most

796
00:47:20,351 --> 00:47:23,260
hair-raising moments for him was
when one of his fellow senators,

797
00:47:23,261 --> 00:47:26,470
Lindsey Graham asked one of the
Department of defense officials,

798
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:31,500
do you agree with me the war against
Islam or Tara or whatever description like

799
00:47:31,941 --> 00:47:36,550
to provide will go on after the
second term of President Obama.

800
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,020
In other words,

801
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:42,370
how long do you think this particular war
as declared in the section is going to

802
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:45,940
go on? Then in my judgment, this is
gonna go on for quite awhile and yes,

803
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:50,230
beyond the Turks, second
term of the president and
beyond this term of Congress.

804
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,930
Yes sir. I think it's
at least 10 to 20 years.

805
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:59,420
[inaudible] it was chilling cause like
this is already the longest war in the

806
00:47:59,421 --> 00:47:59,670
history.

807
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:04,670
United States along the Vietnam and now
a dod official is saying add on 10 or 20

808
00:48:05,241 --> 00:48:07,760
years. So, um, I said and use it,

809
00:48:07,761 --> 00:48:10,970
the administration's
position that you tell me if,

810
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,520
if somebody who's born after
nine 11, let's imagine in 2030,

811
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:20,450
they join a group that has just become
associated with al-Qaida in 2030 is that

812
00:48:20,451 --> 00:48:23,020
the administration's
position at the AUMF would,

813
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:27,110
would cover them and those organizations.
And without hesitation, the, uh,

814
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,570
the administration witnesses said yes,

815
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:34,110
as long as they become an
associated force under the, uh, the,

816
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,570
the legal standard that was set
out, it's not limited in time,

817
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:43,190
not limited in geography, really
troubling. Um, but you know,

818
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:44,660
I'm also troubled by another thing, right?

819
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:46,600
I mean, you know, the iconic, uh,

820
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:51,450
it's a New York picture of a
VJ Day kiss and Times Square.

821
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:55,960
I used to be in a car [inaudible] we
have a combination of every type from

822
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:56,740
typing

823
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,510
August 14th, 1945,

824
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:03,460
there ought to be a day where those who
have served in war that you declare that

825
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:05,770
the war is over and then you celebrate it.

826
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,910
All these people happy.
That's the only white

827
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,080
[inaudible] [inaudible]

828
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,140
you can ask sometimes by service
families, like when is this gonna end?

829
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:21,950
Does it ever come up? Yes, yes, yes.

830
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:26,120
You told us that something like one in
three people in his state of Virginia are

831
00:49:26,121 --> 00:49:29,030
connected to the military. So
he does get that question a lot.

832
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,650
And the truth is we all
want to VJ day, we need it.

833
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:39,010
And so seven days after that, Senate
Arms Services Committee hearing

834
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,860
President Obama, it is a great honor,

835
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,170
gave a speech to return to the
National Defense University

836
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,820
where he seems to say basically it's time,

837
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,200
this war, like all wars must end.

838
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,620
That's what history advises.

839
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:03,900
That is why I intend to engage congress
about the existing authorization to use

840
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:05,880
military force or AUM at

841
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:10,340
basically announces that he would like
to get rid of those 60 words and in this

842
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:14,530
war. Yeah, but common
sense tells you, yeah,

843
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:18,030
that these are different kind of enemy,

844
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,040
not a state or a government.
They just, they make war, uh,

845
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:26,040
in a different way. Senator McCain
has a great line. He goes, look,

846
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:29,150
we're in an age of warfare where the war
isn't going to end with the signing of

847
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,740
a peace treaty on the
deck of the destroyer.

848
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:34,310
That's not how it happens these days.
There no clear start and ending.

849
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:38,380
And yet the president, he wants
to end the war, suspend widows,

850
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,190
and every war has come to an end.

851
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:45,191
He sees himself as a person who came in
to a country fighting two wars and he

852
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:51,350
brought them all to an end. And I think
he wants to have done that. But how,

853
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,830
how do you, how do you do
that? How do you end a war

854
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,340
when the vast amount of people that
you're calling the enemy haven't stopped

855
00:50:58,341 --> 00:50:58,780
fighting? Yeah.

856
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:03,280
So what he does, America
cannot in the May speech,

857
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:06,880
and it's extremely clever and by the way,

858
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,620
it's really well lawyer,

859
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,870
is he announces a set of rules
going forward for drone strikes.

860
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:16,900
America does not take strikes
to punish individuals.

861
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:21,760
We act against terrorists who pose a
continuing an eminent threat to the

862
00:51:21,761 --> 00:51:25,840
American people that he's only gonna use
drone strikes when there's an imminent

863
00:51:25,841 --> 00:51:26,830
threat capable.

864
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,000
And it's well understood by people
who understand this kind of stuff,

865
00:51:31,001 --> 00:51:33,970
that in the constitution and
also in international law,

866
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:39,330
the president is allowed
to act unilaterally in
self-defense when there is an

867
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,200
imminent threat,

868
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:44,920
meaning it's urgent and you can't
feasibly capture that person.

869
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:49,880
Ben Fears that what President Obama
was doing there by stressing that word,

870
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,210
an imminent threat to the American people.

871
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,730
You said he was laying a new foundation.

872
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:59,720
You're saying when the AUMF
ends and I want it to end,

873
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:03,050
I do have another way of
justifying all these things.

874
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,540
Maybe they wouldn't change. So the
drone strikes and the rates would,

875
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,940
would continue as long as you have a
capacious enough understanding of what the

876
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:12,470
word imminent means,

877
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:17,270
you might be able to continue a whole
lot of this stuff and then you don't have

878
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:18,650
to go to Congress at all

879
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,960
and you can say you've ended the war and
the human rights groups will cheer for

880
00:52:26,631 --> 00:52:31,631
you and we're going to mysteriously find
that there are a whole lot of imminent

881
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,550
threats for freedom.

882
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,120
Thank you very much
everybody. God bless you.

883
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,260
Hey God bless the United
States of America.

884
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:48,550
And in the context of what
happened to those 60 words,

885
00:52:48,551 --> 00:52:51,970
you do have to wonder what's going
to happen to a word like imminent.

886
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:56,320
And all the while according to Ben
Witness and pretty much everyone we spoke

887
00:52:56,321 --> 00:52:59,030
with, we haven't really
answered the big questions.

888
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:04,030
When do we want to attack
the enemy? Who is the enemy?

889
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:07,540
And if we're going to be fighting them
even when we're not technically at war

890
00:53:07,541 --> 00:53:11,290
with them, then what's the
difference between war and peace?

891
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,310
And that's why this whole subject

892
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,220
is so unsettling. And
again, if you don't know

893
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,370
the common sense definition anymore of
when you're at war and when you're at

894
00:53:34,371 --> 00:53:37,850
peace, then how do you, how
do you write rules? Yeah.

895
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:41,870
This was an attempt to
begin opal war and a,

896
00:53:41,871 --> 00:53:44,840
so it had the usual beginning
questions. Okay, you who are you?

897
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:50,330
Are you out there where you for how long
until you surrender and know you're not

898
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,120
going to surrender? Like all of the
usual, uh, business of warfare is,

899
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,020
it doesn't apply in this case. So then
you have to think of, now what do we do?

900
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,500
[inaudible] yeah, it's just
like one long improvisation.

901
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:31,070
[inaudible]

902
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:35,960
huge thanks to this hour to buzzfeed
and to their reporter Gregory Johnson.

903
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,740
Checkout Gregory's piece is
where we started with that.

904
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:42,980
We will link to it from radiolab.org.
It's on buzzfeed as well.

905
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:44,420
It's called 60 words.

906
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:49,610
Any war without in the untold story of
the most dangerous sentence in the U S

907
00:54:49,611 --> 00:54:51,770
history. That is a
title right there. Also,

908
00:54:51,771 --> 00:54:55,190
