00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
For this problem, suppose an eavesdropper, Eve, knows Alice is sending Bob a message m,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which is in the set {00, 01, 10, 11} using a one-time pad where the key, k,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is a perfectly random key unknown to Eve

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and the distribution of the messages is uniform--each message is equally likely

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What is the conditional probability that m = 01

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
given that Eve intercepts the ciphertext 01.

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Give your answer to two decimal places.
