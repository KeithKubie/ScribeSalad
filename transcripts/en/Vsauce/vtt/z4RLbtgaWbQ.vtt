00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.049
Wrap a hot dog in a burger and share one
with the girl who looks like Taylor

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:04.670
Lautner.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.610
It's episode 35 of IMG!

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.000
Okay, see this picture

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.450
of Albert Einstein?
Well, squint your eyes to see a wizard.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.160
Last week a volcano erupted in Iceland
and it was captured

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.060
from space.
Octopus chandeliers are also weird,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.790
but this is how I spend most of my
Saturdays. Once the kid is born,

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.890
pick up a TV dinner,
perfect for kid...bullying people.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.719
I usually prefer meals like this,
complete with snails

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.520
and romance. Rage faces are everywhere,
but take a look at a dollar bill.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.740
Closer, closer, closer,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.880
closer. Forever alone.
Grandma...

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.030
Oh.
Here's a pilot ejecting from a plane

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.780
really close to the ground.
This is what he escaped from.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.120
No, no, no, kitty, kitty, kitty.
That is a bad box to sleep in.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.870
But I do love epic meetings.
Carl Sagan

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.559
and the Dalai Lama. George Harrison and
Bob Marley. Warren Buffett,

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.579
Bill Gates, Ludacris.
Hunter S Thompson,

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.850
John Cusack, Johnny Depp and a blow up doll.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.250
Oh, and this guy with Albert Einstein,
that is Charlie Chaplin and here's

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.840
Chaplin

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.600
with Gandhi.
Oh and when bears are bald, they look like

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.940
this.
Artist Sam Spratt gave us Dwight Schrute

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.729
wearing a bear,
and he also created Rebecca Black

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.650
with rotting flesh.
Reddit discovered a lot

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.470
of truths this week. A building that looks
like a bird wearing a top hat

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.970
and Obama looks like this.
Seriously.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.110
A lot.
And now, funny names for boats.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.250
Enjoy.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.180
This license

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.490
plate looks random, but in a mere
reflection... Potatoes and humans can be

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.240
friends.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.870
And if you want a wedding ring to be
more permanent, make it a piercing.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.840
Sam Bassett takes incredible portraits.
Randy Moss,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.620
rainbows, tennis. And here are some books
from the Dutch literature organization

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.130
cut into three-dimensional heads,
like this one of Anne Frank.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.800
And that's right, you guessed it,
today's final image

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.810
is this 8-bit hair bow that you can own

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.040
from today's episode of LÃœT, where I cover a bunch of
stuff that you can actually buy.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.060
And don't worry boys, there are some gifts
for you, too. So go over there right now,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.280
click on the hair bow to view it.
