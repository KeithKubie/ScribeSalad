00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.560
How would you describe your personality?

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.550
Maybe friendly, creative, quirky?

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.450
What about nervous, or timid, or outgoing?

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.480
But has anyone ever called you a sanguine?

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.720
What about a Kapha, or full of metal?

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.740
Ancient Greek physician Hippocrates believed
personality manifested itself in four different

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.530
humors, and, basically, you are who you are
because of your balance of phlegm, blood,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.840
and yellow and black bile.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.199
According to traditional Chinese medicine,
our personalities depend on the balance of

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.460
five elements: Earth, Wind, Water, Metal and
Fire.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.410
Those who practice traditional Hindu Ayurvedic
Medicine view each other as unique combinations

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.300
of three different mind-body principles called
Doshas.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.559
But Sigmund Freud thought our personalities
depended in part on who was winning the battle

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.670
of urges between the Id, Ego, and Superego.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.460
Meanwhile, humanistic psychologist Abraham
Maslow suggested that the key to self-actualization

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.579
was first successfully climbing a hierarchy
of more basic needs.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.049
And then, you've got your BuzzFeed quizzes
to determine what kind of pirate, or font,

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.760
or sandwich, or Harry Potter character you
are, but, that, I would never take one of

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.760
those seriously.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.399
All this is to say that people have been characterizing
one another for a long, long time, and whether

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.200
you're into blood, or bile, or ego, or id,
or BLT, or PB&amp;J, there are a lot of ways to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.350
describe and measure a personality.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.770
And all these theories, all the years of research,
and cigar smoking, and inkblot gazing, and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.580
the fans debating whether they're more of
a Luke or a Leia, they're all funneling down

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.600
to one big central question.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.390
Who, or what, is the self?

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.080
[Intro]

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:39.370
Last week we talked about how psychologists
often study personality by examining the differences

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.490
between characteristics, and by looking at
how these various characteristics combine

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.010
to create a whole thinking, feeling person.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.571
The early psychoanalytic and humanistic theorists
had a lot of ideas about personality, but

00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:54.380
some psychologists question their lack of
clearly measurable standards.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.330
Like, there was no way to really quantify
someone's inkblot response, or how orally

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.560
fixated they might be.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.570
So this drive to find a more empirical approach
spawned two more popular theories in the twentieth

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.920
century, known as the trait and social cognitive
perspectives.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.390
Instead of focusing on things like lingering
unconscious influences or missed growth opportunities,

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.260
trait theory researchers look to define personality
through stable and lasting behavior patterns

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.810
and conscious motivations.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.400
Legend has it that it all began in 1919, when
young American psychologist Gordon Allport

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.459
paid a visit to none other than Freud himself.

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.812
Allport was telling Freud about his journey
there on the train, and how there was this

00:02:31.812 --> 00:02:36.780
little boy who was obsessed with staying clean
and didn't want to sit next to anyone or touch

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.780
anything.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.069
Allport wondered if the boy's mother had a
kind of dirt phobia that had rubbed off on

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.069
him.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.079
So yadda yadda yadda, he's telling his tale,
and at the end of it Freud looks at him and

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.110
says, "Mhmm..

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.540
Was that little boy you?"

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.549
Allport was basically like, "No, man, that
was just some kid on the train.

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.359
Don't try to make this into some big unconscious
episode from my repressed childhood".

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.689
Allport thought Freud was digging a little
too deep, and that sometimes you just need

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.620
to look at motives in the present, not the
past, to describe behavior.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.250
So Allport started his own club, describing
personality in terms of fundamental traits,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.049
or characteristic behaviors and conscious
motives.

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.069
He wasn't so much interested in explaining
traits as he was in describing them.

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.900
Modern trait researchers like Robert McCrae
and Paul Costa have since organized our fundamental

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.309
characteristics into what's casually known
as The Big Five: openness, conscientiousness,

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:29.389
extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism,
which you can remember using the mnemonic

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.549
OCEAN, or CANOE, whichever one you prefer.

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.650
Each of these traits exist on a spectrum,
so, for example, your level of openness can

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.370
range, on one end, from being totally open
to new things and variety, or wanting strict,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.849
regular routine on the other end.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.220
Your degree of conscientiousness can translate
into being impulsive and careless, or careful

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.220
and disciplined.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.779
Someone high on the extroversion end will
be sociable, while those on the low end will

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:53.909
be shy and reserved.

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.290
A very agreeable person, meanwhile, is helpful
and trusting, while someone at the opposite

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.629
end may be suspicious or uncooperative.

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.010
And finally, on the neuroticism spectrum,
an emotionally stable person will be calm

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.700
and secure, while a less stable person is
often anxious, insecure, and self-pitying.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.359
The important idea here is that these traits
are hypothesized to predict behavior and attitude.

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.560
Like an introvert might prefer communicating
through e-mail more than an extrovert, and

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.910
an agreeable person is much more likely to
help their neighbor move that couch than a

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.090
suspicious one who's just glaring through
the window.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.020
By adulthood, trait theorists will tell you
these characteristics are pretty stable, but

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.690
it isn't to say that they can't flex a little
in different situations.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.760
Like that same shy person might end up singing
Elvis karaoke in a room full of people under

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760
the right conditions.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.600
So our personality traits are better at predicting
our average behavior that what we'd do in

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.130
any specific situation, and research indicates
that some traits, like neuroticism, seem to

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.170
be better predictors of behavior than others.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.700
This flexibility that we all seem to have
leads to the fourth major theory on personality,

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.540
the social cognitive perspective.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.220
Originally proposed by our Bobo-beating friend
Alfred Bandura, the social cognitive school

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.590
emphasizes the interaction between our traits
and their social context.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.500
Bandura noted that we learn a lot of our behavior
by watching and imitating others.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.351
That's the social part of the equation.

00:05:07.351 --> 00:05:11.790
But we also think a lot about how these social
interactions affect our behavior, which is

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.790
the cognitive part.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.660
So, in this way, people and their situations
basically work together to create behavior.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.220
Bandura referred to this sort of interplay
as reciprocal determinism.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.560
Meaning, that for example, the kind of books
you read or music you listen to or friends

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.460
you hang out with say something about your
personality, because different people choose

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.630
to be in different environments, and then
those environments in turn continue to reinforce

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.660
our personalities.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.180
So if Bernice has a kind of anxious-suspicious
personality, and she has a serious, titanic

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.240
crush on Sherlock Holmes, she might be extra
attuned to potentially dangerous or fishy

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.240
situations.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.930
But the more she sees the world in that way,
the more anxious and suspicious she gets.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.190
In this way, we're both the creators and the
products of the situations we surround ourselves

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.190
with.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.970
That's why one of the key indicators of personality
in this school of thought has to do with our

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.360
sense of personal control -- that is, the
extent to which you perceive that you have

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.330
control over your environment.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.520
Someone who believes that they control their
own fate, or make their own luck, is said

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.440
to have an internal locus of control, while
those who feel like they're just guided by

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.650
forces beyond their control are said to have
an external locus.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.740
Now whether we're talking about control versus
helplessness, introversion versus extroversion,

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.550
calm versus anxious, or whatever, each of
these different personality perspectives have

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.620
their own methods of testing and measuring
personality.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.010
We've talked before about how the psychoanalyst
super-hunk Hermann Rorschach used his inkblot

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.260
test to infer information about a person's
personality; we know that Freud used dream

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.660
analysis, and both he and Young were both
fans of free association, but the broader

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.350
school of theorists, now known as the psycho-dynamic
camp that descended from Freud and pals, also

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:51.330
use other projective psychological tests,
including the famous thematic apperception

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.330
test.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.800
In this kind of test, you'd be presented with
evocative but ambiguous pictures, and then

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.890
asked to provide information about them.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.580
You might be asked to tell a story about the
scenes, considering things like how are the

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.700
characters feeling, or what's going on, or
what happened before this event and what will

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.700
happen after.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.240
Like check it out, is the woman crying because
her brother just died, or from a bee sting?

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.780
Or is she a maid laughing because some royal
just passed out drunk on his bed, or perhaps

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.430
the object of her long-burning affection has
just confessed his love in a fever haze all

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.122
Jane Austen-style and she's having a mini-breakdown
in the hall?!

00:07:22.122 --> 00:07:25.960
The idea is that your responses will reveal
something about your concerns and motivations

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.980
in real life, or how you see the world, or
about your unconscious processes that drive

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.980
you.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.090
By contrast with that approach, though, modern
trait personality researchers believe that

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.300
you can assess personality traits by having
people answer a series of test questions.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.590
There are lots of so-called personality trait
inventories out there.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:47.380
Some provide a quick reading on a particular
enduring trait, like anxiety or self-esteem,

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.030
while other gauge a wide range of traits,
like our friends The Big Five.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.970
These tests, like the Myers-Briggs, which
you might have heard of, involve long questionnaires

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.970
of true-false or agree-disagree questions
like, "Do you enjoy being the center of attention?",

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:04.830
"Do you find it easy to empathize with others?",
or "Do you value justice over mercy?"

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:10.400
But the classic Minnesota Multiphasic Personality
Inventory is probably the most widely used

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.590
personality test.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:16.280
The most recent version asks a series of five
hundred and sixty-seven true-false questions,

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.230
varying from "No one seems to understand me"
to "I like mechanics magazines" to "I loved

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.389
my father", and is often used to identify
emotional disorders.

00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:27.639
Then there's how Bandura's social cognitive
camp sizes you up.

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:31.320
Because this school of thought emphasizes
the interaction of environment and behavior

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.320
rather than just traits alone, they aren't
solely into questions and answers.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.271
Instead, they might measure personality in
different contexts, understanding behavior

00:08:39.271 --> 00:08:43.479
in one situation is best predicted by how
you acted in a similar situation.

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:47.529
Like, if Bernice freaked out and tried to
hide under the bed during the last five thunderstorms,

00:08:47.529 --> 00:08:49.940
we can predict that she will do that again
next time.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.650
And if we conducted a controlled lab experiment
where we, say, we looked at the effects of

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.640
thunderstorm noises on people's behavior,
we might get an even better sense of what

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.180
baseline psychological factors could best
predict storm-induced freak-outs.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.700
And finally, there are the Humanistic theorists
like Maslow.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.490
They often reject standardized assessments
altogether.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:12.480
Instead, they tend to measure your self-concept
through therapy, interviews, and questionnaires

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.170
that ask subjects to describe both how they
would ideally like to be and how they actually

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.170
are.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.610
The idea is that the closer the actual and
ideal are, the more positive the subject's

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.610
sense of self.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:27.690
Which brings us back to that biggest motherlode
question of them all: Who, or what, is the

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.690
self?

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:32.010
All the books out there about self-esteem,
self-help, self-awareness, self-control, and

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.690
so on are built upon one assumption: that
the self is the organizer of our thoughts

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.610
and feelings and actions: essentially the
center of a personality.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.450
But of course, it's a sticky issue.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:46.860
One way to think about self is through the
concept of possible selves, like your ideal

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.880
self, perhaps devastatingly attractive and
intelligent, successful, and well-loved, as

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.400
well as your most feared self, the one who
could end up unemployed and lonely and rundown.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.020
This balance of potential best and worst selves
motivates us through life.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:03.180
In the end, once you factor in environment
and childhood experiences, culture and all

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.320
that mess, not to mention biology which we
haven't even touched on today, can we really

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.120
firmly define self?

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.550
Or answer certainly that we even have one?

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:16.650
That, my friend, is one of life's biggest
questions, and so far it has yet to be universally

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:17.650
answered.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:18.680
But you learned a lot anyway today, right?

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.590
As we talked about the trait and social cognitive
perspectives, and also about different ways

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.480
these schools and others measure and test
personality.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.740
We also talked about what self is, and how
our self-esteem works.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.710
