00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And the answer is, the probability of every sequence becomes small.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is true because there become more and more sequences.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Every time you flip a coin, you double the number of sequences.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And they have varying probabilities but they are always more against the probability,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
always goes down and always multiplying in a number less than 1.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That's why this assumption is important.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The probability of every number of heads become small.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is a little trickier that this is also true because as the number of flips increases,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the number of heads must increase even if we're assuming some low probability for it.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So, it becomes farther and farther away from what we expect.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The probability of every proportion of heads also becomes small.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This is a little trickier but the thing to remember is--

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
every proportion of heads, corresponds to a given exact number of heads.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now that exact number of heads changes as, let's say,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I double the number of flips, I also double the number of heads I need.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
But, that's going to always be a smaller number, since again that probability has to be divided

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
into the chance that I could just have one more head or one less head

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which is going to be an ever so slightly different proportion.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now, this statement is not true.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The probability of every range of proportions can't become small.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The range of all proportions is arranged and we know that has to stay at once,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So, that can't be true and the probability of some ranges of proportions become small.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Well, this will also be true--consider something improbable like

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
getting the proportion--a proportion below 10% on a fair coin.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
That's going to tend to become rare and rare and rare as you flip it more times,

00:02:03.000 --> 99:59:59.000
because the same rare or unlikely event has to keep repeating itself.
