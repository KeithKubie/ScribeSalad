[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,300
can you cheat your way into
ketosis? The answer's yes and no.

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,340
I've been asked a lot recently
about different ketone
supplements, exotic genus,

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,480
ketones. All right.

5
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:22,481
These are externally synthesize ketones
that you can consume often in liquid

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,923
form.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,260
Good way to remember exact genus XL
like exoskeleton outside endogenous that

8
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:31,310
would be ketones produced
in the body. For instance,

9
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:36,290
if you fast and then eat one meal
per day for two or three days,

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,320
like a salad with a little bit of steak
in a bunch of oil and you walk a lot

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,200
during that period of time, drinking
water, chances are in two or three days,

12
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:47,630
especially if you're a male,
typically to drop in faster,

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,840
you'll probably get 2.7 or higher
millimolars of Beta hydroxybutyrate BHB as

14
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:58,100
measured using a device called the
precision xtra x Tra by Abbott Labs,

15
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:02,120
which is what I use and I recommend people
use something like that with blood as

16
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:05,660
opposed to urinalysis
with the Quito sticks,

17
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,690
which as you get better at processing
ketones in your body will give you a false

18
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,710
negative. It will say
you're not in Contoso,

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,540
but let's come back to the
exhaust ketones. A lot of
my friends have said, hey,

20
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:18,980
have you seen this? Have you seen that?

21
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,320
It seems like I could just consume this
to get the benefits of Ketosis and while

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,190
I'm consuming my normal diet and a,

23
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:31,260
there is some evidence to suggest
that you can derive certain benefits,

24
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:33,960
say, uh,

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,400
related to anti-inflammation or otherwise
by consuming exaggerates ketones even

26
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,000
in the presence of carbohydrates.
However, and I'm not a doctor,

27
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,200
don't play one on the Internet,

28
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:50,650
but I suspect at least the more research
should be done related to the longer

29
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:53,870
term, say for a few weeks,

30
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,560
consumption of exogenous ketones while
you're eating a normal carbohydrate

31
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,430
dependent diet when you're using
still glucose as your primary fuel.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The only place in nature as it relates
to human physiology that I'm aware of

33
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,230
where you observe both elevated glucose
levels and elevated ketone levels is in

34
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:24,590
a state called Quito acidosis,
which is a dangerous state, uh,

35
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,980
observed. Typically I believe
in type one diabetics.

36
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,370
So if then we are mimicking
that by consuming exaggerate
as ketones on a regular

37
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:35,990
basis.

38
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,990
It's hard for me to see how that is
beneficial and strikes me as somewhat

39
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:44,870
epistemologically arrogant
as [inaudible] might say.

40
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,320
For us to believe with the limited data
that we have that that is a good idea.

41
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,710
I would prefer to be conservative and
I am a conservative personally in that

42
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:55,400
respect.

43
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,400
It's often just ketones can be a
fantastic tool for greasing the skids and

44
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:05,080
helping with the transition from
say a semi fasted or fasting state.

45
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,200
Perhaps you're using intermittent
fasting like I mentioned,

46
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:13,201
to consume one or two small meals a day
that are key to genic diet meals on root

47
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,094
ticket ptosis.

48
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,160
You can use the exoticness ketones to
give you some fire power and actual

49
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,830
cognitive ability in that normally very
gray zone until you click in and get to

50
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:31,270
say 0.7 1.2 1.5 millimoles, at which
point you'll be off to the races.

51
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,870
But otherwise I've decided for myself
that I generally steer away from it.

52
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,120
That doesn't mean that, for instance,

53
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:41,260
if you have depressed glucose levels
and you've just come off of a nice big

54
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,840
sleep and you had an early
dinner the night before,

55
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,410
perhaps in those circumstances,
if you're about to do exercise,

56
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:51,460
say aerobic exercise, you could
use ketones to enhance performance.

57
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,900
But caveat emptor, I would say be careful,

58
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,780
and as far as I'm concerned,
it'd be conservative.
