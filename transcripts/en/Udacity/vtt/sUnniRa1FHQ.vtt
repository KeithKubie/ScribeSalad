00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.460
Awesome work.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.840
In this level,
you learned how to draw circles and

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.970
how to manage multiple
shape renderer batches.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.876
You then learned how to create and
manage an orthographic camera.

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:14.310
You use view ports of various
types to make cameras easier.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.100
And finally you learned
how to draw text.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.590
You're not quite done yet, though.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.240
I've got a couple more
drawing challenges for

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.610
you that will strain your brain.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.230
And, put your shape renderer,
orthographic camera, and

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.380
view port knowledge to the test.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.340
Let's do it.
