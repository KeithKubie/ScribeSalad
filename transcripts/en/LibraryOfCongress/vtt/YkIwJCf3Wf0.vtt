00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.610
&gt;&gt; Okay, everybody.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.910
Morning.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.210
&gt;&gt; Morning.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.900
&gt;&gt; Morning, Ms. Carolyn.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.900
&gt;&gt; Good morning, Smithsonian
Early Enrichment Center.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:43.970 position:56%
How many students here go to the
Smithsonian Early Enrichment Center?

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.940
Wow. Thank you.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.160
You are at the Library of Congress

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.920
at a place called the Young Readers
Center, which is a special place

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.410
at the Library for Children.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.820
Has anyone here been to the
Library of Congress before?

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.270
Wow. Great.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.010
We're glad to see you back, and
we hope you'll come again soon.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:20.930
Today we have a special program
about books, and about story time.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.800
And it's a partnership,
a collaboration,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.550
with the Young Readers Center
at the Library of Congress,

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.790
Education Outreach at the Library
of Congress, the Rare Books

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.420
and Collection Division at
the Library of Congress,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.610
and a company called Cricket Media.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.310
Who knows what a cricket is?

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.610
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] bug.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.910
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.210
&gt;&gt; It's a bug.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.260
&gt;&gt; The company is called
Cricket Media and they do a lot

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.040
of fun things for children, and
you're going to see what they do

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.730
in a few minutes, and particularly
what they do about stories.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.390
So I'm going to introduce
Lee Ann Potter,

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.840
who's head of our Education
Outreach Division, and she's going

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.130
to explain the rest of the program.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.080
I just will say one thing, however.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.100
We have a lot of grownups here
as well as our special guests,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.160
our children, and I would ask the
grownups if they have questions

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.790
or comments, to wait until the
end, because the first part

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.380 position:56%
of the program is for our
children, and you will have a chance

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.680
to ask a lot of questions
if you'd like, at the end,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.080
and we'll make time for that.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.380
Lee Ann.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.680
&gt;&gt; Very good.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.980
Thank you Karen.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.280
Good morning!

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.580 position:56%
I'm admiring all of your snow boots.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.140
And I have to stay I'm so
impressed that you made it

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.870
to the Library today when so many
other organizations are closed.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.460
So you're awesome.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.450
Thank you.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.960
Karen mentioned that there
are a lot of grownups

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.430
in the room, as well as kids.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.870
But I'm going to tell you a secret
about the grownups in the room.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.310
Everybody in this room has
something in common with you.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.610
Do you believe me?

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.190
Can I prove it to you anyway?

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.230
Okay, what I want you to do is
I want you to close your eyes,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.690
and in a minute I'm going to
ask you to raise your hand.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.460
Okay? And adults have to
close their eyes, too.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.460
Okay? Everybody's closing
their eyes, and now I'm going

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.930
to ask you some questions, and
as I ask you the questions,

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.200
you can raise your hand
when the answer is yes.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.770
Okay? Raise your hand
if you love books.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.150
Raise your hand -- or keep your
hand up if you love story time.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.610
Raise your hand if you love
reading with other people.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.010
Okay, now everybody keep your
hands up and open your eyes

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.920
and look around the room.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.830
What do you see?

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.740
That's right, everybody in the
room loves the same things,

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.280
and that's why we're all here
today, because we all love books,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.880
and we love story time, and
we've got some very special books

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.210
to show you.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.470
How old -- I'm going
to ask you this.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.630
How many of you are three?

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.520
How many of you are four?

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.820
How many of you are five?

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.740
And how many of you
are older than five?

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:23.110
Okay. We have four very special
books to show you this morning,

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.710
and guess how old they are?

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.700
Do you think they're three?

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.000
Do you think they're four?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.320
&gt;&gt; No, I think they're
100 years old.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.710
&gt;&gt; You know what?

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.960
You're pretty much right, and my
friend Jackie is going to come

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.690
and show you a little
bit about these books.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.120 position:56%
She's going to show you some really
neat old books, and then we're going

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.930 position:56%
to read one of them, and we're
going to do something really special

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.270
with that book when we read it.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.170
Okay? Are you ready
to see some old books?

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah!

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.770
&gt;&gt; All right, Jackie, you're on.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.070
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.370
&gt;&gt; Jackie [inaudible]
works with rare books here

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.670
at the library every day.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.840
&gt;&gt; I don't want to step on
anybody's fingers or toes.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.140
Thank you.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.440
&gt;&gt; And knows rare children's books.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.740
&gt;&gt;Let's see.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.740
&gt;&gt; Do you want me to hold
one and you talk about it?

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.530
&gt;&gt; I've got it, thanks.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.030
Well, it's great to see
everybody here today.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.320
And Lee Ann told you that some
of these books are very old.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.720
This book is 103 years old.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.590
So did somebody say -- somebody
in here say they were three?

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.890
Who's three?

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.190
Are you three?

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.280
This book is 100 years
older than you are.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.320
Isn't that amazing?

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.070
And that's what we do here at
the library -- three and a half?

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.200
Well, then this book is 99 and
a half years older than you are.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:42.080 position:56%
Okay, well, this book is called "The
Rocket Book," and it's very special,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.360
not only because it's --
how old did I say it was?

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.540
103 years old.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.990
It's by a man named Peter Newell.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.300
And Peter Newell had
a great imagination.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.150
And here we go.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.860
There's a little guy
riding his rocket.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.910
So where do you think
this rocket's going to go?

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.210
I'll show you.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.680
He's a little guy.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.980
So here, we're in the basement
of an apartment building,

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.980
and this guy's name is Fritz.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.690
It says, "When Fritz,
the janitor's bad kid,

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.390
went snooping in the basement,

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.450
he found a rocket snugly hid
beneath the window casement.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.040
He struck a match with
one fell swoop,

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.620
then on the concrete kneeling,
he lit the rocket and she-oop!

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.900
It shot up through the ceiling."

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.970
So can you see the rocket?

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.270
Yeah. And where's it going?

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.800
It's going through the
ceiling of the basement.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.340
And then the story goes on.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.820
It's a 20 -- there's 20 floors
in this apartment building,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.400
and it goes up through every floor.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.130 position:56%
So here's this family having their
breakfast, and the rocket goes right

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.360
through the table and right
through their cereal and zoom.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.030
And then it goes up
to the second floor.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.370
And you know what's
funny about this book?

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.990
Is there's a hole in every page.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.350
See? So there's the
hole the rocket made.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.310
And it goes right through
the page of the story book.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.230
&gt;&gt; I think it's to make sure --

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.450
I think it's to make it look
like the rocket went through --

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:19.750
&gt;&gt; Right through the page?

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.050
Absolutely.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.350
&gt;&gt; For real?

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.650
&gt;&gt; Yep, for real.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.920
See? And then I'm going to
show you my favorite page.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.220
Okay?

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.520
&gt;&gt; What is it?

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.820
&gt;&gt; Here we go.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.320
The eighth flat.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.730
That's another name --
that's an old fashion name

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.950
for an apartment is a flat.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:42.490
So here he is on the eighth flat,
and where did the rocket go?

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:43.790
&gt;&gt; The bathtub.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.090
&gt;&gt; Can you see?

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.390
It went in through the bathtub.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.250
So here's this man, and he's
getting ready to take his bath,

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.690
and the rocket -- what would you
do if you went to take your bath

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.100
and the rocket went right
through your bathtub?

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:05.260
Yeah. So this is -- this is "The
Rocket Book," and you're going

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:10.520
to be able to see that on
Storybug, and then you can decide.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:16.800
You can say, do I want to read "The
Rocket Book" on paper like this?

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.100
Or do I want to read
"The Rocket Book" --

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.470
but you will at home
because it's online.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.010
So should I show one more book?

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.750
&gt;&gt; How about we start
reading "The Rocket Book,"

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.230
and then we'll see the other one.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.530
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.830
Okay.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.130
&gt;&gt; Shall we read the story?

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:34.430
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:35.730
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:37.030
I'm going to pull the
story up on the screen,

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.580
because this story has
been made available online,

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.320
and we can all look at it.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.730
And as Karen mentioned, we have
friends with us today who are

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.430
from Cricket Media and they have
created an app called Storybug.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.150
And a minute ago, when Karen asked
if anybody knew what a cricket was

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.660
and one of you said it was a bug?

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.760
That was so perfect, because that's
the name of the app, Storybug.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.130
So it's easy to remember.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.210
The book, you'll see
-- see how we have --

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.430
how many of you use an iPad
to read stories at home?

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.330
So you know what a library
on an iPad looks like,

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.850
and how you've got your
titles all lined up.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.660
Well, the same thing works
here, and I'm going to work off

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.110
of this little one, but
you can see it up there.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.850
And if you need to scoot just a
little bit, that would be okay.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.960
So we're going to select
"The Rocket Book"

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.950
and see "The Rocket Book"
up on the big screen?

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.630
It looks very similar to the
book we were just looking at.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.170
And I can turn the pages.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.840
And if you see where my
finger is, see my finger?

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.160
I'm turning the page.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.540
That's pretty neat, huh?

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.910
So I'm going to turn it.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:46.690
You know, it's not super long,
but maybe I can point to words

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.050
and you guys can help me read.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.350
What do you think?

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.650
Okay, I like that idea.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:51.950
Okay, well we'll start.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.460
Remember, exactly what Jackie said.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.930
We start in the basement.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.380
Oh, that's cool.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.680
Thank you.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.040
We're starting in the basement.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.590
"When Fritz, the janitor's bad
kid, went snooping in the basement,

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.700
he found a rocket snugly hid
beneath the window casement.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:15.460
He struck a match with one fell
swoop, then on the concrete,

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.540
kneeling, he lit the
rocket and she-oop!

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.760
It shot through the ceiling.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.970
The Steiners on the floor above,
a breakfast were partaking,

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:32.840
crash came the rocket, unannounced,
and set them all a-quaking.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:38.060
It smote a catsup bottle fair,
and bang, the thing exploded.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:43.650
And now these people all declare
the catsup flask was loaded.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.820
The second flat.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:52.640
Before the fire, old Grandpa
Hopp dozed in his armchair big,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:58.280
when from a trunk the rocket
burst, and carried off his wig!

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:03.840
It passed so near his ancient
head he roused up with a start

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.650
and turning to his grandsons said,

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.910
'you fellows think
you're smart.'" How many

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.420
of you like the story so far?

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.070
Do you think it would be neat if
you could read the story far away?

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.370
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.020
&gt;&gt; I want to show you something.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.040
When you guys were home
because of the snow,

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.960 position:56%
did any of you read stories at home?

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.350
Did any of you read
stories together?

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:33.210
Could you read stories
together when you were at home?

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.490
You did, you read with
somebody at home, probably.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.610
Do you guys have story time
at school every single day?

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and every single day
when you have story time are all

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.000
of your friends always at school?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.700
Wouldn't it be neat if you could
have story time with your friends

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.000
when they're not even there?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.900
I want to show you
something really cool.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:58.930
I'm going to ask one of your
teachers to bring one student

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.030
with her to be the page turner,
and you guys are going to go

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.880
into the room next door and
in a minute you're going

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.300
to see what I was just
talking about.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:13.240
All right, Ms. Catherine,
do you want to -- awesome.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.280
Okay, see you in a minute.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.790
I think you guys are going
to think this is pretty neat.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.600
So they're just going into the
room next door where you were,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.630
by the beanbag chairs, and
there's an iPad over there as well,

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:34.220
and my friend Stephen is over there
and he and Ms. Catherine are going

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.370
to give us a call in a minute, and
we're going to hear the phone ring

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.940 position:56%
and we're going to answer the phone,
and then we're going to see them

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.790
up on the screen and we're going to
be able to read the story together.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.710
Isn't that going to be cool?

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.630
So let's keep our fingers
crossed that the telephone rings.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.820
Oh, I think they need a password.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.670
That happens.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.800
Whenever you fire up your computer,
you know how you have to type

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.750
in your password or
use your thumbprint?

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.360
That's what they're going to do.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.660
I'm going to turn it back on again.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.340
It's all better.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.640
Thank you.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.940
I guess I needed to wake it up.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.480
Should we accept that call?

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.780
Do you think we should?

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.970
Okay, so I'm going to
hit the Accept button.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.610
Let's see.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:53.470
It looks like somebody's there.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.770
Who's that?

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.810
Do you know who that is?

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.110
Isn't that neat?

00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.410
And look, here we are.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.470
If I can get this just right and
tilted down, there you guys are.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.730
Can you see yourselves, sort of?

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:09.860
Should we start the story
again and see if maybe Carl

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.420
and Ms. Catherine can read to us?

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.650
&gt;&gt; Okay. I'll open it
up -- oops, wrong book.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.920
I'm going to go back to my library.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.220
&gt;&gt; That's a good one, too.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.910
There we go.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:33.960
Okay. Ms. Catherine, do you
see the same story that we see?

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.650
&gt;&gt; We do see the same
story that you see.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.890
&gt;&gt; Do you and Carl want
to read the third flat?

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.700
&gt;&gt; Do you think she can read that?

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.370
Yeah. Okay.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.670
Third flat.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:53.330
"Algernon Bracket, somewhat
rash, had blown a monster bubble.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.500
When oh, there came a blinding
flash, precipitating trouble!

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:03.450
But Algy turned in mild disgust
and called to Mama Bracket, 'Say,

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.540
did you hear that bubble burst?

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.430
It made an awful racket!'"

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:09.730
&gt;&gt; Should we turn the page?

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.030
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.680
&gt;&gt; Would you come help
me turn the page?

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.980
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.280
&gt;&gt; Okay. You saw what
I was doing, right?

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.110
You saw all I did was I
put my finger down here

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:19.590
and I just dragged it over.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.580
Can you do that?

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.880
There you go.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.080
Perfect. Thank you.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.810
Should we read this one?

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:29.590
&gt;&gt; The fifth flat?

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:33.710
"Right here, tis needful
to remark that Dick

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:38.080
and little son were playing with a
Noah's Ark and having loads of fun,

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.740 position:56%
when all at once that rocket, stout,

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.400
up through the ark came blazing
the animals were tossed about

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.410
and did some stunts amazing."

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:52.250
You want to turn the page?

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.010
Okay, I think it's Carl's turn.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.540
&gt;&gt; You ready to read, then?

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.840
All right.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.140
Here we go.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.440
"Sixth flat.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.270
A burglar on the next floor up,
the sideboard was exploring,

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:07.860
(the family with the brindled pup
were still sleeping and snoring.)

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.530
Just then, up through
the silverware,

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:15.610
the rocket thundered, flaring!

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:20.550
The burglar got a dreadful scare
and out the door went tearing."

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.650
&gt;&gt; Would you like to come
and turn the page for me?

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.950
Okay.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.840
I think we're all going
to get a chance.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.320
I think we all will.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.990
Thank you very much.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.860
Do you want to go ahead and try?

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.100
Just put your finger right
there and drag it over.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.350
Yeah. Drag it the other direction.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:42.650
There you go.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:43.950
Just go like that.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.250
Go like that.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.720
I'm going to use your -- I'll
do your finger with you, okay?

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.380
Go like this.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.680
That was cool!

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.980
Good job.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.280
&gt;&gt; What does that say?

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.580
&gt;&gt; What does it say?

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.880
It says, "The Seventh Flat.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.800
Miss Mamie Briggs with no mean
skill was playing 'Casey's Fling'

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.410
to please her cousin Amos Gill,
who liked that sort of thing.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:07.470
When suddenly the rocket,
hot, the old piano jumbled,

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:12.520 position:56%
it stopped that ragtime like a shot,
then through the ceiling rumbled."

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.380
So this time the rocket went
right through the piano!

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.080
What sort of noise do
you think that made?

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.380
&gt;&gt; A boom!

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.680
&gt;&gt; Had a lot of noise, I bet.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.530
I bet. Okay, Carl, do
you want to do one?

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:32.380
&gt;&gt; I want to do some more.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.680
&gt;&gt; Do you?

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.980
&gt;&gt; "Eighth flat.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.650
Up through the next floor on
its way, that rocket, dread,

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.510
went tearing, where Winkle stood

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:42.530
in a bathroom gay, a
tepid bath preparing.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.910
The tub it punctured like a shot
and made a mighty splashing.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:53.460
The man was rooted to the spot,
then out the door went dashing."

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.390
&gt;&gt; That's the one that our friend,
Jackie, said she liked so much.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.850
Do you like that, going
through the bathtub?

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.150
Yep.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:02.450
&gt;&gt; How would you like
to [inaudible].

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:03.750
&gt;&gt; I'm going to have you
go the other direction.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.410
There we go.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.480
Can you go this way again?

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.490
Go this way again.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:10.790
There you go.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.090
Thank you very much.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.390
This one? Let's read this one.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:14.690
I'm going to put my finger here
and then you see what happens

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.230
when I put my finger up here?

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:20.800 position:56%
You can see the word -- like I can
point to specific words and letters.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.990
Can you see those, Carl?

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.640
When I point, can you
see what I'm pointing to?

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.280
&gt;&gt; Can you guys try
and point for us?

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.100
&gt;&gt; Let's point.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.460
&gt;&gt; That's pretty neat, huh?

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.610
You can see their fingers pointing.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.720
Yeah, theirs is a different
color, isn't it?

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.110
Yep, there's your finger.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.360 position:56%
That was -- that was neat, isn't it?

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.130
I think it's so I can tell
when somebody that I'm reading

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:48.190 position:56%
with is pointing and they can see
when I'm reading, when I'm pointing.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.490
Do you think maybe that's why?

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.470
Maybe if we're pointing
at the same time?

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.470
What if we point at the same time?

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:55.510
Do they both come up?

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.260
That was pretty cool, huh?

00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.560
All right.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.960
"Bob Brooks was puffing very
hard, his football to inflate,

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.290
while round him stood his faithful
guard and they could hardly wait.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.850
Then came the rocket,
fierce and bright,

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.210
and through the football rumbled.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.270
'You've got a pair
of lungs, all right,

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.940
his staring playmates grumbled."

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.220
&gt;&gt; "Tenth flat.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.750
The family dog with frenzied mein,

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:30.310
was chasing Fluff,
the mouser, when poof!

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:34.290
The rocket flashed between,
and quite astonished Towzer.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:39.060
Now if this dog had wit enough,
the English tongue to torture,

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.650
he might have growled
such silly stuff as,

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.990
'whew, that cat's a scorcher.'"

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:50.270
&gt;&gt; So a cat was chasing a dog
and a dog was chasing a cat, huh?

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.440
Yep, there we go.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.780
The eleventh flat.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.470
&gt;&gt; Where did it make the hole?

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.660
&gt;&gt; It looked like it made
the hole in the floor

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.090
or in the table, I think.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.820
And on this one it looks like
it's going through a table.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:09.250
"While Carrie Cook sat with a book,
the phonograph played sweetly.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.400
Then came the rocket and it
smashed that instrument completely.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.960
Fair Carrie promptly turned
her head, attracted by the war.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:23.870
'Dear me, I've never heard,' she
said, 'that record played before.'"

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.790
&gt;&gt; De Vere was searching for
a match to light a cigarette,

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:35.970
but failed to find one with
despatch, and threw him in a pet.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:41.330
Just then the rocket flared up
right before his face and crackled,

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.010
supplying him with a needed light.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.520
'Thanks awfully,' he cackled."

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.320
&gt;&gt; So it gave him a
brighter light, didn't it?

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.620
"The thirteenth flat.

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:56.780
Home from the shop came Maud's
new hat, a hat of monstrous size.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:01.170
It almost filled the tiny
flat before her ravished eyes.

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.470
When sch-u-u!

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.150
Up through the box so proud the
rocket flared and sputtered,

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:11.020
'I said that hat was all too loud,'
her peevish husband muttered."

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.120
I don't think he liked that hat

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.970
and was glad the rocket took
it out, don't you think?

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.790
&gt;&gt; This one's got a train.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:27.740
"Tom's pap had helped him start his
train and all would have been fine,

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:32.180
had not for rocket raising Cain,
blocked traffic on the line.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:37.630
It blew the engine into
scrap as in a fit of passion,

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.780
'who would've thought
that toy,' said pap,

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.890
'would blow up in such fashion.'"

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:47.510
&gt;&gt; It came up through
the floor, didn't it?

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:52.040
It did. "Orlando Pease,
quite at his ease,

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.220
the 'Morning Star' was reading,
'my dear,' he said to Mrs. Pease,

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.420
'here's a report worth heeding.'

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:03.410
Then the rocket, in a wanton sport
flashed through the printed pages,

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:06.290
the lady gasped, 'a wild report!'

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:09.970
then swooned by easy stages."

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:14.430
That's funny.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:18.710
He's reading the newspaper and
it came right through, didn't it?

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:24.430
&gt;&gt; Crazy. "Doc Danby was a stupid
guy, so at lest he slept too late,

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:28.200
he placed a tattoo clock
nearby to waken him at eight.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.480 position:56%
But, ah, the rocket smote that clock

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.930
and smashed its way
clean through it.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:37.080
'You have a fine alarm,' said
Doc, 'but say, you overdo it!'"

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.450
&gt;&gt; His clock got exploded,
didn't it?

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.210
That was funny.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:45.870
"The seventeenth flat.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.230
A penny liner, Abram Stout,
was writing a description.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:54.680
The flames shot up and he pounded
out, then threw a mild conniption.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:59.140
For through his Flemington there
shied a rocket, hot and mystic.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.210
'I didn't mean to be,' he cried,

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:06.630
'so deuced realistic!'" It
exploded his typewriter.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:07.990
Do you guys know what
a typewriter is?

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:11.970
Cool. That's cool.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.910
&gt;&gt; "Eighteenth flat.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:20.150
Gus Gummer long had set his head
upon some strange invention.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:24.920 position:56%
'Be careful, Gus,' his good wife
said, 'it might explode, I mention.'

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:29.210
Just then the pesky rocket flared
and wrecked that Yankee notion.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.380
'I feared as much,'
his wife declared,

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:35.360
then fainted from emotion."

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.050
&gt;&gt; "And the rocket made all the
way up to nineteen while Burt was

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:43.870
on his hobby horse and riding
it like mad, the rocket,

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:47.600
on its fiery course,
upset the startled lad.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.100
The frightened pony plunged
a lot, like Fury playing tag.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.400
'Whoa, Spot!'

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.070 position:56%
said Burt, 'Who would've thought you

00:23:55.070 --> 00:24:01.200
such a fiery nag!'" Have you
ever sat on a rocking horse?

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.900
Have you sat on one of those?

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:16.680
&gt;&gt; "A taxidermist plied his
trade upon a walrus head.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.950
It really made him quite afraid
to meet its stare so dread.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:29.470
When suddenly the rocket, bright,
flared up and then was off.

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:31.000
'Oh, Minnie,' cried
the man in fright,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.300
'just hear that walrus cough.'"

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.720
&gt;&gt; That's kind of weird, huh?

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:39.820
Yeah. It was like a
stuffed walrus, wasn't it?

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.800
And this is the very top floor.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.570
The rocket made it all the way to
the top of the apartment building.

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:49.450
"Oh, it was just a splendid
flight, that rocket's wild career,

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:54.720
but to an end it came all right,
as you shall straightaway hear.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.920
It plunged into a can of cream
that Billy Bunk was freezing,

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:07.390
and froze quite stiff as it would
seem and so subsided, wheezing."

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:12.700
It landed in an ice cream maker.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.280
Have you guys ever
made ice cream before?

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.210
Yeah? Did you try to make ice
cream with the snow, by the way?

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:20.810
Did you? Isn't that fun?

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.110
That's fun.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:26.550
And see, at the very,
very end of this book,

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:29.870
we get to learn a little
bit more about the book

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.670
and it's exactly what Ms.
Jackie told you earlier

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:36.510 position:56%
about how old the book is and who
wrote it and all that information is

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.400
at the very back of the book.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.500
So what did you think?

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.790
Is that kind of clever?

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:47.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.460
That sounds great.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.760
That sounds great.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.090
So Jackie, do you want to come and
talk to us about the other books

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:59.730
that you brought that
are also available?

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:02.830
You guys are very good
listeners, by the way.

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:04.130
&gt;&gt; They are.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.430
&gt;&gt; That was terrific.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.160
&gt;&gt; My favorite audience.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.760
Which one should we go with?

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.060
How about the "Gobolinks?"

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.360
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:17.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Okay. This book is one of a kind.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:20.180
I've never seen another
book quite like this.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.970
It was made in 1896.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.150
Oh, thank you.

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.350
That makes life much easier.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:31.700
And the "Gobolinks"
book is actually a game.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.180
You get a bunch of people together
like this whole group here,

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:41.200
or even a group of adults, and
you'd make pictures with ink blots.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:47.880 position:56%
And then the group would decide what
they thought those ink blots were,

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.820
and they'd write a
little poem about it.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:53.160
I know. It's hard to think of.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.460
Now here we go.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.880
See those guys at the top?

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.040
What do you think that is?

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.560
It just came from an ink blot.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.830
Yeah. What kind of birds
do you think that is?

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:08.630
Is it a certain kind of bird?

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.300
You think it's a bluejay?

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.600
That's very good.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.900
What about you?

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.400
Do you think it's a certain kind
of bird or an imaginary bird?

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.800
An imaginary bird.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.240
Well, this group decided
it was two chickens

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.830
and then they wrote a
little poem about it.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.710
You want to hear the little poem?

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:30.020
It says, "They stayed at home.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:34.250
These chickens long debated
on a costume for a ball,

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:38.420
and became so much elated
that they didn't go at all."

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:44.140
Now what about these little,
on the bottom of the page.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.310
What do you think those are?

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:51.200
Do they look like chickens, too?

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.870
They look kind of mad, don't they?

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.450
&gt;&gt; They look like roosters.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:55.750
&gt;&gt; They look like roosters.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.050
They look like roosters.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:58.350
Maybe they look like
they're fighting?

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.040 position:56%
Do you want to hear the little poem?

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.250
Okay. It says, "The
Unfriendly Chickens.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:10.130
The saucy chicks, which here you
see, know neither wrong nor right.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:14.780
They can't be good like you and
me, who sometimes really do agree.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.590
So all day long they fight."

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:21.950
So this would be a funny
game to play, wouldn't it?

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.200
Finding out what the designs
are -- making the design,

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:33.210
deciding what it is, and then
-- and then making a story.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.530
And they don't have
to be real things.

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.680
They can be imaginary.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.280
So see that one --
this one right here?

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.000
They decided to call
it a "Dipsy Doodle."

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.240
What's a dipsy doodle?

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.540
I don't know.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.840
They just made it up.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.570
It says, "Dipsy doodle.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:55.810
This little dipsy doodle sometimes
called the Great Kadoodle.

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:58.610
And the next one they
say is his relative.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.200
"This is Dipsy Doodle's brother.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.470
They have ears like one another."

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.000
Do you think they have
ears like one another?

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.250
These little imaginary creatures?

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:11.230
&gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you, Jackie.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:14.480
We hope you come back,
because we have some

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.780
of the other books to show you.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:23.170
And maybe Jackie will do another
talk with some other books as well.

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:26.020
So thank you from the
Smithsonian Learning Center,

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.760
and we hope to see
you again soon, okay?

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:35.120
&gt;&gt; We suspect -- I'm going
to move so we're still there.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.830
We suspected that some of
you might have some questions

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:42.020
about the collaboration between
the library and Cricket Media

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.230
and getting these children's books

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:47.580
from the library's collection
available through the Storybug app.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:52.110
And so Katya Andresen, who is
the CEO of Cricket Media is here

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.800
as well, and I'll just kind

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.440
of describe how this
kind of came to be.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:59.900
&gt;&gt; The library has
known Cricket Media

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.880
and their publications
well for quite some time.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:06.280
Cricket Media is the parent company
to publications like Cobblestone

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.010
and Calliope and Ladybug
and Babybug and others.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:14.360
And for many years, colleagues
at the library, including members

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.770
of my team and myself, have
written articles for publications

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.930
that are published
through Cricket Media.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.380
And about a year ago,
Katya and I met,

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.500 position:56%
and we were doing some brainstorming
about other things that were going

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.920
on at the library, and I mentioned

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.740
that the library had been
digitizing a number of books

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.840
and they were available
through the library's website,

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.180
and they were also
available through Read.gov,

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.940
and available through the
library's Flickr site,

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:43.370
and that there's some
marvelous books.

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:46.550
And it's such a shame that
they're no longer in print,

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:51.340
because they're rare children's
books and rarely do three, four,

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.950
and five-year-olds
have an opportunity

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:54.260
to see those original books

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.550
in the library's collection unless
they come to an event like this.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.760
And take it from there.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.410
&gt;&gt; Well, so really, this is
Lee Ann's wonderful idea,

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:04.860
but the only thing better

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.910
than making rare books available
more broadly digitally is

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:11.090
to introduce the joy of reading
them with someone else together.

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:14.670 position:56%
And so that was sort of the
genesis of the idea is we had worked

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.540
on this technology that
you just saw in action.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.580
That was the best demo
ever, by the way.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.900
&gt;&gt; It was awesome.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.790
&gt;&gt; Fantastic.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:24.600
They were fantastic.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.010
Because to really open up
the books to the world,

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:28.930
we want to encourage people
to read them together,

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:30.810
and read them with
their grandparents,

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.050
and read them with their
mommies on a business trip,

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.880
or read them however far
flung their family is.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.470
And it's been an absolute honor for
us at Cricket and my colleagues,

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.330
Maggie Hatfield and
Stephanie Hoaglund.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:45.000
It has been such a pleasure
putting together this partnership

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.840
and putting these books out and
making them freely available.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.740
And we're just honored and
happy to advance the mission

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.430
of spreading the joy of reading.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:54.730
&gt;&gt; And that's what we're about.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.450 position:56%
So if you have questions, fire away.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:01.740
&gt;&gt; Does the app itself have the
FaceTime interface within it so --

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.040
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.340
&gt;&gt; So in other words, phone number,

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.890
so you're not using two
apps, just a single one.

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:09.570
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:10.870
&gt;&gt; But you need iOS --

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:14.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is an iOS app, although
we're hoping to bring it to Android.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.780 position:56%
But you can do it on an iPhone, too.

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:20.340
You don't have to have a tablet.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:23.260
So when I read books with my
daughter, she does it on her phone.

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.560
&gt;&gt; That's very cool.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.010
Now and we were just saying as the
children were putting on their hats

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:32.130
and gloves that -- how
great it would be not

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:34.430
that you ever want a child
to have to take a sick day,

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:36.590
but if one of their
friends was at home sick

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:40.350
and they had a regularly
scheduled story time at school,

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.760
there's no reason why that
story time couldn't happen

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.150
and involve the child from home.

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:45.450
&gt;&gt; That's a good idea.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:46.750
&gt;&gt; And I just think
that's great, too.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.050
&gt;&gt; Great idea.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:49.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And, of course, I can see so many
applications and I can't agree more.

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:53.140
I mean, my parents used to read
books to my kids over the phone,

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.170
and my kids are only 13 and 16,

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.550
so it's not like it was a million
years ago, but the technology

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:00.320
of even FaceTime wasn't there yet.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.640
And this is very fun.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.030
&gt;&gt; We also have a feature where you
can record yourself reading a book.

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:09.960
So if you can't reach
each other at a good time,

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.050
that when the child's going
to bed they can open it up

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.770
and hear the recording of
someone reading it to them.

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:16.070
&gt;&gt; Very cool.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:17.370
And the app is free.

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:18.670
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:19.970
&gt;&gt; And all of the books
from the library are free.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:21.270
&gt;&gt; They're all free.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:22.570
&gt;&gt; So we're excited about this.

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:28.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Up to what age does this go, will
the books go, for kids of what age?

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.660
&gt;&gt; So we find the books up
to any age you're reading

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.000
to your children, zero to nine.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.300
I'd say the sweet spot

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.530
for the library we have
in there is zero to six.

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.150
&gt;&gt; Good question.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.450
Anybody else?

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.750
Yeah.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:42.910
&gt;&gt; How many of the library's books
do you have through your app?

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:44.210
&gt;&gt; So, so far we have four.

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:45.510
We would love to do more.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:49.040
We have The Rocket
Book, the Slant Book,

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.510
the Nursery Rhymes, and Gobolinks.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:53.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:56.340
&gt;&gt; You did some work on
Gobolinks, didn't you?

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.430
I mean those illustrations
were colored

00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:59.790
when they were up on the screen.

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:03.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we did a little bit
of modification with approval.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:07.670
Just to make them pop a little
bit more in the digital format.

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:09.420
&gt;&gt; And so you would need to
do that, there would have

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.170
to be some reconfiguration --

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.470
&gt;&gt; A little bit.

00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:13.770
&gt;&gt; Digitize content.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:15.940
&gt;&gt; Right. We had to
do a little bit, yeah.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.550
&gt;&gt; What's your process of deciding?

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:20.630
Because we're digitizing
quite a bit more

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:25.250
of that early reader collection,
so what is your decision process

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:28.940
around which ones you put on
the app and which you wouldn't?

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.030
&gt;&gt; Well we would love the
perspective of The Library

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:35.470
of Congress on that, which are
most meaningful historically,

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:38.810
then we would look at the criteria
of which translate well to digital

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.380
and then which ones
we think would be

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:44.650
of highest interest
to our young readers.

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:47.860
We've chose ones that were sort of
wildly imaginative and creative,

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.160
which is sort of what we like to do

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:53.030
at Cricket Media with
all of our stories.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:59.010
&gt;&gt; And also we had a team at
Outreach, YRC, Rare Books,

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:02.510
Children's Literature
Center, who worked together

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:10.340
to review both the text, because
there were some adaptations to --

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.370
&gt;&gt; And we wanted to make
sure that the descriptions

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:15.960
about the books included all of
the information we would include

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.450
in a regular citation,
so that if people wanted

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:22.600
to see what the original looked
like, they would know where to go

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.410
on the library's website to
get that for that very reason.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.710
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.010
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:34.690
&gt;&gt; And then we also reviewed the
illustrations and the changes.

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:35.990
So it was [inaudible].

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:37.290
&gt;&gt; Very good.

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:40.010
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] most of the
books you've got are books

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:43.920
that Cricket has [inaudible]
authors.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.810
Are there any other [inaudible]
books you're working with?

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:49.110
&gt;&gt; No, right now it's all of our --

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:53.720
we have an archive of about
150,000 stories and illustrations,

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.850
so it's compilations
from our archive.

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:59.180
This is our first partnership,
but we're very excited about it

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:02.840
and would really like to expand
it, because it's wonderful

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.960
to make available things
that people would not get

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.260
to read in any other way.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.120
And if that's something
special we can do with this app,

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.500
we really want to do that.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:13.550
&gt;&gt; Do you imagine making your
magazines available on the app?

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Well, a lot of the stories in the
magazines are in the app and some

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:20.210
of the magazines are, too, like
Babybug for the youngest children

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:26.840 position:56%
who enjoy being read to, so the ones
for zero to three and three to six.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.360
&gt;&gt; Anybody else?

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.800
Well, then I need to
do some thank yous.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.690
So thank you to Stephen Wesson
who helped out in the back room.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.460
Thank you to our two
teachers in residence

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:39.590
who are here asking great
questions and smiling at cute kids.

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:45.160
And to Kahin and to Karen and to
Jackie and to Sean and to our team

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.160
that was here doing the multimedia
recording and really you guys.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.460
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.760
It was a lot of fun.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.060
&gt;&gt; Thank you all.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.360
Thanks for being here.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:58.070
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
