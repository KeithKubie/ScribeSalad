&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.090
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Hello, everyone and welcome

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.080
and thanks for making it.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.330
Is it, okay.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.080
I'm Betsy Peterson, the director of
the American Folklife Center here

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.360
at the Library of Congress
and I want to welcome you

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.320
to the latest presentation in the
Botkin [phonetic] lecture series.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.220
The Botkin series allows
the American Folklife Center

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.020
to present the latest
scholarship, the best scholarship

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.300
in the disciplines of folklore,
ethnomusicology, oral history,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.470
cultural heritage, and
other cultural studies.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.820
It also allows us the opportunity
to enhance our collections.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.370
Each of these lectures
are videotaped.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.290
They do make their
way into our archive

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.010 position:56%
and eventually make their way up
onto our website so that individuals

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.110
around the world can hear
and learn from these lectures

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.220
and future generations
can hear as well.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.290
So if you have a device turned
on, a cell phone, etcetera,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.940
etcetera, please turn it off now.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.250
And today it is my pleasure to
introduce a multitalented writer,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.460
critic musician, Elijah Wald.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.410
Dr. Wald, I should say, is
originally from the Boston area

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.270
and he began his career
as a folk blues guitarist,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.440
and he did well traveling
the world and being abroad

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.700
for roughly a decade fronting
a blues band in Seville, Spain,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.530
a swing trio in Antwerp,
and a rock band in Colombo,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.520
Sri Lanka before returning
to the United States

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.830
to continue his music here.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.570
He's released two solo
albums, played on as a musician

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.940
on numerous others, and still
remains active as a musician.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.480
But as I think many of us
know, Elijah has another life

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.040
and he is equally well-known as
a writer, critic, and scholar,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.570
and it is in this capacity
that he is joining us today.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.420
Since the 1980's Elijah has gained
wide renowned as a writer on roots

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.520 position:56%
and world music and he's written for
numerous newspapers and magazines,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.870
most notably the Boston Globe where
he published over a 1,000 articles

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.110
until he left the paper in 2000.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.610
He has also authored more than
a dozen influential books,

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.010
and I'll just name a couple here,
Escaping the Delta, Robert Johnson

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.430
and the Invention of the Blues, How
the Beatles Destroyed Rock 'n Roll,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.390
An Alternative History of American
Popular Music, and Narcocorrido,

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.990
A Journey into the Music of Guns
-- Drugs, Guns, and Guerrillas.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.590
The Mayor of MacDougal Street
is a memoir that he co-authored

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.690
with Dave Van Rock, and it
served as the inspiration

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.780
for the Cohen brothers
movie Inside Llewyn Davis.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.080
And I must say it's
better than the movie.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.310
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.350
&gt;&gt; He has won a Grammy
award for the album notes

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.030
to The Arhoolie Records
40th Anniversary Box Set,

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.560
for which he was also
nominated as a producer.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.620
His other awards include
an ASCAP Deems Taylor award

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.420
and an honorable mention

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.720
for the American musicological
society's Otto Kinkelday award,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.390
my apologies.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.770
Elijah also holds an
interdisciplinary Ph.D.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.560
in ethnomusicology
and sociolinguistics,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.390
which I think is a fairly recent --

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.690
&gt;&gt; As of today.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.990
&gt;&gt; Degree, okay.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.290
Congratulations.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.640
And he has also taught
for several years

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.880
in the Musicology Department
at UCLA.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.750
So without further ado we're
delighted to have Elijah Wald

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.510
with us today and please
join me in welcoming Elijah.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.090
[ Applause ]

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.820
I should also say Elijah will
talk for roughly an hour.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.060
We'll have some questions
and that will be followed

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.050
by a book signing out in the lobby.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.790
And we hope you will go out
and buy one of the books.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.620
So take it away.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.000
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: Okay, I will
take it as far as I can.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.220
Okay, yeah.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.460
So I'm going to be
talking about Dylan,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.220
but I'm also more generally talking
a bit about how we do history.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:06.550
And I want to start by saying what
historians do is we tell stories.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.110 position:56%
For those of you who speak French or
Spanish it's in fact the same word,

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.010
[speaking foreign language]
history or story.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.450
And I think that's an
important point to make,

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.080
because history is not
what happened in the past.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.960 position:56%
History is the process of organizing
what we know about the past

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.530
into stories that are
relevant to us in the present.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.820
And what that means is
that history is not static,

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.450
it's constantly changing
because what's relevant to us

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.940
in the present is changing.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.160
And the Dylan story, we've all --

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.800
we all know the standard Dylan
story I suspect in this room.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.620
The standard story is he came
to New York as a folk singer

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.220
in very much Woody
Guthrie's tradition.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.130
He became the new young voice
of the folk protest movement.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.460
He then switched to writing more
poetic introspective lyrics,

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.720
which irritated a lot of
the people who loved him

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.150
as a folk protest singer,
and then at Newport

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.330
in 1965 he declared his
independence from the folk scene

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.490
and the boring old folkies
didn't understand and booed him.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.170
But he was an artist
and went his own way

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.470
and history has proved him right.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:30.080
Now I don't disagree with any
of that, but it is history

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.440
as it was written in a particular
moment in the second half

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.790
of the 1960's as part of announcing
the arrival of rock and roll

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.030
as a mature, serious art form.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.270 position:56%
And in that history, which has
remained the standard Dylan history,

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:52.160
he is first and foremost a
song writer, and indeed a poet.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.780
But what I'm going to be
talking about today is sort

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.320
of a different story because
I was on a different mission.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.970
My question was about Dylan's
choice to go electric at Newport,

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.650
and that's not a decision made as a
songwriter, that's a decision made

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.210
as a musician and performer.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.670
And once I started thinking
about, so okay, let's get away

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.530
from the songwriting and discuss
who Dylan was as a musician

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.780
and performer, I was immediately
struck by a sort of bizarre fact

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:29.210
in the Dylan story, which is the
way everyone talked about Dylan

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.580
when he first became known as,
well he's not a great singer,

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.890
he's not a great guitar player,
but he's such an incredible writer

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.360
that it surmounts all
of these weaknesses.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:47.190
But in 1961 Dylan became the
first young male folksinger

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.770
in Greenwich Village to ever get
a profile in the New York Times,

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.480
or to be ever signed by
a major record label,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.880
and at that point he had
only written two songs,

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.150
neither of which was particularly
interesting, and was signed

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:06.090
and written up as a musician and
performer, not as a songwriter.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.390
So if his strength was as a
songwriter and he was deficient

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.850
as a musician, how did that happen?

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.150
And also the way we
all hear the story is

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.640
at that point he was
a Woody Guthrie clone,

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.670
but the New York Times story
doesn't mention Woody Guthrie.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.480
It compares him to
Blind Lemon Jefferson,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.350
the Texas blues musician
from the 1920's.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:37.260
Now if that was right then the
story of Dylan deciding in 1965

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.990
to go electric with the Paul
Butterfield Blues Band sounds

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.510
like a completely different story.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.940
If we've got somebody who in 1961
was a Blind Lemon Jefferson style

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.800
blues singer and now he's teaming
up with the Butterfield Band.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:54.450
Now it's not quite
that simple, but --

00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:00.040
sorry, that wasn't supposed
to happen, but it did.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:08.040
In any case, this is Dylan with his
original band, The Golden Chords.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.540
You will notice the
ad of Monte Edwardson,

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.530 position:56%
Leroy Hoikkala, and Bobby Zimmerman.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:19.210
And what he sounded like at
that point was this [music].

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:27.510
But we need that to
be much, much louder.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:42.230
[ Music ]

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:46.620
His main instrument at that point
was piano rather than guitar,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.680
and he was planning
to be Little Richard.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:56.260
And the next thing in fact that
happens on that tape is an argument

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.070
between him and one of his friends,

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.640
because the friend is saying
nice things about Elvis Presley

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.430
and Dylan is saying, no, no,
you have to listen to real guys

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.850
who Elvis Presley imitated,
Clyde McPhatter

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.160
and Ray Charles and The Drifters.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.670
In fact, we can do the picture.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:18.050
Yes, the real guys
and the fake guys.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.830
You will notice that
there is a difference

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.920
between the real guys
and the fake guys.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.310
Like many teenagers, young
Bobby Zimmerman was trying

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.340
to define himself and that
concept of authenticity,

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.880
which regularly comes in in
the Dylan at Newport story.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.320
I'm just trying to make the point
he was in that concept already

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.150
at this point but in
a different world.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:49.260 position:56%
And that whole idea of authenticity,
what that's about is there are a few

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.800
of us who know the real
stuff, unlike that mass

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.180
of stupid people out
there who don't.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.080
And that's really the entire
discourse of authenticity.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.770
You can phrase it all
sorts of other ways,

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.710
but that's basically
what it's about.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.600
Dylan grew up in northern
Minnesota in a town

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.260 position:56%
with not a single African-American
resident, I have checked the census.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.840
And he discovered this secret
world of music that he could access

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.870
on the radio late at night coming
out of Shreveport, Louisiana.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.490
And knowing about that
music set him apart.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.500
And when he met anyone else who
knew about that music it was sort

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.540
of like they were members
of a secret club.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.580
Now that's not a new idea.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.790
It's one of the stock
cliches of rock history,

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:38.340
that there was this secret world
that young, specifically white,

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.350
specifically usually male listeners
were discovering late night

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.020
on the radio and that
that changed America.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.680
That cliche typically
connects this rebel music

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.160
with other rebel elements of
that period, and Dylan fits

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.300
that discourse perfectly.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.670
By the time I was a teenager
learning about all of this,

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:05.050 position:56%
that rock and roll, James Dean rebel
attitude was also often being linked

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.830
to the alienation of Jack
Kerouac and The Beats.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.490
But that's an anachronism.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.660
That link happened after Dylan.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:18.140
And Kerouac and The Beats
were not into rock and roll.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:23.270 position:56%
They came up in the 1940's listening
to modern jazz and classical music.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.920
Kerouac's writing is full of
references to Brahms, Beethoven,

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.750
Shostakovich, and Stravinsky.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:33.990
That is, they were rebels
but they were grown-ups

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.880 position:56%
and they listened to grown-up music.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:44.710
And in the '50s and early '60s rock
and roll was not grown-up music.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.330
If you were in favor of it you were
saying it was fun, it was exciting,

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:54.530 position:56%
it was energetic, but it was music
for kids and poor uneducated people.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.770
Even people who liked
rock took it for granted.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.700
This is one the fascinating
things you find reading people,

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.050
reading interviews in this
period, took it for granted

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.570
that if they went to college
they would start listening

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.140
to more mature kinds of music.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:14.900
And classical and jazz
were the most familiar.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.540
And by the late '50s folk
music had joined them.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:23.770
And indeed by the 1960 when Dylan
moved to Minneapolis and started

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:29.120
at the university there, folk music
had become the defining collegiate

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.970
style thanks to the Kingston
Trio and the dozens of groups

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.650
that followed in their wake.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:39.850
Now it may sound a little strange
for me to talk about modern jazz

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.730
and folk music overlapping,
but that in fact was a reality.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.640
I mean a typical record collection

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.370
that had the Kingston Trio
would also have Dave Brubeck

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.550
and very likely Miles Davis.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:55.210
And in fact one of the interesting
facts of American music history is

00:13:55.210 --> 00:14:00.480 position:56%
that the Kingston Trio actually made
their east coast debut in New York

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.730
and the Village Vanguard on a
double bill with Thelonious Monk.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.450 position:56%
They did two weeks as a double bill.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:12.400
That is the Kingston Trio were
fun, but they were the fun music

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.520
that the smart kids listened to.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.690
And the Newport Folk Festival
fits perfectly in this.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.180
It was an offshoot of the
Newport Jazz Festival.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.520
It was in fact originally
planned as an afternoon

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.340
at the Newport Jazz
Festival and then sort

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.520
of became its own festival.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.240 position:56%
So when Dylan went off to college he
was following an absolutely normal

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:37.530
transition going into folk music,
but as somebody who had been an R

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.390
and B purist who didn't like white
rock and roll, it's interesting

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:45.600
to notice that if you read
Dylan's description of this period,

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.050
the artists who first got him
into folk music is this list.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.550
And if you look at his repertoire
that's who he is singing,

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.370
he's singing Odetta and
Leon Bibb principally.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.780
And it may just be coincidental,
but in that context it's sort

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:04.350
of interesting that the first Woody
Guthrie album he mentions ever

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.820
having, this was the cover.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.150
I don't want to make
too much of that,

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.100
but I'm just -- it's interesting.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.570
Now when he discovered Woody
Guthrie and Ramblin Jack Elliott,

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.180
he did change his style profoundly

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.520
and he got very much
into sounding like that.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.980
But again, this story has often
been told in a particular way

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.420
with him becoming the next
songwriter after Woody.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.550
So I'd want to point
out that this record,

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.870
which was the first Woody
Guthrie record he had,

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.660
and which in the Minneapolis
crowd was described

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:42.640
as Woody Guthrie's greatest work,
has only one original song on it.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.660
Woody Guthrie was being
heard in this world

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:52.320
as an authentic folk voice
singing old folk songs.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:57.210
Likewise, Jack Elliott normally
comes into this story as a link

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:01.930
to Woody Guthrie, but Jack
Elliott sang a lot of other stuff.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:06.610
And the stuff that you most
profoundly hear Jack's influence

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.950
on Dylan is stuff like this.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.980
No, that's not the track [music].

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.450
Sorry, that was that.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.250
Here we go.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:34.000
[ Music ]

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.290
That's actually Dylan, but it might

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.570
as well be Ramblin
Jack it's so close.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.390
And that's what Dylan sounded

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.130
like when he arrived
in Greenwich Village.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.810
That song is by Jesse Fuller,
a black blues performer,

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.800
but virtually everyone
in the folk scene

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.300
in that period got it
through Jack Elliott.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.190
And Dylan came to New York
to visit Woody Guthrie,

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:58.540
who by then was his hero.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:02.210
Again, this is a story that's
a little more complicated

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:07.940
than it's normally told, because
his huge devotion to Woody Guthrie,

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.160
the music was part of
it, but a huge part

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.350
of it was having read
Bound for Glory.

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:17.250
And I can speak for myself on
this one for an awful lot of us,

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:21.570 position:56%
Woody Guthrie more than anything
else was the character Woody Guthrie

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:25.650
created for himself in Bound
for Glory, and Dylan showed

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:28.720
up in Greenwich Village
playing blues,

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.680
playing some of Woody's songs,

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:35.130
but profoundly he showed
up being Woody Guthrie.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:42.040
He showed up as an orphan from the
western plains who had left home

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:47.930
when he was 13 and bummed around
the country playing in carnivals

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:53.340
and burlesque houses and bars
and had picked up his music

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.420
from people he had
met along the way.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:59.810 position:56%
The character in Bound for Glory,
as he put it in his first interview,

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:04.500
I sing old jazz songs,
sentimental cowboy songs,

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.840
top 40 hit parade stuff, people
have to name it something

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.640
so they call it folk music.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.610
And that's a really interesting
statement because he's already,

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:20.450
at that moment in 1960,
setting himself apart

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:24.830
from the young urban kids on
the folk scene who are trying

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.650
to sing this music of the folk.

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.900
He's being a folk who
sings all kinds of music.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:37.080
And that's something I had
completely misunderstood.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.650
Or rather, it's something
I never paid attention

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:44.990
to because I'd already absorbed the
idea of him as part of this world

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.550
of the urban people who
were playing the folk music.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.370
And what changed my whole
picture of who Dylan was,

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.380
was talking to Peter Stampfel.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.240
I don't know how many
of you know this name.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:59.790
He is a crazed druggie,
brilliant, wonderful human being

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.540
who had a band called the Holy
Modal Rounders and later the Fugs,

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.530
and he and Dylan and Jim
Kweskin actually worked some

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:11.020
as a trio back in that first year.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:17.670
And when I asked him about when he
first saw Dylan he said it changed

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:24.260
his life, because Dylan was playing
hillbilly music like it was rock

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.580
and roll, and Peter had always
thought that the two great loves

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.770
of his life, rock and
roll and hillbilly music,

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.260
were completely separate worlds
and here was somebody proving

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.830
that they could be the same thing.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.470
When I heard that it made
no sense whatsoever to me.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.770
I had heard early Dylan.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:48.050
It didn't sound at all like rock
and roll, but Peter is a genius

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:50.750
so Dave Van Rock, my mentor,

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:55.060
famously said Peter Stampfel is
undoubtedly some kind of genius,

00:19:55.060 --> 00:20:02.480
just nobody has yet figured
out what kind, which is true.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.750
But anyway, so I went home and
grabbed Dylan's first album

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:09.510
and decided to listen through one
and God damn it, there it was.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:16.040
[ Music ]

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.340
Some of the younger people

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.280
in the room may not
instantly recognize that riff.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.510 position:56%
That's from the biggest hit of 1958.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:36.880
[ Music ]

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.680
Which Dylan has repurposed.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:58.670
[ Music ]

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.830
So I thought, damn,
I've made a discovery.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.830
Then I read the liner notes.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:08.390
They say the diesel-tempoed
Highway 51 is

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.350
of a type sung by the
Everly Brothers.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:17.030
I read the rest of the liner
notes, they list Dylan's influences

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:21.450
as Woody Guthrie, Hank
Williams, Jelly Roll Morton,

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:25.530
Carl Perkins, and early
Elvis Presley.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:28.170
Now I've owned that
album for over 40 years.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.000
I never noticed that.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.560 position:56%
I've read those liner notes over and
over, so why didn't I notice that?

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:39.850
The answer was because I knew
when I first got that Dylan album

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:43.140
that he was a folkie in
a scene that hated rock

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.480
and roll and hated Elvis Presley.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:50.380
So I simply glossed over that
as I read it over and over.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.560
But what if that wasn't true?

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:57.420
What if Columbia Records and
Bob Dylan were listing his links

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.690
to Elvis Presley on
that first album,

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:04.360
because that in fact was something
that would make him more appealing?

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:09.830
That doesn't fit the
standard Dylan story at all.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:14.490
And it sounds crazy to all of
us who heard this first album

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:18.210
as the precursor to Freewheelin
and The Times They Are a Changin.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.860
But now I'd like to
do a little question.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.590
How many of you own Dylan's
first album, this album?

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.760
Okay, hold -- keep your
hands up for a second.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:31.270
How many of you was that the
first Dylan album you had?

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:35.660
There you go, virtually
all the hands went down.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:41.780 position:56%
We all went back to this album
after we already had heard the Dylan

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.430
of The Times They Are A
Changin and Freewheelin.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:49.250
And so we had this story
that he had done that

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:51.320
and then he did Freewheelin
and this was Dylan.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.110
But in fact Freewheeling
wasn't the next thing

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.270
that Dylan did after this album.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:03.510
The next thing Dylan did after this
album in January of 1962 was this.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:15.430
[ Music ]

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.400
Stop that.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.200
Go away.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:25.820
[ Music ]

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:33.810
Okay, so if Dylan sounded like that
in 1962 why the hell was it news

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.540
that he went electric in 1965?

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.250
The answer is, nobody
heard that single,

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:43.480
and in fact nobody listened
to Dylan's first album.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:49.060
The way everybody discovered
Dylan was this record [music].

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.990
No, not that record, go away.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.350
What the hell was --
what the hell is that?

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.180
That was really weird.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.510
This record.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:26.040
[ Music ]

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:31.700
That was how virtually
everybody discovered Bob Dylan.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.100
And by the time we heard him
we already knew he played

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.140
that kind of music.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:41.210
He had a lousy voice compared
to Peter, Paul, and Mary,

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:45.130
but it was that kind of stuff.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:48.940
It was called folk music,
but it didn't sound a lot

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.770
like Woody Guthrie or Ramblin
Jack Elliott or Dave Van Rock

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:57.780
or Blind Lemon Jefferson or
God knows, Elvis Presley.

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.510
What it sounded like was a record

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:04.710
that had been the number one hit
a dozen years earlier, of 1950,

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.930
a record that sounded like this.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.510
Let's see if this time
it sounds less squeaky.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:40.520
[ Music ]

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:45.990
So that's the huge hit of
1950, and that's The Weavers,

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:49.760
and the guy sitting on the floor
playing a banjo is Pete Seeger.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:54.950
Now we tend to hear Seeger's story
told in a particular way as well.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:58.900
He was a political folksinger,
a friend of Woody Guthrie,

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.370
together they formed a
political folk singing group

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.450
in the early 1940's
called The Almanac Singers.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:08.690
Then 1950 he formed The Weavers.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.520
They were blacklisted.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.480
He bravely stood up to [inaudible],

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.060
the House on American
Activities Committee.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:19.410
And by the 1960's he was the
grand old man of the folk scene.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:23.060
In the Dylan story he's the
guy who tried to grab an axe

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.980
and cut the cable when Dylan
went electric at New Port.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:33.160
So it's a bit surprising to
hear that lush pop orchestration

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:37.100
on Goodnight Irene, which many
of us had forgotten existed,

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:41.290
and to introduce Pete Seeger as
somebody who got number one hits

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.800
and founded the pop folk style.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.520
But Pete Seeger was
a complicated guy.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.730
In 1950 when that record
hit he was 31 years old

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:56.930
and still virtually unknown except
to folk music and folk dance fans

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:58.900
around Greenwich Village.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.340
In fact, the year that he hit
with The Weavers was also the year

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:08.210
that his first ever solo album
appeared, it was this record,

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:14.340
and this record is extremely
important historically,

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:17.060
though it has largely
been forgotten.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:22.950 position:56%
This was the first time ever that
an urban educated musician attempted

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.200
to present folksongs the way
they were actually played

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.130
in rural communities.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:33.040
Up until this time all the
people popularizing folk music

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.030
for urban audiences
had been changing it,

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:40.290
adapting it to fit the habits of
people who were used to listening

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:43.420
to classical and pop music.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:49.030
And very much the way The Weavers
approach, the Joan Baez approach,

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:52.800
the Peter, Paul, and Mary
approach, but Pete had written

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.560
and self-published an
instructional book on how

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.320
to play southern mountain
banjo styles,

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.500
and his solo album was a
showcase for his belief

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:06.450
that traditional rural music
was not just raw material,

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:10.410
that you could take and
turn into concert music,

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:14.570
but in fact was a fully
achieved art created by important

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:17.220
and often virtuosic artists.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.480
And that sounded very,
very different

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.820
from the smooth harmonies
of The Weavers.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.510
The way this record
sounded was like this.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:48.150
[ Music ]

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:52.910
And this set off a revolution, a
whole generation of young players,

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.930
Tom Paley notably among them,
the New Law City Ramblers,

00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:05.050 position:56%
Dave Van Rock, who dubbed this group
the neo ethnics, started trying

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:10.250
to play this music
authentically, not like Burl Ives

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.160
or Richard Dyer Bennett
or Susan Reed,

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:19.650
but the way people actually played
it down south where it came from.

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.910
And Pete very much was
a hero for this world,

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:25.110
and he very much fitted that.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:29.960
I mean, he was a man who had just
built his own log cabin house,

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.710
cutting down the trees
on his own land.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.600
I mean, he was very much
trying to sort of live this

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.850
in a lot of different ways.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:41.720
And for him that was very much
connected to his politics,

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.250
to populism, communism, democracy.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:49.780
The idea that folk artists were
not primitives, they were just

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:54.050
as important, intelligent,
mature, valuable,

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:56.000
virtuosic as concert artists.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:06.490
I just -- I cut a moment out
of this talk and I just want

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:07.790
to see where I end up next.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:10.920
Okay, now I know, yeah.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:16.910
And the thing is, the way Pete
Seeger first heard folk music was

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:20.830
his father took him down to
the Asheville Folk Festival,

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:24.940
and he was in love with the
music, but also he was entranced

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:29.060
by the way the music seemed to fit
into the community and it seemed

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:32.150
to represent the lives of
the people who was making it.

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:34.320
And he had this idea of this music

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.660
as being inseparable
from the community.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:41.580
And one of his great missions
was to encourage people

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.260
to make their own music
in their own communities,

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.630
rather than just consuming
music made by professionals,

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:52.480
including professionals who
might be marketed as folksingers.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.290
And that's one of the things
that's really easy to misunderstand

00:30:55.290 --> 00:31:00.630
about Pete Seeger, that for him a
bunch of people getting together

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:06.030
to play string quartets or
to sing doo-wop was as much

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:09.220
or more his mission than
people going and sitting

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:13.120
in a concert watching someone
on stage singing Barbara Allen.

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:20.710
Anyway, this brings us to
the Newport Folk Festival.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.430
The first two Newport
Folk Festivals in 1959

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:27.750
and 1960 were basically
just big concerts.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:29.710
They were like the
Newport Jazz Festival.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.010
They were mostly made

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:34.590
up of professional performers
from the New York area.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:39.430
But in 1960 Pete Seeger
did something interesting.

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:43.680
He requested George Wein, the
producer of the festivals,

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:49.440
to not pay him and to use the money
saved by not paying him to bring

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.900
down Jean Carignan, a
French-Canadian fiddler.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.880
And driving back from that
festival Toshi Seeger, Pete's wife,

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.000
had the idea what could you do

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.700
if you could persuade
all the stars to do that?

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:07.530
And in 1963 they sat
down with George Wein

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.300
and designed a festival
on that principle.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.920
The idea of the Newport
Folk Festivals from '63 on,

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:18.560
which everybody got
$50, known or unknown,

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.060
and because they had
some heavyweights

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.540
like Pete Seeger behind it, people
like Pete Seeger, Joan Baez,

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:28.970 position:56%
The [inaudible], Theodore Bikel,
Peter, Paul, and Mary agreed to work

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:31.310
for $50 a day, which meant

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.770
that there was all the extra
money you could use to bring

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:39.010
in unknown performers like Doc
Watson, Mississippi John Hurt,

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.740
neither of those names anybody new

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.920
until they appeared
at Newport in 1963.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.690
Bill Munro, John Lee
Hooker, who were known

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:48.010
within their own communities

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:51.070
but had never been presented
to folk music audiences.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:54.900
The first Cajun band ever
presented outside rural Louisiana.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.670 position:56%
This all happened at Newport in '63,

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:02.920
and also some unknown new
young faces like Judy Collins

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.000
and Tom Paxton and Bob Dylan.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.310
And there was some explicitly
political singers who were

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:14.900
at Newport, but again, this is
something that I had misunderstood,

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.340
because one of the other things
Pete Seeger did in this period,

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:23.220
he cofounded a newsletter called
Broadside Magazine in New York

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.700
and a lot of young songwriters,

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.230
including Bob Dylan started
writing a lot of political songs

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:30.510
to get published in Broadside.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.320
And because histories
of the folk scene tend

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.900
to be very New York centric,
and to a degree Dylan centric,

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.100
when we talk about protest music
in the '60s there's a tendency

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:47.470
to immediately think of Bob Dylan
and Phil Ochs and Tom Paxton.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:52.530
But in Pete Seeger's mind, when
he wanted to bring protest music

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:58.460
to Newport in 1963, that was
not what he was thinking about.

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:03.300
This is Pete Seeger doing a song --
doing the introduction at Newport

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:07.510
in '63 to the political group.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:37.510
[ Inaudible ]

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:44.510
[ Applause ]

00:34:44.510 --> 00:35:06.350
[ Music ]

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:09.340
Yeah, and the iconic moment

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:15.180
of that festival was the
grand finale on Friday night.

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.940
And that's a picture that it's
easy to misread in retrospect.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:23.240
But what that picture is,
is you have the young stars

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.920
of the folk scene over here, Peter,
Paul, and Mary and Joan Baez,

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:31.060
and the grand old men of the folk
scene over on the other side,

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:34.040
Pete Seeger and Theodore
Bikel, fresh off starring

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.060
in the Broadway run
of the Sound of Music.

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:42.500
And in the middle you have the
unknown young figures representing

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:47.960
the voice of young America, Bob
Dylan and The Freedom Singers.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.090
And they're linking
arms and singing Blowing

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:53.010
in the Wind and We Shall Overcome.

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:57.120
And that was the image of
protest at that moment.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.070
The big issue of 1963
was civil rights.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:04.340
And when Dylan became
associated with protest songs

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:07.410
that was the association he had
written Blowing in the Wind,

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:10.010
which was heard by a lot of
people up north as an anthem

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:16.410
of the civil rights movement, and
a month later in August 1963 he

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:18.230
and Joan Baez appeared at the march

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:21.910
on Washington with
Martin Luther King.

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:27.660
Now my time is limited, so I'm
going to now make a lateral jump

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.050
across the Atlantic to England.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:35.460
In England the world had
looked very different

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.540
in the 1950's and into
the early '60s.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.700
England was still recovering
from World War II.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.820
World War II had been great
for the United States.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.140
The U.S. had come out
the strongest, richest,

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.860
healthiest country in the world.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.630
England had been bombed
to smithereens.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:50.930
It was dark.

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:52.230
It was cold.

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:53.530
It was miserable.

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:54.830
There was no work.

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.130
Everything was rationed.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:01.670
And the United States looked
very bright and exciting and fun,

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:05.730
Hollywood movies, the
music, all of that.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:10.660
And it was this huge romantic
attraction to everything American

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.630
for young people in England.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:17.000
And one result of that was they
weren't drawing all the lines

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.840
between different kinds of American
culture that we drew over here.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:27.380 position:56%
So, for example, the banjo player of
Ken Collier's New Orleans jazz band,

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.580
a guy named Lonnie Donegan,

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.150
was on the brakes playing
Woody Guthrie songs.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.930 position:56%
This was not something that happened

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:37.370
at jazz concerts in
the United States.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:42.250
But weirdly enough, he
proceeded to get a hit

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:47.010
with Leadbelly's Rock Island Line
that also went top 10 over here

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:50.310
and started a whole style
of music called skiffle,

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:54.220
and a whole generation of young
Englishmen started playing skiffle

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.270
music, and that included teenagers,

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:59.200
who a few years later were
forming groups like The Beatles

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.860
and The Rolling Stones
and Led Zeppelin.

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:07.290
There's a wonderful YouTube
video of Jimmy Page at age 14

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:11.030
with his skiffle group explaining
to the interviewer that he wants

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:13.850
to grow up to do biomedical
research.

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:16.270
I really recommend this.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:19.970
And they were playing American
hillbilly and blues songs

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:22.650
and listening to Ramblin Jack
Elliott and Woody Guthrie

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.110
and the Memphis Jug Band,
if they could get it,

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:29.870
but also to the electric blues
of Muddy Waters, Chris Barber,

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:32.850
the trombone player
in Ken Collier's band.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:35.370
Oh, I see, you can't
see Lonnie Donegan.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:37.890
He's not worth seeing anyway.

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:42.620
Ken Collier brought Muddy Waters'
electric band over to England

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.470
and had them on double bills

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:47.340
with his New Orleans
traditional jazz group.

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:53.430
And Chuck Berry started coming over
to them as Chess Records music.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:55.360
I mean, The Rolling Stones
thought of Chuck Berry

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.920
and Muddy Waters as the same thing.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.440
It's that Chess Records thing.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.440
Over here that was
not the same thing.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:07.400
And by 1963 they were
listening to Bob Dylan.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.380
And then this came back
across the Atlantic,

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.900
and suddenly the number one hit

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.180
in the United States is the Animals
doing House of the Rising Sun,

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.380
which they've learned off
Bob Dylan's first record,

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.660
which no one over here
had paid any attention to,

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.080
and we call this the
British invasion.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:28.750
There are all these British
rockers who were superstars

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:31.730
and they worshipped Bob Dylan.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:35.560
The Beatles, this was
-- in Melody Maker,

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.220
it's Britain's most
popular music newspaper,

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:41.030 position:56%
and the whole interview they're
saying yeah, we really think we need

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.800
to sound more like Bob Dylan
and be more like Bob Dylan.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.100
We love his attitude.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.920
He doesn't seem to
care about anything

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.120
and he just goes his own way.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:55.970
And British fans were also cutting
electric versions of Dylan hits.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:40:00.040
This one is one of the less
familiar and more wonderful ones.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.510
It's with Jimmy Page on guitar
by a group called The Fairies.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:30.690

&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: Now -- '64.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:39.380
Now that singing style makes
an other interesting link,

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:44.430
because another huge hit over
here in 1964, I've never seen,

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:47.380
even on the internet
they don't connect this

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:48.750
to Don't Think Twice It's Alright,

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:51.510
which is really weird,
because listen to it.

[ Music ]

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:49.680 position:56%
Next to Ring of Fire that was Johnny
Cash's biggest hit of the 1960's,

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.560
and it's just Don't
Think Twice It's Alright.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:56.730 position:56%
So you can see how at this point Bob
Dylan might be thinking there was

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.460
space for him on the top 40.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:06.750
Which brings us to the
1965 Newport Folk Festival.

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:08.050
Ah so, no, it doesn't.

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:11.430
It brings us to his next album
where he goes electric, excuse me,

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:12.730
Bringing It All Back Home.

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:17.100
In 1965 he brings out this
album with the cover photo

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.550
of him looking hip,
rich, and intense,

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:23.900
and electric instrumentation
on one side,

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:28.570
and that album title was framed
explicitly by Columbia Records

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:32.390
as Dylan is the answer
to the British invasion.

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:36.280
They have been doing American
music and been selling it to us,

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:43.310
but we've got the real thing and
Dylan is bringing it all back home.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:46.640
That brings us to the
Newport Folk Festival,

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:51.220
where once again the bill included
Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Dylan,

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:55.170
Peter, Paul, and Mary, The Freedom
Singers, Mississippi John Hurt,

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:58.990
Doc Watson, Bill Monroe,
a lot of familiar faces,

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:02.270
a lot of people coming back to
spend a sunny weekend listening

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:05.600

who shared their tastes and beliefs.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:14.130
But during that first evening's
concert they got something very

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:16.480
different than what they
had been used to at Newport.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.000
It sounded like this.

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:50.500
[ Music ]

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.900
How do you think the
folkies reacted to that one?

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:07.010 position:56%
Alan Lomax, the conservative dean of
hard core American folklorist jumped

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:10.740
on stage as soon as the Chambers
Brothers finished playing,

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:16.940
seized the mic and said, I'm very
proud tonight that we finally got

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.270
onto the Newport Folk
Festival stage,

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:23.100
our modern American folk
music rock and roll.

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:31.490
Okay, so how does that square
with our picture of Alan Lomax,

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:34.320
the guy who hated electric
music in general

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.370
and rock and roll in particular?

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:39.610
Well, the answer is that's
simply flat out wrong.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:43.920
Alan Lomax in 1959 at Carnegie
Hall presented Muddy Waters

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.070
with electric backing
and a doo-wop group.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:49.640 position:56%
He wanted The Cadillacs, the guys
who did Speedo, but they didn't show

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.760
up so he got a less known group.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:57.060
And he took great pride
in how horrified a lot

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.760
of the folk fans were by
this, but his whole point,

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.050
which he had been arguing
for years, is real folk music

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:05.890
in New York is what black
kids are doing in Harlem,

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:08.520
not a bunch of college
kids with banjos trying

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:12.810
to pretend they're hillbillies
in Washington Square Park.

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:16.810
That's why he objected to
The Butterfield Blues Band,

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:20.320
who he famously objected
to at Newport.

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:24.770
He was the guy who had discovered
Muddy Waters in Mississippi.

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:27.590
He knew real Chicago blues.

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:31.210
He appreciated real Chicago blues,

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:34.120
and the first real Chicago
blues band to be brought

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:39.580
to Newport was a bunch of white
college kids, that was his problem

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.720
with The Butterfield Band.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.060
Now personally I love
The Butterfield Band,

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:49.980 position:56%
and I want to underline a point here
which is, one of the big problems

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.870
with the way music
history is often done is

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:56.970
that people confuse music
history with music criticism

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:59.720
and write about what's good.

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:03.520
I often make the joke that if we
did political history the way we do

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:07.120
music history we would do histories
of the 20th century and leave

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:10.320
out Hitler because we
don't like his work.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:15.940
The thing is criticism is

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:21.570
about establishing what has
value in the present for us.

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:26.540
History is about trying to
understand how other people thought

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:30.380
and felt and heard things
and felt about things

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.250
in other times and situations.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:36.400
They're the opposite [inaudible].

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:43.670
And the way rock history tended
to be done was established

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:47.780
with the first rock histories
in the late '60s and early '70s,

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:56.360
and it was establishing rock
as a serious, mature art form,

00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:00.010
and exhibit A was Bob
Dylan and The Beatles,

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:06.240
and those names have forever
since ritually been put together

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.450
as creating this new music that is
maybe called rock instead of rock

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:14.320
and roll in the second
half of the '60s.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:16.410
And in that framing Newport was --

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:20.700
is a confrontation between the
young exciting present represented

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:24.820
by Bob Dylan and the old
conservative purist folkies

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:28.080
represented by Lomax and Seeger.

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.900
But -- and then here, you know,
Dylan is -- Dylan, The Beatles,

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:39.200
The Rolling Stones, but let's take
another look at that album cover.

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:43.640
Dylan looks very different from
the scruffy hobo kid we remember

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:46.020
from the earlier '60s.

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:50.430
He's long-haired, fashionable,
popstar, in a rich environment.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:55.250 position:56%
It fits perfectly in The Stones,
Beatles narrative, but those records

00:47:55.250 --> 00:48:01.260 position:56%
that he has carefully strewn next to
him tell a slightly different story.

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:05.500
Eric Von Schmidt, who was
a mentor and model for him

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:09.930
on the early Cambridge,
Massachusetts folk blues scene,

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:12.050
[inaudible] singing the Berlin
cabaret music of [inaudible],

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:17.720
which he had gotten into
through his girlfriend,

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:22.870
Susie Rotolo in the early 1960's
in the village, Robert Johnson,

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:26.110
King of the Delta Blues
Singers, which he had gotten

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:30.520
into at the moment he was first
signed to Columbia Records.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.140
The one modern record is not
The Beatles or The Stones,

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:35.470
it's The Impressions,
Keep on Pushing,

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:39.990
which incidentally not only had
been a top 10 hit that year,

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:42.220
but was one of the songs
The Chambers Brothers played

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.900
in their set at Newport.

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:57.430
So you never find histories
of the folk scene melding

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:59.960
with the rock scene and this
thing we called folk rock.

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.030
They don't tend to bring The
Impressions into that story,

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:03.330
because The Impressions are

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:06.680
in this separate world
that we call soul music.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:09.540
I mean, as it happens,
Curtis Mayfield was known

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:12.210
for writing socially
conscious songs,

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:14.500
but he's just not typically
in that narrative.

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:17.400
But for Dylan himself, obviously,

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.990
the lines were being drawn
a little differently,

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:23.360
and apparently he wasn't alone.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.040
I'm going to play you
something from Joan Baez

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.500
from Newport that same year.

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:30.120
She was on the same night
as The Chambers Brothers.

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:33.920
And one of the interesting things
about that weekend in 1965 is

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:37.890
that the weekend of the Newport
Folk Festival was also the weekend

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:41.150
that Lyndon Johnson announced
that he was doubling the draft

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:43.200
and firmly committing
the United States

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.830
to a ground war in Southeast Asia.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:50.610
Virtually nobody at Newport
that weekend responded to that,

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:53.090
the one exception being Joan Baez,

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:59.950
who was probably the most
political person on that scene,

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:01.250
and this is how she responded.

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:12.510
[ Inaudible ]

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:34.500
[ Music ]

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:45.470
Okay, nothing I had ever read in
the histories of folk, rock, soul,

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:51.510
or pop prepared me to find Joan
Baez making her strongest political

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:55.240
statement of the 1965
Newport Folk Festival

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.250
by covering a recent
hit by The Supremes.

00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:02.620
But there it is.

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.470
So why were people so upset

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:09.030
when Dylan played an
electric set on Sunday night?

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:10.540
They've had The Chambers Brothers,

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.890
they've had Joan Baez
covering The Supremes,

00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:15.550
they've had the Butterfield
Blues Band.

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:18.690
The usual answer is there were a
lot of purist folkies who had come

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:22.380
to hold hands and sing by
Kumbaya and they didn't get it,

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.760
that however much they supported
left-wing causes they were social

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:29.170
conservatives and he
was a brave rebel.

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:32.710
There's some truth to that,
just as there's some truth

00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:35.770
to the alternate story that they
were young leftists fighting

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:40.020
against racism, the war machine,
and the deadening mindlessness

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:43.610
of mass commercial culture, and
Dylan had gone off on a star trip

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:46.580
and was trying to become
a hit maker.

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:51.290
But, you know, the easy way
out is to say that the people

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:54.060
who booed him were just
stupid or out of touch.

00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.530 position:56%
But the fact is there were lots of
smart, aware people who were unhappy

00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:03.090
with his set that night, and
that's why the booing mattered.

00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:06.230
One of the reasons is a lot

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:09.320
of them were already upset
before he got on stage.

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.770
Remember, the founding idea

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:16.130
of Newport was the stars were just
there to bring in the audience,

00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:21.430
who were then going to
discover the real folk artists.

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:23.470
There were these huge
evening concerts

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:25.940
that typically had 17,000 people,

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:29.510
but the meat of the festival
were the daytime workshops,

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:33.810 position:56%
all these little stages which
normally just had two to 500 people.

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:35.110
You could sit up close.

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:39.200 position:56%
You could be right at the feet of
Mississippi John Hurt or Doc Watson.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:43.890
But by 1965 -- oh, I
should say also, you know,

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:46.430
people like Joan Baez and Pete
Seeger played along with this.

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:49.680
I mean, Joan Baez would show up at
the ballad workshop and she'd show

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.140
up at the kid songs workshop,
and Pete Seeger would be

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:55.460
on the banjo workshop, and they'd
be there framing, you know,

00:52:55.460 --> 00:53:01.040
you like me, listen to Almeda
Riddle, listen to Frank Profit.

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.520
Dylan was an exception.

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.780
By 1965 he was not only
getting [inaudible],

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:08.720
not only was like a
Rolling Stone on the radio,

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.620
but he was acting like a star.

00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:15.650
And when he showed up at Newport
he was mobbed everywhere he went.

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:19.810
And when he played on an afternoon
workshop on Saturday afternoon,

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:25.790
5,000 people showed up
and they were complaining

00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:28.980
because like they could hear the
banjo workshop, they heard people

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:33.240
at the back better than they could
hear Dylan, and a lot of people

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:36.700
at Newport felt that the
festival was being ruined

00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:41.040
by all these stupid pop fans
who had crowded the place

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:45.310
to hear the latest hit
record star from the radio,

00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:48.900
and that these people didn't
belong at their festival.

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:54.140
And that went along
with other concerns

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:56.150
about how their world was changing.

00:53:56.150 --> 00:54:02.180
I've -- our whole idea of the '60s,
the hippies, long hair, drugs,

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:08.450
rock and roll, the Vietnam
War, that's all after 1965.

00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:11.270
The world shifts in this moment.

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:15.660
And, I mean, if you look at photos
of Martin Luther King's march

00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:19.330
on Washington in '63,
it's a protest march

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:22.490
and everyone's in suits and ties.

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:26.790
That would have been
unimaginable three years later.

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:29.510
The Vietnam War was
just beginning in '65.

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:32.750
The civil rights movement
had been based on this idea

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:36.040
of everybody linking arms,
black and white, old and young,

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:39.860
marching together, the
iconic picture from 1963.

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:44.560
In 1964 it had reached its high
point in the freedom summer

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:48.710
with a lot of people from up north
going down south to Mississippi

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:50.990
to work on voter registration.

00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:55.530
1965, the ghettos were
exploding, SNCC,

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:58.430
the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee,

00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:00.480
which had organized
the freedom summer,

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.540
was kicking out its white members.

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:04.330
The new word was black power.

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:09.890
A lot of people have been killed,
Goodman, Schwerner, and Cheney,

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:14.790
[inaudible], most recently Malcolm
X. It was a frightening, scary,

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:18.620
difficult moment and a lot
of people had come to Newport

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:23.530
that weekend hoping to recharge
their batteries, to be surrounded

00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:27.720
by other people who shared
their beliefs, get ready to deal

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:31.660 position:56%
with what they were going to have
to deal with out there in the world,

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:34.800
and to link arms and
sing We Shall Overcome.

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:39.400 position:56%
And instead Dylan was on stage alone

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:43.150
in the spotlight blasting the
loudest music they've ever heard

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:48.850
in their lives and singing How
Does It Feel To Be On Your Own,

00:55:48.850 --> 00:55:53.000
and the answer was for a lot of
people it felt absolutely horrible.

00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:05.210
But for most of them that was a
relatively momentary reaction.

00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:09.840 position:56%
It's important to say, I've titled
this talk, Music, Myth, and History,

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:14.490
and I want to emphasize
the importance of myths.

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:17.460
They're not the same thing
as history, but they are part

00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:21.010
of history, and at
least equally important.

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:24.100
And I would say that the myths
surrounding Dylan at Newport,

00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.840
or at least as important as
what he actually did that night.

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.820
What he did that night
was not a big surprise.

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.840
Everybody had heard of
Like a Rolling Stone.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.970
It was a top 40 record right then.

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:38.030
What was startling was not
that he was on stage playing

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:42.600
Like a Rolling Stone, what was
startling and what made news,

00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:46.220
in fact when he played on
Saturday afternoon most

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:49.020
of the requests you could hear on
the tape are people yelling for him

00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:52.030
to do Like a Rolling Stone.

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:55.290
What made it news was
that he got booed.

00:56:56.830 --> 00:57:01.580
The way rock historians have tended
to describe that is with an analogy

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:06.680
to Stravinsky's Rite of Spring,
getting booed in Paris in 1913.

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:11.730
Now there are lots of problems
with that analogy, but it's central

00:57:11.730 --> 00:57:15.910
to the shift from rock and roll
being dumb teenage music to rock

00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:18.200
and roll being serious art.

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:21.330
And the fact that Dylan got
booed and continued to pursue

00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:26.650 position:56%
that direction, as he was booed from
concert to concert, to Australia,

00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:32.800
to Britain, and stuck to his guns,
proved that he wasn't selling

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.970
out to the pop machine,
that he was a serious artist

00:57:35.970 --> 00:57:40.770
who was going his own way,
whatever his fans wanted.

00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:44.820
And that changed the whole
perception of what rock could be.

00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:50.380
One way to phrase that shift is
that the historians have tended

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.870
to describe that night as
Dylan's break with the folk scene,

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:56.370
he took the folk scene with him.

00:57:56.370 --> 00:58:00.100
Not just all those people at
Newport who were booing that week,

00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:03.340
but two months later loved the
stuff once they had had time

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:08.260
to assimilate it, but also the folk
scene's seriousness, its commitment

00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:13.270 position:56%
to ideals of authenticity, its sense
of importance in social relevance,

00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:16.530
all that got transferred onto rock.

00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:20.050
And to a great extent that's
the process by which rock became

00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:25.150
and has forever since been grown
up music and college kid music.

00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:28.750
Again, that's not a critical
judgment, positive or negative,

00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:32.930
that's a historical judgment,
which is to say it's an attempt

00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:35.940
to understand and explain why
certain people felt the way they

00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:37.480
felt, thought the way they thought,

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:41.190
and acted the way they acted
in a particular moment.

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:44.360
And I'm just going
to finish by saying,

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:48.450
we're in a particularly
bizarre election year,

00:58:48.450 --> 00:58:54.140
and one of the exercises
that I see very little of,

00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:58.470
even from some people I like a
lot, is the exercise of trying

00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:04.230
to understand why intelligent,

00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:10.850
grown-up people might be doing
something that to you seems crazy.

00:59:10.850 --> 00:59:16.740
And I think the value of
studying history is that you learn

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:19.270
that intelligent, grown-up people

00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:24.240
over the years have constantly
made choices that to you

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:26.400
in retrospect seem crazy.

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:30.070
But if you study history
seriously you begin

00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:34.670 position:56%
to understand how had you been there
you might have made those crazy

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:37.310
choices yourself.

00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:44.090
And I feel like if I've done my
book on Dylan at Newport right,

00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:47.430
people who weren't there reading
it won't know whether they would've

00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:50.010
been among the people
booing or cheering,

00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:52.970 position:56%
because God dammit it's complicated.

00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:59.480
And I think that that's what the
value of the study of history is.

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.510
And with that thank you very much.

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:16.250
[ Applause ]

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:20.390
And now I'm happy to
take questions, comments.

01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:22.190
Yes?

01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:35.510
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:38.110
You know the simple answer is
I've done my damn Dylan book

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.510
and I don't want to think about
him for a couple of years.

01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:44.350
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:45.650
Absolutely.

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:49.010 position:56%
No, no, no, I mean, clearly had I --

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:52.400
had the times been reversed I would
have had to make a trip to Tulsa,

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.140
which would probably
have been good for me.

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:56.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks.

01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:57.970
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: Yeah?

01:00:57.970 --> 01:01:06.070
&gt;&gt; It seems to me that another main
reason [inaudible] at this time was

01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:11.090
to disassociate himself from the
political world surrounding folk

01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:15.410
music, which of course
at that time [inaudible].

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:19.210
I don't think he was ever
that political to begin with.

01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:24.560
I mean, you talked about --
you read [inaudible] comments

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.910
about what he really thought at
that time in the early '60s, yeah,

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:31.350
profound [inaudible] that is true.

01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:32.650
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: And
poor white people.

01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:33.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.

01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:36.410
But other than that he
was not an [inaudible],

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:39.430
and I think he never wanted
to be any kind of voice

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:41.130
in the generation, a leader --

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.430
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: Yeah.

01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:43.730
&gt;&gt; Of the generation.

01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:45.830
And they were sort of the
[inaudible] to elevate him

01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:52.380
to this kind of, you know,
spokesman until he --

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:53.960
I think he rebelled against that.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.890
He's a very private person.

01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:57.390
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: All of that's true.

01:01:57.390 --> 01:02:01.280
I would've said that that rebellion
had happened considerably earlier.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.580
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:03.990
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: I mean already

01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:06.280
when he was doing acoustic
stuff he had moved away

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.400
from the political stuff
and the folk movement.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.060 position:56%
I mean, there's this wonderful quote
that I actually use to begin one

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:15.830
of my chapters, that he, God
bless him, scrawled on the back

01:02:15.830 --> 01:02:20.430
of the original manuscript of
It Ain't Me Babe, which he wrote

01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:25.660 position:56%
in a London hotel, and on the back
he writes, how many times am I going

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:30.310
to have to say I'm not a folksinger
before people will stop saying he's

01:02:30.310 --> 01:02:32.220
not a folksinger.

01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:38.440
It Ain't Me Babe, no, no, no.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.640
Yeah, no, I mean, clearly
that had been happening

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.730
and that was part of
what was going on.

01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:46.780
But the rock and roll thing I don't
think he went into rock and roll

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:49.540
to separate himself from the folk,
or that he went into rock and roll

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.960
because who the hell
wouldn't if they could.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.880
I mean, it's fun.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.610
&gt;&gt; Oh, I agree.

01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:56.940
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: Yeah.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.190
I mean, I think if he
could've been a rock star

01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:04.190 position:56%
in 1960 he would've been a rock star
in 1960, but the path was not there.

01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:06.490
And when the path opened
up he followed it.

01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:09.510
It's fun. Yeah?

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:25.100
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:29.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; -- and I've always wondered about
how the influences really went back

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.790
and forth across the ocean.

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:34.090
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: Constantly, yeah.

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:40.370
No, I mean, look, I think
one of the horrible problems

01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:43.600
with the way we do music history
is that there's a tendency to act

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.540
as if genres have meaning.

01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:48.430 position:56%
There is no such thing as folk rock.

01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:50.580
I mean, this is just
a marketing term.

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:52.300
It's a way of selling records.

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:54.830
It has nothing to do
with how anything sounds.

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:56.620
I mean, I sometimes do the exercise

01:03:56.620 --> 01:04:00.140
of playing Maggie's Farm the
way Dylan did it at Newport,

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:03.100
next to what we call folk rock.

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:06.750
I mean Maggie's Farm sounds
like Satisfaction more

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:09.620
than it sounds like
Sounds of Silence.

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:13.330
And The Rolling Stones were in fact
imitating -- I mean, Satisfaction,

01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:16.450
listen to it, it's a
flat out Dylan imitation,

01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:18.530
and Mick Jagger was
very upfront about that.

01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:20.820
There's this wonderful
quote from Jagger talking

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:24.340
about Keith Richards running
into Bob Dylan in New York right

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:29.140 position:56%
around then and Dylan saying to him,
I could have written Satisfaction

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:32.640
but you couldn't have
written Mr. Tambourine Man.

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:38.070
And the interviewer says,
well, what did he mean by that?

01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:40.130 position:56%
I mean, it wasn't a put down was it?

01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:42.110
And Jagger says, well,
yes, of course it was.

01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:44.960
But, you know, it's funny.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.900
It's like -- you know, it's true.

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:50.230
And it is true, of course
Dylan could have written that.

01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:53.960 position:56%
And the Stones were in full scale
of Dylan imitation mode that summer.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:57.760
I mean, Satisfaction, 19th Nervous
Breakdown, Get Off My Cloud,

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.070
it's all Dylan imitations.

01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:03.490
And yet you read the histories and
like Dylan is part of folk rock

01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:06.900
and the Stones are over in
blues rock, this is crap.

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:13.410
And, yeah, you know, yes, Body
and Soul is an English song,

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.720 position:56%
Lime House Blues is an English song.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:21.260
I mean musicians have been treating
music and styles and trends back

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:26.300
and forth across the Atlantic, back
at least to the minstrel shows,

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:30.090
and probably earlier, and it kept
happening in the '60s and '70s

01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:32.360
and '80s, and is happening
right now.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:38.990
And I just think it's completely
unuseful [phonetic] to sort

01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:41.200
of divide these things into genres.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.550
People are -- particularly
people who want to get

01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:48.770
on the pop charts are constantly
listening to each other.

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:51.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:55.180
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: Hey, suddenly
three hands up from women.

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:56.890
Age before beauty, yes?

01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:58.190
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:05:58.190 --> 01:06:03.610
I enjoyed your talk tremendously.

01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:04.910
[inaudible] singers.

01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:07.470
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: Uh-huh, me too.

01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:14.490
&gt;&gt; And my question to you
is did you interview any

01:06:14.490 --> 01:06:18.650
of the people you mentioned?

01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:23.150
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: For this
project most of the people

01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:25.710
of that generation were
unfortunately dead.

01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:28.360
Ronnie Gilbert was still alive
and I tried to interview her,

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.160
but she was no longer
interviewable [phonetic].

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:34.580
I did interview pretty
much all of those people

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:37.740
because 20 years ago I
was doing the research

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.270
for a biography of Josh White.

01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:43.130
So I went pretty deep
into that world.

01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:47.340
Yeah, I mean I talked to pretty
much all the almanac singers

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:53.020
who were still alive at that point,
but not specifically about this.

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:55.040
&gt;&gt; Two more questions.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:58.200
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: I'm
allowed two more questions.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.530
You're one of them,
and you're the other.

01:07:00.530 --> 01:07:05.910
&gt;&gt; You talked about
imitating and training and --

01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:08.800
but, I mean was some
of it just stealing?

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:13.600
I mean, did some -- were they just
taking like tunes and riffs and,

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.670
you know, from each other?

01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:18.160
Was that okay or not frowned upon?

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:23.180
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: The answer to
that is extremely variable.

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:30.720
If I had to generalize I would say
that when somebody imitates you

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:34.950
and doesn't do as well as you
they are simply paying homage

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:36.250
in imitating.

01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:37.890
And when somebody imitates
you and does better

01:07:37.890 --> 01:07:40.640
than you they are stealing.

01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:46.140
But you don't tend to know
until you see how they do.

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:49.190
I mean, the white singers

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:53.190
who covered Maybelline were
just imitating Chuck Berry

01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:56.010
because nobody gave a damn.

01:07:56.010 --> 01:07:59.640
The white singers who covered
Laverne Baker were stealing

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:03.070
because they got the top
40 hits and she didn't.

01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:05.710
I mean, you know, it's retrospect.

01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:09.010
You know, there's often the
saying, mediocre composers imitate,

01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:12.740
great composers steal, and
that's sort of what we mean.

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:16.460 position:56%
I mean, you know, once Beethoven
does it they forget that you did it,

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:19.070
and then you feel like
it's been stolen.

01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:22.980
But, you know, I mean it's
complicated because like

01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:25.780 position:56%
that whole discourse is about power.

01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:30.030
It isn't about one person
playing what someone else plays.

01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:33.400
It's about someone with power
playing something that someone

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:37.200
without power plays and using
that power to get credit

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.730
that the other person
might've got, but the process

01:08:39.730 --> 01:08:42.900
of imitation need not
be any different from --

01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:46.920
in the one case from
the other, is my answer.

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:49.010
I'm sure there are others.

01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:53.130
&gt;&gt; I would love to hear you say
something about Robert Plant.

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:56.700
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: I have nothing
to say about Robert Plant.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:58.620
No, seriously, I have nothing
to say about Robert Plant.

01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:02.040
So I can take one more question
because I ducked that one.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.340
Yes?

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.690
&gt;&gt; Your book is also
a lot about Pete.

01:09:04.690 --> 01:09:06.500
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: My book is
very much a lot about Pete.

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.830
&gt;&gt; About Pete, and I thought it
was amazing the way, you know,

01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:11.750
you said it's a complex
relationship,

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:14.760
but you really set
them up as [inaudible],

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.570
very political his music.

01:09:16.570 --> 01:09:23.550
It came [inaudible] place in a
critique and Dylan really was,

01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:34.420
you know, going his own way
at this point [inaudible] --

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:38.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Elijah Wald: Yeah, the thing,
first of all, I made Pete the center

01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:41.050
of this book because
-- for two reasons.

01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:47.500
One, is I wanted to -- for
people who weren't around then,

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:53.200 position:56%
really give them a sense of what the
folk scene pre-Dylan looked like.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:56.500 position:56%
And if one person ever
exemplified a scene it's Pete Seeger

01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:00.050
and the folk scene of the
1950's in every aspect.

01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:06.190 position:56%
I mean, the amazing thing about Pete
Seeger is he had the most popular

01:10:06.190 --> 01:10:08.200
pop folk group.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.670
He did the most rooted
traditional music.

01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:19.660
Pete Seeger from 1954 through 1960
released an average eight albums

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:21.910
a year.

01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:24.220
He simply was folk music.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.420
I don't care what branch
of folk music.

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:28.200
It all came out of Pete Seeger,

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:31.680
which made him just
this wonderful way

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.350
that you could exemplify a world.

01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:36.970
But I'd like to say -- you know,
the other thing I wanted to say is

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:39.900
that it often -- this
thing is talked about as

01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:44.220
if Dylan is this complicated
character

01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:45.650
and Pete Seeger is just Pete.

01:10:45.650 --> 01:10:50.420
You know, there was no one on Earth
more complicated than Pete Seeger.

01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:52.890
And so part of what I was
trying to suggest in this was

01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:57.940
that these were two very
complicated, very bright,

01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:05.310
very interesting people, who at
this one moment went head-to-head

01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:07.670
and represented opposite camps.

01:11:07.670 --> 01:11:10.790
But it's just this one moment.

01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:15.260
I mean, they remained
in touch till Pete died.

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.900
They had been very close before.

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:21.430
They both understood that they
were on different missions,

01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:28.320
and they both understood that the
other was the best at doing that.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:33.200
I mean, you find Dylan in the '80s,
'90s, whatever saying, you know,

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:36.260
what Pete does he's like a shaman.

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:39.810
He -- you know, he has this magical
way of bringing people together,

01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:41.420
and rock stars don't do that.

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:44.550
We're just sort of living
out people's fantasies.

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:50.730
And you find Pete saying, you
know, I didn't get it at Newport,

01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:53.610
but pop music was changing
into something different

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:55.580
from what I thought pop music was

01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:58.510
and Dylan was instrumental
in that change.

01:11:58.510 --> 01:12:00.630
So, you know, I was just trying

01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:07.010
to make this story let's
just say more interesting.

01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:10.490
And now I'm going to go out front
and I'm going to sign some books

01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:11.790
if anyone wants them signed.

01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:13.870
And I'm happily -- happy
to answer more questions.

01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:15.960
I mean, I'm not going to have like
tape over my mouth or anything.

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.630
Thank you very, very much.

01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:19.630
