RICK BOROVOY: Hi,
I'm Rick Borovoy.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.340
I'm the Lead Product Manager
for Google Play for Education.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.798
JULIE FARAGO: And
I'm Julie Farago.

00:00:05.798 --> 00:00:08.910
I'm the Engineering Manager
for Google Play for Education.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.030
RICK BOROVOY: So I get you.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.490
You want to change the world
with your mad software skills,

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.730
but you don't know
where to start.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.600
So in five minutes
we're going to pitch you

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.560
on a "rock your paradigm"
educational Android app that we

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.400
are dying for someone to
build that could transform

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.700
a classroom into an amazing
place for collaboration

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.907
and exploration.

00:00:28.907 --> 00:00:30.740
JULIE FARAGO: I'm really
excited about this,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.820
but we're not just
going to tantalize you

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.119
with exciting ideas.

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:36.410
We're actually going to teach
you about the Google APIs

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.670
that you can use that
makes it easy to build

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.477
these apps and really any app
that you're excited about.

00:00:41.477 --> 00:00:43.560
And we've actually already
created the Google Play

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.310
for Education store that
you could put your app there

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.490
and super easily get it into the
hands of teachers and students.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.680
So the biggest thing
that needs to be done

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.763
is just building that app.

00:00:51.763 --> 00:00:53.674
So let's learn how.

00:00:53.674 --> 00:00:55.090
RICK BOROVOY: We
want you to build

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.050
an app that nails one of
the most awesome, most

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.900
popular, collaborative
tablet use cases in school.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.280
It's called the Photo Hunt,
or sometimes the Photo Safari.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.510
As in, I'm the teacher.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.295
Hey, kids.

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:07.110
For our unit on
energy conservation

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.670
go grab your tablets and take
some pictures of examples

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.980
of how we're wasting
energy at school.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.000
That's easy.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.050
And it's really
empowering for kids

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.830
to go and find some examples
of waste with their camera.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.340
Like a door left open when
the air conditioner's running.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.091
Or school buses
belching carbon monoxide

00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:25.090
while they're sitting
there waiting for the kids

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.770
to come out.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.990
Or entire labs
where the computers

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.020
powered on but sitting unused.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.992
JULIE FARAGO: Turn them off.

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:33.700
RICK BOROVOY: Now
there are existing apps

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.130
for this that support the basic
photo collection reasonably

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.980
well.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.960
But as awesome as kids taking
pictures around the school is,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.300
it's actually not the magic
moment of the Photo Hunt.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.080
The real magic happens when
the kids gather back together

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.232
with the teacher and they look
over what they've collected

00:01:50.232 --> 00:01:51.940
and they start talking
about it and start

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.950
pulling out ideas
and really getting

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.120
focused on what
they've collected.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.880
It turns out that that
focus can be a challenge.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.210
Teacher may want to point
out a couple of photos,

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.060
but the kids are wandering off.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.449
In fact, a teacher
once told me that kids

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.220
have a superhuman ability
to be on the wrong page

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.120
at the wrong time.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.585
So how about building something
straight into the Photo Hunt

00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:21.910
app that lets a
teacher walk students

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.610
through a particular photo, so
that they can control the focus

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.490
and really make an
awesome conversation.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.980
JULIE FARAGO: Totally.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.935
So I love this idea.

00:02:27.935 --> 00:02:29.310
I think I get it.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.550
Let's walk through how
to actually build it.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.840
So first of all, if you want
to use the tablet as a camera,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.219
or for that matter an audio
sensor or a video recorder,

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.760
please actually check out the
Google Android media and camera

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.260
APIs.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.551
These are going to give you
all the tools that you need

00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:46.440
to capture and record multimedia
so that when you're building

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.380
for a tablet you can
actually take advantage

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.100
of the awesome mobility and
multimedia of that tablet.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.740
We want apps that just shine
on tablets-- that you just

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.820
couldn't do otherwise--
because the tablet form

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.390
factor is so fabulous.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.890
And we think that
you can build apps

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.770
that take advantage of that.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.650
So, all right, let's say you
understand how to take photos.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.800
What you're going to need
is a source of identity.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.216
And when kids are gathering
and commenting on photos,

00:03:10.216 --> 00:03:12.090
they actually need a
way to say who they are.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.423
And I'm going to go a little
melodramatic here, but bear

00:03:14.423 --> 00:03:15.220
with me.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.220
Because the thing that
you want to be careful of

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.430
is that identity is the first
place where apps go to die.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.770
I know, intense.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.250
But so we went to a
classroom earlier this year

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.140
in New Hampshire.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.340
And what we saw was 20
pages-- 20 plus or minus--

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.810
stapled together mapping
app name to kid name

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.790
to username to password.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.990
And there is nothing
that will make

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.650
a teacher abandon your app
more quickly than wasting her,

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.160
or even more importantly,
her student's time.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.580
And requiring unique
usernames and passwords

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.960
for all of these students?

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.720
It's just a waste of time.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.040
So you can make this
easier with Google Login.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.640
So with really
minimal effort, you

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.980
can get a trusted
registration system

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.660
that's familiar to users.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.200
It's consistent across devices.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.390
And it just lets you skip all
that time intensive username

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.510
and password entering.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.860
And it makes registration
faster and more secure.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.410
And the awesome
thing about this is

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.000
that all the students
in your classes

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.630
are actually going to
have Google Apps accounts.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.838
They're going to have Google
Login available to them.

00:04:17.838 --> 00:04:20.880
Because you need it in order to
use Google Play for Education.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.180
So 100% of those
students are going

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.900
to be able to click
that sign in button

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.330
and use it for registration,
use it for log in, and just go.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.450
So no login, no password.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.210
Happy teachers.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.155
Great.

00:04:31.155 --> 00:04:31.560
RICK BOROVOY: Amazing.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.940
JULIE FARAGO: Amazing.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.290
So now the next question
is, how do we really

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.380
get to the heart of what Rick
was talking about earlier?

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.860
How do we get
students all talking

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.630
about the same thing, on the
same page, at the same time?

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.780
And for that we're actually
introducing a new Android

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.024
API that lets an app go
into lock to app mode.

00:04:46.024 --> 00:04:47.690
This API actually
needs to be authorized

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.610
through device management.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.440
So you want to be thoughtful
about how you use it and use it

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.580
in apps like testing apps,
or classroom management apps,

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.960
or, in this case, a task
focused app, where you really

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.090
want to keep all the
kids on the same image,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.010
keep the discussion
focused, and keep kids

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.600
from getting distracted and
going off to another place.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.980
So now what you
can do is you can

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.530
build this special
discussion mode into your app

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.170
so that when a teacher, for
example, swipes between photos,

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.631
the students'
tablets follow along.

00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:17.130
So they can all look at this
one picture of the exhaust pipe

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.760
and all the gas
coming out of it.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.610
And because you've used
this lock to app API,

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.300
all of the basic navigation
buttons and the notifications

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.220
are turned off so they can't
accidentally or intentionally

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.100
switch out of the
app and wander off.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.600
So you can find out more about
this in the Android L Preview

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.150
release.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.840
RICK BOROVOY: I love the
idea of a discussion mode.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.256
So that feels like
that completely

00:05:35.256 --> 00:05:37.600
nails the Photo Safari use case.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.340
But I'm thinking if you
give kids this awesome power

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.890
to collect these photos
and discuss them and start

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.550
to think about the
world around them,

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.425
they're going to want
to start arranging them

00:05:46.425 --> 00:05:48.750
in a way that represents
the world around them.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.060
They're going to want to map.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.924
Of course, we love
maps at Google.

00:05:52.924 --> 00:05:54.840
But we also think it's
an amazing way for kids

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.970
to work together to build an
understanding of the world

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.070
around them and maybe
even to use a map

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.850
to advocate for
positive social change.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:03.870
JULIE FARAGO: Totally.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.195
RICK BOROVOY:
Remarkably, there isn't

00:06:05.195 --> 00:06:07.070
a tool that makes this
really simple for kids

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.760
to do-- to decide what matters
to them and map it out.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.010
For example, a tool that
would help our conservation

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.619
minded kids.

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:17.910
Maybe they want to make their
school more bike friendly

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.660
or find out how
bike friendly it is.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.104
So they want to map
the surrounding first

00:06:22.104 --> 00:06:23.020
for bike friendliness.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.650
Maybe they want to
map out three things.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.680
Where are bike racks?

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.580
Where are bike lanes?

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.190
Or where are bike hazards
that they should be aware of?

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.270
So imagine a tool that lets kids
decide those three markers, fan

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.630
out with their GPS devices,
start marking on the map where

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.110
those things are, take some
photos, and then just magically

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.890
have it gather all together so
they can study it themselves

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.620
and then share it
with other people.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.870
JULIE FARAGO: I love this app.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:49.828
I want to use this app.

00:06:49.828 --> 00:06:51.299
It sounds fabulous.

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:53.340
And the big question is,
how do you do it easily?

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.570
And the Google Maps API
actually makes this really easy.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.977
You can build this functionality
on top of Google Maps,

00:06:58.977 --> 00:07:01.060
and you can get a bunch
of gnarly engineering work

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.970
for free.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.570
So you can get a shared Cloud
synced set of map markers

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.700
that are contributed
to by a group of users.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.860
You can get GPS integration,
fantastic and familiar

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.720
touch UX, maps that span the
entire earth, and, of course,

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.859
custom map markers.

00:07:15.859 --> 00:07:17.400
In fact, actually,
one of our schools

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.060
earlier this year did
this amazing project

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.060
where kids went
around their town

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.270
and they took pictures
of street lights--

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.210
street lights that were working,
street lights that were out,

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.530
where they needed
more street lights.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.510
And using that, they actually
made a shared proposal

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.218
to their local town
government about what

00:07:33.218 --> 00:07:35.350
they should do about
their streetlights.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.717
And it was fantastic.

00:07:36.717 --> 00:07:38.300
But the challenge
was actually that it

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.172
required a ton of IT support.

00:07:40.172 --> 00:07:41.880
And, of course, a ton
of teacher support.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.610
You want the teacher
supportive, but you

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.050
don't want them to have to
work long weekends in order

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.430
to enable this
project to happen.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.820
And so what we
really need here is

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.420
we want students
all over the country

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.560
to be able to do these
types of things, teachers

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.410
to be able to do
it, without having

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.340
to invest oodles of time.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.130
And for that we need an app.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.799
And we're hopeful
that you'll build one.

00:08:02.799 --> 00:08:03.590
RICK BOROVOY: Boom.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:04.850
Awesome.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.350
All right.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.933
So now we've got this app that
lets kids collaborate, explore,

00:08:07.933 --> 00:08:10.265
document their
world, organize it.

00:08:10.265 --> 00:08:13.950
But I don't think we're done.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.230
I think that the
missing piece is

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.850
that these kids want to do
more than just collect photos.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.009
They want to collect data.

00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:24.300
Maybe it's not just the kids
that want to collect data.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.383
Maybe it's the teachers
that want to collect data.

00:08:26.383 --> 00:08:29.140
I have not met a teacher
that isn't really

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.080
passionate about
getting their kids to be

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.250
excited about collecting
and analyzing data.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.970
It's an ultimate
21st century skill.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.850
But there's a funny
truth about how it often

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:39.764
goes down in schools.

00:08:39.764 --> 00:08:41.570
It often looks
something like kid

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.170
in the back measuring the
pH value of the puddle.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.410
And I think that's just less
exciting than maybe teachers

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.790
and we all hope
it's going to be.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.206
Kids somehow figured
out that this

00:08:52.206 --> 00:08:54.210
isn't the way to a Nobel Prize.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.820
And it's not the most
exciting use of data.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.510
So what if we just took
a lot better advantage

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.760
of what we have to offer here?

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.390
You don't just have one kid
and one scientific instrument.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.560
You've got a whole
classroom worth of tablets.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.590
Isn't there some cool way we can
combine these tablets together

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.085
into some super
scientific instrument?

00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:14.842
You've ever been to the
Very Large Array in Arizona?

00:09:14.842 --> 00:09:16.300
JULIE FARAGO: I
have not, actually.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.758
RICK BOROVOY: It's
totally awesome.

00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:19.310
It's like the modern
day Stonehenge.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.940
There are all these
radio telescopes

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:22.990
that all work together.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.490
I'm not talking about making
radio telescopes work together.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.250
But what if you can
take nine tablets

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.340
and put them together
in an array and then

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.550
use that single big array to
go measure sound in the school.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.460
Maybe you take it into a
classroom and you look and see

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.420
how the sound travels in there.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.264
Or maybe you take it into an
auditorium and you look and see

00:09:43.264 --> 00:09:44.430
how the sound travels there.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.950
Or maybe you take it out to
the field and you look and see

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:47.710
how sound travels there.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.251
And maybe you ask
this question, what

00:09:49.251 --> 00:09:51.730
is the loudest room
in the school anyway?

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.120
JULIE FARAGO: I love the vision.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.637
I love the division
of data fluency

00:09:54.637 --> 00:09:55.970
and helping teach our kids that.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.094
It's fabulous.

00:09:57.094 --> 00:09:59.260
And also creating these
cool scientific instruments.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
And the question is, how
do you, as a developer,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.950
enable this type of data
fluency-- this cross device

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.909
data gathering and
analysis and collaboration?

00:10:06.909 --> 00:10:08.950
And you already know how
to use the Android Media

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.600
APIs because you've already
done that with the photos.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.030
But let's look at the APIs
for data collaboration

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.430
and for collection.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.050
So as it turns out
there are actually

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.240
more than 30 million
active apps for Edu users.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.010
These students and
teachers use tools

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.840
like Google Docs and
Google Spreadsheets

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.840
to create content and
collaborate around it

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.360
all the time, which is
exactly what we want to do.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.020
So our Spreadsheets
API offers the ability

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.280
to create spreadsheets,
add rows of data,

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.000
manipulate individual
cells of data,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.050
and basically you
can use it as a place

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.740
to store all that awesome
audio data that your kids are

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.560
gathering.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.430
And then those kids can
go into Google Drive,

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.047
they can collaboratively
create charts and understand

00:10:50.047 --> 00:10:51.630
how sound travels
through and compares

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.309
across different locations.

00:10:53.309 --> 00:10:54.850
And then you can
even do more things,

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.519
like use the Drive
APIs for Google Docs

00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:59.810
or for Google Spreadsheets,
which are all very similar.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.030
So we'd be really excited
if you also checked out

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.560
the developer site
for the Drive APIs.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.792
RICK BOROVOY: So bringing
it all together here.

00:11:08.792 --> 00:11:11.190
Our goal with Google
Play for Education

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.120
for all these
awesome Google APIs

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.280
is to make it really easy for
you to build some apps that

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.340
make some collaborative learning
activities easy for kids.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.100
And then to make it easy
for schools to find those

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.189
apps and just start
using them right away.

00:11:26.189 --> 00:11:27.230
JULIE FARAGO: Absolutely.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.930
So we want it to be easy
for teachers, easy for you,

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:31.680
easy for students.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.110
Easy, easy, easy.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.740
So please go do it.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.640
We cannot wait to see what
you're going to build.
