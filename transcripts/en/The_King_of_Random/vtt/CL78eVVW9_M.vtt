The next time you eat a giant hamburger, don't
do it like this. The bottoms get soggy and

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.310
fall apart. Instead, try turning your sandwich
upside down. The tops are nearly twice as

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.740
thick as the bottoms, and a lot more durable.
So be smart, and eat your hamburgers upside

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.420
down.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.320
Have you ever noticed that when you put a
straw in a can of soda, it doesn't want to

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.640
stay? Try bending the tab of the can over
the hole and slide your straw down through

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.180
the tab. No more floating straws, because
now, it's held in place.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.370
Grab yourself a mango and try this little
trick. Carefully cut off the two sides of

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.270
the fruit, and hold one piece in your hand.
You can gently cut a few lines vertically,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.280
and a few more across, until the pattern resembles
a checkerboard. Now take it with both hands

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.280
and gently push from the back. You'll see
bite sized pieces pop right up.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.989
You can use a spoon to scrape
them into a bowl, or just eat them right off

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.020
the peel. It's fast, easy, and they won't
get stuck in your teeth.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.170
If you've got ants and you're looking for
a natural form of pest control, try measuring

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.280
out a cup of popcorn kernels. Put them in
a blender, on high speed for about 30 seconds,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.729
and you'll end up with a batch of fresh, homemade
cornmeal. Just make a few piles around the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.179
ant trails and within a few days, your ant
problems will, literally disappear.

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.229
The next time you're at a party and someone
has bags of chips laying around, impress your

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.959
friends by making them into custom snack bowls.
You can fold the top edge inside the bag first,

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:39.959
then begin rolling the bottom corners, up
into the base of the bag, pushing the chips

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:45.830
up as you go. You'll end up with a custom
snack bowl, with chips overflowing.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.349
It's the season for fruit flies, so before
they take over your kitchen, slice a few pieces

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:55.429
of banana and mix them with some of your leftover
mango peels. Find yourself a couple of small

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.619
containers, and add the fruit. Now just stretch
a piece of plastic wrap over the top, and

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.190
use something like the tip of a chopstick
to poke a small hole in the center that's

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.899
just bigger than the fly. Now you can set
it and forget it. Within a few minutes, the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.400
flies will be checking things out, and once
one goes in, you can be sure his friends will

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.120
follow. Within a couple of days, they'll all
be having a rocking fruit party. And now you

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.489
can simply, take the lid of the container
and press it on, sealing them inside. Now

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.900
you, are the lord of the flies.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.579
Summer means popsicles, and popsicles mean
your kids are going to get sticky fingers.

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.760
Grab a small paper cup, and carefully poke
a hole in the bottom, about the size of a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.379
popsicle stick. Now when you push a popsicle
inside, you've got an instant drip catcher,

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.719
and no more sticky fingers. By the way, this
works great with cupcake liners as well!

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.849
You've probably been to a BBQ where the condiments
take up half the table, and the lineups for

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.250
using them take forever. Solve the problem
with a muffin pan. This way your condiments

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.340
are easy to access and your lines will move
along quickly. You'll also dramatically increase

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.829
your table space, and cut down the things
to clean up afterward.

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.959
When you're at the beach, reduce the chances
of things getting stolen by making a covert

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.599
container. Just take your old shampoo bottle
and twist the top so that it pops right off.

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.489
Clean it out and cut a hole in the top that's
just big enough, to stash your valuable items

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.030
inside. Now you can snap the top back on,
and your items are perfectly concealed. Anyone

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.269
who sees this will just think it's a shampoo
bottle, and chances are, nobody's wants to

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.810
steal your shampoo.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.849
When you need a drink to cool down, hot water
can taste disgusting. Try filling your water

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.549
bottles, a quarter of the way, so that when
their on their sides, the water settles just

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.739
below the bottle neck. Now stick your bottles
in the freezer and go on with your day. When

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.870
the water is frozen it will make an ice block
on the side the bottle, but doesn't block

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.349
the opening. Now when you need to cool off
just take a bottle from the freezer, fill

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.620
it up with your favorite drink, and you've
got an instant, icy cold beverage ready to

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.950
go.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.599
Well there are a few tricks, to make your
summer, a littler easier. If you liked these

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.180
