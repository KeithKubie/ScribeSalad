00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.179
 for me cooking gastronomy is a 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.059
 way of understanding life we ​​know a lot 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.070
 more than with cooking work for me is 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.460
 more a mental issue than a question 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.460
 physical 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.580
 Y 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.860
 more than cooking I like to create around 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.840
 of the kitchen and of these moments also 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.079
 I like to understand what the kitchen is 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.510
 but this cooking physically is not 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.730
 what I really need the most I never 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.309
 I said that they only do damage to 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.190
 creativity we started doing 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.019
 kitchen we did creative and kitchen and 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.790
 now the truth that we use the kitchen 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.579
 to do creativity and teacher has 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.320
 come the slogan is to eat knowledge 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.320
 to fuel creativity 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.310
 I was lucky to get a ticket 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.750
 to open doors that had never been 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.130
 open for the world to cook what 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.369
 We were looking for us 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.170
 the limits that we had what we were doing 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.630
 We wanted it to be an experience not 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.450
 single sensory taste or no order 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.060
 central but an experience I would like 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.439
 reflect next what you can be able to 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.439
 get the art field 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.800
 life in motivation 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.620
 you knew woman I challenge you I thought that 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.120
 I knew a lot about society and I realized 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.830
 that I did not have that much knowledge about 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.830
 everything did not understand what he was doing 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.020
 do not 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.610
 do not 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.450
 mythical god money because I wanted to 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.099
 to achieve a homeland of ibiza I did not like 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.020
 work and this is why I asked all 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.420
 my life in the way of things one of the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.790
 revolutions I was wearing 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.980
 it is the knowledge of the cooks 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.700
 conscious amateurs to complete the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.880
 mind 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.040
 the other is to understand that when they come down 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.430
 remaining not only eat but also 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.430
 Cook 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.880
 we have been brave in freedom 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.140
 I love to talk with painters 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.950
 sculptors magazines with everyone I 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.840
 like to learn people participate here 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.120
 different it is very difficult to focus the 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.500
 passion when I do the tubes and here's the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.500
 home this is the best of my career 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.750
 in most 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:22.140
 I do not understand what people are 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:24.720
 understand the days 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.800
 I love the avant-garde and I love the people who 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.800
 they risk in the vanguard 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.500
 that same 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.810
 the kitchen is a person who does not prick 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.480
 kitchen 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.860
 but I cook empty 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.540
 I'm cooking, I'm with you, I'm 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.129
 cooking for an hour cooking continues 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.310
 coming from kitchen cooking action and 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:05.120
 this is cooking is physically cooking 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.120
 this is the least interesting that someone 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.120
 kitchen 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.330
 it's not the people 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.400
 I'm moved by the desire to discover the 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.560
 world the desire to move forward 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.560
 want to do different and unique things
