00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.440
I tend to do a lot of videos
with simplified examples and

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.690
round numbers.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.120
But let's get a little bit of
dose of reality and actually

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.600
analyze a real transaction
that happened.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.010
Just to show to you that some of
these CDOs are selling for

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.760
well below what the people paid
for them, or what that

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.980
they were listed as
on the books.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.080
And even the price is actually,
probably, even worth

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.940
less than what the person
actually paid.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.540
Let's just analyze this and then
I'll let you make your

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.720
own conclusions.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.220
So this was a press release.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.550
This is part of the press
release that Merrill Lynch

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.390
sent out on July 28.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.110
And just remember, they had
just finished reporting

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.700
earnings, right?

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.100
As of June 30.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.980
That's when they do a snapshot
of their books.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.650
So keep that in the
back of your mind.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.060
Right?

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.830
It says on July 28, Merrill
Lynch agreed to sell $30.6

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:58.250
billion gross notional amount of
U.S. super senior ABS CDOs

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.920
to an affiliate of
Lone Star Funds.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.630
So this is important.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.640
So the $30.6 billion,
what is that?

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.810
That's the number that either
Merrill Lynch originally paid

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.780
for it, or the amount
that they originally

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.230
valued those CDOs are.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.870
So $30.6 billion gross
notional-- notional, I have a

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.950
notion it's worth this--
notional amount

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.360
of U.S. super senior.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.660
That sounds safe.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.370
Super senior, ABS-- that's
short for asset back

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.200
security-- CDOs-- we know
a lot about CDOs now,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.580
collateralized and obligations--
to an affiliate

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.650
of Lone Star Funds.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.260
So this is a Texas private
equity firm.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.090
I'll underlined them in green,
because I think they know what

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.510
they're doing.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.680
For purchase price
of $6.7 billion.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.540
So just off that first line,
just very superficial, before

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.950
we do any other real analysis,
notice that, at one time,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.670
there was an asset that someone
had a notion was worth

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.410
$30.6 billion.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.190
And now they sell to
this private equity

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.220
firm for $6.7 billion.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.280
So what's the recovery
on that asset?

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.070
Just superficially?

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.160
And we're going to dig in a
little bit and realize that

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.330
recovery is even worse
than that.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.850
They're able to sell for $6.7
something that they originally

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.520
thought was worth $30.6.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.190
So that's $0.22 on the dollar.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.040
So this, at least what that
first sentence implies, it is

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.260
$0.22 on the dollar.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.560
At least relative to the
original amount that the those

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.440
assets were booked at.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.330
At the end of the second
quarter of 2008.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.730
Notice, the end of the second
quarter of 2008 was four weeks

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.120
ago relative to this
press release.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.320
That's June 30, four
weeks ago.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.920
Not like can happen
in four weeks.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.220
At the end of the second quarter
of 2008, these CDOs

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.470
were carried at $11.1 billion.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.940
So this is interesting.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.050
So Merrill Lynch, at one point,
probably last year, had

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.020
these assets on their balance
sheets for $30.6 billion.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.640
They, too, realized that they
were stinky assets.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.510
And they said, well, we have
to, just to be somewhat

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.480
genuine, we have to write down
these assets a little bit.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.120
And notice, they don't want to
write them down too much,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.860
because if they write them down
too much no one else is

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.320
going to want to invest
in Merill Lynch.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.160
Or maybe they'll say Merrill
Lynch might not even have

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.760
anything left.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.230
But at some point, they said,
you know what, we will be

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.680
pseudo honest with the market.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.110
And these things that were worth
$30.6 billion, we're

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.690
going to write them down
to a $11.1 billion.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.740
So they must have taken-- if
they did that in one period, I

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.880
don't know how many periods it
took them to realize that this

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.200
$30.6 billion asset was really
worth $11.1-- but in those

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.890
periods, they would have had
to take a-- what is that?

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.060
A $29.5 billion write down.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.490
Right?

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.680
And they did that to look pseudo
honest that the asset

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.670
it is worth $11 billion.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.030
But they valued it
at $11 billion.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.050
And then four weeks later, they
sell it for $6.7 billion.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.520
So whatever was on their books
on-- as far as this asset is

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.060
concerned-- whatever was on
their books on July 1, or on

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.030
June 30, what are they getting
recovery relative to that?

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:13.000
They're getting $6.7 billion for
something that just four

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.260
weeks ago, not a lot can
happen in four weeks.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.519
Woops.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.230
$11.1 and then I can
delete that.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.800
So they got $0.60 on the dollar
relative to what was on

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.690
their books as of June 30.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.170
Right?

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.640
So It's a $0.60 recovery
relative to what they thought

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.170
it was worth only
four weeks ago.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.990
And then they say, in connection
with this sale,

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.310
Merrill Lynch will record
a write-down.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.940
Essentially, now we
sold this thing.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.010
So now we have to essentially
come to terms with reality.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.750
And so they recorded
a write-down of

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.500
$4.4 billion pretax.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.210
And what's $4.4?

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.930
That's the difference between
what they thought it was

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.620
worth, between the $11.1 billion
and what it ended up

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.710
being worth, or $6.7 billion.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.590
What's interesting here
is that's not the

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.290
end of the bad news.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.370
You might think that's
bad enough.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.090
They were only able to get
$0.22 on the dollar for

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.400
something that they originally
valued at $30.6, or what four

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.170
weeks ago they valued at
$11.1 billion, right?

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.600
And I don't think they got
a lot more information.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.770
I think they just put that $11.1
billion down on June 30

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.850
just because it was probably
a convenient number.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.260
Enough of a write-down to make
it look like you're writing

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.940
things down.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.500
But not so much of
a write-down to

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.350
scare people too much.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.820
But this is the interesting
part.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.960
I mean this paragraph talks
little bit about the exposure,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.200
and we can get into that.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.960
But if I talked about that, I
could talk another 20 minutes.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.450
But let's get to this last
paragraph that was buried in

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.160
the press release.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.330
And this is really the
crux of things.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.260
And this, I think, will give you
a clue of the shell games

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.790
that the financial industry
tries to play on people.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.060
Merrill Lynch will provide
financing to the purchaser for

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.180
approximately 75% of
the purchase price.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.260
So Lone Star Funds, they're
buying it for $6.7 billion,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.840
but 75% of that is a loan
from Merrill Lynch.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.120
So how much are they lending?

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.630
6.7 times 0.75.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.030
They're lending them
roughly $5 billion.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.430
Right?

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.690
So Merrill Lynch is lending $5
billion-- I don't like that

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.190
color-- $5 billion.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.030
So Lone Star says these things
are so stinky, we're only

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.280
going to pay $6.7 billion
for them.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.820
And in fact, they're even
stinkier than that.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.330
In order for me to buy them, I
don't even want to buy them

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.110
with my money.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.950
You're going to have to lend
me most of the money to buy

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:39.890
that asset.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.970
And even this wouldn't be so
bad if you just lent it

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.300
generally to Lone Star.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.240
And if one day Lone Star, if
these assets were worth

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.050
nothing, you could still go
after Lone Star's other

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.760
assets, right?

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.530
If you could just go after Lone
Star generally, maybe

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.050
this loan isn't such a crazy
thing because maybe Lone Star

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.830
has a lot of assets.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:57.240
I don't know.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.010
But I suspect that they're
fairly large

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.080
private equity firm.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.260
This is just insult to
injury right here.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.410
You got to give credit to
those Lone Star guys.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.790
The recourse on this loan-- the
recourse is essentially

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.490
what you can go after if the
person decides that they don't

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.440
feel like paying that loan-- the
recourse on this loan will

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.290
be limited to the assets
of the purchaser.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.420
The purchaser will not own any
assets other than those sold

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.220
pursuant to this transaction.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.390
So essentially, what Lone Star
did, because Lone Star does

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:41.420
own assets other than
essentially this asset that

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.130
it's buying right now.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:42.930
I'm guessing it does.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.430
That it's a real private
equity firm.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.790
What they probably did is, they
created a corporation

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.080
that does not own anything
else, right?

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.460
So that if they default,
nothing's left.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.620
So they created a corporation,
they capitalize that

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.400
corporation, with whatever,
$1.7 billion.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:04.970
So essentially Lone star puts
$1.7 billion into the Lone

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.250
Star Funds, or whatever.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.230
An affiliate-- the affiliate
is probably the corporation

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.690
that they created.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.400
So this affiliate is created
by Lone Star.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.820
Lone Star puts in $1.7
billion into it.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:21.070
Merrill Lynch lends this
affiliate $5 billion.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.750
And then this affiliate buys,
or Merrill Lynch is able to

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:29.490
off load this $6.7 billion
on to that affiliate.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.460
And this is a special purpose
entity if I've

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.070
ever heard of one.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.450
Because it's purpose is very
special-- essentially for

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.610
Merrill Lynch to take something
off of it's books,

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.960
and not have to write
it down all the way.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.340
Think about what happens.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.650
Let's say that these
assets are worth 0.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.660
Let's just say that they're
completely worthless.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.340
In the previous video I
showed you why that

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.880
could be the case.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.280
What's the loss to Lone Star?

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.580
Well Lone Star, they
don't have to pay

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.590
the 5 billion back.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.700
We just said the purchaser will
not own any assets other

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.730
than those sold pursuant
to this transaction.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.780
And that the recourse is only
those assets, right?

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.010
So if they don't pay that loan
back, Merrill Lynch, all they

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.290
can do is take back those
worthless assets.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.710
And then what's going
to happen?

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.500
Well then Lone Star is just
going to lose $1.7 billion.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.860
Or even better, what
if those assets are

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.710
only worth $1.7 billion?

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.540
Right?

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.560
Let's think about
that example.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.000
Let's say those assets are
worth $1.7 billion.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.250
And Lone Star says, you know we
don't feel like paying back

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.570
this $5 billion loan.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.640
What's going to happen?

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.930
Merrill Lynch is going to
just take back those

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.270
$1.7 billion of assets.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.370
So what's Lone Star's downside?
$1.7 billion.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.800
So essentially, what are
they paying for it?

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.430
They're essentially paying $1.7
billion, and they're kind

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.610
of sharing the upside in
between $1.7 and $5.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.910
So really, if you think that
they're paying $1.7 or even a

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:53.150
little bit more, what is Lone
Star putting at risk? $1.7.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:58.280
So $1.7 billion divided by--
what was the original notional

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.080
value of this asset?-- So
they're paying $0.06 on the

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.470
original notional value.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.880
And what are they paying
relative to what Merrill Lynch

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.250
told its shareholders this asset
was worth four weeks

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:12.390
before this press release?

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.490
They're paying $0.15 on the
dollar relative to that.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.980
Well anyway, this is a
real world example.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.180
This was not made up by me, and
frankly I don't think I

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.740
could have made up something
this outlandish.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.630
But it hopefully gives you an
idea of what is actually going

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.530
on in the real world.
