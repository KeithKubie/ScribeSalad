[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.350
XAVIER DAMMAN: So Storify is a
platform to tell stories using

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.390
what people post on
social media.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.890
Right now in the web, we were
in an age where we made it

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.130
easier and easier for
people to produce

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.570
content, to share content.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.140
And now we are kind of in this
state where there's kind of a

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.570
way to match content,
and we try to find

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.250
meaning in that content.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.650
We have a bit of information
here, we have a video here, we

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.060
have a tweet here.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.100
So often we tell a
story using that.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.380
So this is really what
Storify is all about.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.510
It's how can we connect the
dots, and tell a compelling

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.440
story in a really collaborative
way.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.680
NATHAN WHITE: Social networking
as a source for

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.630
journalism is becoming more and
more prominent, because

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.130
what's happening is the
traditional news outlets and

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.720
medias are getting their
news from social media.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.990
Like with the Japanese
earthquake, some of the first

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.280
videos and breaking news came
from the social medias from

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.300
the individual people.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.720
XAVIER DAMMAN: YouTube is
a fantastic platform.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.960
People with their mobile phone
can so easy share, take a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.650
video and upload
it to YouTube.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.230
It's so well integrated.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.380
And so it's really a no-brainer
that we need to be

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.940
able to add YouTube videos
and stories.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.400
And we really had fantastic
support from the developer

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.090
advocates at YouTube really
helping us to integrate that,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.560
and really wanted to
create a seamless

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.590
experience for the end user.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.010
Our users are people who don't
understand what an API is,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.180
what embedded code
is, necessarily.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.180
So we just created this really
easy to use, drag-and-drop

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.910
interface, so we can really
tell better stories, more

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.330
engaging stories.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.550
And finding the meaning in the
noise, it's really something,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.620
like kind of the next
step for the web.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.020
And we are really excited
to see that happen.
