00:00:08.587 --> 00:00:09.420
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.010
Well, thank you all for coming
to this Google Play Games

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.250
Developer Summit today.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.500
There's quite a lot of
familiar faces in the audience.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.072
Very nice to see you.

00:00:17.072 --> 00:00:19.880
For those that don't recognize
me, my name is Richard Hyndman.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.820
I'd like to think that I'm
your Guy Dangerous for the day.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.740
Avoiding overrunning session
times and finding treasures--

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.772
digging up treasures from
each of the speakers.

00:00:27.772 --> 00:00:29.230
But there's two
problems with that.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.340
I think the first one is in
a very, very recent poll,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.700
not that many people know
who Guy Dangerous is.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.360
Blank faces.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.960
Anybody?

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.210
One person with Guy Dangerous.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.710
No.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.330
Dammit.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.640
That was supposed to work.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.350
Guy Dangerous, being the lead
protagonist from Temple Run.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.800
And the second
problem being, I'm

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.341
probably a lot more
like Minion Dave.

00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:50.980
Just trying to avoid a bus
smashing me in the face

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.097
right now.

00:00:52.097 --> 00:00:53.930
I've also got some very,
very bad tech jokes

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.380
up my sleeve which I'll pull
out if necessary, later on.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.450
So hopefully it
runs all smoothly.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.120
We've got a fantastic
set of speakers lined up

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.120
for you today.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.494
We're going to run into all
the details of the Play Games

00:01:04.494 --> 00:01:07.610
services, and why
Google is doing gaming.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.670
With Play Games
services, Google is

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.610
aiming to bring you a very
powerful cross-platform suite

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.610
of tools and services for you
to enhance your gaming user

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.420
experience, increase engagement,
and improve revenues.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.430
So with that, I'd like invite
on stage Thomas "Schree-ber",

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.650
Schreiber-- I knew I was
gonna get that wrong-- E-I,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.950
Schreiber, who's going to
talk to us about why Google is

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.631
in gaming.

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:30.130
Thomas.

00:01:35.502 --> 00:01:37.210
THOMAS SCHREIBER: Good
morning, everyone,

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.715
and thank you for coming
here to our office in London.

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:42.090
And it's actually
quite exciting.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.060
This is the first
time-- I mean, obviously

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.130
we've had a number of
Google Developer summits.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.020
But this is the first time that
we have one that is in Europe

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.660
and dedicated only to gaming.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.014
That's quite great.

00:01:56.014 --> 00:01:57.680
Let's maybe start
with a bit of honesty,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.850
because this is a
developer summit.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.640
Who of you have actually written
real code in the last seven

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.140
days?

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:09.570
That's pretty good.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.550
It's impressive.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.920
And for those who didn't
raise your hands, don't panic.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.230
You can stay here.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.860
The conference is also for you.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.860
We'll cover all aspects.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.849
And I have to
confess, I myself--

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.390
it's been actually
a long time that I

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.710
have written serious code.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.590
So I feel with you who weren't
able to raise your hands.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.360
Although a few weeks
ago I actually started

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.360
again working on code, and
actually working on games.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.050
I started teaching 9 to
11-year-olds how to code.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.550
This is using an
environment called

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.360
Scratch where they
actually develop games.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.500
And it's super, super
inspiring to do this and see

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.520
the excitement of children.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.570
But I can also tell you
that of all the things

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.610
that I have to do, this is
the most challenging thing

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.550
that I have to do-- to
try to crowd control 9

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.970
to 11-year-olds, being
excited with their games.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.690
The hope of this program is
that they'll find a [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.790
with this kind of topic.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.420
They stay interested
in technology.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.290
They consider education
in this space.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.010
And then in a number of--
obviously in a couple of years,

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.770
when your companies have
all grown tremendously,

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.340
and you need a lot
more developers,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.480
then I will have personally
gotten the developers for you.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.690
But not only is it
me who helps out

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.080
trying to grow the
gaming industry.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.014
Clearly, it's a huge
growth opportunity.

00:03:41.014 --> 00:03:42.180
That's why you are all here.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.370
You're doing great stuff.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.610
And Google is also investing
heavily in that space.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.800
For example, in Cologne
at GDC last year,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.360
we announced that our favorite
video format-- a TrueView

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.280
that some of you may know from
YouTube, this skippable ad

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.170
format-- that we made this
available on games on the web.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.490
And of course it's available
on mobile apps as well.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.035
And then just last week
at GDC in San Francisco,

00:04:10.035 --> 00:04:13.350
there were just so
many announcements

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.250
on product
improvements that even

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.160
I am struggling to
remember all of them.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.920
And we'll go through
them throughout the day

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.960
in more details.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.520
So importantly, your
game is the key, right?

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.980
You are doing great
at developing games,

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.700
and that's the most
important thing that matters.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.145
But the world has become
quite complicated.

00:04:41.145 --> 00:04:42.520
There are so many
things that you

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.285
need to consider on top of
actually making a great game.

00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:51.040
You need to ask yourself, how
do I make the infrastructure so

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.170
that it scales with your game
as it becomes more popular?

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.950
How do you actually
distribute your game, so

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.070
that you get millions
of users using it?

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.340
Once you have the
users in your system,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.880
how do you engage the
users more deeply?

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.842
And last but not
least, you might

00:05:07.842 --> 00:05:09.300
want to make a lot
of money with it

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.690
as well, so you can pay
your development team.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.520
And so you need to find
the right systems in place

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.130
so you can monetize well.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.060
And what I want to do today
is give you a brief tour,

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.850
running through
the Google services

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.690
on how they can help you
with those specific points.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.000
So let's start with
taking the work away

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.920
on the infrastructure, to
make your games scalable.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.665
You might have heard of this
operating system, Android,

00:05:46.665 --> 00:05:47.165
before.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.280
So clearly, we are
putting a lot of effort

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.330
in developing the
SDK, making it work on

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.490
as many devices as possible.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.090
Android 4.4 KitKat has
been out for some time.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.090
So I'm sure you're
all familiar with it.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.970
But with this release, I feel
we've taken it another level,

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.405
making it available
on even more devices.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.950
We would encourage you to
develop natively on the SDK,

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.550
to really benefit
from the efficiency

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.840
and the responsiveness that
you can get on those devices.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.540
And of course, we also
have put in a lot of effort

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.020
on the developer support so that
you can code, debug, and test.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.135
On the Google Play Games,
this is a great piece

00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:44.880
of infrastructure, so that a
number of real life problems

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.630
that you have, or that
you should consider

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.600
to make your games
more interesting--

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.130
such as multiplayer support,
or keeping scores, et cetera--

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.170
that this level of services
can take care of it

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.330
so you can focus on the
core aspect of your game.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.350
And clearly we heard
you, that if you really

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.200
want to support
multiplayer games,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.820
it needs to be available
across operating systems.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.970
And I believe that was
one of the announcements,

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.000
that it's not only Android,
but also iOS and support also

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.550
for web.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.250
Cloud Save has been
out for some time.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.170
But let me share one of the
frustrations that I have,

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.820
as a gamer.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.760
Like many people in the room,
I have multiple devices.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.120
You've probably all
seen this chart,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.780
that you start in the morning
with your mobile phone.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.970
You commute to work.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.000
Then during the day, you
use your laptop, desktop

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.960
more heavily.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.894
Then you commute back.

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:44.560
You use your phone, and then you
use your tablet in the evening.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.650
A lot of people do that.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.450
It's not just me
who's doing that.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.520
So I find it very frustrating
that when I'm at home

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.690
and I want to use the laptop
I can't play any of the games.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.960
Because a lot of
you still force me,

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.530
that if I start
playing your games

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.150
I have to start from scratch.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.080
I spent so much time and
effort to go up to this level,

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.540
and of course when
I switch device,

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.440
I want to continue
with that level.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.520
So please, just for me,
please develop your games so

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.500
that you save the score
and the level somewhere.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.880
I think that the Google
Play Games service

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.070
is a great and
easy way to do it.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.050
But if you want to do it another
way, just please do it for me.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.680
And of course it's
not only mobile,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.460
but we also have a
great set of tools

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.809
that helps you on the web.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:39.780
So specifically, we
have a set of APIs

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.580
as part of the Chrome packaged
apps, that really allow you

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:48.910
to have web-based games
using HTML, JavaScript, CSS,

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:52.960
so that you can create the same
experience-- so that they're

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.920
as powerful as a native app, but
they're as safe as a web app.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:05.560
It's not just
user-facing technology.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.770
A lot of things need to go
in the background as well,

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.450
to make your game scalable so
that when it really takes off,

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.330
your game works.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.360
And what we have done is--
exactly the same technology

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.200
that we use at Google to
make our system scalable--

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.410
we make that available to you
as a Google Cloud Platform

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.760
service.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.660
I actually look forward to
the session later from Kaj

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.830
from MAG Interactive,
who's going

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.690
to share his experience of
how this is working for him.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.190
So I hope that has
given you some ideas.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.350
I'm sure you know some
of these weren't exactly

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.930
new things, of what services you
can use from Google that helps

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.810
you with the
infrastructure aspect.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.050
But of course, you
want to get to users.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.500
You want to get
millions of users.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.630
You want to get hundreds
of millions of users.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.670
So let's go through, what are
the tools that we can help you

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:04.700
with that challenge.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:11.100
The first one is
again an obvious one,

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.580
and Dan will speak to that in
more detail, of how you really

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.600
get the best out of the
Google Play Platform

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.930
to distribute the game.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.870
But the numbers
speak for themselves.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.870
50 billion downloaded apps.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.420
Another 2 billion every month.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.720
Clearly, this is something
to look into, and really

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.850
optimize for you.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.940
Just as we had before,
don't forget the web.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.880
The Chrome store is
really a fantastic way

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.680
to distribute web
versions of your game.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.390
And it has hundreds
of millions of users.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.530
It is an opportunity that you
should definitely think about.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.910
And I have a surprise for you.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.930
Advertising actually does work.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.340
Obviously, people
will use your game,

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.110
ultimately because
it's a great game.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.870
If you have a game that's not so
great, no level of advertising

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.190
is gonna help with that.

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:18.150
But what you can do is
just to get more users

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.750
to actually discover your game.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.680
So whether it's-- which
this screen is depicting--

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.890
whether it's a focused
text search campaign--

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.790
so if a user is
searching for your game,

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.030
or is searching for
something very similar,

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.150
that you direct
them to your game.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.020
Or whether it's a
re-marketing campaign

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.790
that you have a user who
has played very frequently,

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.130
and somehow they have stopped,
to remind them about it.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.530
Or a re-marketing campaign,
because you have now a game

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.740
that you think would
interest the same user.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.760
Or you want to
attract completely

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:56.020
new people, new players, and you
use more rich engagement ads.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.610
Either videos or
display ads, so that

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:02.760
you can really tell the story of
the visual appeal of the game,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.090
and create that experience.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:07.390
It definitely does work.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:17.450
Now once you start
paying for users,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.546
you have to look
into metrics that you

00:12:19.546 --> 00:12:20.545
spend your money wisely.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.510
The cost of user acquisition
is not necessarily

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.520
the most important aspect.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.490
So let's just assume
that the game that you

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.750
want to distribute is
actually a free game,

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.100
and you want to make money
through in-app purchases

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.490
or through advertising.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:41.340
So no matter what you
have spent to acquire

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.420
that particular user, if that
user only downloads the game

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.950
and doesn't actually
play it, that

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.900
was not a very smart investment.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.880
And so really look
for-- is that you

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.200
need the deep analytics
to figure out,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.160
how do you get the
return on you investment?

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.860
How would you get that user
who was actually making

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.430
the purchase, is making
the in-app purchase,

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.910
or is playing the
game long enough so

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.510
that you can show them enough
ads that it actually pays off

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.030
for you.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:12.850
One of the great things where
our product suite really helps

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:17.060
you, is that we now have very
deep integration between AdMob

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.950
and analytics, so you can easily
see that segmentation to really

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.256
understand which campaign
is working for you and which

00:13:24.256 --> 00:13:24.755
isn't.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.400
So now we're in a good state.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.950
You have hundreds of
millions of users.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.000
Clearly they will
stay in your game,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.810
because it's a great
game experience.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.890
But what other services
can Google help you with,

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:48.230
just to deepen the
engagement even further?

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:55.710
First one-- and we'll hear
about that later today as well--

00:13:55.710 --> 00:14:00.010
I think it's the next
session, actually--

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.710
on how to have
multiplayer support.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.180
I won't go too much into detail.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.360
But in essence, the more
you can get your users

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.120
to play with their friends,
play against their friends,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.190
share things with their friends,
the more they are delighted,

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.620
and the better the
experience is for them.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.327
And this is a solution that
we make available to you

00:14:18.327 --> 00:14:20.410
so you don't have to do a
lot of coding around it.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.620
Of course the same
is true for the web.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.930
And I just wanted to point
out-- one thing that I get a lot

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.510
of positive feedback from
publishers who have a strong

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:37.890
web presence, is that if you use
the Google+ sign-in process--

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.780
similar to Google Play that
you can purchase something

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.670
on the web and it gets
downloaded to your Android

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:48.290
device-- when a user logs in on
your service using the Google+

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:52.690
functionality, you have the
ability to directly download

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:56.850
and install the mobile app that
you want on the user's devices.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.480
So I think that's
another great way

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:05.770
how to distribute
your applications

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:09.280
Let's see how well
you know your YouTube.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.990
And anyone from Google
is not allowed to answer.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:16.040
Who knows what is the most
popular channel on YouTube

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.140
by number of subscribers?

00:15:20.492 --> 00:15:21.700
AUDIENCE: Probably PewDiePie.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.890
THOMAS SCHREIBER: Exactly.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.440
He's got 25 million subscribers.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.290
And it's incredible.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:29.790
If you think about all the
content, all the videos, all

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:32.240
the channels, it's
actually the gaming sector

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.440
that is the number one.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.160
I think this is an area that
is almost like a hidden secret.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.300
And more can be made of it.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.780
Gaming content is
incredibly popular on video.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.450
And Ibrahim will go
into more details later.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.440
But because it is
like that, it's

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.370
good to think-- to both use
it as a promotional tool

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.070
to show the power of your
games, the experience

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.900
that people have--
but also think

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.550
about in your games,
either using video actually

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:05.960
in the games, or if someone has
had a nice gaming experience

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.852
can you use, for
example, YouTube APIs,

00:16:08.852 --> 00:16:11.435
that they can share that gaming
experience with their friends.

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:20.600
And then obviously, you want
to listen to your users.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.170
You want to have a game
where the comments they give,

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.920
the ratings they give is high.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.510
If you have high ratings,
your ranking is higher,

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:37.020
you get more users, you make
more money, life is good.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.810
And we have a mechanism
to give that feedback.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.670
So focusing on
quality is important.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.770
At the same time,
what is crucial

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.100
is don't just put out
your game and then

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.690
hope that users will love it.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.320
Because the reverse
can also happen.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.040
That if users aren't happy
they give you bad ratings,

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.110
and then everything
spirals down.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.120
So what we would recommend is
that you use the alpha and beta

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.150
testing tool that we have.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:07.440
So you can test it out with
a trusted group of gamers.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.339
And they will give
you the feedback.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.640
And then in a dialogue
you can improve your game.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.839
And only when you know you are
really ready you push it out,

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.659
and you got much more success.

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:22.079
Right.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:26.390
So now we come to last section.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.339
You have a scalable game.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.490
You have reached lots of users.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.430
They stay even more
engaged with the game,

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.470
spending more time because
of all the social features--

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:36.910
YouTube engagement, et cetera.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.320
But I guess most of you actually
want to make money out of it.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:47.230
The obvious, and very,
very important mechanism,

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.840
is of course to sell your game.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.580
And with Google Play
supporting to sell your game

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.310
in over 130 countries, that's
of course a great opportunity

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.790
how to make money.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:04.010
But life is more complicated.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.270
Clearly, this is a
fantastic revenue stream,

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:12.480
how to sell money-- not
selling money, making money.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.830
But the sad truth
is that when you

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.340
look behind the
actual numbers, it's

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.320
a very, very small
percentage of users

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.950
who are willing to pay
money for your games.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.880
A recent study that
I have read claimed

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.920
that the majority of revenue
made from in-app purchases

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:33.090
or from up-front purchases
is less than 0.2 percent

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.500
of your users.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.230
So if that is the case, then you
should ask yourself, well what

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.160
about the other 99.8
percent of the users.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.690
Are you OK to not make
any money out of them?

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.570
Personally how I think
about this challenge is,

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.660
I think it's less a question
whether you personally

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.620
think ads are a
great thing or not.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.950
But users have a preference.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.790
So some users are willing to
pay money to get an experience,

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.640
and some are not.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.240
And for those who are not
prepared to make money

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.180
advertising, I think is
a very legitimate way

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.350
for you to make money
for all the hard work

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.280
that you have done.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.140
And actually, we have
worked very hard on this.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:18.820
I think it would be fair to
say that two years ago, AdMob

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:24.690
was merely a demand platform,
that we help you to get ads.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.630
But it has grown tremendously.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:33.490
It is now a fully working
advertising solution,

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.920
in that it's deeply
integrated with Google Play.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.360
So for example, if
you want, at run time,

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:45.720
to figure out, should I actually
have an in-app purchase ad,

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.140
then we have that
integration and it

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.700
puts you directly
to the Play Store.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.060
It also is deeply
integrated into analytics,

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.060
which is very important.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.810
Because those users who
pay you a lot of money--

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.770
well maybe, even
though you love ads,

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.690
you may not want to
show them any ads.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.340
And you need exactly
that segmentation--

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:09.970
getting all the signals out of
your application from analytics

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:11.910
all combined, so
that you can dice

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.390
and slice the user
to really give--

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.890
to really use the optimal
monetize strategy.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.080
Now clearly, you are in control.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:25.110
But get the most out
of this opportunity.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:27.430
So this is one way how to do it.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.840
For those users who don't
want to pay for your app,

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.050
you can have a display ad.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:36.860
But of course that's not
the only thing how to do it.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.260
I think another
great way how to do

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.890
it is to have more
engaging formats.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:44.230
And I think the skippable
ad format that we provide,

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.280
I think is actually another
fantastic mechanism.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.810
So let's say-- clearly not
in the middle of the game,

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:55.340
but once the user has
reached a certain level--

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.480
and it's the kind of user who's
not giving you money anyway--

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.670
why don't you show
them a skippable ad?

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.850
And then the user has a choice.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.690
They can either skip the ad,
and continue playing your game.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:08.590
And that's fine, because they're
not interested to see the ad.

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:12.310
And so the value to the
advertiser's also not so great.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.460
Because they want the audience
to engage with their ad.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.740
Or, they actually decide
that they want to see the ad,

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.880
and then it's fantastic
for the advertisers

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.720
and they're willing to pay
a lot of money for that.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.280
And so this is the
experience that we provide.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:35.320
I just wanted to mention, given
that at Google the majority

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.540
of revenue comes
from advertising,

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.650
clearly this is our
bread and butter.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.750
And the tools that
we use internally,

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.270
we also make available to you.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:49.160
So if you are a very
large games company,

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.290
and you have your
own sales force that

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.680
goes out in the market
and sells it directly,

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.840
obviously we can offer
you the same tools

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.100
that any big company
uses to really make

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.310
that a scalable process.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.880
And it's all fully integrated.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.190
So it works with AdMob
and it works with video,

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:10.170
and it works across
all platforms,

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.740
and it's all the same system.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.730
And I even take a personal bet
that no matter what advertising

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:21.590
solution you have-- because
of all this deep integration--

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.240
I would take a personal bet
that we would generate more

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.970
revenue than any other system.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.530
So that was kind of
a marathon running

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.260
through the different products.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.790
We will hear more details
in the later session.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:42.470
And I hope it has given
you an idea of how

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:46.880
we can make-- how we can help
you in the development process,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.580
to make your games
more scalable.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.660
How we can help you to
generate more users,

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.250
whether it's from
organic traffic

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.730
or whether it's
from paid traffic.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:02.130
The tools that you can leverage
so that your game is more

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:02.730
engaging.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:07.210
And last but not
least, how you can

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:09.640
make as much money as possible.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.140
Because at the end of the day
you're running a business.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.400
But let's not keep forgetting
the most important thing

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.180
is that you continue
writing fantastic games.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.160
Thank you very much.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.947
