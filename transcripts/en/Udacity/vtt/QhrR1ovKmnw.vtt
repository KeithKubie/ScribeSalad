00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:03.713
Data Science
is a 21st-century job.

00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:06.530
Data just keeps coming.
There's more and more of it,

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:08.564
and we need more people
to process it

00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:10.504
and draw conclusions.

00:00:12.753 --> 00:00:13.843
My name is André Costa

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.622
and I work with Business
Intelligence at Gympass.

00:00:16.697 --> 00:00:19.261
Originally
I grew up in Brasília.

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.578
I've played a lot
of videogames as a kid.

00:00:21.653 --> 00:00:23.699
I've always loved technology

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:26.365
and dreamed
of being a programmer

00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:28.643
to make my own
videogames.

00:00:29.136 --> 00:00:30.760
I have a degree in Business

00:00:30.877 --> 00:00:33.713
and I'm getting my 6th
Udacity Nanodegree.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.032
I started studying
Introduction to Programming

00:00:37.107 --> 00:00:38.861
to get a firm grasp,

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:41.215
and then I took
the Data Analysis

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:42.743
and the Machine Learning
courses.

00:00:42.818 --> 00:00:45.729
Now I'm also taking the course
on Artificial Intelligence

00:00:45.804 --> 00:00:48.430
in order to have a good grasp
of these subjects.

00:00:48.884 --> 00:00:51.219
I came to São Paulo

00:00:51.294 --> 00:00:53.797
after I was offered a spot
in the Sales Department

00:00:53.872 --> 00:00:55.273
of Gympass.

00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:58.761
Later I had the chance
to move over to BI,

00:00:58.878 --> 00:01:00.654
because there was
an open spot.

00:01:01.165 --> 00:01:04.124
I took it. I had the knowledge,
I had worked with that.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.926
I thought:
"Why not go for it?"

00:01:05.955 --> 00:01:08.196
I changed departments
a few weeks later.

00:01:08.313 --> 00:01:11.317
I've worked in BI
ever since.

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.153
Gympass is still a very new
company.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.248
That is why we experiment
a lot

00:01:16.365 --> 00:01:18.300
and that's why we need
Data Science,

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:21.172
to understand what's going on
in each experiment

00:01:21.786 --> 00:01:24.369
and draw conclusions
about the best way to act

00:01:24.444 --> 00:01:27.031
in each of the new things
we try,

00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:29.092
whether it is an expansion
in a new country,

00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:30.985
or a new department
we'll create,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.677
or a new kind of contract
we'll do.

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:38.642
I've made projects
for Gympass

00:01:38.717 --> 00:01:41.061
where my Udacity courses
were of great help.

00:01:41.136 --> 00:01:43.276
For instance,
I built a dashboard

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:44.885
that used several tables.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.076
In order to gather
all this information in one place

00:01:48.314 --> 00:01:51.607
the Udacity course on databases
served me well.

00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:54.731
I also did a client
clustering analysis

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:56.731
for different
client profiles.

00:01:56.806 --> 00:01:59.443
This clustering
model building

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:01.430
I learned at Udacity.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.914
For my career

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:09.779
I want to work at the boundary
between Tech and Business

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.924
to try and unite
these two worlds,

00:02:12.016 --> 00:02:13.314
draw useful conclusions

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.032
and with Data Science,
to move the world forward.
