00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:04.437
 (upbeat music)

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.676 size:88% position:44%
 - A liberated woman
 is one who has sex

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.047
before marriage and a job after.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.418
Women have two choices,
either she's a feminist

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.186
or a masochist.

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:23.523 size:84% position:42%
  - [Voiceover] Chloe Grace
  Moretz is Gloria Steinem.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:26.493 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Jesus, what a
 bossy, naggy Nancy.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.328 size:88% position:44%
  God, and the shrill voice.

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:31.531 align:start position:0%
  Does it remind you of
  Britney or what you guys?

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:34.233 size:84% position:42%
  - Okay you realize that
  that's a huge compliment.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.468
 - Oh my bad.

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:36.436 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Kevin's just
  bummed because the

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.471
 cisgender white male is done.

00:00:38.504 --> 00:00:41.541
Witness the future Father Time.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:42.742 size:88% position:44%
  - Hey guys can I
  ask you something?

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:45.511
 Do your bosses ever make you
 ask inappropriate questions?

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:46.645 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I don't understand
 the question.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.148 align:start position:0%
- I once asked Jennifer
Lawrence what her cup size was.

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:50.683
- You asked her that on camera?

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.085
 - Never mind.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.453 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I guess my site wants
to get into gossip

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.188 align:start size:88% position:13%
  because numbers
  are a little flat.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.722 size:84% position:42%
  They want me to ask Chloe
  about who she's dating.

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.324
- That's always a winner for me.

00:00:58.357 --> 00:00:59.525
 - That sucks.

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:00.660 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I just feel weird,
you know, as a grown man

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:03.029
 asking a young girl
 about her love life.

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:04.764
 - How else are you going to
 know if she's available, man?

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:06.365
- Okay, you guys are all idiots

00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:09.235
 and you clearly know
 nothing about feminism

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:12.238 size:88% position:44%
 because you're men, so just
 stick to non controversial

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:15.608
 subjects like her diet
 secrets or refugees.

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.376
So the movie, oh my god.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.279 align:start position:0%
 I loved it, as a woman,
 Gloria Steinem has been a huge

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:23.249 align:start position:0%
 influence on me since I
 googled her a half hour ago.

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:25.785
 I honestly thought like women
 were always equal with men.

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:27.687
 - You never dealt with
 any discrepancy there?

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.389 size:88% position:44%
  - No, because like
  in our generation

00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:32.325
 things are different for us.

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:34.460 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I think we're
 around the same age.

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:36.062
 Right, like early 20s?

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:36.796 size:88% position:44%
 - I'm sure.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.799
- Yeah early mid late 20s, 30s.

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:41.300 size:84% position:42%
  - I'm 19.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.202
 - Okay yeah, so like
 around the same age.

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:44.537
 - How you doing, you
 doing good today?

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.404
- Yeah.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:46.839 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You look great,
 anyways, did you want

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:47.673
 to talk about this
 movie or can we just

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:48.641
stick on Little Mermaid?

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:49.442
 - I'm here promoting this, so.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:50.376
- Right.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.711
- [Chloe] I think we
should talk about that.

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.112 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - They warned me
 you would kind of be

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:54.280 align:start size:88% position:13%
 like this, but that's
 cool, whatever.

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:56.616
 - Oh man, you know, I'm such
 a big fan of all your work.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.117 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Like Gloria's
 great, but of course

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.519 size:88% position:44%
  I gotta bring up Kick-Ass.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:01.020 align:start size:88% position:13%
 It's so great
 because Hit-Girl is

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:03.456
 not afraid to just hit people.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.358 align:start position:0%
 - I don't really agree with
 violence, it's a movie.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.459
 - Oh yeah, me neither.

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:08.494
- It's all art and fun.

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:10.062 align:start size:88% position:13%
- It's just that people,
some of the people

00:02:10.095 --> 00:02:11.564
 I work with are so mean to me.

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:13.533 size:88% position:44%
 It's like the prettier they
 are, the meaner they are.

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.168 size:88% position:44%
 If I could be like.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:17.737
 - I mean frankly she
 changed the world.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.672 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Let's not get too
carried away here, okay?

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:21.140 size:84% position:42%
  I mean she put a
  silly little idea

00:02:21.173 --> 00:02:22.408 align:start size:88% position:13%
 in a lot of girls'
 heads that they could

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:24.377
go out there and be the
boss of somebody okay?

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.645
 That's not written in
 any playbook I know.

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:27.146 size:88% position:44%
 It's not even in the Bible.

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.182 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I mean what did
 Glo-glo here really do

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.450
when you think about it?

00:02:31.483 --> 00:02:32.284
 - Wow.

00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:33.686 align:start size:88% position:13%
 First of all, no
 one's even speaking

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.322
 about menstruation before her.

00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:38.491 align:start position:0%
 - You know what, let's
 just keep this classy okay?

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:40.059
 You don't need to
 get disgusting here.

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:42.528 size:84% position:42%
  We got to put this on TV.

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:44.197
- You're a Neanderthal.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.298 size:88% position:44%
  You understand that right?

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.500 align:start position:0%
 No wonder everyone says
 you're gonna get fired soon.

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:48.568
- All right missy, I don't think

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.236 align:start size:88% position:13%
  you need to get
  rude with me here.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.738
- You literally can't
handle the word vagina.

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:54.440
 (gags)

00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:55.374
 Uterine wall.

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:56.342
 - Ugh.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:57.176 size:88% position:44%
  - Fallopian tubes.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.544
- Oh god, oh ew.

00:02:58.577 --> 00:02:59.445 size:88% position:44%
  - Ovaries.

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:00.513
 - Ew, ew, ew!

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:04.483
 I was wrong.

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:05.651 size:88% position:44%
 Chloe Grace Moretz
 has the upper hand.

00:03:05.684 --> 00:03:07.687
She's a little monster.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.388 size:88% position:44%
 - We're about ready
 for you, and just

00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:13.259 size:88% position:44%
  a friendly reminder, stick
  to the film okay, great.

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:14.427
 - Hey, buddy.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.464
 You owe it to America to keep
 them stupid and entertained

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:22.268
so go be that guy, okay soldier?

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:28.641 size:88% position:44%
  - [Voiceover] Name
  and affiliation?

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:30.443
 - Brian Butler The Downloader.

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:31.577
- Oh my god, I know you.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.812
 I've read your work.

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:34.680 size:88% position:44%
 You're actually a
 really good writer.

00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:35.681 size:84% position:42%
  - Oh wow, thanks.

00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:37.083
 You've read my work?

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.451 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Yeah well you're
 like a real journalist

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:40.519
 unlike those fools out there.

00:03:40.552 --> 00:03:41.353
 I mean they're total clowns.

00:03:41.386 --> 00:03:42.688 size:88% position:44%
 They have no idea
 what they're doing.

00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:44.123 size:88% position:44%
 What do you want to ask me?

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:45.558
 - So now that you've
 had the chance to play

00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:47.793
 a feminist icon, how
 has that influenced

00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:50.429 size:84% position:42%
  your outlook on being a
  woman in today's society?

00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:52.531
 - Thank you so much
 for actually asking me

00:03:52.564 --> 00:03:54.500
a question that means something.

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:57.169
Gloria came of age in
a very oppressive time.

00:03:57.202 --> 00:03:59.572 size:84% position:42%
  It just made me feel very
  honored and privileged

00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:02.074 size:88% position:44%
 to be a young woman
 in the time period

00:04:02.107 --> 00:04:03.242
that we're living in right now.

00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:04.477
 - Such a smart answer.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.512 size:88% position:44%
 You're such a smart
 lady who I'm sure

00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:09.148
could talk on any number
of interesting subjects.

00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:10.650
 - Yeah, I'd love to.

00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:15.154 size:84% position:42%
  You okay?

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:15.655 align:start position:0%
  - Yeah no, we're probably
  out of time right?

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:16.622 size:88% position:44%
 We're good?

00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:17.556 size:88% position:44%
 - No we have, we have time.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:18.724 size:88% position:44%
  - Ask me another question.

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:20.026 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - These things
 just really fly by.

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:21.227 align:start size:88% position:13%
- No, I'm like
actually enjoying this.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.328
 - Oh, great.

00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:23.195 size:88% position:44%
 So.

00:04:23.228 --> 00:04:25.264
(clears throat)

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:26.165 size:88% position:44%
  Who're you dating?

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:27.533
- What was that?

00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:30.369
 - Who are you dating?

00:04:30.402 --> 00:04:32.772
- Sorry I can't, I can't
hear what you're saying.

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:35.074
 - Who are you dating?

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:36.275 size:88% position:44%
  - Are you serious?

00:04:36.308 --> 00:04:37.409 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I'm so sorry,
 I'm just a soldier.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:41.514 size:88% position:44%
 You know what I mean like,
 we all do what we gotta do.

00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:45.418
- I am here doing press

00:04:46.518 --> 00:04:48.788 size:88% position:44%
 for Gloria Steinem.

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:52.291
 You come in here and you ask
 me who I'm fucking dating!

00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:53.459
- I'm so sorry.

00:04:53.492 --> 00:04:54.527 size:88% position:44%
  - Who am I dating?

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.528
- I had marching orders.

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:56.562 size:88% position:44%
  - Get out.

00:04:56.595 --> 00:04:57.463 size:88% position:44%
 Get out of my room.

00:04:57.496 --> 00:04:58.397
- Come on there's more.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.198 size:84% position:42%
  - Go, go!

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:04.236
 I actually liked you!

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:06.072
 I wanted you to interview me!

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:07.640
 And you fucked it up!

00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:13.512
 - Hey.

00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:14.680
 - Hey.

00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:16.015
 - [Britney] You okay?

00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:16.782
 - You guys have a key?

00:05:16.815 --> 00:05:18.217 size:88% position:44%
 - [All] No.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.585 size:84% position:42%
  - No they don't
  give those to us.

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:21.621
- Should I text someone?

00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:24.190
- Chlo?

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:26.956 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Are you going by
 the vending machines?
