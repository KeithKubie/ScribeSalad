00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.510
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: We're going
to leave quite a bit of time

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.360
after the presentation
for questions.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.660
So, about 15 minutes.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.740
There's microphones
in the aisles

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.910
if you guys want to queue up.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.750
And, I have been asked to
remind you that if you come

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.660
up to the microphone, you'll
be included in the videotape

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.190
of the event, which may be
broadcast at a later date.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.610
So, you'll be preserved
for all time

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.550
with your brilliant questions.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.310
It's my absolute pleasure
to introduce my guest,

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.060
Sandhya Menon, author
of the two brilliant

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.230
and successful YA novels,
When Dimple Met Rishi,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.510
and From Twinkle, With Love.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.190
Menon is an active
Twitter account,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.820
where she reminds her readers
that her name rhymes with

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.700
"Stunned-ya Melon," which
I think is the most clever

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.940
pronunciation guide I've seen.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.770
When Dimple Met Rishi was a
New York Times best seller.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.610
And, From Twinkle, With
Love published in May.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.740
So, I mentioned the
Q and A. But,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.110
also Menon will be
signing books.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.410
So, if you have your copies,
and you want to get them signed,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.580
she will be signing books at
11:30 here at the festival.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.450
So, Sandhya, I want to
start by thanking you

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.160
for the absolutely lovely
weekend, which I spent

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.950
in the company of
Dimple and Twinkle.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.680
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Oh, thank you.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.980
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: I
found both characters to be

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.150
so honest, and warm, and true.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.200
And, I found reading these books

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.080
to be a really joyful
experience.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.050
Was writing them a
joyful experience?

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.350
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.980
I like to say that,
especially now, I really look

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.920
at writing as my escape.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.420
And so, nothing gives me
more pleasure than going

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.410
into an office and getting to
spend hours with characters

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.710
who I know are going
to be OK in the end.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.060
And, who makes lots of
corny jokes along the way,

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.830
and I get to write kissing
scenes, and get paid for them.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.720
I mean-- I'm so lucky.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.910
So, absolutely, yes.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.220
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly:
These are books

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.490
that are absolutely
about representation.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.790
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Right.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.380
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: And, how did
you find your way into the voice

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.800
of your young characters?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.460
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: It was
definitely trial and error.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.920
I was actually self-publishing
before my publisher, you know,

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.100
found me and all that stuff,
so I was writing for adults,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.420
and then the opportunity to
write young adult fiction came,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.460
and I was absolutely having a
moment, like, can I do this?

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.960
I've never down this before.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.110
And, you know, I
haven't been a teenager

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.970
for quite a long time now.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.130
So, I had to go back to, you
know, what was high school like,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.000
which for me was extremely
painful and awkward.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.030
And, I didn't know what was
happening half the time,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.750
because I had moved to
the U.S. when I was 15,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.790
right in the middle
of high school.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.720
But, there was such great
fodder to mine there,

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.220
because of those experiences.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.090
And, although my
characters are all American.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.690
They're, you know,
American-born, I think some

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.850
of those high school
experiences are very universal.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.560
And, they are still burned
fresh in my mind to this day.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.340
So, I think I'll have lots
of material for a while.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.930
And then, plus, in my
other job, I'm a therapist,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.690
and I work with a lot of
adolescents, so, you know,

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.170
I absolutely don't write
about my clients, of course.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.140
But, you know, it
helps me stay current

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.100
with what's important
to adolescents now.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.400
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Yes.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.700
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.430
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: For both of
these characters, their passion,

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.820
or I think, when they're
a little bit older,

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.070
I hope that their
profession is so core

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.680
to how they see themselves
in the world.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.260
Why did you do that with
both of these characters?

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.760
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: I think
one of my favorite things

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.050
in the world is passionate
people.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.150
And, I remember when I was
in high school, I don't know

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.450
if people have this perception

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.020
that adolescents don't
really know what they want,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.000
or you know, they're
wishy washy,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.110
but that wasn't my experience.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.950
Every friend I had, and
almost every person I knew

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.120
in high school, was
absolutely passionate

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.480
about what they wanted to do.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.550
Ad, even the adolescents
I see now,

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.610
everybody has this kernel
inside of them, and sometimes

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.520
that kernel is stomped out,
or, you know, people are told

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.360
that it's not important,
and don't pursue that,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.970
and that's not a
worthwhile career.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.270
But, it's still there.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.010
And, that to me is, kind of,
what makes adolescents shine

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.720
so brightly, is that it's
just this entire world

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.020
of possibility.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.840
And, you could go
anywhere and be anything.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.080
And, that's so incredible to me.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.620
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: How did you
go about getting the details

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.450
of their passions,
coding or film making,

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.450
how did you get those
details right?

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.040
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon:
So, with coding,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.450
it was a lot more
challenging, because contrary

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.160
to what some readers think,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.970
I am not a technical
kind of person at all.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.700
So, I had to reach out to a lot

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.070
of different people
in the field.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.040
My husband is actually
in cybersecurity,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.080
and he had a lot of contacts.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.360
I reached out to other female
friends who were in STEM

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.140
and asked, hey, this is
what I'm trying to say.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.620
How do you say it in
technical language?

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.920
You know, that kind of thing.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.500
And then, also what would a
coder, kind of, think about?

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.300
And, how does she think?

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.290
The way she thinks is very
different from how I think,

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.110
because I'm much more
creative and a writer,

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.570
versus, you know, a coder.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.130
And then, as far as-- there's,
in Dimple, there's a lot of talk

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.210
about females in--
female coders.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.730
And, that was my research.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.420
I just went online and read a
ton of articles about, you know,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.860
the challenges that
women in STEM face.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.250
So, I have done-- I
have some psychological

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.550
research background.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.460
And so, while that's
not coding, research,

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.130
kind of, has the same issues.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.430
And so, I was able to draw

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.380
on my own experiences
for that as well.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.680
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Yes,
there's a great scene

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.580
where she sits down
with her idol.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.590
She doesn't win the contest,
but she gets the chance

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.890
to sit down with here.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.190
And, they have a really
frank conversation

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.380
about the challenges women
face in the workplace.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.680
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Right.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.470
Yes. And, I think that's
what was so important for me,

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.050
was that there has to
be a female mentor.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.150
I am tired of, you know,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.710
this idea that there are no
female mentors, because this is

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.010
such a male-dominated field.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.470
They're actually there,

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.730
they just don't get the
spotlight a whole lot.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.180
And so, I really wanted
to show Dimple connecting

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.920
with this woman who
had gone before her,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.220
and done the things
that she wants to do.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.780
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: So,
let's switch to Twinkle.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.860
She wants to be a film maker.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.160
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.460
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: And, she's
writing all these letters

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.760
to female film makers.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.310
And, I kind of [inaudible]
confirmed with you beforehand,

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.680
there's 17 different film
makers that she writes to.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.980
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.280
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly:
Where did you come

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.310
up with this list of
women film makers?

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.770
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: So, I was--
as I was researching this book,

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.610
I saw this statistic
that said in 2016,

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.850
which was only 2 years ago,
out of the top 250 movies made,

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.810
only 7% were directed by women.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.420
And, that doesn't even
count, you know, ethnicity,

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.680
or LGBTQ community status,
or anything like that.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.170
So, I started thinking,
well, how many movies--

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.470
because I love movies,
and I was like,

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.050
how many movies have I watched

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.910
that have had women
film directors?

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.220
And, I couldn't think
of that many.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.900
So, I went on this quest to
watch movies directed by women

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.340
so that I could write this book,

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.750
and know what I was
talking about.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.360
And, in the process, I also
bought a bunch of books

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.100
where female directors talk
about their experiences,

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.780
and things like that, which
was really amazing to, kind of,

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.760
see firsthand, what they, you
know, what they were dealing

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.060
with as they went through it.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.380
And, so that's kind
of my research,

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.490
was actually watching
the movies.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.420
Of course, you know, my husband
would come in and I'd have,

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.290
like, popcorn all over me,
and I'd be watching Netflix.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:44.960
I'm like, go away, I'm working.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.370
Yes, it's, like,
the best job ever.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.670
[laughs]

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.970
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: How
do you like your popcorn?

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.270
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon:
How do I like it?

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.570
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Yes.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:54.870
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: I
like caramel popcorn,

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.170
so I'm all about the sweetness.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.470
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: OK.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.040
Did you have a favorite that you
revisited, or that you watched

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.030
for the first time when you
were doing the research?

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.360
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: I actually
happen to love Ava DuVernay,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.680
and I watched a lot
of her documentaries.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.200
Like, I'd watched Selma already.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.810
And then, I went back and I
watched Middle of Nowhere,

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.110
and some of her other ones.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:19.320
And so, that was, kind of,
really, like, life-changing

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.200
for me, because Ava
DuVernay's story is just very

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.620
inspirational, and Twinkle has
a Ava DuVernay poster because,

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.850
you know, that was borne
from my absolute devotion.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.150
So.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.590
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Did you see
A Wrinkle in Time in theaters?

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.890
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: I did!

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.190
Yes. And, I loved that.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.490
It was incredible.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.790
I loved that.

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.090
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: I feel

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:40.390
like there's something
really incredible

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.690
about the way she
took this classic--

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.990
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Right.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.290
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: -- novel
that so many of us had read,

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.590
and really turned
it into what felt

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.890
like a totally new story to me.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.190
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: I know.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.830
Exactly. And, I feel
like it's about time

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.470
that we saw different people

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.870
in the main characters'
roles, you know?

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.610
Like, I don't think any
of us, when we read it,

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.610
when we were kids envisioned
Meg as ever being black,

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:01.910
because she wasn't in the book.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.160
But, in the movie she is,
and it absolutely works.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.460
I love that.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.080
I love being shown new
worlds and new people, in,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.630
you know, old, kind of, roles.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.930
Yes.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.200
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Was there
a logic to how you paired

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.120
up which film maker she
wrote to with the contents

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.940
of the letter she wrote to them?

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.240
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.710
So, this is kind of a
behind the scenes look.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.630
When I first wrote Twinkle,

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.550
I sold it before Dimple
had even come out.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.990
And so, at that point, I
hadn't really thought--

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.260
and, my publisher hadn't really
thought of a brand for me,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.860
or what kind of books I
was going to be writing

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.550
for the rest of my career.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:44.430
So, I had written this book
as a very dark literary novel.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.800
And so-- I know.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.680
What was I thinking?

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.490
So, when Dimple came out, and it
did well, my publisher was like,

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.280
yes, you know-- they just
pushed the manuscript back

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.660
across the desk and said
this isn't really going

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.380
to work anymore.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.080
So, if any of you are writers,
you'll know that there's no way

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.110
to shoehorn an old
idea into a new voice.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.220
So, I basically had
to delete 80,000 words

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.220
of fiction, and re-write it.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.760
It's OK, I'm over it now.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.390
So, yes, so originally
it was very--

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.740
you know, with the
literary novel,

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.820
it was very closely
tied together.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.340
There was-- she would very
carefully explain what the film

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.440
maker's film had
been about and tie it

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.070
to what she was going through.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.070
However, as the book
got lighter in tone,

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.030
a lot of that had to go.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.990
So, sometimes you'll still see
glimmers of that on the page,

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:43.070
but I didn't quite delve as
deeply into it this time.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.370
Yes.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.670
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly:
How do you watch films?

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.970
Do you like theaters?

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.270
Do you watch like
watching alone?

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.570
Do you watch them in groups?

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.000
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: I
love watching alone,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.130
because I get very
easily annoyed by people

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.070
who talk during the movie.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.720
And, I'm like, I'm
trying to watch!

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.120
So, even my family,
I'm like, shh!

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.300
Stop munching your
popcorn so loudly.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.720
A moment is happening, so.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.540
I tend to watch alone,
by myself,

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.260
especially documentaries,
because not a lot

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.650
of people enjoy documentaries,
at least not

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.450
in my family, or in my life.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.830
And so, I tend to-- it's

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.410
like a very spiritual
experience for me.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.750
I have to sit down, like
me and the film maker.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.240
You know? How weird
does that sound?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.260
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Why
do you like documentaries?

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.720
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: I feel
like there's a truthfulness

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.270
and a realness to
them that you--

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.480
I don't want to say you
don't get in other films,

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.770
but it's just on a
different level for me.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:42.240
And, I feel like I learn so
much about different things

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.670
that I would never
have considered

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.180
if I hadn't watched that film.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.170
So, to me, that's sort
of like indie movies too,

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.940
because they just--
they're different,

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.240
and they make you think.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.320
And, they present
different problems to you

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.930
than you're usually faced with.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.230
So.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.530
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Do you have
a favorite documentary that you,

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.580
sort of, press on people and
say you have to watch this?

00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.880
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: No.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.180
I knew you were going
to ask me that,

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.670
and I should have
researched this.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.450
Any of Ava DuVernay's, but--
well, those are, kind of--

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.220
they're based on her experience,

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.000
they're not really
documentaries.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.710
But, there's one about--
maybe you know this one.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.080
But it's about clothing waste.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.670
And, it's really powerful,
and it was recommended to me

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.800
by a college professor,
like, couple years ago.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.490
I think it's still on Netflix.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:27.060
But, it's amazing how much
clothing waste happens

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.490
in our country, and ends
up in the landfills.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.380
Anyway, I'm not going to bore
you now about clothing waste,

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.510
but if you're interested,
I think it is on Netflix.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.810
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly:
Alright, we'll look it up,

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.150
and we can tweet about it later,
and share it out with everyone.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.450
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:42.750
That's true.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.050
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly:
Something to look forward to.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.550
So, one of the ways that
I, just, found myself

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.150
in these books is
the way you write

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.750
about mothers and daughters.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.210
You've said in previous
interviews that Dadi,

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.000
who is Twinkle's grandmother,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.860
was one of your favorite
characters to write.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.160
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Right.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.460
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Talk
about that a little bit.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.510
Why was she your favorite?

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.060
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: I-- so,
in From Twinkle, With Love,

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.900
Twinkle has a very different
relationship with her parents

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.340
than Dimple does in When
Dimple Met Rishi, so-- sorry.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.980
Twinkle's parents are very
disengaged from her life.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.380
And, while that happens a lot,
I wanted her to have somebody

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.590
who was unconditionally
supportive of her, and believed

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.150
in her, even in those times that
she didn't believe in herself.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.960
And, Dadi was absolutely
that person.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.740
But, also Dadi kind of,
marches to her own tune.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.350
And, she is very kooky, and very
eccentric, and kind of strange.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.710
But, she and Twinkle
have this incredible bond

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.270
that nothing can break.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.800
And, I really love the
idea of showing this mentor

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.430
for Twinkle who's
always in her corner,

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.110
even when Twinkle doesn't really
know who she is in certain parts

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.440
of the book, and she's
trying to figure it out.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.040
But, Dadi's always,
like, this constant.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.810
So.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.110
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Yes.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:57.220
Twinkle's mother suffers
from depression in the book.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.560
How did you land upon writing
about depression in one

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.370
of your main characters?

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:05.920
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Honestly,
personal experience.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.280
I feel like when we-- when
my parents and I migrated

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.310
to the U.S., I could see that
my mother was struggling a whole

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.880
lot with the move.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.030
And, she was extremely isolated.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.960
She was actually a
very social person.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.670
But, when we moved to the U.S.,
she had no friends at all.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.270
We had lost a lot of our
wealth and resources,

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.230
and so she didn't really have,
you know, a way to get around,

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.230
and make those connections
any more.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.690
People didn't understand
her when she spoke,

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.660
even though she spoke
English, really,

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.210
you know, perfect English.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.840
But, it was heavily accented,
so people don't understand her,

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.790
and this was in the '90s, so
there was a lot less acceptance,

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:45.360
and so, she spent a lot of
her time alone, at home.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.590
And, it was a really hard thing
to watch, because as a teenager,

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.080
I wanted to go out
and do things,

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.030
and explore my new
world, and my new culture.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.410
And, she was just completely
shut down, and shut in.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.020
And, I wanted to explore that,
because I feel like we don't see

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.970
that a whole lot when we
talk about immigration, and,

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.970
you know, moving completely away
from everything that you know,

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.730
especially as an adult,
how difficult that can be.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.110
And so, I wanted to portray
her mom in a real way,

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.620
but also hopefully
in a sympathetic way.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.920
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Yes.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.130
I really appreciated that her
mom is not magically fixed

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.430
by the end of the book.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.730
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Right.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.030
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: I mean,

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.330
she and Twinkle have found a
deeper connection, I think,

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.050
and Twinkle understands her
mom, but there's not this moment

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:31.410
where it's poof, now you're
not depressed anymore.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.710
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Right.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.010
Yes.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.310
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Which
is very true to life.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.610
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon:
Right, exactly.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:37.910
It's not-- there's no easy fix.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.210
One of her big things
that she struggles with is

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:43.710
that her mom dies back home, and
Twinkle's mom is not able to go

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.910
to her mother's funeral.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.160
And, that is a reality
that a lot

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.320
of immigrants face,
unfortunately.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.340
And so, that can be
really, really, you know,

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.810
hard-hitting and heavy.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.640
And, how do you ever get
over something like that?

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.940
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Yes.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.030
Just takes time.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.330
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Right.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:03.630
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Since we're
talking about hard topics,

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.350
and you sort of referenced
this talking

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.100
about your mother's
experience of not having money,

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:13.860
but you write about class pretty
frankly in both of these books.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.450
I love the scene where
Twinkle is with Dadi,

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.750
and they're carrying--

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.610
she's carrying this bowl
of water for her, right?

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.220
And, she says it's the
first time she's ever glad

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.770
that they live in
such a small house.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.800
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Right.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.100
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: You know,

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.390
or she's visiting her
love interest, right,

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.440
and they have this
really nice house,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.520
and they've got a special glass
carafe for their orange juice.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.580
And, she's like, we don't--
we use a carton, right?

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.880
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: That's right.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.180
What's wrong with a carton?

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.480
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Yes.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.350
Yes. Why did you include
class in your novels?

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.000
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Like I
said, when we moved here,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.460
I lost a lot of-- we
lost a lot of our wealth.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:55.440
My dad was a highly educated
engineer, but when we moved

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.000
to the U.S. it didn't matter.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.580
We lived in free
housing, you know,

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.680
where somebody was stabbed
on my street for $11.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.240
There were sex workers
on our street.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.000
Stuff was stolen out of my house
while I was sleeping in it.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.360
So, we were really, really poor.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.460
And, I remember that I went

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.560
to a little magnet
school, a high school.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.960
And, a lot of the kids there
were, you know, kids of lawyers,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.840
and doctors, and engineers
who had been here for a while.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.400
And, it was so different
seeing that kind of lifestyle,

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.970
when I was, you know-- my car
broke down, my secondhand,

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.770
you know, car that my
dad bought for, like,

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.630
$200 bucks broke down.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:38.350
And so, he had to get his
work to lend him a car

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.720
so he could come pick me up.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.850
And then, meanwhile these kids
in their Beemers, you know,

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:45.770
driving by, like,
oh, what's she doing?

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.070
Is that vintage?

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.290
What does that car
look like that for?

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.370
And, I remember feeling so
isolated because of that.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.220
And, of course, I had
friends who were also

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.120
in similar situations, like me.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.490
But, it doesn't matter
when you're a teenager,

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:00.790
you feel so different.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.690
All you notice is these
people have so much,

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.010
and it's so easy for them.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.520
And, why isn't it
like that for me?

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:12.130
And, I wanted to put poverty
in a rom-com, because I feel

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.690
like it doesn't happen enough.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.360
And, you know, just
like ethnicity.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.940
Ethnic minorities don't
have to have a book about

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.560
"the struggle" all the time.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.060
Poverty doesn't have
to be in books about

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.630
"the struggle," either.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.930
So.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.230
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Right.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:28.530
It could just be a fact
of a character's life.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.830
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.130
Right. Exactly.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.430
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly:
Everyone always wants

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:33.730
to know about process, right?

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.030
You've written two
super-well-received novel,

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.010
while you have a whole
profession on the side.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:41.210
Do you set yourself
word count goals?

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.350
Do you go into a novel knowing
how long it's going to be?

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.160
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon:
So, I have it easy

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.330
because after I sold a couple
of contracts, I have, you know,

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.230
I'm pretty much a
full-time writer.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.960
I work part-time as a therapist.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.620
So, I have a lot more time than
people who work during the day

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:02.240
in another profession, but I
still do set word count goals.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.880
And, usually when I'm drafting,

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.850
that's 2,000 words a
day, five days a week.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.270
And, that will get you
to 10,000 words per week,

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.570
which is pretty quick.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.150
You can finish a novel in
about 8 weeks that way.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.130
That doesn't count
editing for course,

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:17.670
which is a whole
nother ballgame.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.660
So, not my favorite part.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.270
But, yes, I have to treat
it like a job where I sit

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.930
down at my desk every-- you
know, when my kids leave

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:28.130
for school, that's my,
kind of, start time.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.870
And then, I don't
get up from there

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.750
until I'm done with my goal.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.050
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Wow.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.350
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.650
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: What
do you read while you're

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.950
yourself writing?

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.570
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Lots
of different things.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.430
I tend not to read YA
while I'm writing YA.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.890
Because then it, like,
seeps into my writing.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.950
I'm like, did I just
plagiarize that whole page?

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.970
So. That's bad.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.590
So. I tend to read a
lot of non-fiction,

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.200
or adult fiction to, kind
of, balance things out.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.820
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: And, is
there a prompt or a thing

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.370
that you do, when you've
got writer's block?

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.670
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.330
So, for me writer's block is

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:09.440
about not knowing
where to go next.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.140
So, I realize then that I need
to plot a little more closely,

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.710
and so I'll get up and
actually go somewhere else

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.940
and plot what I need to do
next, and just brainstorm.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.240
Because when I'm
sitting at the desk,

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.610
I feel like I'm staring
at my computer.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:23.910
Nothing's coming.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.210
So, I need a change of pace.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:27.140
Or, if that doesn't work,
I'll just get up and, like,

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.770
go for a walk or a
hike or something.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.240
Because I live in Colorado, so
there's lots of outdoorsy stuff,

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.420
so you can just walk out
your door, and, kind of,

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.400
get lost in the woods,
and you know,

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.470
it helps shake things free.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:42.690
&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Let's
talk about rom-coms

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:44.450
which you already,
sort of, mentioned.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.300
We're having a rom-com
moment right now.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.600
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.860
And, I am so excited about that.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.560
Finally our time has come!

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.860
[laughs]

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.160
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly:
And, it also feels

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.920
like we're having this moment

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.510
of these refreshingly
non-problematic rom-coms, right?

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.460
Where you can, like,
just lose yourself.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.760
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.380
You're like, wow, that
was remarkably sexist.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.260
You just slipped that
in there, did you.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.890
I know, and I love it.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:15.960
And, we were talking
earlier about this.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.630
You know the rom-com
with Taye Diggs,

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.310
where the assistant
sets them up?

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:21.610
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:22.910
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Set It Up.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:24.210
I love that one.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.140
I was so, like, I just
could watch it 1,000 times.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.940
I love To All The
Boys I Loved Before.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.240
I mean-- yes.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.810
Right? I love that it's
become this phenomenon.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.560
It's just amazing to me.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.860
I'm so excited.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.160
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Yes.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.800
I think having more diverse
rom-coms made them better.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.350
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Exactly.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.650
Yes.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.020
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: You
just teased your next novel,

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.090
which is a sequel to
When Dimple Met Rishi.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:48.390
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.690
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly:
So, which was harder?

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.570
Writing your second novel
or writing a sequel?

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:52.870
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Oh, God.

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.350
The second novel
There's, like, no contest.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.340
Like, deleting 80,000 words,

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.560
I will always carry
those scars with me.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.860
[laughs]

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.160
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: [laughs]

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.750
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: You know,
actually, both the Dimple novel,

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.130
and the companion
coming out next summer,

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.730
they were both remarkably
easy, and, like,

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.060
who am I to fight that?

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.930
You know? I'm just
going to go with it.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:16.230
So. Yes. No.

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.710
These were my easy novels.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.430
Twinkle was the one
that really hurt.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:22.730
[laughs]

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.030
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly:
[laughs] Sounds good.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:25.640
Well, do you all want
to start lining up,

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.690
and let's get some
questions from the audience?

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:29.990
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon:
That would be great!

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.290
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Yes.

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:37.770
And, I'll say, forgive us,

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.840
because we're a little
bit blinded by the lights.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.280
We see you as sort of a shape.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.760
If we look puzzled, that's why.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.060
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: [laughs]

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.360
&gt;&gt; Morning.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.660
Hello?

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.960
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Yes, hi!

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.710
&gt;&gt; Good morning, my name's
Marissa [assumed spelling].

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.220
First of all I just want
to clear my conscience

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.770
if that's OK, and check that
you still have those 80,000

00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:59.070
words somewhere.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:01.910
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: [laughs]
They have been saved

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:03.210
in the Reject folder.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.600
&gt;&gt; Very good.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.290
So, my question is, what
are some of the challenges

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.740
that you face in
trying to normalize

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:17.230
or empower young adults
reading your novels?

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.530
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Oh.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:19.870
Some of the challenges
that I face--

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.170
that's such a great question.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.970
I'm like, where do I begin?

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:27.010
I think that still
people think that--

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.830
they're struggling
to put me in a box.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.060
They're, is it rom-com,
or its it multi-cultural?

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.360
Where should we put you?

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.660
And, more often than not,

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.280
they tend to go towards
multi-cultural.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.830
And, I don't tend to like that
box, because this is a story

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:45.950
about American kids who
happen to be Indian American.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.800
But, they are American kids,
and if they were white,

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.380
you would probably
not think twice

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.560
about saying it's
a romantic comedy.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.560
And so, this is why I've
come to the conclusion

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.670
that I'm not going to
do panels, or interviews

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.470
where the only focus
is diversity,

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:05.410
and how are you changing the
landscape by writing these kids

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.710
who are not mainstream,
because this is mainstream now.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.930
And so, that's, kind of, my
challenge still, I think,

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:12.700
is showing that this
is mainstream now.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.890
But, that's why I love
the romantic comedies

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:16.490
that we were talking
about earlier.

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.470
Because that's all
normalizing it.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.200
So, yes.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.790
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.630
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Thank you.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:26.930
&gt;&gt; Hi, Ms. Menon.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:28.230
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Hi!

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:29.530
&gt;&gt; I was wondering, you've
been writing rom-coms,

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:30.830
you've been saying that
you watch rom-coms,

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:35.120
what's your main, like, favorite
part of the rom-com genre?

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.420
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Oh!

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.650
What's my favorite part?

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.440
Can I say, all the kissing?

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.460
Is that too trite?

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.320
No, I'm going to say
something deeper.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.460
Wait, this is being recorded.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.340
[laughs] No, all the kissing.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.870
That's all I got.

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.930
&gt;&gt; Thank you, ma'am.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.430
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Thank you.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:00.810
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:02.110
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Hi.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.410
&gt;&gt; My name's Olivia [assumed
spelling], and I just wanted

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.520
to ask, like, I read your
books, and all, like,

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.020
the characters are very
unique from each other.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.710
So, like, how do you go
about writing each character

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.450
with their own unique
voice and personality?

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:17.250
And, do you draw any influences
from your real life from that?

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:18.680
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Oh,
what a great question.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.930
And, thank you for saying that.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:25.530
I like to imagine my characters
kind of like a mini-movie

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:27.820
in my head before I write.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.570
So, I'll just think--
I daydream a lot.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:33.520
And, my husband will be
like, that's not working.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.200
And, I'm like, yes it is.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.500
Prove otherwise.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.880
But, I think that daydreaming
is so important for writers.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.470
Because you have to, just sit,
and, kind of, let it marinate.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:44.790
You can't just start typing.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.570
At least for me,
it doesn't work.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.780
So, every time I think of
a character, I will write

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.080
down the character's
name, and, like,

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.030
some basic details about them.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.700
And then, I'll spend
up to half a day,

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.150
even for secondary
characters, just daydreaming

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.450
about the things they like,

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:01.720
what they might do
in a funny situation.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.750
You know. What they do
when things are hard?

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.090
What do they do when
things are easy?

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:06.510
That kind of thing.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:07.810
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:09.890
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Thank you.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.310
&gt;&gt; What is your favorite
part to write?

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.710
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: My
favorite part to write.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.720
I love writing endings.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.800
Endings are really fun for me.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.530
And, I hate writing beginnings.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:23.730
Like, beginnings,
just getting started?

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:27.100
I don't know if it's the
tyranny of the blank page,

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.650
or I feel like it has to be the
best novel in the world, or,

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:31.980
you know, it's not worth it.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.280
I don't know.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.740
But, beginnings always stump
me, and endings are so great.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.400
I love writing endings.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.700
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.000
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Thank you.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.300
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly:
I can't believe

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.600
that there's not a longer line.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.220
I know you all have questions.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.590
Yes. They're getting up, OK.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:46.890
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yay.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.190
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Well, while
they get to the microphone,

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:50.080
do you ever let yourself
write the ending first?

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.380
Or, do you make yourself wait?

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.680
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: No.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.760
I absolutely make myself
wait, because I feel like,

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.930
if you wait enough, things
that you didn't realize before,

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:01.340
you can tie together in a much
more satisfying way in the end,

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.580
that you didn't know, oh this
was a theme through the thing.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.430
So-- and plus, it's kind of
like saving your dessert.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:10.530
If you eat your dessert first,
don't want to eat your dinner?

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:12.600
So. If I just turned
in an ending,

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.970
I don't think my publisher
would like that too much.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.860
&gt;&gt; Hello. Good morning.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.160
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Hi.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.860
&gt;&gt; You've mentioned before,
certainly, that, you know,

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.750
that you have a husband,
and you have kids,

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.550
and I'm not sure
necessarily how old they are,

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.220
but I'm curious how
you incorporate them

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:35.570
into your process, or, sort of,
talking about what you're doing

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.260
with your family, and how
they help you in terms

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.660
of producing the novels

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.840
that you've also come
out with thus far.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.140
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Oh, yes.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:47.260
So, my husband is-- he's
got, I think I mentioned,

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:51.470
he's a very tech guy, and
so he's got a very logical,

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:55.080
kind of brain, which is not so
great with the creative stuff.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.160
But, it's great if you have,
like, plot structure problems,

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.180
or other mechanical issues.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.890
He's great at saying this is
why this part's not working.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.860
And so, I use him
a lot for plot.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.400
And then, my kids are 9 and
10, so they're a little young.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:16.120
But, my daughter actually cried
when she saw the Dimple cover,

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.480
because she was like,
somebody who looks like us!

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.480
And, she was so excited.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.880
And, she keeps asking me, like,

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.350
every six months,
can I read it yet?

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.780
Can I read it yet?

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.260
Not yet! You're only 9.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:31.970
So, yes. She's like my
encouragement to keep writing.

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.360
&gt;&gt; Morning.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.660
That actually inspires me

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:41.590
to ask a different question
than I was planning.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:42.890
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Ask both!

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.500
&gt;&gt; Well, your covers for
your books are amazing.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.040
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Thank you.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.240
&gt;&gt; Covers are so important,
and yours are beautiful,

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.680
and so perfectly rom-com-y.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:57.020
Can you talk a little bit about
the process you went through?

00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:00.480
How much input you had on
the way the covers looked?

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.780
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:05.840
So, I am very lucky in that
my publisher consults me

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.140
on the cover.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.540
And, they actually send
me model portfolios

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.250
so I can pick the exact model.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:16.030
And, on the books, like
there's the front cover,

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:19.060
and the back cover has,
like, the male model too.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.540
Which I love, so I get
to pick two models.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:25.830
And, get to look at
pretty pictures of models.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.400
[laughs] But, anyway, so yes,

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.140
I actually get a
decent amount of say.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.700
They don't ask me
from, you know--

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.370
and I wouldn't want
to be in there

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:38.140
from the beginning to the end.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.590
But, they say this is, kind of,
the direction we're thinking.

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.890
What do you think?

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:43.190
And, I'll say yes or no.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:45.670
And then, you know, I'll
request little tweaks and stuff,

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.210
and they usually do them.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:51.440
So, I'm really lucky in that,
yes, I get to do, I think,

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.840
I lot more than authors
typically get to do.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:30:00.090
&gt;&gt; Can I ask-- this is sort
of the inevitable question,

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:03.240
but other than the
companion novel to Dimple,

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.230
what are you working on next?

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.430
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Oh, you said
other than the companion novel?

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:12.810
Oh, yes. So, I have
a series in the works

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.130
that I haven't announced yet,
even though I sold it, like,

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:17.190
a year and a half ago.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.490
So--

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:20.270
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: We're
breaking news on the stage!

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.570
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: I know!

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:22.870
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: A series.

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:24.560
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Oh, wait, I
forgot this is being recorded.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.560
[laughs] So, it is
a whole new trilogy,

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.290
and it's set in a
boarding school.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:33.380
And, it's a boarding
school for elites, like,

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.440
there are some royals and some
British aristocrat-type people.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.740
And, they're based
loosely on fairy tales.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.010
So, while there's
no magic, per se,

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.420
they are contemporary novels,
there is, like, a is it a curse

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.930
or isn't it a curse
kind of thing.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:53.250
And, the first one is based
on Beauty and the Beast.

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:55.260
[laughs] Thanks for asking that.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.560
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly:
I'm excited now.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.860
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yay.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.160
I'm so excited.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.460
I can't wait.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:06.110
I can't wait until I can
actually publicly talk about it.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:07.410
[laughs] I'm dying.

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:08.710
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Have you
already written the first one?

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.010
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: I have!

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.880
Yes. And, I just finished the
first round of edits on it.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.180
So. I know!

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.480
I'm dying.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.760
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: We've
got a few more minutes,

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.700
are there any other
questions from the audience?

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.550
You all are being so polite,
and saving your questions.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.160
I know you're burning up.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:28.470
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Right.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:29.770
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Ah, yes.

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:31.070
Please.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:32.370
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon:
There's two of them.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.800
&gt;&gt; When Dimple Met Rishi,
I'm assuming was inspired

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.100
by the Nora Ephron
movie, with the title?

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.280
You know, because it's
like when Harry Met Sally,

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.480
and I was wondering if
the title came first,

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.470
or how did you choose
[inaudible].

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.700
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Oh, so it
was actually originally Dimple

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.950
and Rishi, very simple,
like Eleanor and Park?

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:54.130
And then, my editor had
this idea, she was like,

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:56.930
what about for the Dimple
universe novels, if we take,

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.510
like, a classic rom-com,
and change it up?

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:01.350
And so, When Dimple Met Rishi,

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:04.580
and then the next one is
There's Something About Sweetie.

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.040
Like, There's Something
About Mary.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.710
So. I just loved that idea.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.010
I was like, yes.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:11.470
Because it's like
rom-coms have rebooted,

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.110
like we were talking about.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.410
Yes.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:19.250
&gt;&gt; Do all of your books
have happy endings, or no?

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.070
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Did
you say happy endings?

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.370
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:23.670
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Oh, yes.

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:28.370
If they didn't, I would never
be able to forgive myself.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:29.670
[laughs] Yes.

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:31.130
All of them do.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:32.430
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.730
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Thank you.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:35.030
That's so sweet.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.540
&gt;&gt; Hi. I wanted to ask how
you go about, like, planning

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.090
or outlining your novels.

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:41.150
Like, what is your
process for that?

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:42.450
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Oh.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:44.290
If you're on Instagram,
you can follow me there.

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:46.470
I post a lot about my process.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:49.220
I post pictures, and
videos, and stuff.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:55.120
So, I plot out, and I use little
sticky notes to do my whole arc.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.800
And, if you haven't looked into
the Plot Whisperer workbook,

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.680
I highly recommend that.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.270
It's by Martha Alderson.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:06.730
And, it's an amazing way to
begin plotting your novel.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.030
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:09.640
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:13.000
&gt;&gt; Hi. So, I feel like we've
been talking about rom-coms

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.460
so much, so I feel like I have
to ask, are there any movies

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.680
in the works for
either of your books?

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.980
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Movies?

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:24.060
Oh! So, unfortunately, like,
you have to have, like,

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:29.140
a super duper super clearance to
talk about that kind of stuff.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:34.610
So, there has been interest
in the Dimple books,

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.000
but it's like super early days,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.730
and a lot of times things never
happen past the early days.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.780
So, that's all I have to
share right now, sadly.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.080
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Ooh.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.380
Something to keep us waiting.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.680
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.980
Fingers crossed.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.280
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.580
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes, exactly.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:53.880
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: We
should all keep asking

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.180
for the movie adaptation.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.480
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Exactly.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.780
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly:
Right, well, so, Sandhya,

00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.080
thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.380
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Thank you.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.680
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: And, I hope
everyone gets a chance to check

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.980
out her books, if
you haven't already.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.000
And, we will wait
in anticipation,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.770
not only for the
next Dimple book,

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.280
but also for your new series.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.580
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Thank
you so much, Phoebe.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.880
&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly:
Alright, thank you.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.180
&gt;&gt; Sandhya Menon: Yes.

00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.480
Thanks, guys.
