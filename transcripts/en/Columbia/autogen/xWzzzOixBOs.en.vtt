we're always watching it from our values

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760
we're always watching it from our values
 

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.310
we're always watching it from our values
or understanding from the present and

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:51.320
or understanding from the present and
 

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.380
or understanding from the present and
what happened and so therefore we can

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:53.390
what happened and so therefore we can
 

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.990
what happened and so therefore we can
never truly kind of feel what they felt

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000
never truly kind of feel what they felt
 

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.490
never truly kind of feel what they felt
but it gives us the sense that we might

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:57.500
but it gives us the sense that we might
 

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.860
but it gives us the sense that we might
be able to in the same way that watching

00:09:59.860 --> 00:09:59.870
be able to in the same way that watching
 

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:03.100
be able to in the same way that watching
the film on the Holocaust might tend to

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.110
the film on the Holocaust might tend to
 

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.480
the film on the Holocaust might tend to
give you the belief that you know a

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:04.490
give you the belief that you know a
 

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.100
give you the belief that you know a
little bit more about what it would have

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:06.110
little bit more about what it would have
 

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.860
little bit more about what it would have
been to experience that or any other and

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:08.870
been to experience that or any other and
 

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.389
been to experience that or any other and
so this is the tricky part

00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399
so this is the tricky part
 

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:13.360
so this is the tricky part
so as a looking round again on the

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:13.370
so as a looking round again on the
 

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.870
so as a looking round again on the

you're picking something not just

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:48.090
you're picking something not just
 

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.730
you're picking something not just
because it's about a time period or

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740
because it's about a time period or
 

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.320
because it's about a time period or
event you're picking it because it shows

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:51.330
event you're picking it because it shows
 

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.420
event you're picking it because it shows
a certain perspective so that's one of

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:53.430
a certain perspective so that's one of
 

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.190
a certain perspective so that's one of
the big kind of takeaways at least that

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200
the big kind of takeaways at least that
 

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.670
the big kind of takeaways at least that
I've gotten out of the research I've

00:22:58.670 --> 00:22:58.680
I've gotten out of the research I've
 

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.390
I've gotten out of the research I've
done we're going to go back okay so a

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400
done we're going to go back okay so a
 

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.890
done we're going to go back okay so a
little bit of a break away from the

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:03.900
little bit of a break away from the
 

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.650
little bit of a break away from the
documentary but I do that because

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:05.660
documentary but I do that because
 

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.060
documentary but I do that because
documentaries do very much the same

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:08.070
documentaries do very much the same
 

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.220
documentaries do very much the same
thing they reflect the social period the

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:10.230
thing they reflect the social period the
 

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:11.720
thing they reflect the social period the
political views of the people who make

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:11.730
political views of the people who make
 

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.460
political views of the people who make
them the ideological views of the people

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:13.470
them the ideological views of the people
 

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.730
them the ideological views of the people
who make them and they're making a lot

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:16.740
who make them and they're making a lot
 

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.460
who make them and they're making a lot
of the same decisions in a documentary

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:18.470
of the same decisions in a documentary
 

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:20.660
of the same decisions in a documentary
albeit with some kind of this raw

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:20.670
albeit with some kind of this raw
 

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.930
albeit with some kind of this raw
material that they are in future films

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:23.940
material that they are in future films
 

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.370
material that they are in future films
so there isn't that much difference

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380
so there isn't that much difference
 

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.900
so there isn't that much difference
especially in newer documentaries

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:26.910
especially in newer documentaries
 

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:28.430

because they've actually adopted a lot

after 10 it came out in 68 that was

after 10 it came out in 68 that was
 

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.410
after 10 it came out in 68 that was
January 68 was Ted Wright new year and

so it's interesting timing wise in terms

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:32.380
so it's interesting timing wise in terms
 

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:37.020

right spend a little bit of time looking
at why so this was a part of a study I

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:46.270
at why so this was a part of a study I

more data on that coming a little bit
 

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.070
more data on that coming a little bit
later so the second part or factor them

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080
later so the second part or factor them

that all these people could access
 

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.080
that all these people could access

they're giving them the right answer and
 

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.670
they're giving them the right answer and
so at the end I asked two

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680
so at the end I asked two
 

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.110

were the responses of the number of
 

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:15.970
were the responses of the number of
students in the class so four letters

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:15.980
students in the class so four letters
 

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:17.920
students in the class so four letters
about half the students decided it was

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:17.930
about half the students decided it was
 

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:22.600

kind of what they saw as both points of

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:27.890
kind of what they saw as both points of
 

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:32.170
kind of what they saw as both points of
view therefore it was balanced some said

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:32.180
view therefore it was balanced some said
 

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.810

it was for the war and when you see the
 

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.520
it was for the war and when you see the
film this is really an interesting take

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:36.530
film this is really an interesting take
 

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:37.990
film this is really an interesting take
on it although when I started talking

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000
on it although when I started talking
 

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.120
on it although when I started talking
with them I won't mention where this

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:40.130
with them I won't mention where this
 

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:42.340
with them I won't mention where this
study was done but let's just say that

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:42.350
study was done but let's just say that
 

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:44.530
study was done but let's just say that
in head of our largely big history with

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:44.540
in head of our largely big history with
 

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.780
in head of our largely big history with

mama's tear gas what I found was that

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:52.370
mama's tear gas what I found was that
 

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:53.800
mama's tear gas what I found was that
the ones who said it was actually

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:53.810
the ones who said it was actually
 

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:55.660
the ones who said it was actually
supported on the war was because the

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:55.670
supported on the war was because the
 

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:57.430
supported on the war was because the
film was much more positive than what

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440
film was much more positive than what
 

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.320
film was much more positive than what
they heard at home that they sought

00:36:59.320 --> 00:36:59.330
they heard at home that they sought
 

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:01.810
they heard at home that they sought
therefore as supportive of the war so

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:01.820
therefore as supportive of the war so
 

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.400
therefore as supportive of the war so
it's all kind of context related in

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:03.410
it's all kind of context related in
 

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:05.110
it's all kind of context related in
terms of what they were hearing at home

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:05.120
terms of what they were hearing at home
 

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.640
terms of what they were hearing at home
this was a much even though this is

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:06.650
this was a much even though this is
 

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.910
this was a much even though this is
really an anti-war kind of film it was

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920
really an anti-war kind of film it was
 

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.320
really an anti-war kind of film it was
still more positive than what they saw

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:11.330
still more positive than what they saw
 

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:13.150
still more positive than what they saw
so it's all very context related in

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160
so it's all very context related in
 

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.420
so it's all very context related in
terms of when you get to your students

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:15.430
terms of when you get to your students
 

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:18.940
terms of when you get to your students
okay so we have these four kind of ways

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:18.950
okay so we have these four kind of ways
 

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:20.680
okay so we have these four kind of ways
of leading what I'm calling this History

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:20.690

of leading what I'm calling this History
Channel five and then I was thinking

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800
Channel five and then I was thinking
 

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.200
Channel five and then I was thinking
what the heck are teachers supposed to

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:23.210
what the heck are teachers supposed to
 

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.990
what the heck are teachers supposed to
do about it so we're looking at a number

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000
do about it so we're looking at a number
 

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.640
do about it so we're looking at a number
of different ways and they all kind of

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:27.650
of different ways and they all kind of
 

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:29.830
of different ways and they all kind of
center around basically critical

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:29.840
center around basically critical
 

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:39.120
center around basically critical
literacy goals

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:39.130
 
 

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:41.190
 
and the first and easiest is for us as

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200
and the first and easiest is for us as
 

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.019
and the first and easiest is for us as
teachers to stop looking at

00:37:43.019 --> 00:37:43.029
teachers to stop looking at
 

00:37:43.029 --> 00:37:46.200
teachers to stop looking at
documentaries as objective notions of

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:46.210
documentaries as objective notions of
 

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:51.239
documentaries as objective notions of
documentary okay and what I did really

00:37:51.239 --> 00:37:51.249
documentary okay and what I did really
 

00:37:51.249 --> 00:37:53.219
documentary okay and what I did really
think a lot about is trying to get

00:37:53.219 --> 00:37:53.229
think a lot about is trying to get
 

00:37:53.229 --> 00:37:54.749
think a lot about is trying to get
teachers to think more about what

00:37:54.749 --> 00:37:54.759
teachers to think more about what
 

00:37:54.759 --> 00:37:57.120

basically he's saying they aren't saying

00:38:47.249 --> 00:38:47.259
basically he's saying they aren't saying
 

00:38:47.259 --> 00:38:49.140
basically he's saying they aren't saying
they are trying to tell the objective

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:49.150
they are trying to tell the objective
 

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:51.059
they are trying to tell the objective
story of something they're trying to

00:38:51.059 --> 00:38:51.069
story of something they're trying to
 

00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:52.979
story of something they're trying to
frame a narrative that's interesting to

00:38:52.979 --> 00:38:52.989
frame a narrative that's interesting to
 

00:38:52.989 --> 00:38:54.660
frame a narrative that's interesting to
an audience that puts across a certain

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:54.670
an audience that puts across a certain
 

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.789
an audience that puts across a certain
perspective they don't think they're

00:38:56.789 --> 00:38:56.799
perspective they don't think they're
 

00:38:56.799 --> 00:38:58.890
perspective they don't think they're
being objective if you ask a documentary

00:38:58.890 --> 00:38:58.900
being objective if you ask a documentary
 

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.690
being objective if you ask a documentary
filmmaker they wouldn't say there are no

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:00.700
filmmaker they wouldn't say there are no
 

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.279
filmmaker they wouldn't say there are no
educational film maybe but not

00:39:02.279 --> 00:39:02.289
educational film maybe but not
 

00:39:02.289 --> 00:39:04.979
educational film maybe but not
documentary film okay and so I think

00:39:04.979 --> 00:39:04.989
documentary film okay and so I think
 

00:39:04.989 --> 00:39:06.420
documentary film okay and so I think
this is one thing that we as teachers

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:06.430
this is one thing that we as teachers
 

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:08.130
this is one thing that we as teachers
need to think about too is the way that

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:08.140
need to think about too is the way that
 

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:11.099
need to think about too is the way that
we're framing it for students and so

00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:11.109
we're framing it for students and so
 

00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:12.180
we're framing it for students and so
we're gonna look at a few different ways

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:12.190
we're gonna look at a few different ways
 

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.009
we're gonna look at a few different ways
to do this so one is to get students to

00:39:14.009 --> 00:39:14.019
to do this so one is to get students to
 

00:39:14.019 --> 00:39:15.630
to do this so one is to get students to
think about the choices of the producers

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:15.640
think about the choices of the producers
 

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.329
think about the choices of the producers
of the film writers directors people are

00:39:18.329 --> 00:39:18.339
of the film writers directors people are
 

00:39:18.339 --> 00:39:19.620
of the film writers directors people are
doing the interviews people are

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:19.630
doing the interviews people are
 

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:21.420
doing the interviews people are
selecting the stock footage that they're

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:21.430
selecting the stock footage that they're
 

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:23.219
selecting the stock footage that they're
using the stock footage is really

00:39:23.219 --> 00:39:23.229
using the stock footage is really
 

00:39:23.229 --> 00:39:24.599
using the stock footage is really
problematic it's awfully is that the

00:39:24.599 --> 00:39:24.609
problematic it's awfully is that the
 

00:39:24.609 --> 00:39:27.479
problematic it's awfully is that the
context this is the reason why Holocaust

00:39:27.479 --> 00:39:27.489
context this is the reason why Holocaust
 

00:39:27.489 --> 00:39:30.059
context this is the reason why Holocaust
deniers have any usually this is one of

00:39:30.059 --> 00:39:30.069
deniers have any usually this is one of
 

00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.300
deniers have any usually this is one of
the

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:30.310
the
 

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:32.460
the
things that they use that images there's

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:32.470
things that they use that images there's
 

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:33.930
things that they use that images there's
millions and millions of pictures out

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:33.940
millions and millions of pictures out
 

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.570
millions and millions of pictures out
there that relate to the Holocaust but

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:36.580
there that relate to the Holocaust but
 

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.010
there that relate to the Holocaust but
yet when you see what's actually used in

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:38.020
yet when you see what's actually used in
 

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.960
yet when you see what's actually used in
publications and films it's a very very

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:39.970
publications and films it's a very very
 

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.880
publications and films it's a very very
small number because we've found these

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:41.890
small number because we've found these
 

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:43.800
small number because we've found these
iconic kind of images at the Holocaust

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:43.810
iconic kind of images at the Holocaust
 

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:45.990
iconic kind of images at the Holocaust
are used over and over again and the

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000
are used over and over again and the
 

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.070
are used over and over again and the
problem is they're often used out of

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:47.080
problem is they're often used out of
 

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.070
problem is they're often used out of
context and so that opens the door for

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:50.080
context and so that opens the door for
 

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.710
context and so that opens the door for
Holocaust deniers to then say well that

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720
Holocaust deniers to then say well that
 

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.540
Holocaust deniers to then say well that
picture wasn't in this city this was in

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:54.550
picture wasn't in this city this was in
 

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:56.790
picture wasn't in this city this was in
another city and therefore none of it's

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800
another city and therefore none of it's
 

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.500
another city and therefore none of it's
true right I mean gives you a window

00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:58.510
true right I mean gives you a window
 

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:00.480
true right I mean gives you a window
into it and so in the same way a lot of

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:00.490
into it and so in the same way a lot of
 

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.280
into it and so in the same way a lot of
documentaries they take a picture

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:02.290
documentaries they take a picture
 

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:03.900
documentaries they take a picture
because it's powerful that pick a stock

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:03.910
because it's powerful that pick a stock
 

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:05.370
because it's powerful that pick a stock
footage clip because it's very powerful

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:05.380
footage clip because it's very powerful
 

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.290
footage clip because it's very powerful
not because it necessarily relates

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:07.300
not because it necessarily relates
 

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.570
not because it necessarily relates
exactly to what they're saying and so

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:09.580
exactly to what they're saying and so
 

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:10.410
exactly to what they're saying and so
that's one thing

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:10.420
that's one thing
 

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:12.420
that's one thing
the selection of evidence that T's do we

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:12.430
the selection of evidence that T's do we
 

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:14.790
the selection of evidence that T's do we
look at a different Vietnam or a section

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800
look at a different Vietnam or a section
 

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.070
look at a different Vietnam or a section
of the film that's on Vietnam the

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:17.080
of the film that's on Vietnam the
 

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.900
of the film that's on Vietnam the
filmmaker uses a very creative use of

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:18.910
filmmaker uses a very creative use of
 

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:20.850
filmmaker uses a very creative use of
multiple forms of evidence that he's

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:20.860
multiple forms of evidence that he's
 

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.350
multiple forms of evidence that he's
trying to make his point with visually

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:22.360
trying to make his point with visually
 

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:28.830
trying to make his point with visually
and auditorily audibly one of those

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:28.840
and auditorily audibly one of those
 

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:33.270
and auditorily audibly one of those
words you can cut that from the film so

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280
words you can cut that from the film so
 

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.920
words you can cut that from the film so
really trying to get the the author's

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:34.930
really trying to get the the author's
 

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:37.140
really trying to get the the author's
perspective on it and also the audience

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:37.150
perspective on it and also the audience
 

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:39.060
perspective on it and also the audience
that they're trying to talk to okay so

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:39.070
that they're trying to talk to okay so

these are kind of film studies things

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:02.680
these are kind of film studies things
 

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.020
these are kind of film studies things
but I think they can be helpful to think

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:04.030
but I think they can be helpful to think
 

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:05.820
but I think they can be helpful to think
through so we're going to do a number of

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:05.830
through so we're going to do a number of
 

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.250
through so we're going to do a number of
exercises and I'm gonna apologize in

of film is to do a reverse storyboard so

00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:57.220
of film is to do a reverse storyboard so
 

00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:58.230
of film is to do a reverse storyboard so

01:13:31.210 --> 01:13:31.220
know they were all baby killers but if
 

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:33.130
know they were all baby killers but if
they were doing that to show that you

01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:33.140
they were doing that to show that you
 

01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:34.360
they were doing that to show that you
know when these guys came home they did

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:34.370
know when these guys came home they did
 

01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:35.650
know when these guys came home they did
have a rough time but they had a rough

01:13:35.650 --> 01:13:35.660
have a rough time but they had a rough
 

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:37.360
have a rough time but they had a rough
time in it over there and they shouldn't

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:37.370
time in it over there and they shouldn't
 

01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:39.700
time in it over there and they shouldn't
be treated that way right and so this

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:39.710
be treated that way right and so this
 

01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:42.160
be treated that way right and so this
definitely reflects that kind of descent

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:42.170
definitely reflects that kind of descent
 

01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:45.430
definitely reflects that kind of descent
in society now in the 80s that people

01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440
in society now in the 80s that people
 

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.870
in society now in the 80s that people

01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:00.870
only source so that's kind of the issue
 

01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:02.900
only source so that's kind of the issue

little bit short on this section so but
 

01:24:56.130 --> 01:24:57.439
little bit short on this section so but
you do have two perspectives here

01:24:57.439 --> 01:24:57.449
you do have two perspectives here
 

01:24:57.449 --> 01:24:58.910

wrong in the second attack right but
then yo Meryl Moritz kind of putting the

01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360

in so you've kind of got two layers here
 

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.979
in so you've kind of got two layers here
and in a number of documentaries here I

01:25:18.979 --> 01:25:18.989
and in a number of documentaries here I
 

01:25:18.989 --> 01:25:20.330
and in a number of documentaries here I
see that you're gonna see multiple

01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040
that is you need to add on that extra
 

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:14.350
that is you need to add on that extra
layer though so you're not just talking

01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:14.360
layer though so you're not just talking
 

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.060

about what's portrayed in the film but

01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:16.070
about what's portrayed in the film but
 

01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:18.340
about what's portrayed in the film but

the film itself okay we sometimes get
 

01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:21.100
the film itself okay we sometimes get
torn we get all up into what's going on

01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:21.110
torn we get all up into what's going on

torn we get all up into what's going on
in the film story not looking at the

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:23.090
in the film story not looking at the
 

01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:25.180
in the film story not looking at the
bigger picture so how is it framed in

01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:25.190
bigger picture so how is it framed in
 

01:33:25.190 --> 01:33:27.130
bigger picture so how is it framed in
society you know how does it reflect the

01:33:27.130 --> 01:33:27.140
society you know how does it reflect the
 

01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:29.050
society you know how does it reflect the
time and the people who made it and all

01:33:29.050 --> 01:33:29.060
time and the people who made it and all
 

01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:31.240
time and the people who made it and all
those things and this chronic seminar

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:31.250
those things and this chronic seminar
 

01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:32.380
those things and this chronic seminar
works well because that's what you're

01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:32.390
works well because that's what you're
 

01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:33.730
works well because that's what you're
doing when you do literature that way

01:33:33.730 --> 01:33:33.740
doing when you do literature that way
 

01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:35.530
doing when you do literature that way
right you're not just talking about the

01:33:35.530 --> 01:33:35.540
right you're not just talking about the
 

01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:37.120
right you're not just talking about the
story or whatever you read you're also

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:37.130
story or whatever you read you're also
 

01:33:37.130 --> 01:33:38.890
story or whatever you read you're also
talking about the author why did the

01:33:38.890 --> 01:33:38.900
talking about the author why did the
 

01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:40.450
talking about the author why did the
white adopter do this or that

01:33:40.450 --> 01:33:40.460
white adopter do this or that
 

01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:42.130
white adopter do this or that
so in my mind that's why I've been doing

01:33:42.130 --> 01:33:42.140
so in my mind that's why I've been doing
 

01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:43.870
so in my mind that's why I've been doing
a lot of this kind of modified versions

01:33:43.870 --> 01:33:43.880
a lot of this kind of modified versions
 

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:46.000
a lot of this kind of modified versions
of those seminars but it takes time so

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:46.010
of those seminars but it takes time so
 

01:33:46.010 --> 01:33:47.080
of those seminars but it takes time so
the thing I was telling is that you're

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:47.090
the thing I was telling is that you're
 

01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:48.880
the thing I was telling is that you're
going to choose to show something you

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:48.890
going to choose to show something you
 

01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:50.200
going to choose to show something you
know this is why I don't think clips are

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:50.210
know this is why I don't think clips are
 

01:33:50.210 --> 01:33:51.190
know this is why I don't think clips are
necessarily a bad idea

01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:51.200
necessarily a bad idea
 

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:52.720
necessarily a bad idea
unless you do want to give them the idea

01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:52.730
unless you do want to give them the idea
 

01:33:52.730 --> 01:33:54.220
unless you do want to give them the idea
of kind of that narrative arc across

01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:54.230
of kind of that narrative arc across
 

01:33:54.230 --> 01:33:56.740
of kind of that narrative arc across
something but you need to take the time

01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:56.750
something but you need to take the time
 

01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:58.720
something but you need to take the time
then to help them debrief it because you

01:33:58.720 --> 01:33:58.730
then to help them debrief it because you
 

01:33:58.730 --> 01:34:00.220
then to help them debrief it because you
are going to get different perspectives

01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:00.230
are going to get different perspectives
 

01:34:00.230 --> 01:34:02.680
are going to get different perspectives
on it from a whole wide variety as you

01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:02.690
on it from a whole wide variety as you
 

01:34:02.690 --> 01:34:03.729
on it from a whole wide variety as you
can imagine that letters home from

01:34:03.729 --> 01:34:03.739
can imagine that letters home from
 

01:34:03.739 --> 01:34:06.130

01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:07.910
that class going wow you know I'm
 

01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:10.000
that class going wow you know I'm
getting one read on it while other kids

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:10.010
getting one read on it while other kids
 

01:34:10.010 --> 01:34:12.100
getting one read on it while other kids
were absolutely horrified by the

01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:12.110
were absolutely horrified by the
 

01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:13.750
were absolutely horrified by the
violence in it so you're going to get

01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760
violence in it so you're going to get
 

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.430
violence in it so you're going to get
that wide range of perspectives across

01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440
that wide range of perspectives across
 

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:17.320
that wide range of perspectives across
it's good for students to hear each

01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:17.330
it's good for students to hear each
 

01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:19.900
it's good for students to hear each
other's perspectives on it so yeah so

01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:19.910

can you use a short clip from it and

01:34:44.110 --> 01:34:44.120
can you use a short clip from it and
 

01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:45.700
can you use a short clip from it and
have pasted this pretty close to same

01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:45.710
have pasted this pretty close to same
 

01:34:45.710 --> 01:34:50.709
have pasted this pretty close to same
effect yeah

01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719
 
 

01:34:50.719 --> 01:34:52.830
 
so you're probably in the notion of any

01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840
so you're probably in the notion of any
 

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.969
so you're probably in the notion of any
objectivity remembered through

01:34:54.969 --> 01:34:54.979
objectivity remembered through
 

01:34:54.979 --> 01:34:56.500
objectivity remembered through
documentaries and I think that's very

01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:56.510
documentaries and I think that's very
 

01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:59.979
documentaries and I think that's very
valuable now that we have the capacity

01:34:59.979 --> 01:34:59.989
valuable now that we have the capacity
 

01:34:59.989 --> 01:35:02.439
valuable now that we have the capacity
to take out the soundtrack and to go

01:35:02.439 --> 01:35:02.449
to take out the soundtrack and to go
 

01:35:02.449 --> 01:35:04.810
to take out the soundtrack and to go
back to the raw materials and to see

01:35:04.810 --> 01:35:04.820
back to the raw materials and to see
 

01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:08.649
back to the raw materials and to see
what the director didn't use the

01:35:08.649 --> 01:35:08.659
what the director didn't use the
 

01:35:08.659 --> 01:35:11.620
what the director didn't use the
temptation is to regard that as more

01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:11.630
temptation is to regard that as more
 

01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:13.719
temptation is to regard that as more
active access to objectivity that we

01:35:13.719 --> 01:35:13.729
active access to objectivity that we
 

01:35:13.729 --> 01:35:15.819
active access to objectivity that we
didn't have before and wonder what your

01:35:15.819 --> 01:35:15.829
didn't have before and wonder what your
 

01:35:15.829 --> 01:35:17.379
didn't have before and wonder what your
reaction to that is well I mean you

01:35:17.379 --> 01:35:17.389
reaction to that is well I mean you
 

01:35:17.389 --> 01:35:19.509
reaction to that is well I mean you
still are asking certain questions they

01:35:19.509 --> 01:35:19.519
still are asking certain questions they
 

01:35:19.519 --> 01:35:21.009
still are asking certain questions they
picked those people for surgeries right

01:35:21.009 --> 01:35:21.019
picked those people for surgeries right
 

01:35:21.019 --> 01:35:21.909
picked those people for surgeries right
I mean you still have a number of

01:35:21.909 --> 01:35:21.919
I mean you still have a number of
 

01:35:21.919 --> 01:35:23.379
I mean you still have a number of
choices even going into the interviews

01:35:23.379 --> 01:35:23.389
choices even going into the interviews
 

01:35:23.389 --> 01:35:25.899
choices even going into the interviews
that were there but you know compare a

01:35:25.899 --> 01:35:25.909
that were there but you know compare a
 

01:35:25.909 --> 01:35:27.609
that were there but you know compare a
weird time on this earlier to see what

01:35:27.609 --> 01:35:27.619
weird time on this earlier to see what
 

01:35:27.619 --> 01:35:30.040
weird time on this earlier to see what
was left out of that you know if you

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:30.050
was left out of that you know if you
 

01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:31.779
was left out of that you know if you
watched part of that series of where

01:35:31.779 --> 01:35:31.789
watched part of that series of where
 

01:35:31.789 --> 01:35:33.429
watched part of that series of where
maybe that person was an interview you

01:35:33.429 --> 01:35:33.439
maybe that person was an interview you
 

01:35:33.439 --> 01:35:35.439
maybe that person was an interview you
picked a segment that they did include

01:35:35.439 --> 01:35:35.449
picked a segment that they did include
 

01:35:35.449 --> 01:35:37.179
picked a segment that they did include
the interview from and then you watch

01:35:37.179 --> 01:35:37.189
the interview from and then you watch
 

01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:38.469
the interview from and then you watch
some of the raw footage of what else

01:35:38.469 --> 01:35:38.479
some of the raw footage of what else
 

01:35:38.479 --> 01:35:40.149
some of the raw footage of what else
they said I think that's a really

01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159
they said I think that's a really
 

01:35:40.159 --> 01:35:41.709
they said I think that's a really
powerful thing in terms of talking about

01:35:41.709 --> 01:35:41.719
powerful thing in terms of talking about
 

01:35:41.719 --> 01:35:44.169
powerful thing in terms of talking about
why did the filmmaker decide that was

01:35:44.169 --> 01:35:44.179
why did the filmmaker decide that was
 

01:35:44.179 --> 01:35:46.689
why did the filmmaker decide that was
the part to pull out from it you know I

01:35:46.689 --> 01:35:46.699
the part to pull out from it you know I
 

01:35:46.699 --> 01:35:47.739
the part to pull out from it you know I
think I think it can be really useful

01:35:47.739 --> 01:35:47.749
think I think it can be really useful
 

01:35:47.749 --> 01:35:49.270
think I think it can be really useful
the other thing you know that this

01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280
the other thing you know that this
 

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:51.100
the other thing you know that this
project and some of the other ones I've

01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:51.110
project and some of the other ones I've
 

01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:53.020
project and some of the other ones I've
heard that are similar is having

01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:53.030
heard that are similar is having
 

01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:54.969
heard that are similar is having
students create their own documentaries

01:35:54.969 --> 01:35:54.979
students create their own documentaries
 

01:35:54.979 --> 01:35:56.409
students create their own documentaries
from some of this stuff would be really

01:35:56.409 --> 01:35:56.419
from some of this stuff would be really
 

01:35:56.419 --> 01:35:58.449
from some of this stuff would be really
interesting because then the hope would

01:35:58.449 --> 01:35:58.459
interesting because then the hope would
 

01:35:58.459 --> 01:35:59.890
interesting because then the hope would
be that then they would understand more

01:35:59.890 --> 01:35:59.900
be that then they would understand more
 

01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:01.179
be that then they would understand more
of those choices that they made in

01:36:01.179 --> 01:36:01.189
of those choices that they made in
 

01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:02.589
of those choices that they made in
creating their owns that when they

01:36:02.589 --> 01:36:02.599
creating their owns that when they
 

01:36:02.599 --> 01:36:04.120
creating their owns that when they
looked at other documentaries they would

01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:04.130
looked at other documentaries they would
 

01:36:04.130 --> 01:36:05.469
looked at other documentaries they would
get a better sense of what went into

01:36:05.469 --> 01:36:05.479
get a better sense of what went into
 

01:36:05.479 --> 01:36:08.529
get a better sense of what went into
making it - so I think you know I think

01:36:08.529 --> 01:36:08.539
making it - so I think you know I think
 

01:36:08.539 --> 01:36:10.569
making it - so I think you know I think
you still can't say it's it's objective

01:36:10.569 --> 01:36:10.579
you still can't say it's it's objective
 

01:36:10.579 --> 01:36:12.459
you still can't say it's it's objective
because there are still going to be you

01:36:12.459 --> 01:36:12.469
because there are still going to be you
 

01:36:12.469 --> 01:36:14.830
because there are still going to be you
know again they're asking the questions

01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:14.840
know again they're asking the questions
 

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.600
know again they're asking the questions
and it's given within a certain context

01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:16.610
and it's given within a certain context
 

01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:20.140
and it's given within a certain context
but I think it's more raw more primary

01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:20.150
but I think it's more raw more primary
 

01:36:20.150 --> 01:36:22.149
but I think it's more raw more primary
than it would be in a finished product

01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159
than it would be in a finished product
 

01:36:22.159 --> 01:36:24.040
than it would be in a finished product
for sure it'd be the same way in that a

01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:24.050
for sure it'd be the same way in that a
 

01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:27.609
for sure it'd be the same way in that a
primary a diary or something all a

01:36:27.609 --> 01:36:27.619
primary a diary or something all a
 

01:36:27.619 --> 01:36:29.020
primary a diary or something all a
little bit less because the diaries

01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:29.030
little bit less because the diaries
 

01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:30.129
little bit less because the diaries
going to be more of that person's

01:36:30.129 --> 01:36:30.139
going to be more of that person's
 

01:36:30.139 --> 01:36:31.149
going to be more of that person's
thoughts and not sure

01:36:31.149 --> 01:36:31.159
thoughts and not sure
 

01:36:31.159 --> 01:36:32.830
thoughts and not sure
and my questions from somewhere else but

01:36:32.830 --> 01:36:32.840
and my questions from somewhere else but
 

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:36.940
and my questions from somewhere else but
you know it is someone the same way
