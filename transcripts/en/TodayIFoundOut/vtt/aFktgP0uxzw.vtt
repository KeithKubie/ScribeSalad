00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.040
Police Officers and the Color Blue

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.019
Police services like the NYPD and the LAPD
are bona fide pop culture staples that have

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.980
been featured in countless movies and TV shows.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.540
Their distinctive blue uniform is known the
world over, but have you ever stopped to think,

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.820
“Well, why is it blue?”

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.949
If so, wonder no more.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.159
It turns out, beyond some of the modern reasons
for continuing to do it, there initially was

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.269
a very simple explanation as to why blue was
chosen.

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.779
For starters, why they keep the colour today-
according to “The Psychological Influence

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.240
of the Police Uniform“, the colour blue
has several functions in relation to a police

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.010
uniform, one of the main ones being that it
is much easier to clean and maintain than

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.050
a lighter/brighter colour and that it shows
stains and marks less easily.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.989
Intuitively, this makes a lot of sense.

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.180
If someone was thinking of buying 18,000 police
uniforms, they’d probably want to buy the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.929
ones that were easiest to clean.

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.280
Also, nobody would trust a police officer
in a dirty uniform unless he was currently

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.379
holding a kitten he’d just pulled from a
fire or the like; decking officers out in

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.250
a uniform that doesn’t show stains easily
is just good common sense.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.450
Another reason listed by the boys in blue
today is that the dark shade of navy blue

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.360
makes an officer harder to see at night, making
it easier for them to sneak up on bad guys.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.680
In fact, in 1996 Baltimore County police officers
working the graveyard shift stopped wearing

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.200
white uniform shirts for that exact reason.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.060
Of course, whether this is really helping
the officers or not is up for debate.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.030
This change wasn’t backed up by studies
or research of any kind, but to quote one

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.369
of the officers involved in the switch “The
officers feel safer with the dark shirts on

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:34.369
at night.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.810
It’s the perception, and the perception
is as important as reality.”

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.329
Speaking of psychology, according to a study
done at the University of Georgia on 98 test

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.289
subjects (Color-emotion associations: Past
Experience and Personal Preference), the colour

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.430
blue subconsciously evokes feelings of comfort
and security in most people, supposedly making

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.600
it a good choice for people in a position
of authority to wear.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.270
Now, we should point out that colour psychology,
while currently being heavily researched particularly

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.320
by marketers with compelling results, is not
yet fully understood, so take that previous

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.690
sentence with a pinch of salt (or perhaps
a mug full).

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.380
So up to this point, it’s really just been
a matter of practicality and a bit of pseudoscience

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.910
in terms of why police wear blue.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.480
But is that why police first started wearing
these colours?

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.440
It turns out there is a little more to it
than that.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.120
As recorded in the History of the LAPD, when
standardized uniforms became a thing for the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.970
police across America shortly after the mid-19th
century, years after the first state wide

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.330
law enforcement agency (now known as the Texas
Rangers) had been established in 1835, many

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.069
officers were simply given surplus (navy blue)
Union army uniforms to wear.

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.610
Conversely, in the UK when the 1829 Metropolitan
Police Act was brought into effect, essentially

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.269
creating the country’s first proper, paid
police force, they made the deliberate choice

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.671
to dress their officers in blue to contrast
with the, then bright red uniforms worn by

00:02:58.671 --> 00:03:00.370
the British military.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.409
This choice was made almost entirely to distinguish
the officers from military personal, and hopefully

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.920
help make them look more like regular people
on the street; it was also partially for this

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.319
reason that initially, the police in the UK
were unarmed.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.150
In fact, for a time the police in the UK were
literally only given a rattle to call for

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.690
help with and a wooden truncheon.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.510
Regardless of the initial reasoning behind
the choice of the colour blue for uniforms,

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.310
it stuck and as the uniforms in both respective
countries were redesigned and made more comfortable

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.640
and functional for officers as the years went
on, the colour scheme has remained, for the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.580
most part, the same.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.420
As you’re probably aware, not all police
officers in the states wear the traditional

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.400
blue uniform you’d see on a beat cop in
say, New York City.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.030
This is mostly due to the fact that historically
each state was responsible for designing and

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.450
implementing uniforms for its officers.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.629
As a result, not every state went with the
“just chuck ‘em in old Civil war uniforms

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:54.629
approach“.

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.530
In fact, initially, many police officers didn’t
even want uniforms due to the fear it would

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.190
make them a target of mob violence and ridicule.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.189
(Not surprisingly, many officers saw fit to
arm themselves before guns became standard

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:07.189
issue.)

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:11.560
As an example of just how resistant to this
change some law enforcement agencies were,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.590
the Orange County Sheriff’s office didn’t
make a uniform compulsory for its officers

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.010
until 1938.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.070
Bonus Fact:
• Sports teams or athletes wearing red have

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.630
been noted to consistently perform better
in various forms of competition over the long

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.630
haul.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.630
Why?

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.420
Well, no one really knows, but one study to
determine the root cause indicated the officials

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.140
may be at least partially to blame.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.950
Specifically, “As part of their study, the
researchers had 42 experienced Taekwondo referees

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.030
watch two videos, each of which included 11
fight sequences.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.200
In the first video, one athlete wears a red
trunk protector while the other wears a blue

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.200
one.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.600
The second film shows the same exact scenes,
but with the athletes’ colors switched by

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.730
digitally manipulating the tapes…

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:11.290
On average, athletes scored 13 percent more
points when they were wearing red than blue.”
