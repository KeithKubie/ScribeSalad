come out of that is just leverage is

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110
come out of that is just leverage is
 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.069
come out of that is just leverage is
dangerous but that's that's really

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079
dangerous but that's that's really
 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.780

that turned out to be I mean they were
 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.440
that turned out to be I mean they were
worse than banks at determining what's a

very rationalist theories of how the
world worked coupled with this kind of

world worked coupled with this kind of
 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.150
world worked coupled with this kind of
understanding and a lot of classroom

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160
understanding and a lot of classroom
 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.280

views so Shiller came out with this

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190
views so Shiller came out with this
 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.620
views so Shiller came out with this
conventional training but this sense

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630
conventional training but this sense
 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.110
conventional training but this sense
that all these theories and models

that all these theories and models
weren't entirely right and any and he

weren't entirely right and any and he

anything all that explosive but then

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120
anything all that explosive but then

starting to late 70s he started looking
 

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.400
starting to late 70s he started looking
at stock prices and was trying to come

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:30.410
at stock prices and was trying to come
 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.659
at stock prices and was trying to come
up with a measure of whether they

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:31.669
up with a measure of whether they
 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:34.540

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840
subsequent dividend payments and found
 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.270
subsequent dividend payments and found
that the dividend payments were a lot

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.280
that the dividend payments were a lot
 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.830

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.110
less volatile than the stock price
movements and that wasn't proof of

thousand published irrational exuberance
 

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.720
thousand published irrational exuberance
and march two thousand one is exactly

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:57.730
and march two thousand one is exactly
 

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.300
and march two thousand one is exactly
when that exuberance started to tail off

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:00.310
when that exuberance started to tail off
 

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.860

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:02.870
 

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.500
so we wrote irrational exuberance in two

later to more complex things and that's

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480
later to more complex things and that's

isn't any sort of overarching
 

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.130
isn't any sort of overarching
replacement and and my sense is what

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:41.140
replacement and and my sense is what
 

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.750
replacement and and my sense is what
should be taught is there isn't any

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:42.760
should be taught is there isn't any
 

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.250

there are lots of different ways so my

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:01.930
there are lots of different ways so my
 

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.050
there are lots of different ways so my
sense is that there's clearly a lot more

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:04.060

that is you had far less finance you had

obvious example we sort of realized that

00:20:20.279 --> 00:20:22.369
regulation there's a reason why we have
it there's a reason why we keep banks

00:20:22.369 --> 00:20:22.379
it there's a reason why we keep banks
 

00:20:22.379 --> 00:20:25.759
it there's a reason why we keep banks
from taking certain risks so I think

00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:25.769
from taking certain risks so I think
 

00:20:25.769 --> 00:20:28.310
from taking certain risks so I think
that's just back and people understand

forward because what happened basically
over the past 20 years is that banks per

were allowed to engage in all these

were allowed to engage in all these
 

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:54.169
were allowed to engage in all these
really risky behaviors and I think now

00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:54.179
really risky behaviors and I think now
 

00:20:54.179 --> 00:20:55.970
really risky behaviors and I think now
there's this understanding that okay all

there's this understanding that okay all

basically banking and it should probably

00:21:02.119 --> 00:21:02.129
basically banking and it should probably
 

00:21:02.129 --> 00:21:04.039
basically banking and it should probably
be subject to the same set of rules that

be subject to the same set of rules that
 

00:21:04.049 --> 00:21:06.529
be subject to the same set of rules that
we had before so I guess the big

00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:06.539
we had before so I guess the big
 

00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:08.090
we had before so I guess the big
difference is there's been this

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:08.100
difference is there's been this
 

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.710
difference is there's been this
reaffirmation that there's a

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720
reaffirmation that there's a
 

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.330
reaffirmation that there's a
reason for banking regulation and

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:11.340
reason for banking regulation and
 

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.040
reason for banking regulation and
there's been this realization that all

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:13.050
there's been this realization that all
 

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:14.690
there's been this realization that all
these things that didn't call themselves
