00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.110
One of the most fundamental
ideas in all of physics

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.385
is the idea of work.

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:08.450
Now when you first learn work,
you just say, oh, that's

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.120
just force times distance.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.200
But then later on, when you
learn a little bit about

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.770
vectors, you realize that the
force isn't always going in

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.610
the same direction as
your displacement.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.450
So you learn that work is
really the magnitude, let me

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:33.070
write this down, the magnitude
of the force, in the direction,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.460
or the component of the force
in the direction

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.740
of displacement.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.206
Displacement is just distance
with some direction.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.290
Times the magnitude of the
displacement, or you could say,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.695
times the distance displaced.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.330
And the classic example.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.250
Maybe you have an ice cube,
or some type of block.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.740
I just ice so that there's
not a lot of friction.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.510
Maybe it's standing on a bigger
lake or ice or something.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.030
And maybe you're pulling on
that ice cube at an angle.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.610
Let's say, you're pulling
at an angle like that.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.820
That is my force, right there.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.080
Let's say my force is
equal to-- well, that's

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.160
my force vector.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:33.870
Let's say the magnitude of
my force vector, let's

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.310
say it's 10 newtons.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.650
And let's say the direction of
my force vector, right, any

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.080
vector has to have a magnitude
and a direction, and the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.920
direction, let's say it has a
30 degree angle, let's say a 60

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.770
degree angle, above horizontal.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.560
So that's the direction
I'm pulling in.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.600
And let's say I displace it.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.930
This is all review, hopefully.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.225
If you're displacing it, let's
say you displace it 5 newtons.

00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:02.570
So let's say the displacement,
that's the displacement vector

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.290
right there, and the magnitude
of it is equal to 5 meters.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.460
So you've learned from the
definition of work, you can't

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.940
just say, oh, I'm pulling with
10 newtons of force and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.360
I'm moving it 5 meters.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.560
You can't just multiply the 10
newtons times the 5 meters.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.660
You have to find the magnitude
of the component going in the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.050
same direction as
my displacement.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.860
So what I essentially need to
do is, the length, if you

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.930
imagine the length of this
vector being 10, that's the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.750
total force, but you need to
figure out the length of the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.770
vector, that's the component of
the force, going in the same

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.460
direction as my displacement.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.570
And a little simple
trigonometry, you know that

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:53.120
this is 10 times the cosine of
60 degrees, or that's equal to,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.010
cosine of 60 degrees is 1/2, so
that's just equal to 5.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.380
So this magnitude, the
magnitude of the force going

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.410
in the same direction of
the displacement in this

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.810
case, is 5 newtons.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.850
And then you can
figure out the work.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:19.560
You could say that the work is
equal to 5 newtons times, I'll

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.630
just write a dot for times.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.290
I don't want you to think
it's cross product.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.680
Times 5 meters, which is 25
newton meters, or you could

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.250
even say 25 Joules of
work have been done.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.280
And this is all review of
somewhat basic physics.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.720
But just think about
what happened, here.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.430
What was the work?

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.190
If I write in the abstract.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.550
The work is equal
to the 5 newtons.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.700
That was the magnitude of my
force vector, so it's the

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.630
magnitude of my force vector,
times the cosine of this angle.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.860
So you know, let's
call that theta.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.010
Let's say it a
little generally.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.150
So times the cosine
of the angle.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.740
This is the amount of my force
in the direction of the

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.960
displacement, the cosine of the
angle between them, times the

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.800
magnitude of the displacement.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.260
So times the magnitude
of the displacement.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.560
Or if I wanted to rewrite that,
I could just write that as, the

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.940
magnitude of the displacement
times the magnitude of

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.400
the force times the
cosine of theta.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.760
And I've done multiple videos
of this, in the linear algebra

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.880
playlist, in the physics
playlist, where I talk about

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.580
the dot product and the cross
product and all of that, but

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:40.470
this is the dot product
of the vectors d and f.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.700
So in general, if you're trying
to find the work for a constant

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.730
displacement, and you have a
constant force, you just take

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.530
the dot product of
those two vectors.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.330
And if the dot product is a
completely foreign concept to

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.770
you, might want to watch, I
think I've made multiple, 4

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.380
or 5 videos on the dot
product, and its intuition,

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.420
and how it compares.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.280
But just to give you a little
bit of that intuition right

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.920
here, the dot product, when
I take f dot d, or d dot f,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.440
what it's giving me is, I'm
multiplying the magnitude, well

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.130
I could just read this out.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.590
But the idea of the dot product
is, take how much of this

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.800
vector is going in the same
direction as this vector,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.500
in this case, this much.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.110
And then multiply
the two magnitudes.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.410
And that's what we
did right here.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.230
So the work is going to be the
force vector, dot, taking the

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.980
dot part of the force vector
with the displacement vector,

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.840
and this, of course,
is a scalar value.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.040
And we'll work out some
examples in the future where

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.360
you'll see that that's true.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.000
So this is all review of
fairly elementary physics.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.500
Now let's take a more
complex example, but it's

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.670
really the same idea.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.873
Let's define a vector field.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.371
So let's say that I have a
vector field f, and we're

00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:54.050
going to think about what
this means in a second.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.890
It's a function of x and y, and
it's equal to some scalar

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.490
function of x and y times the
i-unit vector, or the

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.760
horizontal unit vector, plus
some other function, scalar

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.250
function of x and y, times the
vertical unit vector.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.580
So what would something
like this be?

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.460
This is a vector field.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.210
This is a vector field
in 2-dimensional space.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.330
We're on the x-y plane.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.840
Or you could even say, on R2.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.690
Either way, I don't want
to get too much into

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.230
the mathiness of it.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.590
But what does this do?

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:47.270
Well, if I were to draw my x-y
plane, so that is my, again,

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.070
having trouble drawing
a straight line.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.610
All right, there we go.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.050
That's my y-axis, and
that's my x-axis.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.360
I'm just drawing the first
quadrant, and but you could

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.450
go negative in either
direction, if you like.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.260
What does this thing do?

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.350
Well, it's essentially
saying, look.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.800
You give me any x, any y, you
give any x, y in the x-y plane,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.970
and these are going to end
up with some numbers, right?

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.655
When you put x, y here, you're
going to get some value, when

00:07:12.655 --> 00:07:14.310
you put x, y here, you're
going to get some value.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.980
So you're going to get some
combination of the i-

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.070
and j-unit vectors.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.770
So you're going to
get some vector.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.020
So what this does, it defines a
vector that's associated with

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.810
every point on x-y plane.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.780
So you could say, if I take
this point on the x-y plane,

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.480
and I would pop it into this,
I'll get something times i plus

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.730
something times j, and when you
add those 2, maybe I get a

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.130
vector that something
like that.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.100
And you could do that
on every point.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.190
I'm just taking random samples.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.420
Maybe when I go here,
the vector looks

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.280
something like that.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.910
Maybe when I go here, the
victor looks like this.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.560
Maybe when I go here, the
vector looks like that.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.350
And maybe when I go up here,
the vector goes like that.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.320
I'm just randomly
picking points.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.090
It defines a vector on all of
the x, y coordinates where

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.920
these scalar functions
are properly defined.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.370
And that's why it's
called a vector field.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:06.580
It defines what a potential,
maybe, force would be,

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:11.430
or some other type of
force, at any point.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.350
At any point, if you happen
to have something there.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.900
Maybe that's what
the function is.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.750
And I could keep doing
this forever, and

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.790
filling in all the gaps.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:19.660
But I think you get the idea.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.790
It associates a vector with
every point on x-y plane.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:29.010
Now, this is called a vector
field, so it probably makes a

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.950
lot of sense that this could
be used to describe

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:31.870
any type of field.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.410
It could be a
gravitation field.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.840
It could be an electric field,
it could be a magnetic field.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.630
And this could be essentially
telling you how much force

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.190
there would be on some
particle in that field.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.660
That's exactly what
this would describe.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.950
Now, let's say that in this
field, I have some particle

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.610
traveling on x-y plane.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:58.620
Let's say it starts there, and
by virtue of all of these crazy

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.850
forces that are acting on it,
and maybe it's on some tracks

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.900
or something, so it won't
always move exactly in the

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.360
direction that the field
is trying to move it at.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.030
Let's say it moves in a path
that moves something like this.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.710
And let's say that this path,
or this curve, is defined by

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:22.010
a position vector function.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.150
So let's say that that's
defined by r of t, which is

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:33.780
just x of t times i plus y of
t times our unit factor j.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.130
That's r of t right there.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.730
Well, in order for this to be
a finite path, this is true

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:42.370
before t is greater than or
equal to a, and less

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.640
than or equal to b.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.830
This is the path that the
particle just happens to

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.370
take, due to all of
these wacky forces.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.270
So when the particle is right
here, maybe the vector field

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:56.960
acting on it, maybe it's
putting a force like that.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.520
But since the thing is on some
type of tracks, it moves

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.400
in this direction.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.830
And then when it's here, maybe
the vector field is like that,

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.740
but it moves in that direction,
because it's on some

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.940
type of tracks.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.500
Now, everything I've done in
this video is to build up

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.180
to a fundamental question.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.910
What was the work done on
the particle by the field?

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.620
To answer that question, we
could zoom in a little bit.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.100
I'm going to zoom in on
only a little small

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.710
snippet of our path.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.010
And let's try to figure out
what the work is done in a very

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.470
small part of our path, because
it's constantly changing.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.190
The field is
changing direction.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.630
my object is
changing direction.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.780
So let's say when I'm here,
and let's say I move a

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.740
small amount of my path.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:55.860
So let's say I move, this
is an infinitesimally

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.500
small dr. Right?

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.810
I have a differential, it's a
differential vector, infinitely

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.630
small displacement.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:06.800
and let's say over the course
of that, the vector field is

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.840
acting in this local
area, let's say it looks

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.480
something like that.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.490
It's providing a force that
looks something like that.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.640
So that's the vector field in
that area, or the force

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.750
directed on that particle right
when it's at that point.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.870
Right?

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.420
It's an infinitesimally small
amount of time in space.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.440
You could say, OK, over that
little small point, we

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.600
have this constant force.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.790
What was the work done
over this small period?

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.330
You could say, what's the
small interval of work?

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.120
You could say d work, or
a differential of work.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.940
Well, by the same exact logic
that we did with the simple

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:43.810
problem, it's the magnitude of
the force in the direction of

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:48.550
our displacement times the
magnitude of our displacement.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.800
And we know what that is, just
from this example up here.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.810
That's the dot product.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:58.340
It's the dot product of the
force and our super-small

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.480
displacement.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:07.860
So that's equal to the dot
product of our force and our

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.870
super-small displacement.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.240
Now, just by doing this, we're
just figuring out the work

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.440
over, maybe like a really
small, super-small dr. But

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.820
what we want to do, is we
want to sum them all up.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.870
We want to sum up all of the
drs to figure out the total,

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.090
all of the f dot drs to figure
out the total work done.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.510
And that's where the
integral comes in.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:32.570
We will do a line integral
over-- I mean, you could

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:33.910
think of it two ways.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.440
You could write just d dot w
there, but we could say, we'll

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.700
do a line integral along this
curve c, could call that c

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.410
or along r, whatever you
want to say it, of dw.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.800
That'll give us the total work.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.500
So let's say, work
is equal to that.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:54.040
Or we could also write it over
the integral, over the same

00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:00.500
curve of f of f dot dr.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.580
And this might seem like a
really, you know, gee, this

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.120
is really abstract, Sal.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.220
How do we actually calculate
something like this?

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.130
Especially because we have
everything parameterized

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.030
in terms of t.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.130
How do we get this
in terms of t?

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:19.710
And if you just think about
it, what is f dot r?

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.030
Or what is f dot dr?

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.300
Well, actually, to answer
that, let's remember

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.830
what dr looked like.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:36.200
If you remember, dr/dt is equal
to x prime of t, I'm writing it

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.120
like, I could have written dx
dt if I wanted to do, times the

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:45.180
i-unit vector, plus y prime of
t, times the j-unit vector.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.320
And if we just wanted to dr, we
could multiply both sides, if

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.850
we're being a little bit more
hand-wavy with the

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.470
differentials, not
too rigorous.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:58.480
We'll get dr is equal to x
prime of t dt times the unit

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:05.070
vector i plus y prime of t
times the differential dt

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.280
times the unit vector j.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.070
So this is our dr right here.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:16.280
And remember what our
vector field was.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.440
It was this thing up here.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.590
Let me copy and paste it.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.030
And we'll see that
the dot product is

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.360
actually not so crazy.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.710
So copy, and let me
paste it down here.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.820
So what's this integral
going to look like?

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.600
This integral right here, that
gives the total work done by

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.790
the field, on the particle,
as it moves along that path.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.090
Just super fundamental to
pretty much any serious physics

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.170
that you might eventually
find yourself doing.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.170
So you could say, well gee.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:52.420
It's going to be the integral,
let's just say from t is equal

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.320
to a, to t is equal to b.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.310
Right? a is where we started
off on the path, t is equal

00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:59.790
to a to t is equal to b.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.760
You can imagine it as being
timed, as a particle

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.610
moving, as time increases.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.000
And then what is f dot dr?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.640
Well, if you remember from just
what the dot product is, you

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.310
can essentially just take the
product of the corresponding

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.740
components of your of
vector, and add them up.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.070
So this is going to be the
integral from t equals a to t

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:27.246
equals b, of p of p of x,
really, instead of writing x,

00:15:27.246 --> 00:15:30.740
y, it's x of t, right? x as a
function of t, y as

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.350
a function of t.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:33.690
So that's that.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:37.600
Times this thing right here,
times this component, right?

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.300
We're multiplying
the i-components.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:50.650
So times x prime of t d t, and
then that plus, we're going

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.370
to do the same thing
with the q function.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:56.060
So this is q plus, I'll
go to another line.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.760
Hopefully you realize I could
have just kept writing, but

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.020
I'm running out of space.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:09.960
Plus q of x of t, y of t, times
the component of our dr. Times

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.900
the y-component, or
the j-component.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.530
y prime of t dt.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:16.620
And we're done!

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:17.480
And we're done.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.300
This might still seem a little
bit abstract, but we're going

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.020
to see in the next video,
everything is now in terms of

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.480
t, so this is just a
straight-up integration,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.170
with respect to dt.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.150
If we want, we could take the
dt's outside of the equation,

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:32.270
and it'll look a little
bit more normal for you.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.640
But this is essentially
all that we have to do.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.080
And we're going to see some
concrete examples of taking a

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.230
line integral through a vector
field, or using vector

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.790
functions, in the next video.
