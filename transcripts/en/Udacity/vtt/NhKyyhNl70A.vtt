[Narrator] And here the histogram filter scores better.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Even though it was discrete, it was able to represent multiple bumps,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which the kalman filter couldn't, so it's unimodal.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If you forget this go back to the past class and look at this.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The kalman filter was a single Gaussian which is by definition unimodal,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
whereas the histogram filter can have bumps over arbitrary grid cells.
