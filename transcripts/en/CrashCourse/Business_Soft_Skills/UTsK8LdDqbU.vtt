00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:10.160
Life’s all about give and take: Compromising
over takeout choices.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.030
Trying for a different curfew.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.070
Haggling at a market or over the price of
a car.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.680
So whether or not you consider yourself a
businessperson, you’ve led a negotiation.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.840
And the first step to any good negotiation
is preparation.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.730
You don’t want to head blindly into important
decision-making.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.070
Reverend H.K. Williams said it best: by failing
to prepare, you’re preparing to fail.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.860
See, if we hadn’t done our research to
prepare, we would’ve accidentally attributed

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.220
that to Benjamin Franklin.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.380
But you’re not going to fail.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.900
Because you’re awesome at what you do.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.850
And we’re awesome at we do.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.450
So we’re here to help you prep by showing
you how to set goals, ask the right questions,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.230
and think outside the box a bit.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.140
I’m Evelyn from the Internets, and this
is Crash Course Business: Soft Skills.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:01.700
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.920
Before we get started, let’s clear up a
few things.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.380
Lay some ground rules, if you will.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.650
Negotiation involves two or more people -- and
we’ll focus on two here -- that have opposing

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.869
interests and something the other person
wants.

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.990
There’s no such thing as a single-party
negotiation.You can argue with yourself over

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.619
buying that pair of glitter Balenciaga boots
that Michelle Obama wore, but you’re not

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:25.619
negotiating.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.020
You’re just indecisive. Probably irresponsible.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.719
Let’s say two people are trying to split
100 lemons and they each want 60.

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:33.729
That’s a perfect setup for a negotiation,
because it /looks/ like there could be serious

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:34.729
conflict.

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.049
Maybe it won’t come to an all-out duel,
but who knows how serious these lemon people

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.049
are!

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.889
Jokes aside, though, negotiation is not
about ‘winning’ or doing better than someone

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:44.109
else.

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.780
Negotiation is about solving perceived conflict.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.619
It’s playing nice with others and finding
collaborative solutions by communicating your

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.249
needs and interests.

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:54.929
You still advocate for yourself.

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.789
Don’t let someone just take your lemons
or pie you in the face with a lemon chess.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.009
But you avoid hostility and find a solution
that helps the other person out.

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.850
So take that 100 lemon situation.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.650
The two people might chat and figure out that
one wants 60 lemon rinds for their bakery,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.280
and the other wants juice from 60 lemons
for their lemonade stand.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.480
There’s not really a problem, and there’s
a solution where both people get what they

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.480
need.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.380
Or if you want a clean kitchen but your roommate
has midterms, you might do more dishes this

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.250
week in exchange for a week off when you’re
swamped.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.860
To make sure everyone walks away from a negotiation
with their needs met, you need to prepare.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.990
And the first step in preparation is understanding
what your goal is.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.230
Clear goal, full hearts, can’t lose.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.290
I mean... we just talked about how negotiations
don’t really have a winner or loser.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.120
But Friday Night Lights is just so good.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.290
Think about exactly what’s important to
you, because your goal might not be as cut

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.560
and dry as you think.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.150
Like, let’s say you’re moving to a new
city and need to commute to work.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.720
Your goal probably isn’t to buy any car
as cheap as possible.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.820
Because, uh, there’s some real junk on
Craigslist.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.990
Your goal is to find transportation that
meets your needs in the most cost-effective

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.990
way.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.990
That difference is subtle.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.200
But it helps you focus on what matters.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.840
And what matters is readiness, cost, and quality.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.820
So a cheap car is one way of getting to your
ultimate goal: effective transportation.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.050
If you only think about one limited goal,
like the price of a used car, you’ll end

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.260
up conducting a purely distributive negotiation.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.740
And that can limit your solutions.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.220
A distributive negotiation might involve haggling
with a car seller to drop the price by $150.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.480
Just, like, going back and forth saying numbers.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.510
Usually, you’ll have more options if you
focus on complex goals and conduct an integrative

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.510
negotiation.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.780
Instead of bargaining over $150, integrative
negotiations let you get creative.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.050
Maybe you let a seller charge $100 more for
a car, but only if they get the oil changed

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.330
and get you a Jiffy Lube coupon book.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.730
Now, everyone’s happy.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.120
The seller earns a bit more and you save time.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.920
But in any negotiation, integrative or otherwise,
you’re going to need to make trade-offs.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.780
Ideally, you’d reach your target goal, which
is the most you think you can get from a situation.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.030
Something that meets all of your needs, with
a cherry on top.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.740
So let’s say you’re arriving in this new
city soon.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.150
And remember: your ultimate goal is cheap,
good, and readily available transportation.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.050
Your target might be an immediately driveable
car for a really good price -- say, $4,200,

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.020
if the used cars you’re looking at average
around $4,600.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.710
You should rank what’s important to you
in a definitive list, so you know what you

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.990
can concede and still meet your ultimate goal.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.680
Are you willing to spend a bit more money
for a sooner pickup date?

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.150
Would you give up a couple of features, like
seat warmers, if it meant saving dough?

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.650
Must it really be a 1981 DeLorean DMC-12?

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.010
Knowing how much you’re willing to concede
depends on what alternatives you have.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.669
Alternatives set your resistance point, or
the worst possible deal you’ll accept in

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:55.699
a negotiation.

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.759
So in the case of negotiating to buy a used
car, an alternative can be anything that

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:05.789
meets your ultimate goal of transportation,
like using the metro or taking an Uber everywhere.

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.580
If your alternative is terrible and you’ll
be walking to work in the snow, your resistance

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.759
point will be lower.

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.300
You really need a car, and your power to walk
away from a negotiation is limited.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.880
And if your alternative is amazing, like a
free shuttle provided by your job in the freezing

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.029
cold winter months, your resistance point
will be higher.

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:27.879
If you can put up with the shuttle’s kind
of irregular schedule, you can take time to

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:31.250
make a deal for that Volkswagen bug of your
dreams.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.730
Basically, alternatives give you more power,
or leverage, in a negotiation.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.500
They give you time to consider your options,
keep you from giving up too much, and let

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.159
you walk away comfortably if you can’t beat
your alternatives.

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:45.289
And walking away is not a failure.

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.600
It might just mean the deal wasn’t meant
to be.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.110
It wasn’t your time.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.920
They weren’t ready for you.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.840
Usually, you’ve got more leverage than you
might think, especially when you have a job

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.840
offer.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.099
They want your talent and your skills for
a reason!

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:03.969
So never be afraid to negotiate your salary,
especially if you’re a woman or a person

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:04.969
of color.

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:06.840
Negotiating doesn’t make you aggressive.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.840
It makes you smart.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.860
To see how you’d prep for a salary negotiation,
let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.759
You’re a fresh graduate from a quirky community
college.

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:21.080
And you’ve got a job offer from a cool virtual
reality startup called Dreamatorium Enterprises.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.610
They’ve got great health benefits, an awesome
office, and you’re excited to flex your

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.610
creative muscles.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.610
Plus, you’ll have the chance to network
with some up-and-coming industry leaders.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.590
But you’ve also got an offer from Hawthorne
Industries, a company in town that makes wet

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.590
wipes.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.590
You’ve heard a few iffy things about Hawthorne’s
upper management, and the work isn’t as

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.909
exciting, but they’re offering you $5,000
more per year for your salary.

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:50.349
And in a place like Greendale, Colorado, that
can go a long way.

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:55.279
You really want the startup job, so you’re
thinking about giving up the extra pay.

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:57.069
But you’ve got more leverage than you think!

00:06:57.069 --> 00:06:58.930
So prepare to negotiate.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:04.050
Greendale’s not a booming tech town, so
applications for Dreamatorium haven’t exactly

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.050
been rolling in.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.380
So they don’t have many alternative candidates,
which gives you a bit more power.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.580
And you can point out that they won’t
need to pay for you to relocate.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.850
They’ll save a lot on expensive training
and certification courses, since you already

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.229
know how to use specialized art software.

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:22.560
You used it to design your school’s flag
and create short films!

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.419
Plus, after doing industry research, you know
the salary they’re offering you is a bit

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:28.729
below average.

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:30.449
So they might have room to move up.

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:34.120
Your strengths look great, and you’ve also
thought about what you’re willing to give

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.620
up -- like 3 days vacation, a premium parking
spot, and the signing bonus they offered you.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.740
So when you walk into that negotiation, you’re
ready to help them see the full benefits of

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.940
hiring you and get that salary bump.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.699
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:51.759
To prepare for negotiation, you don’t just
need to have your goals figured out.

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:55.630
You need to flip the script and know your
enemy -- or, uh, your collaborator.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.690
What are their goals, target, and the issues
they’re going to prioritize?

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.849
If you understand what they’re trying to
achieve, you may be able to move away from

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:08.960
distributive negotiations and create integrative
solutions that help you both win.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.129
Maybe you own a burger restaurant and are
ordering from a new beef supplier who’s

00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:14.650
trying to get their name out there.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:19.680
So, in exchange for a 10% discount, you could
promote them at the food festival you’re

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.749
working next weekend.

00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:24.699
Think about what questions you can ask to
help you identify their goals.

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:29.580
But… don’t be so blatantly obvious and
straight-up ask what their resistance point

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.580
is.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.580
It’s a little tacky.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.380
Instead, you could ask, “What other options
are you considering?” to get a handle on

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.469
their alternatives, and sort of extrapolate
from there.

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:42.909
Questions like, “Oh, so you just want the
lemon rinds?”, “How important is picking

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:47.510
up the car right away?”, or, “What are
you currently doing to market your beef?”

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.730
can help you figure out their priorities and
find ways to create value for everyone.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:56.279
They’ll probably be asking you similar questions
too, so remember your goals and think about

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:57.600
how you’ll want to answer.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.870
And if you can help it, it’s best to negotiate
in person.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:06.449
Sometimes you can’t, but the hierarchy goes:
video calls, then phone calls, then emails.

00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:08.600
Basically, the more personal, the better.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.820
Remember emotional influence?

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:14.329
It’s easier to get a read on someone’s
intentions if you can get a feel for their

00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:15.329
personality.

00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:19.470
It’s easier for them to ignore your wants
and needs when you’re separated by a computer

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:20.470
screen.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.680
That’s partially why cyberbullying is so
widespread.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.070
Not okay, people.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.040
Really, it all comes down to trust.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.490
People are more willing to find solutions
if they trust that you’re looking out for

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.730
their interests as well.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:37.350
When there’s no trust, it’s like a villain
negotiating with the hero in an action movie.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:42.560
Everyone’s on edge, and no one’s thinking
of creative ways to get out of Nakatomi Plaza.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.070
Sure... no matter what, your business negotiation
will probably be lower-stakes than that.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:51.959
But with a bit of time and effort, you’ll
have built up a reputation as a master negotiator

00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:55.730
who follows through and is willing to work
with people for win-win situations.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.190
We’ve done all we can to prepare you to
prepare.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:02.610
And if you take away nothing else, remember:

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:07.880
If you can help it, negotiation is about collaboration
and finding creative solutions so everyone

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.070
wins.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.730
Clear goal, full hearts, can’t lose.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:18.160
Goals can help you think of creative solutions
that target what you really want.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.339
You may need to make concessions, but be aware
of what you can use as leverage.

00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:27.990
Prepare ahead of time by thinking about the
other person’s needs and what questions

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.720
you will ask or be asked.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.759
And next time, we’ll talk about how to jump
in and conduct a negotiation!

00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:37.330
Crash Course Business is sponsored by Google and it’s made with the help of all these

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.670
nice people and Thought Cafe is our amazing
animation team.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.040
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.070
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us, you can check out some of our other

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.990
channels like Mental Floss, where knowledge
junkies come to get their fix of trivia-tastic

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.990
information.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.100
Also, if you’d like to keep Crash Course
free for everybody, forever, you can support

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:01.800
the series at Patreon; a crowdfunding platform
that allows you to support the content you

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.800
love.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.100
