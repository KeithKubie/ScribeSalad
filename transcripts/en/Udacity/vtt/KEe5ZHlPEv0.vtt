00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.313
So, let's look at what kind of structures and what

00:00:02.313 --> 00:00:04.680
do we have in the hardware with the ROB. So,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.485
we still have the instruction queue, from which we dispatch

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:11.180
into the reservation stations. We still have the RAT, that can

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.715
point to a register file, or to the rename name

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:17.430
for the instruction until it writes to the register file.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.311
But RAT entries that point to, not to register file

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:25.540
in, in normal Tomasulo's algorithm would point to the reservation stations.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.270
Now, however, we have a new structure called the

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.280
reorder buffer, or ROB. It has a head and tail

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.950
pointer, and basically the instructions that are currently in

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.924
execution are between these two pointers. The head pointer is

00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:40.366
the pointer to where we are going to put the

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:44.051
next instruction that issues. The tail pointer is where we

00:00:44.051 --> 00:00:47.468
are considering instructions for commit and the RAT entries

00:00:47.468 --> 00:00:50.550
that are not pointing register file are now pointing to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.080
the ROB entries for the instructions that are going to produce its value.
