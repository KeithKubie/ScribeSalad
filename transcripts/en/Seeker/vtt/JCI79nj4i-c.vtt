00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.239
Did you know one third of our food supply
requires pollination?

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:06.260
You better Bee-live it!

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:13.559
Hello everyone, Crystal here for DNews buzzing
with news about bees.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.560
That’s right, the honeybee is finally getting
noticed for its decreasing workforce and essential

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.870
role in our economy.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.630
The honeybee has been an unsung hero of industry
pollinating our food, producing commercially

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.960
used wax, and of course honey.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.050
Government estimates suggest that around $15
billion dollars a year of the US economy currently

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.850
rests on the backs of bees and other pollinators.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.710
But there is a big problem, scientists have
known for years that these busy bees are dying

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.399
off and disappearing in a phenomenon called
Colony Collapse Disorder.

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.289
Originally a term applied to the noticeable
reduction in viability of commercial honey

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.750
bee colonies, there is a growing concern that
Colony Collapse Disorder is also affecting

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.140
wild bee populations.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.800
It may not seem like much but the US honeybee
population is currently less than half of

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.559
what it was sixty years ago.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.500
And In some cases, farmers have reported a
loss of bee population of 50% within a single

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.500
year.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.320
You may be asking yourself, how many bees
do we really need to keep our nation fed?

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.430
Well, in 2007 the EPA reported that the ever
vulnerable California almond crop requires

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.220
1.3 million colonies of bees.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.250
The average number of bees per colony is at
50 - 60 thousand so thats 78 billion bees

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.430
for California almonds alone! or “a LOT”
of bees.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.860
Now, the problem is getting some high profile
attention from the president himself who signed

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.159
a memorandum directing our governmental agencies
to “broadly advance honey bee and other

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.079
pollinator health and habitat”.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.189
So what factors will most likely be investigated?

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.630
Well right now, concerns for honey bee health
center around a few major factors: poor bee

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.140
nutrition, loss of forage lands, parasites,
pathogens, lack of genetic diversity, and

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.020
exposure to pesticides.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.799
Much attention has been paid to the effects
of neonicotinoid pesticides on pollinator

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.770
populations, but the White House memo goes
broader calling for more research on pollinator

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.250
health, and the restoration and enhancement
of acres of land for pollinators through combined

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.600
public and private action.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.820
Monarch butterflies also got a shout out for
efforts to protect their annual migration

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.850
and prevent decline of their population.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.880
The drastic and inexplicable loss of pollinators
has been an intense topic of research for

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.390
many years given its interest to farmers and
scientists alike.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.370
Now with the spotlight of government interest
upon it hopefully it will be possible to design

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.750
new and effective means to address this critical
issue.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.790
What can you do to help short of raising bees
yourself?

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.791
Plant flowers in your yard, don’t use pesticides
to keep them pretty and spend some of that

00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:29.230
disposable income on local honey.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.410
Supporting your friendly neighborhood beekeeper
will keep food in your mouth in more ways

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.410
then one

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.410
What you do think?

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.760
