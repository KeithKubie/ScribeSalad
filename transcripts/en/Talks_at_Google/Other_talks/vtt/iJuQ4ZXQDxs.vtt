MATT SINGER: How's
everybody doing?

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.890
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.717
MATT SINGER: Did you guys
just watch the movie?

00:00:06.717 --> 00:00:07.216
Yes?

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:11.580
You guys just watched
the movie, right?

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.120
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.230
MATT SINGER: So you know
who these people are, right?

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.070
DAVID GORDON GREEN: Not me.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.528
MATT SINGER: We've
got David Gordon

00:00:16.528 --> 00:00:19.380
Green, writer-director
right here.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.220
All right.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.554
Paul Rudd and Emile Hirsch.

00:00:23.554 --> 00:00:24.470
My name's Matt Singer.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.520
I work for a website
called "The Dissolve."

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.360
And thanks for having me.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.520
Thanks for having us.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.680
How you guys doing?

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.930
DAVID GORDON GREEN: Fantastic.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.121
PAUL RUDD: Good.

00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:35.620
MATT SINGER: You have something
you want to address, I know.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.130
EMILE HIRSCH: Yeah.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.780
MATT SINGER: You want to get
it off your chest right now?

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.250
EMILE HIRSCH: Oh, yeah.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.458
Yeah, now that I'm at Google.

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:43.950
So if you type in
my name on Google,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.490
the Google profile
says I'm 5' 5".

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.240
That's not true.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.660
I'm 5' 7 and 3/4".

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.550
When you're 5' 7 and 3/4",
5' 5" sounds fucked up.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.185
No offense to anybody who may
be 5' 5" or close to 5' 5".

00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:01.060
MATT SINGER: It's fine
if that's who you are.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.518
EMILE HIRSCH: Yeah,
but when you're

00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:04.849
not that-- It's not a big deal.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.542
I just figured I'm in
the offices of Google.

00:01:07.542 --> 00:01:09.750
MATT SINGER: Can we get this
taken care of right now?

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.512
Anyone?

00:01:10.512 --> 00:01:12.470
EMILE HIRSCH: I'm just
throwing that out there.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.320
MATT SINGER: Maybe afterwards
someone can take care of that.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.110
All right.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.340
We threw it out there.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.209
I'm sure by the time this
is over, we'll go on Google

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:20.000
and it'll be right.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.090
MATT SINGER: Maybe?

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.531
They're laughing like it's
not, but I was serious.

00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:29.030
EMILE HIRSCH: I'm
going to be 5' 1".

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.020
They're like, ask
us again, bitch.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.775
See what happens.

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:34.500
DAVID GORDON GREEN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.180
MATT SINGER: 5' 5"
was close enough.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.930
PAUL RUDD: 4' 10".

00:01:43.025 --> 00:01:44.650
MATT SINGER: While
they're fixing that,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.620
let's talk about the movie.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.000
I walked in to the movie not
knowing much more about it

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.380
other than you guys.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.200
And then I was really
surprised to find out

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.377
that it was a remake
of another movie.

00:01:55.377 --> 00:01:55.960
I had no idea.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.460
And it didn't feel
like one to me.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.014
So maybe you can talk about
the origins of the project.

00:02:02.014 --> 00:02:03.430
Reading a little
more about it, it

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.510
seemed like it wasn't
like you saw the movie

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.460
and wanted to make that.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.340
There's kind of an interesting,
unusual process there.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.506
DAVID GORDON GREEN: It's a
little bit backward, yes.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.140
I was directed to go to this
state park in Bastrop, Texas.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.974
I live in Austin.

00:02:19.974 --> 00:02:21.640
This is about an hour
outside of Austin.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.190
And a friend of
mine was telling me

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.370
how interesting this
particular state

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.015
park was after this wild
fire has swept through.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:31.140
And he said, you should go
to check this place out.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.400
It's really cinematic
and interesting.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.020
And you should
make a movie there.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.820
So I went to the park
and checked it out

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.486
and thought, oh, this
is really awesome.

00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:38.650
I should make a movie here.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.660
But what was beautiful about it
is also the devastation of it.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.930
And it was this apocalyptic,
monochromatic forest.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.320
And it went on for
25 square miles.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.690
I mean, it was just an enormous,
very catastrophic wildfire.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.150
People lost their homes.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.590
A number of people,
actually filmmaker

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.050
Richard Linklater, some of his
property was affected by it,

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.980
and some people that I knew.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.550
And so it was
interesting walking

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.049
through this place
thinking about it

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.770
as a very haunted
backdrop location.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.630
I thought this would
make a great place

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.250
to make a movie that had
that kind of strange beauty,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.549
sad thing going on in it.

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.340
I need to come up with
a very simple story,

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.130
something cool that
I can do really

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.960
quickly before the forest turns
green again in the summertime.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.530
And then, coincidentally,
I was telling

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.159
a friend of mine
that lives up here,

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.325
a production designer up
here, and I was telling him

00:03:33.325 --> 00:03:34.533
this beautiful place I found.

00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:37.360
And I said, I need a
really stripped down,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.190
simple narrative that then
I can get great actors

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.640
and make a great
character piece.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.940
And he said, well, I've heard
about this Icelandic film

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.079
about two guys painting
stripes on the road.

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.620
Why don't you just
remake that movie?

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.250
I asked him if it's any good.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.482
And he said he hadn't seen
it, but it sounded cool.

00:03:51.482 --> 00:03:52.440
MATT SINGER: Who cares?

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.120
You're going to remake it.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.375
DAVID GORDON GREEN: Exactly.

00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:54.450
So that's what I thought.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.840
I hunted it down.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.006
I said, OK, I can't wait
to remake this movie that I

00:03:57.006 --> 00:03:59.297
haven't seen or no one
I know has seen yet.

00:03:59.297 --> 00:04:00.380
And I started watching it.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.241
And I was like, no,
this is really good.

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:03.740
And I really responded
to the movie.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.690
And I sent it to Paul.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.366
And he liked it.

00:04:05.366 --> 00:04:06.490
And we said, what the hell.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.781
Let's try to get the rights
and do something with this,

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:10.380
and use it as a great blueprint.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.290
Some of the dialogue is taken
precisely from the movie.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.891
A few shots are even taken
directly from the movie.

00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:18.390
And then we tried
to personalize it.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.140
And each of us put
our fingerprint on it.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.850
And elements like the
woman that Paul's character

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.650
Alvin encounters in
the burned down home

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.990
wasn't in the screenplay,
but it was an illustration

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.680
of the opportunity of making
a movie like this where

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.770
you can just open it up to that.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.930
That was Joyce.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.219
And that was her home.

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:37.510
And that was her story looking
for her pilot's licence.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.320
And just taking advantage of the
beautiful, sad oddity, funny,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.080
strangeness of this environment
became a great journey

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.670
for all of us.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.200
And once we got Paul
and Emile on board,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.610
it really just became its own
very special, very personal

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.300
project.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.300
MATT SINGER: What were you guys
attracted to in the material

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.758
that you wanted to
be a part of it?

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.740
PAUL RUDD: Well, at first for
me, it was working with David.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.270
David and I have known
each other for a long time.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.936
And I've always wanted
to work with him.

00:05:05.936 --> 00:05:08.980
And I think he's great.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.700
Emile wasn't on board.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.210
This was when Emile
wasn't attached

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.260
to be in it or anything.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.491
Because when I first heard
about it, Dave was like, hey,

00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:20.740
man, why don't we get some
cameras and go out in the--

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.000
And he didn't even have to
tell me what it was about.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.960
But then he said, there's
this Icelandic movie

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.420
about two guys that paint
the lines on a road.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.030
And, uh, that sounds awesome.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.770
Like I like that.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:30.520
That sounds super.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.255
MATT SINGER: Do I get
to paint the lines?

00:05:32.255 --> 00:05:33.671
PAUL RUDD: And it
was such a treat

00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:36.630
to actually get to
paint the lines.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.810
But I just thought,
oh, this would

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.540
be, one, a cool experience
to work with David.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.400
And then I'd never met Emile.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.680
And then when Emile came on,
I was excited about that.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.790
But ultimately the
idea of doing something

00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:00.400
that was purely artistic,
that it was never about,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.040
oh, this will get picked up.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.380
We didn't even know if it would
be in theaters or anything

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.310
like that.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:13.300
But it was just a
really fun exercise

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.630
to get back in
touch with what it

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.017
is that we love about doing
this in the first place.

00:06:20.017 --> 00:06:21.350
MATT SINGER: How about yourself?

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.540
Same thing?

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.860
EMILE HIRSCH: Yeah, I mean,
I don't think that I really

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.640
even realized that we were
making a movie for most of it

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.020
because the script
was only 65 pages.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.220
And it was only a 16-day shoot.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.997
And every time I
would ask David--

00:06:35.997 --> 00:06:37.705
we'd be shooting a
scene and I'd be like,

00:06:37.705 --> 00:06:39.890
so is this going to be a movie?

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.260
And he'd be like, I don't know.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.880
And I'd be like, well, is it
going to be shown in theaters?

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.300
Or what's it going to be like?

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.200
And he's like, this is going
to be very weird, let me just

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.450
tell you.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.440
And I was like, OK.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.200
And he goes, yeah.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.491
And I was like, well, how's
it going to be distributed?

00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:53.620
He's like, I don't know.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.410
He's like, maybe we'll just show
it to our friends and family

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.634
over drinks and dinner.

00:06:58.634 --> 00:07:00.800
MATT SINGER: That's got to
fill you with confidence.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.630
EMILE HIRSCH: And
I was like, OK.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.434
I mean, I thought
it could be a movie.

00:07:05.434 --> 00:07:07.100
But I didn't really
know it was a movie.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.194
And David was very
guarding about-- he never

00:07:10.194 --> 00:07:12.360
actually said, oh, yeah,
this will be a movie that's

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.600
going to come out or
anything like that.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.950
PAUL RUDD: We went to
the screening last night.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.366
And really, he's
like, oh, my God.

00:07:16.366 --> 00:07:17.060
It's a movie.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.080
EMILE HIRSCH: Yeah.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.302
PAUL RUDD: There it is.

00:07:19.302 --> 00:07:21.510
MATT SINGER: Does that give
you some freedom, though?

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.244
Because it seems
pretty relaxed, seems

00:07:23.244 --> 00:07:24.660
like there's very
little pressure.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.760
It's not like, we have to make
this and get it in theaters

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.900
and you know, it seems--

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.350
EMILE HIRSCH: Yeah, I mean,
when we were shooting,

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.180
there was no press
about the movie.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.120
It was like we basically shot
it in secret to David's design,

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.720
right?

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.380
DAVID GORDON GREEN: Yes.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.990
PAUL RUDD: There's
always pressure

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.730
because there's
other people around.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.090
And there's a crew around.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.746
There's a guy that's
holding a mic.

00:07:47.746 --> 00:07:49.370
And there's somebody
that's filming it.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.190
And there's somebody that's
setting up cones and doing

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.404
all sorts of set design.

00:07:53.404 --> 00:07:54.570
And David's there directing.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.610
So it's like there's always
pressure because, I mean,

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.900
acting is just stupid
and embarrassing anyway.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:01.827
Just by design, it is.

00:08:01.827 --> 00:08:03.910
EMILE HIRSCH: I think it's
more embarrassing to be

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.960
the boom guy holding it.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.020
There's no non-awkward
way to do that.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.145
PAUL RUDD: When you're
doing it in front of people,

00:08:09.145 --> 00:08:10.051
it's like, yeah.

00:08:10.051 --> 00:08:10.550
That's true.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.090
MATT SINGER: I like when
the guy cocks it on his hip.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:14.840
EMILE HIRSCH: Yeah,
he thinks he's so cool

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.470
MATT SINGER: He thinks
he's really cool.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.000
Yeah.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.250
PAUL RUDD: No, I don't think
it's he thinks he's cool.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.880
I think he's smart because
it's so hard to do.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.310
Have you ever tried to do it?

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.440
It sucks.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.640
It's terrible.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.689
A lot of times, I've worked on
things and the takes go long.

00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:32.980
Like sometimes, we'll just
say, let's just play around.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:33.914
And we'll improvise.

00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:35.039
We'll see where it's going.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.630
And that's so fun
to do as an actor.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.365
And it's terrible as a boom guy.

00:08:39.365 --> 00:08:41.240
EMILE HIRSCH: Yeah, he's
checking into the ER

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:41.939
the next day.

00:08:41.939 --> 00:08:43.480
PAUL RUDD: Literally,
like, we're not

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.320
designed to just stand like that
the whole time for 20 minutes.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.090
And I can't even do it for two.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.349
So thank you, boom
guys out there.

00:08:52.349 --> 00:08:53.890
MATT SINGER: Big
ups to the boom guys

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:54.557
PAUL RUDD: Yeah.

00:08:54.557 --> 00:08:56.806
MATT SINGER: There are a
couple of really great scenes

00:08:56.806 --> 00:08:58.020
that I wanted to talk about.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.561
You mentioned one
already, that scene

00:08:59.561 --> 00:09:01.850
where you're walking
through that house that's

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.440
been sort of destroyed
and you find this woman.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.570
What an amazing scene.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.540
And could you just walk through?

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.520
You said it wasn't
in the script.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.510
It wasn't in the
original movie, right?

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.844
How did you find that?

00:09:11.844 --> 00:09:13.010
You just found the location?

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:13.650
Did you find her?

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.350
How did it work?

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:15.700
DAVID GORDON GREEN: Well we
were looking for locations--

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.042
it evolved quite a bit,
the movie, I'd say.

00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:19.500
In the script,
there was a sequence

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:25.024
where Paul's character
in his lost weekend when

00:09:25.024 --> 00:09:27.440
Emile's character goes off to
the city, his character, one

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.850
of the sequences was going to
be this funny sequence of him

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.184
going into a burned down
home and pantomiming

00:09:34.184 --> 00:09:36.600
his way through it and talking
to someone who wasn't there

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.810
and then having ghost
sex with his wife.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.550
And it was going
to be hilarious.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.220
And when we're
looking for locations

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.820
for this funny scene--

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.570
MATT SINGER: I just
like watching his face

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.800
while you describe it.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.091
DAVID GORDON GREEN: I just
thought it would be a funny,

00:09:49.091 --> 00:09:53.790
invisible person's-- I don't
know-- provocative scene.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.750
We got into the
process of looking

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.440
for this location for
the ghost sex scene.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.360
And then my producer Craig
Zobel and our assistant director

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.140
Atilla were out looking
about for locations.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.910
And they found Joyce looking
through the ashes of her home.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.230
And they started talking to
her about potentially using

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.300
her house as a
location and then got

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.780
into the conversation of her
and her particular situation

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.830
of losing everything
in her home.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.930
And what an amazingly
interesting woman Joyce was.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.762
And after they had
spoken with her,

00:10:22.762 --> 00:10:24.220
they called me and
said, listen, we

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.480
found a location that's great.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.813
But more importantly, we found
a woman that's incredible

00:10:27.813 --> 00:10:30.540
and somehow needs to be
integrated into this project.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.460
So sure enough, we went
out and I don't think

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.470
she was aware, kind
of like Emile, she--

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.470
MATT SINGER: Did not
know it was a movie.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.803
DAVID GORDON GREEN: --wasn't
sure that this was a movie.

00:10:39.803 --> 00:10:42.620
But so Paul directed that scene.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.360
And we went in there
very discreetly

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.550
with a cameraman and a
sound guy, our boom guy.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.967
And Paul just talked her
through her situation.

00:10:50.967 --> 00:10:52.050
None of that was scripted.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.000
It was all just things that were
regurgitating the story that

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.170
had been told to our
friends previously.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.590
And it was such a beautiful
moment just being there on set

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.560
and watching Paul's
interaction with her.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.269
I mean, I just got chills.

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:07.560
Again, there's things that
she said that made me laugh.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.351
And things that were
just really upsetting.

00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:12.080
And the truth is, every
crack in her voice

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.505
is her holding back tears
because she lost everything

00:11:14.505 --> 00:11:16.130
that was meaningful
to her in her life.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.552
And she says things
like, I feel like I'm

00:11:18.552 --> 00:11:19.760
looking through my own ashes.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.470
And some really powerful,
gripping things that were said.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:27.470
For me, personally, and I think
for Paul as well, and all four

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.530
of us that were on set
that day, it really

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.410
changed the tone
and the approach

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:32.500
to the rest of the film.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.980
That funny pantomime
scene ended up

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.830
being a heartbroken scene of
Paul sitting in a chair rocking

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:42.760
back and forth lonely in the
rain, and very much simplified

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.860
and drained of comedy.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.080
And the rest of the film,
too, although I think

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.620
has great laughter and
great of moments of humor.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.800
And these guys really
did a great job

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.080
in my opinion of
balancing the comedy

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.430
and the drama of the film.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:03.974
But our project became
much more emotional

00:12:03.974 --> 00:12:05.390
after that interaction
with Joyce.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.160
And I have to say,
having a movie that

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.400
has such a low profile
and is under the radar

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.510
and made in secret
means that we don't

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.010
have this expectation of people.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.560
There's probably a
few die-hard fans

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.310
of the Icelandic
film "Either Way."

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.060
And a few of those guys would
be shocked and horrified

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.770
that anybody dare sabotage
their beloved film.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.890
But here we could just
make our own thing

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.680
and make some
discoveries and take

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.055
advantage of those
opportunities.

00:12:29.055 --> 00:12:31.221
MATT SINGER: What was that
scene like for you, Paul?

00:12:31.221 --> 00:12:35.190
I mean, watching you talk to
her is so fascinating, too.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:41.970
PAUL RUDD: It was a really
emotional experience.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.280
And it was for her, clearly.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.880
And we were there for a while,
I mean, obviously longer

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.310
than what you see in the film.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:53.390
But to have somebody just
give you a tour of their house

00:12:53.390 --> 00:13:00.280
that is rubble and see all the
emotion played on her face,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:07.270
I was nervous that I
might say the wrong thing,

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.880
I think, through some of it.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.810
And I actually felt
very attached to her

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.800
after we finished
shooting it because she

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.510
was so vulnerable and
so open and so fragile.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.180
It was kind of impossible
to not get caught up in it.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.960
MATT SINGER: Has
she seen the movie?

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.040
DAVID GORDON GREEN: Yeah, she
saw it at South by Southwest.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.680
It was really interesting.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.040
She brought her best friend.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.630
She called her best
friend at 11:00.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.216
It was going to show at 4:00
in Austin this last March.

00:13:39.216 --> 00:13:40.590
And it was going
to show at 4:00.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.090
And she called her friend of
11:00 and says, I'm in a movie.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.910
Do you want to come see it?

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.640
She's like, what do you
mean you're in a movie?

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.110
She's like, yep.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:47.734
And then she shows
up, and her friend's

00:13:47.734 --> 00:13:50.310
like, she didn't ever tell
me that this had happened.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:51.920
And then she shows
up in a movie.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.920
And her friend was very much a
fan of Paul and Emile's work.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.770
She's like, why did I not
know my best friend was just

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.500
in a move with these guys?

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.444
Never happened to cross
her mind to tell me.

00:14:02.444 --> 00:14:03.610
I think that's really funny.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.740
But she was really
proud of the movie

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:10.570
and really seemed very sincere
in saying that it was a turning

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.730
point in her processing
of that event.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:16.889
And just having somebody there
to listen that cared, I think,

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:18.680
seems like a very
meaningful thing for her.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.514
And we had a benefit
screening last week

00:14:21.514 --> 00:14:22.930
for the fire
department out there.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.030
And it's really interesting
seeing the various audiences

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.530
that we've exposed to the film.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:33.060
And for them, it's this hard
core, mystical dramatic film

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.530
about overcoming
this circumstance.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.860
And other audiences, you'll
see it gets huge laughs.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.330
And other audiences find it
very meditative and lyrical.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:45.322
And others are grabbing on to
the heartbreak element of it.

00:14:45.322 --> 00:14:47.030
And others just think
it's a boring movie

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.467
with A kick-ass soundtrack.

00:14:48.467 --> 00:14:49.800
MATT SINGER: Well, it does have.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.844
That, I think, is
indisputable, for sure.

00:14:52.844 --> 00:14:54.260
We mentioned already
the painting,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.470
the lines on the road.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:59.230
This job that you guys are
doing out there, I mean,

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.630
would it really be
two guys by themselves

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.680
with one little thing?

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.240
Or is there some poetic license?

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.210
Is that from the remake-- or the
original movie, I should say?

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:07.760
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
In the original movie,

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.170
it was like a dude with
a roller on a brush.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:11.695
So it was even more hardcore.

00:15:11.695 --> 00:15:13.320
These guys at least
had some mechanics.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.610
PAUL RUDD: We had
an actual machine.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:15.818
MATT SINGER: Truck, at least.

00:15:15.818 --> 00:15:16.790
PAUL RUDD: A step up.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.956
MATT SINGER: And you got
to paint lines on the road.

00:15:18.956 --> 00:15:20.040
Are they still there now?

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.952
Or did they immediately
get replaced?

00:15:22.952 --> 00:15:24.910
PAUL RUDD: I think, no,
it was a special paint.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.940
PAUL RUDD: Yeah, we had to
hose it down afterwards.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.773
Yeah, they didn't want
our weird art project

00:15:28.773 --> 00:15:30.550
on the middle of
their park road.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.549
EMILE HIRSCH: Yeah, because
some of those roads,

00:15:32.549 --> 00:15:34.620
it was like if you
divided it into two lanes,

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.520
someone would drive
off the road because it

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.270
wasn't that big of a road.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.953
PAUL RUDD: We're
painting bike lanes.

00:15:38.953 --> 00:15:40.174
EMILE HIRSCH: I was like--

00:15:40.174 --> 00:15:42.590
MATT SINGER: That could have
been in the movie at the end.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:43.506
You go, wait a second.

00:15:43.506 --> 00:15:45.220
Maybe there's a huge--

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.073
PAUL RUDD: What are
these cyclists going

00:15:46.073 --> 00:15:46.864
to do without the--

00:15:46.864 --> 00:15:49.024
EMILE HIRSCH: A truck
driver just goes off the--

00:15:49.024 --> 00:15:50.440
MATT SINGER: This
could definitely

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.398
be me reading a little
too much into the movie.

00:15:52.398 --> 00:15:54.070
And if it is, shoot me down.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.880
But I'm wondering how much
of the making of this movie

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.050
is about the making
of this movie?

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.640
You guys made bigger
movies, little movies.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.140
And you've made a
bunch of big ones.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.080
And now you're making
a small one again.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.710
And the movie is
about going out alone,

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.980
how you described the
process a little bit,

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.350
getting a small crew and getting
back in touch with stuff.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.460
I'm just wondering if
you looked at it that way

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.260
at all, whether you
were sort of commenting

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.270
on your own experience.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.500
It's based on another movie,
but to me watching it,

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:26.840
I could sort of see an
autobiographical element to it.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.399
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
Well, I think

00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:30.690
a lot of that is unintentional.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:31.100
MATT SINGER: Fine.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.808
I made it all up.

00:16:31.808 --> 00:16:33.780
DAVID GORDON GREEN: But
it's not far from true.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.410
After making the last few
projects I'd worked on

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.250
were of substantial size,
budget, and expectation,

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.700
I think stripping it all
away and stepping out

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.680
into the wilderness
much like Alvin does

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.260
is something that is a
part of my personality.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.060
And I have a place in Colorado
I disappear to as much

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.800
as I can and try to keep
my head screwed on straight

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.430
when it gets a little wobbly.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:17:01.550
And this project was doing a
professional version of that,

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.950
being able to strip away
so much of the paperwork

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:07.160
and politics of movie-making and
just the nuances of performance

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.579
were essential to this.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:13.212
And it really was just the
Walden Pond of movie-making.

00:17:13.212 --> 00:17:14.670
MATT SINGER: The
other scene that I

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:18.359
wanted to ask you guys about
is, I would describe it as,

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:23.740
the bad connection scene,
which I loved as well.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.780
I mean, I could be
wrong again, but I'm

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.070
guessing that was not scripted.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.820
PAUL RUDD: I don't
think that was, was it?

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:39.120
Yeah, it was fun to do.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.640
And I think we knew
there was going

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:48.874
to be some kind of build up
and some kind of letting loose

00:17:48.874 --> 00:17:50.290
that these characters
had to have.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.720
And it was probably going
to be alcohol infused.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.727
Bad connection, I
think came from--

00:17:59.727 --> 00:18:01.310
MATT SINGER: Just
the way you said it.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.910
I'm sorry.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:02.500
EMILE HIRSCH: All
that good stuff

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.590
you said about boom guys--

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:04.070
DAVID GORDON GREEN: You
guys don't remember the--

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.240
EMILE HIRSCH: --makes you
sound like a huge hypocrite.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.115
Because you remember?

00:18:06.115 --> 00:18:08.819
It was our sound guy that we
named it after, Bad Connection.

00:18:08.819 --> 00:18:10.860
PAUL RUDD: That was what
we called the sound guy.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.652
It was his nickname,
Bad Connection.

00:18:13.652 --> 00:18:15.099
DAVID GORDON GREEN: It's true.

00:18:15.099 --> 00:18:16.140
PAUL RUDD: So we sang it.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.290
We made a song about him.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:18.140
We just called it
"Bad Connection."

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.960
EMILE HIRSCH: We sound
like hypocrites now.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.175
PAUL RUDD: We just
sound like dicks.

00:18:22.175 --> 00:18:23.800
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
Here's the novelty.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.050
So this is what's
going to inspire

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.258
you to watch the movie again.

00:18:26.258 --> 00:18:29.950
At the very beginning, the
song that Emile's character

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.320
puts in the tape
player when he gets

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.330
tired of listening to
the language tapes.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:36.746
After we'd filmed
the movie, which

00:18:36.746 --> 00:18:41.420
is improvised by these guys but
based on a little piece of tape

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.579
marking on the sound
pack of the boom operator

00:18:45.579 --> 00:18:47.120
that said "bad
connection" because he

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.760
was referring to the
cable connection.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.390
And then they
improvise the song.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:54.980
And we loved it in
the editing room.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.771
We just had so much
fun putting it together

00:18:56.771 --> 00:18:59.230
that we had an
artist write a song

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.050
as if these guys were
riffing off the song

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:02.820
and just didn't
know it very well.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.560
And so when you watch
it again, you'll

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.180
notice the song that
plays like an '80s rock

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.454
version of "Bad Connection."

00:19:08.454 --> 00:19:09.620
PAUL RUDD: "Bad Connection."

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.640
MATT SINGER: That's like
immortalized in song.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.056
PAUL RUDD: That's like the
most fun part of making movies.

00:19:13.056 --> 00:19:16.020
You get to really go deep into
something absolutely stupid.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:16.690
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
And that no one

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.900
would recognize unless they
watch the movie 16 times.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.495
MATT SINGER: Well, that's
what I was going to ask.

00:19:19.495 --> 00:19:21.250
Has anyone noticed it
without you telling them?

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:21.720
DAVID GORDON GREEN: Never.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.000
MATT SINGER: Oh, it
will definitely happen.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.809
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
It will never happen.

00:19:23.809 --> 00:19:25.850
MATT SINGER: We'll get to
some audience questions

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:26.891
maybe in a minute or two.

00:19:26.891 --> 00:19:28.950
So if you have some
questions, start

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.620
percolating them right now.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.670
The other member of the cast
is that the truck driver

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.520
is fabulous as well.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.274
But he's an actor, not
someone you found, right?

00:19:41.274 --> 00:19:42.690
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
Lance LeGault?

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:42.970
MATT SINGER: He was cast.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:44.120
Lance, yeah.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.620
DAVID GORDON GREEN: Yeah,
you know, Lance is amazing.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.370
I met him, I was doing
a Dodge commercial

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.380
in Tehachapi, California.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.760
And there was a
background actor.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.220
He was talking trash.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.200
I was trying to figure
out the new fleet of Dodge

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.060
cars were going to
blaze through this town.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.377
And then there's this guy
just like loud as hell over

00:20:01.377 --> 00:20:01.960
in the corner.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.167
I look over, and he threw
a lawn chair at a kid.

00:20:04.167 --> 00:20:05.949
It's like, who is this guy?

00:20:05.949 --> 00:20:06.990
And then I looked at him.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.275
I was keeping an
eye on him, just

00:20:08.275 --> 00:20:09.650
making sure he
didn't go berserk.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.330
And I said, he looks
really familiar.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.120
And then I started
talking to him

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.680
and realized I
did recognize him.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.080
He was in some "A-Team" episodes
and a bad guy on some "Magnum,

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.170
P.I."

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:21.820
And he was in
"Stripes" for a minute.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.260
And really interestingly,
he played with Elvis

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:30.440
for 15 years, that
singer Elvis Presley,

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.525
and traveled the
world with Elvis

00:20:32.525 --> 00:20:33.900
and was in a bunch
of his movies.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.560
And it's just this
larger-than-life personality.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.018
And that was right when we were
putting the movie together.

00:20:38.018 --> 00:20:42.430
So I thought it would be cool
to bring Lance out and play

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.830
the old cantankerous
truck driver, which

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:48.540
isn't far from
who he really was.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.630
And I liked him
mainly because I knew

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:52.100
Emile would be terrified of him.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:52.590
EMILE HIRSCH: Oh, yeah.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:53.820
MATT SINGER: I was going to
say, your scenes with him

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.490
are so fun to watch
you in those scenes.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:56.615
EMILE HIRSCH: Yeah, I know.

00:20:56.615 --> 00:20:58.850
I mean, I never knew what
he was going to say next.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.910
I mean, I remember one day I was
sitting with him and his wife.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.855
And he had his oxygen
tank on the other side.

00:21:03.855 --> 00:21:05.080
And he had his oxygen on.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.450
And I was asking him a question
about girls or something

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:07.950
like this.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.390
And he was like, let me tell
you something about girls.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.470
In the 1960s, I was with Elvis.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.560
And I played bass in Vegas.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.720
And I used it knock off two or
three pieces of pussy a day.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.910
And he was eating
peanuts at the time.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.610
And the peanuts were
hitting me in the face.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:29.560
And I would look at him
and then just look over

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.685
to his wife to make sure she's
not twisting the oxygen tank.

00:21:33.685 --> 00:21:35.400
Sorry, Paul.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.490
And she just had a
huge smile on her face

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.163
because she knew that was
Lance and he was just a beast.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.580
And sometimes, I think--
you didn't use too many,

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.625
but he would grab me
and shake me and--

00:21:51.625 --> 00:21:53.250
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
There was one thing

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.840
that we didn't use where
he smelled a fart on set.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.730
And he got mad.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.640
And there's just a
take of him looking

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.800
at Emile, pretty convinced
that Emile farted.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:05.552
And he's yelling very
deadly serious, who farted?

00:22:05.552 --> 00:22:06.476
EMILE HIRSCH: Yeah.

00:22:06.476 --> 00:22:07.684
PAUL RUDD: He was terrifying.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.970
I remember sitting next to him
and kind of out of nowhere he

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.400
goes, you know the
problem with kids today?

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.818
No grit.

00:22:18.818 --> 00:22:20.150
And I was like, I know.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.680
I have none.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.617
I never felt less gritty
around anybody than Lance.

00:22:25.617 --> 00:22:27.200
MATT SINGER: That
sounds like it could

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.300
be a line from like the next
"Anchorman" or something.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.008
I could hear that
coming out of the voice

00:22:31.008 --> 00:22:33.550
of one of the characters
or something, maybe.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:34.740
Well, that's great.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.790
Do we have any questions from
the Googlers in the audience?

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.050
Yes?

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:44.410
AUDIENCE: So first of all,
I actually lived in Austin,

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.500
moved here pretty recently.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.750
And on Cinco de Mayo,
I was next to you guys

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.270
eating at Curra's Grill.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.040
So it's good to see you again.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.790
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
That's pretty amazing.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.081
PAUL RUDD: How was your dinner?

00:22:57.081 --> 00:22:58.630
AUDIENCE: It was awesome.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:00.610
PAUL RUDD: What did
we have that night?

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:01.820
It's nice to see you, too.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.611
MATT SINGER: They have
bananas in the rice,

00:23:03.611 --> 00:23:04.900
if that recalls anything.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:05.609
But anyway--

00:23:05.609 --> 00:23:07.400
DAVID GORDON GREEN: I
remember you vividly.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.660
AUDIENCE: I didn't
bother you guys.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.118
It looked like you
had a good time.

00:23:10.118 --> 00:23:11.830
But it's good to be here now.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:15.450
Anyway, I was wondering
about the title.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.600
Is "Prince Avalanche" the title
of the Icelandic film and that

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.790
was just a nod to loyalty?

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.520
Or why did we keep the
"avalanche" portion

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.540
when we were clearly in Austin?

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.490
MATT SINGER: Not in
avalanche country?

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:29.420
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.590
MATT SINGER: The title?

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.006
DAVID GORDON GREEN: I just
think it's a really cool title.

00:23:33.006 --> 00:23:35.146
The Icelandic film was
called "Either Way."

00:23:35.146 --> 00:23:36.770
You should all hunt
it down and find it

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.090
because it's a good movie.

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:41.910
"Prince Avalanche"
was a title I woke up

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:44.400
with after a strange dream.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.190
And in my dream, I had a dream
that it was a cool title.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:50.810
And then I woke up and it
really was a cool title.

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:54.400
So it was in the same
creative melting pot of time

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.000
that this project
was coming together.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.240
And it seemed like a good idea.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.073
EMILE HIRSCH: But with
the "avalanche" part,

00:23:59.073 --> 00:24:01.360
would you say in France
they don't like it

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.250
because it's too
close to snowboarding?

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:03.860
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
Yeah, they thought

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.151
it would be about snowboarding.

00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:08.418
So they've changed the French
title to "Prince of Texas."

00:24:08.418 --> 00:24:11.190
MATT SINGER: Not a
terrible title, I suppose.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.440
It's not Alvin and
Lance together?

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.360
They kind of sound--

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.250
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
Alvin and Lance?

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.600
MATT SINGER: Yeah, Alvin, Lance.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.550
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
Put them together?

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.250
MATT SINGER: That's
what I thought.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:19.400
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
If his name was Lanch?

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.774
MATT SINGER: Lanch.

00:24:20.774 --> 00:24:21.783
I don't know.

00:24:21.783 --> 00:24:22.283
It's close.

00:24:22.283 --> 00:24:24.280
It's kind of close.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.160
PAUL RUDD: And it's Avil.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.746
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
Avil and Lanch.

00:24:27.746 --> 00:24:29.815
That would have been amazing.

00:24:29.815 --> 00:24:31.190
MATT SINGER:
Admittedly, it would

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.159
have worked better if
those were their names.

00:24:33.159 --> 00:24:34.950
PAUL RUDD: And instead
of "Bad Connection,"

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:36.616
we just listen to a
lot of Prince songs.

00:24:39.448 --> 00:24:41.431
That sucked.

00:24:41.431 --> 00:24:42.180
That was terrible.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.002
I'm so sorry, Google.

00:24:45.002 --> 00:24:50.252
God, I should have to
switch my browser for that.

00:24:50.252 --> 00:24:51.960
MATT SINGER: Another
question right here?

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.640
Yeah?

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:52.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:53.160
Hey, guys.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:53.785
How's it going?

00:24:53.785 --> 00:24:56.060
Thanks a lot for coming
and showing us the movie.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.470
Really appreciate it.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:00.410
I actually had a question,
just a general question,

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.300
regarding the
improvisational nature

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.310
of a lot of the
scenes that happened.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:09.750
I know, David, you're pretty
experienced with regarding

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:14.670
"Pineapple Express" and Paul
with Judd Apatow movies,

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:15.381
things like that.

00:25:15.381 --> 00:25:17.130
Seems like there's a
lot of deleted scenes

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.920
with a lot of just
improv that's happening.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:25.585
I was curious for the scene
with Emile, the, I guess,

00:25:25.585 --> 00:25:27.210
disappointed weekend
where you actually

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:28.830
start crying in the middle?

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:32.370
How much of that was just you
off the cuff rolling with it?

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:34.100
Or was that scripted?

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.840
How did that whole
scene play out?

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.420
EMILE HIRSCH: That
scene was actually

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:42.929
almost completely scripted,
I think almost to the word.

00:25:42.929 --> 00:25:43.470
I don't know.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.610
That was just a
really long scene.

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.690
And I wasn't really just
going off the cuff or anything

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.260
on that one.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.760
I mean, there were
some scenes where

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.770
there was elements of
improv, but never too much.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.149
I mean, most of the dialogue
was in the script, I feel.

00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.940
Surprise, surprise.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.560
MATT SINGER: Is that
accurate, most of the dialogue

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.130
was in the script?

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.930
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
There's a good bit.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.471
I honestly don't know because
I haven't read the script since

00:26:08.471 --> 00:26:10.460
before we made the film.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.530
I don't find scripts
particularly sacred or that

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:13.420
interesting.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.860
I think if actors respond to
it, and it works for them,

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.360
and it feels believable when
we're rolling, then great.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.290
If not, we'll throw it away.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.032
We'll come up with
something new.

00:26:23.032 --> 00:26:24.490
I mean, there's
plenty of sequences

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.280
that were designed out
of just the moment,

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.862
particularly when Emile's
out of town and Paul's

00:26:30.862 --> 00:26:31.570
wandering around.

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.440
All that stuff was just
whimsical thoughts that we had,

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.120
a list of a few agendas.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.540
And then we filmed things.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.150
So the camera did its own
version of improvisation.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:45.250
But I don't hold any
dialogue super close to me

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:47.580
as being super valuable
other than what feels honest.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.340
MATT SINGER: Questions
from the crowd?

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.910
Oh, someone is-- It's a race.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:56.590
Go!

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:57.784
Who will win?

00:26:57.784 --> 00:26:58.590
AUDIENCE: I won.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:59.000
MATT SINGER: You won.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.670
Go ahead.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:00.942
Congratulations.

00:27:00.942 --> 00:27:02.650
Your reward is you
get to ask a question.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:03.810
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.560
Well, first of all,
the movie's beautiful.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.684
So I just want to say that.

00:27:06.684 --> 00:27:09.050
I love the scene where you
guys are in the road right

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:10.760
after you've met
the truck driver.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.710
And all of the trees
are super vertical.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:14.230
And the lines are on the road.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:17.920
So nicely done.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.010
And now I'm going to
apologize because I

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.500
have a question for Paul.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:29.730
First of all, congrats on the
anniversary of "Clueless."

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.690
It was a super important
piece of my childhood.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:37.260
And I think I could quote
at least 75% of the movie.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.060
I read somewhere
that you auditioned

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:43.170
for a lot of the major
male roles in the movie.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.620
And I'm curious to hear
if you weren't going

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.587
to be Josh, who would
you have chosen to be?

00:27:48.587 --> 00:27:50.170
And how do you think
your career might

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:54.654
have been different as a result
of being a different character?

00:27:54.654 --> 00:27:55.820
MATT SINGER: Great question.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:56.887
PAUL RUDD: That is, yeah.

00:27:56.887 --> 00:27:58.220
MATT SINGER: Excellent question.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
"Clueless."

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.940
PAUL RUDD: It is.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.980
When I read that script
and I went in to audition

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:15.380
and I met Amy
Heckerling, I think

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.470
my initial audition
was for Josh.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:21.140
But I thought, oh,
there was characters

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.595
I'd never seen before in movies.

00:28:22.595 --> 00:28:23.970
And I remember
thinking Christian

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:24.972
was a great character.

00:28:24.972 --> 00:28:26.430
And I think that
was the first one.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:30.090
I thought, wow, a really cool
gay character in a teen movie.

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:31.060
I hadn't seen that.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.310
I'd like to audition for that.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.342
And I really wanted to
audition for-- I thought

00:28:35.342 --> 00:28:36.800
it would be a great
character would

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.821
be the one that
Donald Faison played.

00:28:38.821 --> 00:28:40.445
But I didn't realize
that he was black.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:49.850
Yeah, I thought it was like a
white guy trying to be black.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:53.070
Another thing I can't do.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:57.460
And then I auditioned for Elton,
which was Jeremy Sisto's part.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.010
And then finally, Amy
Heckerling said, well,

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:01.455
would you read for Josh?

00:29:01.455 --> 00:29:03.350
And I said, yes, absolutely.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:06.860
And so I auditioned for
that part and then--

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.110
AUDIENCE: The rest is history.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:09.820
AUDIENCE: Here you are.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.040
PAUL RUDD: And I'm just
still a little upset

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.040
I didn't get Miss Geist.

00:29:16.777 --> 00:29:17.610
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:18.425
PAUL RUDD: Thank you.

00:29:18.425 --> 00:29:18.780
MATT SINGER: Thank you.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.450
Was there a question over here?

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:21.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.660
Is thing working?

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:26.292
I didn't prepare quite
so specific a question.

00:29:26.292 --> 00:29:28.000
Anyway, I was wondering
if you guys could

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.330
talk about how Explosions in the
Sky got involved in this movie,

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:35.570
and how their music influenced
the tone of your editing

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.380
and how it all came together?

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.140
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
Good question.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.431
Explosions in the Sky, for
those of you who don't know,

00:29:40.431 --> 00:29:43.610
is a wonderful band,
Austin-based band.

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:46.375
They collaborated with my
longtime composer David Wingo

00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:48.000
to put the score of
the movie together.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.458
We've been talking
for a long time.

00:29:49.458 --> 00:29:52.380
They've done songs for two
of my films previously.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.770
So we've had that relationship.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:54.500
We go way back.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.280
And a lot of us live in
the same neighborhood.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.587
And so actually the whole
reason I went to the park

00:30:00.587 --> 00:30:02.670
in the first place is the
drummer from Explosions,

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:05.100
Chris Hrasky, told me about it.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.122
And he said, you got to
go check this park out.

00:30:07.122 --> 00:30:08.880
I remember, we were
watching the Superbowl

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.709
and just talking
about cool shit to do.

00:30:12.709 --> 00:30:14.500
And he's like, go make
a move in this park.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.570
So that happened.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.780
And then once it started
fleshing itself out,

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.360
we just started
talking about making

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.300
a bigger partnership
of the movie.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.920
And it was really cool and
a very unusual experience

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.280
in that the musicians would come
to set, spent time hanging out,

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.770
got to know the
actors, got to know

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:31.750
the environment and
the tones, and started

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.860
going home and writing themes.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.550
And so we had an
idea of where we

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:37.849
would go in the editing room.

00:30:37.849 --> 00:30:39.390
Typically, in the
editing room, we'll

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:41.330
grab a score, some
songs from other movies,

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:43.980
and edit to them as a
temporary foundation

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.930
for where we want to go.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:50.810
The problem with that is half
the time you use a movie score

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:52.630
and then you just have
to hire a composer

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:55.300
and say, kind of rip this off
because we really like it,

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.400
but make it your own
so we don't get sued.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.149
So there's a lot of
those kind of problems

00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:00.437
you have in editing.

00:31:00.437 --> 00:31:02.020
Where here it was
really just a luxury

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:03.590
to be able to walk
down the street

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:04.580
and go over to Munaf's house.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.288
And he's working on
this thing over here.

00:31:06.288 --> 00:31:08.455
And the guys, the
musicians, will go over

00:31:08.455 --> 00:31:10.330
at the end of the day
to David Wingo's house.

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:12.250
And we'll bring our
friend Mike Tully

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:15.540
to come beatbox for a track,
or a clarinet player comes in.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.070
And so we could mess around with
some of their signature sound

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:21.100
and expand that a little bit.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.710
And then walk over
to the editing room

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:24.085
and spend a little
time in there.

00:31:24.085 --> 00:31:28.300
So it was all very much like
a high school class project.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:32.580
It was very casual and laid
back and strangely efficient

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:33.740
that way.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.200
There wasn't a whole lot of
back and forth and note sessions

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.210
and this and that because
we're engineering it together.

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:42.670
I mean, it was probably a
four, five week post-production

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:46.910
period, which is hardly time to
get a rough cut in most movies.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:48.990
And we were done with
the score and done

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.698
with the cutting of
the film because they

00:31:50.698 --> 00:31:52.229
were done simultaneously.

00:31:52.229 --> 00:31:53.020
PAUL RUDD: Awesome.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:53.644
That's so cool.

00:31:53.644 --> 00:31:57.560
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
And the soundtrack's

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.290
actually coming out on the 6th.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:02.019
So if anybody liked the
music, then go check that out.

00:32:02.019 --> 00:32:02.810
It was really cool.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:04.320
The other day, I don't
know that you know this.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.660
There's two dudes dressed
up like you guys painting

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.297
a mural in Brooklyn
for the album.

00:32:10.297 --> 00:32:10.880
PAUL RUDD: No.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.130
MATT SINGER: They
specifically dressed like?

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:15.380
DAVID GORDON GREEN: We sent
the costumes, the helmets.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.220
They had the overalls.

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.636
And they were out
over on Bedford,

00:32:17.636 --> 00:32:18.730
I think, out in Brooklyn.

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:20.250
EMILE HIRSCH: Did anyone
know what they were doing?

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:20.350
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.940
MATT SINGER: Probably
no one thought

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.340
that was strange at all
in that part of Brooklyn.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.048
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
Just some weird Mario

00:32:25.048 --> 00:32:27.690
and Luigi just chilling
and painting on the side.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:29.009
PAUL RUDD: Painting a mural.

00:32:29.009 --> 00:32:31.050
MATT SINGER: Did you give
them the mustache, too?

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.260
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
I didn't see them.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.301
I saw a couple snapshots.

00:32:33.301 --> 00:32:36.690
I'll show you some pictures,
some weird ones, too.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:38.530
MATT SINGER: Was the
mustache your choice?

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:39.957
Was it David's choice?

00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:41.290
DAVID GORDON GREEN: Yours, yeah.

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:43.069
PAUL RUDD: I think
it was mine, yeah.

00:32:43.069 --> 00:32:45.610
MATT SINGER: Why did you feel
so strongly about the mustache?

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.390
PAUL RUDD: Because
it's set in 1988,

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:57.779
but it wasn't like
"The Wedding Singer."

00:32:57.779 --> 00:32:59.320
It wasn't like a
movie that was like,

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.130
oh, we're going
to really lampoon

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:02.680
'80s fashion or anything.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.622
It wasn't that at all.

00:33:03.622 --> 00:33:05.080
But I wanted to
have something that

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.320
was like a little different.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.380
And I remember I want to have
kind of Sally Jesse Raphael

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:10.720
glasses.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.550
I thought the
combination of those

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:15.375
and a mustache and
kind of like short hair

00:33:15.375 --> 00:33:17.700
but then a little
curlier on top seems--

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.760
I think I knew a guy
that had that look

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.050
and was friends with my parents
or something around that time.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:27.850
And I thought that takes
it out of hipster, too,

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:29.980
because that was a concern.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:32.441
EMILE HIRSCH: Redefines hipster.

00:33:32.441 --> 00:33:34.440
PAUL RUDD: I don't know
if it redefines hipster.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:43.270
And it also seemed to go
along with the rugged nature

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:45.910
that this character
thinks he has.

00:33:48.724 --> 00:33:50.390
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
Somebody I reference

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:54.710
a lot is summer camp counselors
from this very Christian camp

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:55.860
that I went to as a kid.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.380
And there's always this guy
with a guitar, singing songs

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:01.350
with his shirt off
and his mustache.

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:02.664
PAUL RUDD: The L-Bar-C Ranch?

00:34:02.664 --> 00:34:04.080
EMILE HIRSCH: Or
the guy that when

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.340
he talks to you to try to be
cool with the other students,

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.400
flips his chair around
and leans on the back--

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:08.800
DAVID GORDON GREEN:
Sits on it backwards?

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.040
Yeah.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.389
EMILE HIRSCH: --and
puts his hat backwards.

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:11.560
MATT SINGER: But you
do in the movie, right?

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.840
Don't you have that move?

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.380
DAVID GORDON GREEN: Yeah,
he does something like that.

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:13.630
PAUL RUDD: I do.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:14.400
I do turn around.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.774
I go over to listen
to his story.

00:34:15.774 --> 00:34:16.580
I flip the chair.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.719
And that chair, by the way,
was made for two-year-olds.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:21.499
It was such a small
part, another thing

00:34:21.499 --> 00:34:23.790
that was just like-- There's
so many little things that

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:24.969
would just make us laugh.

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:26.330
It's like, why don't
we just be sitting

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:27.440
on a really small chair?

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.940
EMILE HIRSCH: Yeah,
and you remember

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.429
the day that we
did the scene where

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:32.830
Alvin's talking
about what he does?

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:35.239
He reads, paints,
sews, and he has

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:36.790
a lot of prescription
medication?

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:37.498
PAUL RUDD: Right.

00:34:37.498 --> 00:34:40.230
EMILE HIRSCH: That scene we
could not keep a straight face.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:46.710
PAUL RUDD: Well, it was also
because I took care of my pet

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:48.520
before it was killed.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.449
And there was like no
explanation beyond that.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:52.905
Just like, I had a pet.

00:34:52.905 --> 00:34:53.800
It was killed.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.190
And I just say it and
move on to the next thing.

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:59.520
That just really
struck me as funny.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.710
And I still laugh at that.

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:05.274
But yeah, oh well.

00:35:05.274 --> 00:35:07.440
MATT SINGER: I think we're
running out of time here.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.440
If there was any
one last question?

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.380
Anybody?

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.252
We'll end with the striking
it funny, then, I guess.

00:35:15.252 --> 00:35:16.710
Guys, thank you so
much for coming.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:17.710
DAVID GORDON GREEN: Thank
you, guys, for coming.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:18.310
PAUL RUDD: Thank you.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:19.310
EMILE HIRSCH: Thank you.

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:21.310
MATT SINGER: Thank
you, everybody.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:23.160
Thanks a lot.
