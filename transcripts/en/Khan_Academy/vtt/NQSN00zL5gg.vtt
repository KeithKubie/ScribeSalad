00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.570
Let's have some practice
adding and subtracting

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.420
negative numbers.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.360
So the first example I want
to look at is 2 minus 3.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.050
So right now I'm just
subtracting a positive number

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.370
from another positive
number, but you might already

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.021
see that I'm subtracting a
larger number from a smaller

00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:16.520
number.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.370
So I'm probably, or
I will, definitely

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.710
end up with a negative number.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.584
But let's just think
about this a little bit.

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:23.530
And I'm going to do
it with a number line.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.230
So there's my number
line right over there.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.080
Now this is 0, this is 1,
this is 2, this is negative 1,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.030
this is negative 2.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.220
We could view this
as starting at 2.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.280
So this is 2 right over
here, and then we're

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.150
going to subtract 3 from that 2.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.260
So we're going to move 3 to
the left on the number line.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.420
So we're going to move
3 to the left, 1, 2, 3.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.330
And that gets us to negative 1.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.940
This is equal to negative 1.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.810
Now let's mix it up
a little bit more.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:01.800
Let's imagine what would happen
if we had negative 2 minus 3.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.500
So this was positive 2 minus 3.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.290
Now let's think about
negative 2 minus 3.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.350
So once again, let's
draw our number line.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.350
And I'll put 0 over here.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.800
So this is 0, this is 1, this
is negative 1, negative 2,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.030
negative 3, negative 4,
negative 5, negative 6, and I

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.380
could keep going.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.460
But we're starting
at negative 2,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.160
and then we're
subtracting 3 again.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.826
So once again, we're
going to move three

00:01:31.826 --> 00:01:33.490
to the left of negative 2.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.640
So we go 1, 2, 3.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.230
We end up at negative 5.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.380
So this is negative 5.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.770
So notice in both
situations we subtracted 3,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.960
we moved 3 to the left
on the number line.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.920
It's just here we started
2 to the right of 0.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.800
Here we started 2
to the left of 0.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.330
This is negative 2.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.640
Let's do another example
with these same numbers.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:05.170
Let's imagine negative 2 plus 3.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.830
I encourage you to
pause this video,

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.060
and try to think about
this on your own.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.254
So we could draw
the number line--

00:02:12.254 --> 00:02:14.420
I could draw a straighter
number line than that-- so

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.170
draw the number line again.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.460
And let's say that
this is negative 2,

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.102
negative 1, 0, 1, and 2 again.

00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:24.560
We're starting at
negative 2, we're

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.724
starting 2 to the left of zero.

00:02:27.724 --> 00:02:30.140
So we're starting at negative
2, and we're going to add 3.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.598
So we're going to
go 3 to the right

00:02:31.598 --> 00:02:40.670
now, 1, 2, 3, and we
end up at positive 1.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.450
Now let's think about
2, so positive 2,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.440
and we're going to
subtract a negative 3.

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.950
And other videos we've
already talked about this.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.158
In fact, there's a video
explaining why this actually

00:02:59.158 --> 00:02:59.840
makes sense.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.390
But when you
subtract a negative,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.560
this is the same thing
as adding the positive.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.460
So 2 minus negative 3 is
the exact same thing as 2

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.030
plus 2 plus positive 3.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.060
These two statements
are equivalent,

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.280
and this just boils down
to, this right over here,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.290
is just going to be 5.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.390
Now, let's mix it up
a little bit more.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:31.280
Let's imagine negative
2 minus negative 3.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.890
Now, this might seem
really intimidating to have

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.810
all of these negatives
in place here,

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.130
but you just have to
remember subtracting

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.210
a negative, like this, is
going to get you a positive.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:52.090
So this is the exact same
thing as negative 2 plus 3,

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.720
and negative 2 plus
3, we've already

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.890
seen it right over here.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.310
You start at negative 2, you
start 2 to the left of 0,

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.080
and then we're going
to go 3 to the right,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.678
we're adding 3, 1, 2, 3.
