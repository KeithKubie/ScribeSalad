00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:06.580
DANIEL PINK: All right.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.420
Thank you, Heath.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.670
Thank you guys for being here.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.590
So I'm eager to tell you
about this latest book,

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.150
tell you why I
wrote it, and then

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.360
give you some ideas from it
and then take some questions.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.150
I wrote this book out of a
sense of frustration largely.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.330
I was making all kinds of
decisions in my own life

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.610
about when to do things.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.630
When should I exercise?

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.990
When should I do
this kind of work?

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.120
What should I do
that kind of work?

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.380
When should I start a project?

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.870
When should I abandon a
project that's not working?

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.491
And I was making those decisions
in a very, very sloppy way.

00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:36.490
I felt that I can make
them in a more coherent--

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.440
I wanted to make
them in a better way.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.730
I looked around for guidance.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.616
It didn't exist, but
that got me curious.

00:00:43.616 --> 00:00:45.490
I've written some books
about social science.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.316
And I said, I wonder if there is
any research on this question?

00:00:48.316 --> 00:00:49.690
And it turned out
there was a lot

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.950
of research on this question.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.370
It was in many, many fields--
literally dozens of fields.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.510
It was in economics
and social psychology,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.810
but it was also in
molecular biology.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.190
There's a whole field
of chronobiology.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.440
There is research
in anesthesiology,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.450
endocrinology-- all
these different fields

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.490
asking very similar questions.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.947
What's the effect of time of day
on what we do and how we do it?

00:01:09.947 --> 00:01:11.530
How do beginnings
affect our behavior?

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.120
How do midpoints
affect our behavior?

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.990
How do endings
affect our behavior?

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.990
And I felt if you go wide
enough and deep enough

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.990
into this research you can
begin to piece together

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.990
the evidence-based ways to
make better, smarter, shorter

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.850
decisions about
when to do things.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.950
For you guys, what I did
is I just put together

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.320
five questions.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.390
I'm going to ask five
questions and then provide

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.472
the answers to those questions
based on this research.

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:39.013
But the main idea
here-- and then I'm

00:01:39.013 --> 00:01:41.137
going to spend a lot of
time taking your questions.

00:01:41.137 --> 00:01:43.630
The main idea here is that we
think that timing is an art,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.917
but it's really a science.

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:46.750
We don't have to make
these timing decisions

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.560
in such a haphazard, intuitive,
guesswork-centered way.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.320
We can make them in a better,
smarter, more systematic way.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.200
So let's talk about five.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.920
I'm talking five very specific,
nitty-gritty questions about

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.180
timing--

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.820
all kinds of different things,
fairly idiosyncratic list here.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.210
So number one-- at
what time of day

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.720
should Alphabet hold its
quarterly earnings calls?

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.830
Alphabet holds its
earnings calls at 1:30

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.230
Pacific, 4:30 Eastern.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.180
Is that a good idea?

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.550
Does it matter at what
time of day we do things?

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.710
Does it matter a little?

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.087
Does it matter a lot?

00:02:22.087 --> 00:02:23.170
Let's find out, all right?

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.919
There's a huge amount
of research on this.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.350
This is just one
tiny little nugget.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.010
And as many of you know,
there's some incredible insights

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.340
one can get from big data now.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.257
I don't need to explain
all that to you.

00:02:36.257 --> 00:02:37.840
One of the really
interesting programs

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.470
being used in big data research
is something called LIWC--

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.310
L-I-W-C-- the Linguistic
Inquiry Word Count.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.500
It's basically a
gigantic text analyzer.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.260
It can take a giant body of
text or a small body of text

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.660
and do all kinds of analysis
that would otherwise

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.670
take an army of people to do.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.050
So these researchers at NYU--

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.760
so there's been
research on tracking.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.590
You can actually have
a pretty good read

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.860
on the patterns of mood
over the course of a day

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.820
by analyzing tweets,
because the program

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.290
can measure the emotional
valence of the words there.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.070
You can do all kinds of
things with this, including

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.010
measuring any body of text.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.880
So here's a body of text--

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.515
26,000 corporate earnings calls.

00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:25.640
All these corporate earnings
calls are transcribed.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.200
You guys put them on your site--

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.020
the transcriptions of all
of your earnings calls.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.960
These researchers at NYU
took these 26,000 calls

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.100
from 2,100 companies
over 6 and 1/2 years.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.089
Now, just think about manually
reading through 26,000

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:42.130
corporate earnings calls.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.380
You would want to just beat
your head against the wall

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.400
after about five, right?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.410
And so they were actually
looking for something else.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.790
And they said, does
the emotional content

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.150
of the words being used
in these earnings calls

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.125
both by the executives
who are leading it

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:00.750
and by the analysts
and journalists who

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.400
are asking questions--
does the mood

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.730
change at all based
on time of day?

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.560
And the answer was,
yeah, even when

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.180
you control for fundamentals--

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.649
even when you control
for fundamentals, right?

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.300
Here's what happened.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.420
Afternoon calls were
more negative, irritable,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.910
and combative, leading to--

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.470
here's the punch
line right here--

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.330
temporary stock mispricings
for firms hosting earnings

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.882
calls later in the day.

00:04:33.882 --> 00:04:35.340
Now, think about
that for a second.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.027
That's kind of weird, right?

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:38.110
It doesn't make any sense.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.735
Think about it.

00:04:38.735 --> 00:04:40.890
You guys are familiar
with earnings calls.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.720
The people who do
your earnings calls--

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.460
your CEO and your CFO--

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.810
what's your CEO's first name?

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.190
Sundar, right?

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.690
OK, right.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.880
And then your CFO is Ruth.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.955
So are Sundar and
Ruth pretty good?

00:04:52.955 --> 00:04:54.420
Are they any good?

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.460
They know what they're
doing more or less?

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.380
You're being videotaped,
but you know.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.130
They know what they're
doing more or less?

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.730
OK.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.640
Do you think those guys prepare
for these earnings calls?

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.890
Any of you ever been involved
in anything like that?

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.360
They prepare like
crazy-- not just

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.300
these two but any CFO and CEO.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.620
They prepare like crazy.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.674
They have talking points.

00:05:14.674 --> 00:05:15.840
They rehearse the questions.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.965
They're very well prepared.

00:05:16.965 --> 00:05:19.980
Do Sundar and Ruth have anything
at stake in these earnings

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.120
calls?

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.800
What?

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.300
Repetition.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.385
What else?

00:05:25.385 --> 00:05:26.760
You can say it--
personal wealth.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.840
Exactly.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.440
All right.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.060
So here you have--

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.520
and just extrapolate to how
many companies were there?

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.590
2,100 companies.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.930
Extrapolate to 2,000 companies.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.710
Their CEOs and CFOs
know what they're doing.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.780
They're well prepared.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.100
They have something at stake.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.710
And yet time of
day had an effect

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.660
on the mood of these
calls to the point

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.900
where the stocks for
afternoon conference calls

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.686
were temporarily mispriced.

00:05:55.686 --> 00:05:57.560
And I'm convinced there's
someone out there--

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.300
maybe even in this building--

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.200
who has written a
program to exploit

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.000
that delta between
the true price

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.550
and the misprice
because of time of day.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.690
And over and over
and over again,

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.590
we see this in the research--
over and over and over again.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.090
Here's what we know.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.619
Our mood does not stay the
same throughout the day.

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:18.410
Our cognitive abilities
don't stay the same

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.460
throughout the day.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.960
Our mood and our
cognitive abilities

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.640
change throughout the day.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.890
They change in predictable
ways, and they sometimes

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.720
can change in dramatic ways.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.000
Let me tell you what that means.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.500
Basically what we know is this.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.630
We tend to move through
the day in three stages--

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.870
peak, trough, recovery,
peak, trough, recovery.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.920
In general, our mood
goes up, then it dips,

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.460
then it goes back up again.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.100
And that has an
effect on performance,

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.930
and performance
varies more than you

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.650
would think over time of day.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.620
I'll give you an
example of that--

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.519
hospitals.

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:54.560
If you learn nothing else
from our little session

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.860
here this morning, don't go to
the hospital in the afternoon

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.890
if you can avoid it.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.750
There are predictable
differences

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.540
in hospital performance
based on time of day.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.200
Example-- anesthesia errors--

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.350
four times more likely at
3:00 PM than at 9:00 AM.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.440
hand washing in hospitals-- huge
deterioration in hand washing

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.805
at hospitals in the afternoon.

00:07:20.805 --> 00:07:21.430
It's lunchtime.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.280
Let's talk about colonoscopies.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.910
Colonoscopies-- doctors
find half as many polyps

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.380
in afternoon exams as
they do in morning exams.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.066
Unnecessary antibiotics
fueling the rise of superbugs--

00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:35.440
much more likely
to be prescribed

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.587
in the afternoon
versus the morning.

00:07:40.587 --> 00:07:41.670
You see it in health care.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:42.610
You see it in education.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.984
There's a great
piece of research

00:07:43.984 --> 00:07:47.610
from the University of Chicago
looking at 2 million students

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.130
from the LA Unified
School District.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.230
Students who took
math in the morning

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:58.140
had better GPAs, higher
test scores than students

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.940
who took math in the afternoon.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.644
Over and over and over
again we see this pattern.

00:08:02.644 --> 00:08:03.810
Here's what we need to know.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.390
Our cognitive abilities
don't remain the same

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.220
over the course of the day.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.330
They change.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.010
They change in predictable ways.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.140
They sometimes change
in dramatic ways,

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.330
and the right time
to do something

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.082
depends on what you're doing.

00:08:17.082 --> 00:08:18.540
We can talk more
about that in Q&amp;A,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.300
because I'm going to
be pretty brief here.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.470
Another question about
the particular tactical--

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.260
just put basically a dog's
breakfast of tactical questions

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.250
about timing.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.780
Two-- when should you ask
your boss for a raise?

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.590
When should you ask
your boss for a raise?

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:38.710
What time of day do
you think you should

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:39.793
ask your boss for a raise?

00:08:39.793 --> 00:08:40.730
AUDIENCE: After lunch.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:41.659
DANIEL PINK: After lunch.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:41.870
OK.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:42.453
Good instinct.

00:08:42.453 --> 00:08:43.610
What makes you say that?

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.837
AUDIENCE: They're happy
that they've eaten.

00:08:46.837 --> 00:08:50.450
DANIEL PINK: They're happy that
they've eaten a free meal, OK?

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.410
That's a good instinct.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.472
Tell me your first name.

00:08:52.472 --> 00:08:53.180
AUDIENCE: Amelia.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:53.750
DANIEL PINK: Amelia.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:54.170
All right.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.220
So let's take a look at this.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.470
Here's what we're going to do.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.780
We're going to analogize
to some research--

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.870
very powerful pretty well-known
research out of Israel.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.775
This is a study done of judges--

00:09:07.775 --> 00:09:11.380
a study done of parole hearings.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.860
You'll see why this matters.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.460
These judges come before--

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.930
you have prisoners in Israel
who come before these judges,

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.290
and these judges decide
whether they get parole.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.960
Do they stay in prison for
the rest of their term?

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.920
Do they get early release?

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.730
Do they continue wearing
an ankle monitor,

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.160
or are they allowed
to remove it?

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.350
These are pretty significant
decisions about human liberty.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:42.360
Does time of day effect
those judicial decisions?

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.370
And the answer is--

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.640
what do you think the answer is?

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.710
Why else would I be
mentioning it, right?

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.820
I want you to take a
look at this chart here.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.490
This is a chart.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:57.170
On the vertical axis is your
probability of getting paroled.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.300
The horizontal axis
is time of day.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.350
Early in the day, you've got
a pretty good chance, then big

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.130
drop.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.040
Then-- Amelia's instincts
were very good--

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.450
the judge has a break.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.170
It goes back up
then way back down.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:17.660
Then the judge has a
break, then way back up.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.440
Now think about
this for a second.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.150
Remember, your timing of when
you appear before that judge is

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.570
largely random, right?

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.490
It's like going to the DMV.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.499
How long is a person
waiting in line?

00:10:32.499 --> 00:10:34.790
I guess nobody here owns a
car, so let's make something

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.080
more relevant to your life.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.277
You're waiting in line
at Whole Foods, OK?

00:10:38.277 --> 00:10:39.860
You're waiting in
line at Whole Foods.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:45.050
How long it takes depends
on who's in front of you--

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.554
how long that takes.

00:10:46.554 --> 00:10:48.470
You don't know when
you're going to get taken.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.636
So take a look at that here.

00:10:49.636 --> 00:10:52.100
So imagine your loved one is
coming in for a parole hearing

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.880
immediately before
the judge has a break.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.330
Your odds are not good.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.390
And then imagine
the schmo behind--

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.310
the next person in
line, the person

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:05.570
who had ticket number 14 versus
ticket number 13 in the order--

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.500
comes in after the
judge has their break.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.400
There's like a seven
or eight x difference.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.230
So what does this have
to do with your boss?

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.610
Here's what it has
to do with your boss.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.980
When we make decisions--
human beings make decisions--

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.520
So first of all, this should
scare the hell out of us

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.350
about the criminal
justice system.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:30.600
There other things about this.

00:11:33.439 --> 00:11:34.980
There's a great book
that I recommend

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.770
to you called "Unfair" by a
guy named Adam Benforado who's

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.930
a professor at
Temple Law School.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.270
And it basically makes
this very powerful argument

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.640
that much of our
justice system is

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.100
built on assumptions
and premises

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.730
about human behavior
that are not true.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.210
That's problematic.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.049
And so this might
be another example.

00:11:54.049 --> 00:11:55.590
I'll give you another
example of time

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.230
of day effects on
juror decision making.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.787
This is experimental research.

00:11:59.787 --> 00:12:00.620
Here's what they do.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.620
They have a fact
pattern, all right?

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.995
So here's what
we're going to do.

00:12:03.995 --> 00:12:05.850
I got a fact pattern
about a defendant.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.210
And I'm going to give this
group this fact pattern,

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.189
and I'm going to give this
group this fact pattern.

00:12:12.189 --> 00:12:14.730
I'm going to describe to you a
defendant and all the evidence

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.540
about that defendant.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.790
You get the same fact pattern.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.040
You get the same fact pattern.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.710
The only difference is that
this group, the defendant's name

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.900
is Robert Garner,
and in this group,

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.060
the defendant's name
is Roberto Garcia--

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.100
same exact facts though.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.340
When jurors deliberated
in the morning,

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.440
both defendants are
treated the same way.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.760
When jurors deliberated
in the afternoon,

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.870
they were more likely to
exonerate Garner and convict

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.830
Garcia on the same set of facts.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:44.680
Yeah.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.300
So we should be
disturbed about this

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.900
for a number of
different reasons.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.830
But let's take this back to
decision making writ large.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.930
When people make decisions--

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.520
anybody makes a
decision-- they come

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.040
to that decision with,
in their back pocket,

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.660
a default decision.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.970
And that decision is largely no.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.792
Anybody here in sales?

00:13:02.792 --> 00:13:03.700
OK, yeah.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.147
So when you go to
pitch a prospect

00:13:05.147 --> 00:13:07.480
or something like that, you
know what I'm talking about.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.401
The default decision
is no, right?

00:13:09.401 --> 00:13:10.900
You go to ask your
boss for a raise.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.257
The default decision is no.

00:13:12.257 --> 00:13:13.840
You go to ask somebody
out for a date.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.140
The default decision is no-- at
least that was my experience.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.990
And when parole
judges make decisions,

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.310
the default answer is no.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:29.170
Remember, if a judge doesn't
grant parole, she's fine.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.960
If a judge grants parole and
that person she's paroled

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.790
goes on to do
something horrible,

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.800
that's really bad for her.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.020
So the default decision
is not to grant parole.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.750
What we see over and over again
in studies of decision making

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:41.710
is the following.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:47.140
People are more likely to
overcome the default early

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.990
in the day and
immediately after breaks--

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.180
early in the day and
immediately after breaks.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.970
So Amelia, you were
exactly right about that.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.100
Hit your boss after
lunch if you want

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.920
a raise, because her default
answer is going to be no.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.350
Let's go to another
idiosyncratic

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.940
tactical question.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.810
When should you begin a new
diet or exercise program?

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.050
Does it matter the
day that you begin?

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.524
Of course it does.

00:14:10.524 --> 00:14:11.440
Let's talk about this.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.810
We're going to move
beyond the unit of a day.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.060
We're going to talk about
timing in a broader sense.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.643
There's some very
interesting research

00:14:17.643 --> 00:14:20.590
on what are called
"temporal landmarks."

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.630
So think about a landmark
in physical space.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.090
What does a landmark
in physical space do?

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.130
Get you to slow down
and pay attention.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.960
Helps you navigate, right?

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.850
So there are also
temporal landmarks.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.440
There's some good research--

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.760
a lot of research on this.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.135
Some of the best research is
done by researchers at Penn,

00:14:36.135 --> 00:14:39.110
including Katy Milkman, Jason
Reese, and Hengchen Dai,

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.906
who's no longer at
Penn-- now at UCLA.

00:14:42.906 --> 00:14:44.030
Here's what they found out.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.930
There's certain dates
that seem to be better--

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:51.664
make it more likely that people
will embark on behavior change.

00:14:51.664 --> 00:14:53.830
So you know this with New
Year's resolutions, right?

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.520
Anybody ever made New
Year's resolutions?

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.600
New Year's resolutions
get a lot of bad press.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:58.960
Here's the thing.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.460
New Year's resolutions--
oh, my God.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.850
Half the people don't even--

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.580
half of New Year's
resolutions fail.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.960
To me, you've buried
the lead in that.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.810
I think the lead is that means
half of New Year's resolutions

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:14.837
succeed.

00:15:14.837 --> 00:15:17.170
That's a big deal when you
think about how hard changing

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:18.370
behavior is.

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:19.130
That's a big deal.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:19.630
Why?

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.500
Because all dates are
not created equal.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.100
Some of them operate
as temporal landmarks,

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.430
operating somewhat similar to
physical landmarks in space.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.200
What do these
temporal landmarks do?

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.680
They trigger a peculiar
form of mental accounting.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.224
We open up a fresh ledger
on ourselves essentially,

00:15:35.224 --> 00:15:37.390
the same way a business
would open up a fresh ledger

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.160
on a new quarter or a new year.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.080
So when they look
at the research

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.650
on when people begin
behavior change-- and again,

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:45.880
it's axiomatic.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.940
You're more likely to change
your behavior if you begin

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.830
to try to change your behavior.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.370
You don't begin, your behavior
is not going to change, right?

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.750
So what do we see?

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.360
This is a study of a
very large university,

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.996
and they were able to get
the data by looking at--

00:16:00.996 --> 00:16:02.870
when you go to the gym,
you have to swipe in.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.180
And so they had massive
amounts of data.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.450
When do people go to the gym?

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:08.350
Start of a new
semester-- huge increase.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.400
Start of a new year--

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.000
big increase.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.180
Start of a new month--

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:11.990
big increase.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.300
Start of a new week--

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.470
very big increase.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.480
After your birthday-- a
somewhat big increase.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.030
This is mitigated by the fact
that there are decreases.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.700
There's a big drop in
going to the gym on the day

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.280
after your 21st birthday.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.710
I'm not joking.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.519
So what do we know about that?

00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:29.560
What's our question here?

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.330
Our question here is, when
should you begin a new diet

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.280
or exercise program--
any behavior change?

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.900
The day you choose to begin--

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.830
those days are not
all created equal.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.960
You have a better chance if you
begin on a Monday rather than

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.043
a Thursday, if you begin
on the first of the month

00:16:41.043 --> 00:16:43.220
rather than on the
13th of the month.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.497
You can choose personal
temporal landmarks.

00:16:45.497 --> 00:16:47.830
You're better off beginning
the day after your birthday,

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.140
the day after your
anniversary working here

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.720
than three days before that.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.580
Temporal landmarks
shape our behavior,

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.230
help us change our behavior.

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.510
Number four-- when are
you most likely to run

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.742
your first marathon--
at what age?

00:17:00.742 --> 00:17:01.283
AUDIENCE: 35.

00:17:01.283 --> 00:17:01.990
DANIEL PINK: 35.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:03.560
Great guess.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.480
Who else has a guess?

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.512
35 is a great guess.

00:17:06.512 --> 00:17:07.474
AUDIENCE: 29.

00:17:07.474 --> 00:17:08.140
DANIEL PINK: 29.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.617
Who said 29?

00:17:09.617 --> 00:17:10.450
Why do you think 29?

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.089
AUDIENCE: I think
as you approach 30,

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:13.349
you start to [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:14.890
DANIEL PINK: Have
you run a marathon?

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:15.470
AUDIENCE: No.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.810
I'll be 29 next year, and
I'd like to run a marathon.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:18.680
DANIEL PINK: OK, there you go.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.805
So tell me your first name.

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:20.510
AUDIENCE: Abby.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.260
DANIEL PINK: Abby.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.569
Abby wants to run a
marathon at age 29.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:24.861
Why, Abby?

00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:26.402
AUDIENCE: Because
it's something I've

00:17:26.402 --> 00:17:27.901
said I wanted to
do for a long time,

00:17:27.901 --> 00:17:31.949
and I'd rather do it when I'm
in better physical fitness.

00:17:31.949 --> 00:17:32.490
I don't know.

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:34.630
30 feels like a--

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:35.810
a thing to do before 30.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.010
DANIEL PINK: Absolutely.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:40.190
So here's what we
know about that.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:44.160
As luck would have
it, I have a chart

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.780
on 29-year-olds and marathon
running believe it or not.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:50.970
Now, here's what we know.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.810
The age at which people are most
likely to run a first marathon

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.640
is age 29.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.485
This is the work of
Hal Hershfield at UCLA

00:17:58.485 --> 00:18:00.050
and Adam Alter at NYU.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.760
29-year-olds-- twice as likely
to run a first marathon as

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.870
28-year-olds.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.360
29-year-olds-- twice as
likely to run a first marathon

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:12.492
as 30-year-olds for exactly the
reason that Abby is telling us.

00:18:12.492 --> 00:18:14.700
Abby, do you think you're
going to be physiologically

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:15.930
different next year--

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.441
twice as physiologically
set to run a marathon?

00:18:19.441 --> 00:18:24.700
AUDIENCE: If our trainer at
the gym has anything to say.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.700
DANIEL PINK: There are
not massive physiological

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.783
differences between
28-year-olds and 29-year-olds,

00:18:28.783 --> 00:18:30.065
between 29 and 30-year-olds.

00:18:30.065 --> 00:18:31.440
Let me give you
another question.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.060
What's another age at
which people are most--

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.935
I'll give you a hint.

00:18:33.935 --> 00:18:35.340
It's about 10 years later.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.250
What's another age at which
people are disproportionately

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.610
likely to run their
first marathon?

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:41.160
39.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:41.660
OK.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.670
Here's another one.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.580
What's another age at which
people are disproportionately

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.954
likely to run the
first marathon?

00:18:45.954 --> 00:18:46.650
49.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:47.870
Let's look at that.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:52.290
49-year-olds-- three times more
likely to run a first marathon

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:53.700
than 50-year-olds.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.300
Right?

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.540
There's a whole effect.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.440
Remember, our lives in
some ways are episodic.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.940
And there's a whole
line of research

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.670
that I write about in here
about the effect of endings

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:03.430
on our behavior.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:06.390
One of the things that endings
do is endings help us energize.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.090
When the end of something
becomes salient,

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.946
we kick a little harder.

00:19:11.946 --> 00:19:13.320
One final question
for all of you

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.480
before we take some
questions from you--

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.920
another idiosyncratic
tactical question.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.420
Here we go.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.010
We're going to play
a guessing game.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.830
What activity am I describing?

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.500
I'm going to
describe the benefits

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.580
of a particular activity.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.370
You are to tell me what
activity I'm describing.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.380
Here's what this
activity does for us.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.230
It delivers a significant
boost to positive mood.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.150
Any guesses yet?

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.110
AUDIENCE: Sleeping.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.010
DANIEL PINK: Sleeping, good.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:38.790
AUDIENCE: Dancing.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.570
DANIEL PINK: Dancing, good.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.170
AUDIENCE: Exercise.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:40.980
DANIEL PINK: Exercise, good.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.190
OK.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:42.740
This is good, so stick
with those answers.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.220
Here, I'll give you another one.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:44.910
This like a game show.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.460
We're going to peel
this back a little bit.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.090
It increases
sensitivity to others

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:51.210
and makes you more likely
to subsequently cooperate

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.137
with others or
perform a good deed.

00:19:53.137 --> 00:19:54.330
AUDIENCE: Alcohol.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.920
DANIEL PINK: Alcohol, good.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.640
Great guess.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.140
OK.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.190
So what do we have
on the table here?

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.860
We have alcohol.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.750
AUDIENCE: The holidays.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.350
DANIEL PINK: The holidays?

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:02.850
OK.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:03.820
So let's see what we
have on the table here.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.240
We have celebrating a holiday.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.180
We have exercise.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.319
We have alcohol.

00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:08.610
AUDIENCE: Expressing gratitude.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.140
DANIEL PINK: Expressing
gratitude, very good.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:10.635
AUDIENCE: Meditation.

00:20:10.635 --> 00:20:11.130
AUDIENCE: Taking a walk.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.713
DANIEL PINK: Taking
a walk, very good.

00:20:12.713 --> 00:20:13.941
Meditation, very good.

00:20:13.941 --> 00:20:14.440
All right.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.979
So there's more here, folks.

00:20:15.979 --> 00:20:16.520
There's more.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.610
Here's what else it does.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.684
It calms heart rates and
it boost endorphin levels.

00:20:20.684 --> 00:20:21.650
AUDIENCE: Meditation?

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:22.400
DANIEL PINK: Meditation, good.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.775
We have two votes
for meditation.

00:20:23.775 --> 00:20:25.160
We're not done.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.060
AUDIENCE: Eating.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.143
DANIEL PINK: Eating, good.

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:27.885
Good guess.

00:20:27.885 --> 00:20:28.820
AUDIENCE: Sex.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.350
DANIEL PINK: Good guess.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.140
Sex is good.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.150
It increases pain
thresholds and reduces

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:36.760
the need for pain medication.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.469
AUDIENCE: Friday.

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:38.301
DANIEL PINK: Friday.

00:20:38.301 --> 00:20:38.990
Good guess.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:40.850
Great guess.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.050
You guys are circling this.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.492
AUDIENCE: Marijuana?

00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:44.700
DANIEL PINK: Marijuana, good.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.050
So what do we have?

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:45.800
We have marijuana.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.820
We have meditation.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:47.750
We have Friday.

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:48.530
We have sex.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.030
We have alcohol.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.220
We have exercise.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.480
That's not it.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.450
One more-- it increases the
production of immunoglobulin,

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.176
making it easier to
fight infections.

00:20:58.176 --> 00:20:58.850
AUDIENCE: Sleep?

00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:59.641
DANIEL PINK: Sleep?

00:20:59.641 --> 00:21:00.934
Good guess.

00:21:00.934 --> 00:21:01.850
It's not sleep either.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:02.683
You know what it is?

00:21:02.683 --> 00:21:03.442
AUDIENCE: Reading?

00:21:03.442 --> 00:21:04.400
DANIEL PINK: Say again?

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.060
AUDIENCE: Reading.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:05.390
DANIEL PINK: Reading.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.386
Good guess.

00:21:06.386 --> 00:21:07.300
AUDIENCE: Sunlight?

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.216
DANIEL PINK: Sunlight?

00:21:08.216 --> 00:21:09.011
Good guess.

00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:10.010
AUDIENCE: Your birthday?

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.135
DANIEL PINK: Your birthday?

00:21:11.135 --> 00:21:13.290
My birthday?

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.850
My birthday has this
effect on people worldwide.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.770
When it's my birthday, July
23, immunoglobulin levels

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:20.860
around the world spike.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.122
AUDIENCE: Adaptogens?

00:21:22.122 --> 00:21:23.080
DANIEL PINK: Say again?

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.000
AUDIENCE: Adaptogens?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.550
DANIEL PINK: Adaptogens?

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.530
OK.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.390
I don't even know what that
is, but it's a great guess.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.100
Here's what it is.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:32.992
It's an activity.

00:21:32.992 --> 00:21:33.700
It's an activity.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.610
You guys had a lot of
guesses for activities,

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.620
but you didn't manage to
get the right activity.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.870
The activity that has all these
benefits is choral singing.

00:21:44.124 --> 00:21:45.540
You seem pumped
about that answer.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.340
Why?

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.298
AUDIENCE: Because I just
started singing again,

00:21:48.298 --> 00:21:50.370
and I'm actually working
one on one with a coach.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:55.270
And she probably said all
these benefits to me verbatim.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.630
And I forgot that
that was singing.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:58.380
DANIEL PINK: Yeah.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.620
But it's not just singing,
it's singing in a group.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.100
It's singing in a group
that is different.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.230
Here's what this is about.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.540
There is a rich and
fascinating body

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:11.610
of evidence showing how people
coordinate and synchronize

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.320
in time--

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.082
how we're able to do that
but also the benefits of it.

00:22:16.082 --> 00:22:17.790
These are the benefits
of choral singing.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:21.180
Basically, choral singing
is about as good for you

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.540
as exercise.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.540
Tell me your first name?

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.406
AUDIENCE: Lakshmana.

00:22:24.406 --> 00:22:25.364
DANIEL PINK: Lakshmana?

00:22:25.364 --> 00:22:26.710
Lakshmana says exercise.

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.530
Exercise is so good for you.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.420
You're crazy if
you don't exercise.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.060
Exercise is so, so, so, so
good for you, all right?

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:40.050
Choral singing gets
the silver medal.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:45.040
I think it delivers more
benefits than meditation.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.831
The research is
overwhelming on this,

00:22:46.831 --> 00:22:48.580
and it's part of a
larger body of research

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.310
showing the benefits
of synchronization.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:53.680
When we synchronize with
other people, we feel better.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.971
I'll give you an example of it.

00:22:54.971 --> 00:22:56.530
Let's take rowing.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.090
Measure people rowing
individually-- you can measure,

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.520
because it's physical.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.070
You can put cameras on
people, sensors on people

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.940
and say, go row.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.550
And you row your whatever
the boat is called.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:09.630
You row the boat, all right?

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.170
And so you can measure
physical exertion.

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:13.900
And then you can say
to people, how much

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.557
pain are you experiencing?

00:23:15.557 --> 00:23:17.140
Because it's very
physically exerting.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.940
You can give them a chart
saying, how much pain are you

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:19.870
experiencing?

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.510
Then you can have
them row with a team--

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.724
row in a group.

00:23:23.724 --> 00:23:25.390
And they can exert
themselves physically

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:27.910
the exact same amount.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:29.320
We can measure this.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.210
Exert the exact same amount--

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.810
they report feeling less pain
even though they were exerting

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:36.400
themselves the same amount.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.920
They were in a group
doing it in synchrony.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.540
They reported less pain.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:45.370
You see this in some really
fascinating work on children.

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.380
You have children.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.800
Imagine you're children.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.420
I'm the teacher.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.670
This half of the room--

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.744
we're going to play an awesome,
fun game for a little while.

00:23:56.744 --> 00:23:58.160
This group over
here-- we're going

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.720
to play an awesome,
fun game, but it's

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.680
going to be a synchronous game.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.970
We're going to play
a game like clap

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.890
and tap where you go--
everybody follow me.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:05.000
Clap, clap, clap.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.800
Oh, you don't-- I mean
just hypothetically.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.330
Tap, tap, clap, clap-- we
play a synchronous game.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.040
Totally fun game--
it's synchronous.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.810
Totally fun game--
it's not synchronous.

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:19.880
We take these kids, move
them out of this room--

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.000
more likely to help the
teacher, more likely

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.775
to want to play with kids
who don't look like them.

00:24:24.775 --> 00:24:26.150
Same thing is true
on swing sets.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:27.260
This is incredible.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.551
This is research out of Oxford.

00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:29.367
This is incredible.

00:24:29.367 --> 00:24:30.950
Swinging-- swinging
is awesome, right?

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.574
Being on a swing set
is awesome, right?

00:24:32.574 --> 00:24:34.280
Total mood booster.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.430
Unless you have serious
motion sickness issues,

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.200
swinging is cool, right?

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.720
So you put two kids on a swing.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.087
These two kids
swing synchronously.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.320
Next two kids swing
asynchronously.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.110
These two kids who swung
synchronously-- same thing--

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.579
more likely to cooperate,
more likely to collaborate,

00:24:58.579 --> 00:25:00.370
more likely to be open
to playing with kids

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:01.580
who don't look like them.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:06.130
There is something really
peculiar in the human condition

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:07.360
that makes us--

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.220
synchronizing
makes us feel good.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.900
Synchronizing
makes us do a good.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.410
Synchronizing with other
people is a powerful elixir--

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:17.295
more than I ever
would have expected.

00:25:17.295 --> 00:25:19.170
Because there's something
about us that makes

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.890
us want to synchronize
with others.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:24.210
So those are five simple
idiosyncratic questions

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.050
about timing.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:28.390
There are about 100 more of
these really cool things.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.930
So I'm happy to talk to you and
answer any of your questions

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:36.370
about the pattern of the day,
why breaks are important,

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.570
how beginnings affect us,
how midpoints affect us,

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:42.930
how endings affect us, how
groups synchronize in time,

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.910
and how the very way
we think about time--

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.520
including even the
verb tenses we use--

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.700
shapes our behavior.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.140
So what are your questions?

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.848
Yes sir?

00:25:53.848 --> 00:25:57.950
AUDIENCE: How can I optimize my
schedule to the peak, trough,

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.770
recovery thing?

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.480
I heard you on the
Tim Ferriss podcast,

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.340
so I was starting to use this.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.220
And I started noticing how,
yeah, earlier in the day,

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:08.744
I'm better at analysis.

00:26:08.744 --> 00:26:10.160
Then I go through
the trough, then

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.080
I recover in the afternoon.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.170
However, my schedule is
kind of inconsistent.

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.590
Left to my own devices,
I go to bed at 2:00 AM,

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.230
wake up at 10:30.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.080
But sometimes I have early
meetings, so I can't do that.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.950
So how do I--

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:31.070
does the PTR start
when you wake up,

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.680
or is it a regular
time every day?

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.294
And so if I wake up late, I
might wake up in the trough.

00:26:37.294 --> 00:26:38.460
DANIEL PINK: Great question.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.120
I totally understand
your question.

00:26:43.097 --> 00:26:44.680
I just like to throw
things in public.

00:26:47.767 --> 00:26:49.600
It's a great question,
and it's complicated.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.410
Tell me your first name.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:51.130
AUDIENCE: Chris.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.120
DANIEL PINK: Chris, OK.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.720
So one thing that we
have to think about is--

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.780
what we're looking for in terms
of figuring out the right time

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.484
to do work during the day
is what social psychologists

00:27:01.484 --> 00:27:02.650
call the "synchrony effect."

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:05.380
It's sort of a fancy word.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:10.495
What you want to line up
are type, task, and time.

00:27:10.495 --> 00:27:11.870
So type is really
important here.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.520
So type means chronotype.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.389
Chronotype is basically
your propensity.

00:27:15.389 --> 00:27:17.180
Do you wake up early
and go to sleep early?

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.888
Do you wake up late
and go to sleep late?

00:27:22.256 --> 00:27:23.630
On a free day when
you don't have

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:25.546
to be anywhere or do
anything, what time would

00:27:25.546 --> 00:27:26.960
you typically go to sleep?

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.400
Do you say 2:00?

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.910
AUDIENCE: Probably
around 1:00 or 1:30.

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:33.665
But if I have a week of
nothing, by the end of the week,

00:27:33.665 --> 00:27:35.124
I'm going to bed at 2:30.

00:27:35.124 --> 00:27:35.790
DANIEL PINK: OK.

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.049
So let's split the
difference and call it 2:00.

00:27:38.049 --> 00:27:38.840
All right, so 2:00.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.874
And then what time do
you typically wake up?

00:27:41.874 --> 00:27:42.540
AUDIENCE: 10:00.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.030
DANIEL PINK: 10:00.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:43.340
OK.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.715
So what we're
trying to do here--

00:27:44.715 --> 00:27:46.550
there's a very easy
back of the envelope way

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.170
to figure out
someone's chronotype.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.090
So what we're looking for is
the midpoint of your sleep.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.800
So the midpoint of your sleep--
if you go to sleep at 2:00

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.580
and wake up at 10:00, your
midpoint of sleep is 6:00 AM.

00:27:57.408 --> 00:27:59.120
And basically the
way it works is

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.840
that if your midpoint
is before 3:30 AM,

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.420
you're generally a
morning person-- a lark.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:11.880
If your midpoint is after 5:30
AM, you're generally an owl.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.870
So about 15% of us are
larks, 20% of us are owls,

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:16.754
but 2/3 of us are in the middle.

00:28:16.754 --> 00:28:18.170
And so would you
consider yourself

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:19.640
more of an owl than a lark?

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.830
DANIEL PINK: OK.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.906
But you still have to
go to 8:30 meetings.

00:28:23.906 --> 00:28:26.030
So in general, 80% of us
move through the day peak,

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:26.750
trough, recovery.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.180
Owls are more complicated.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.290
Owls are more complicated.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.607
And in many ways,
as you're hinting,

00:28:32.607 --> 00:28:34.940
I think that the corporate
world-- the traditional world

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.470
of work-- is designed to
crush the spirits of owls.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.790
And to my mind what should go
on is that the organization

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.010
should accommodate
the owls rather than

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.170
force the owls to
accommodate the organization.

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:50.270
That said, that
doesn't always happen.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.660
In fact, that rarely happens.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.120
Let's talk about the early
morning meetings here.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.356
What time would
you have a meeting?

00:28:58.356 --> 00:28:59.980
AUDIENCE: The earlier
ones are 9:00 AM?

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.550
DANIEL PINK: 9:00 AM.

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:01.050
All right.

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.220
So how do you feel in
those 9:00 AM meetings?

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.904
AUDIENCE: Usually not good.

00:29:04.904 --> 00:29:05.570
DANIEL PINK: OK.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:07.360
Great, awesome.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.180
Do you feel like you do your
better work later in the day?

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah, typically.

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:14.320
Although now I'm
realizing that also

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:20.480
I do some good work
earlier in the day.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.795
If I get up at 9:00 AM,
I am doing good work

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:24.672
at around 11:30.

00:29:24.672 --> 00:29:25.880
DANIEL PINK: Oh, interesting.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:26.686
OK.

00:29:26.686 --> 00:29:29.120
AUDIENCE: There is a
zone there, and then I do

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:36.809
hit the trough after noon and
then 7:00 PM, 8:00 PM on again.

00:29:36.809 --> 00:29:37.850
DANIEL PINK: Interesting.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:38.420
OK, good.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.960
So one thing here is--

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.130
and I think Chris raises one
of the most important points

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.110
here-- is that what
the research gives

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:48.440
us are general guidelines
for large populations,

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.380
but there's going to be some
human individual variation.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.390
And I think the key is
to actually pay attention

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:55.181
to how you're feeling
and what you're doing

00:29:55.181 --> 00:29:56.630
to observe yourself better.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.454
So you could be, Chris, either--

00:29:58.454 --> 00:30:00.620
it'd be interesting to see
what kind of work you do.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.900
But you could be either
basically peak, trough,

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.242
recovery just starting later,
or you could be actually

00:30:05.242 --> 00:30:06.950
recovery, trough,
peak, which is actually

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:08.690
fairly common among owls.

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.900
What would be happening early
on is that recovery period

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.580
which is good for
certain kinds of work,

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.250
and then the peak period
is later in the day.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:19.280
But leaving that aside
for the moment here,

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.650
let's be very practical
and tactical here.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:24.734
You feel like you really
get going at around 7:00.

00:30:24.734 --> 00:30:26.275
Here's what I would
do for you if you

00:30:26.275 --> 00:30:28.880
have those 9 o'clock meetings
when you're not at your best.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.830
It's clear based on
your facial expression

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:32.538
that you're not at
your best at 9 o'clock

00:30:32.538 --> 00:30:35.420
in the morning, which
is totally cool.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.720
Here's what I recommend you do.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:43.070
The day before you have an
important 9:00 meeting--

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:46.130
say you're working between
7:00 and 10:00 PM--

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.110
here's what I
recommend that you do.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:49.880
Make a checklist
for what you want

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.870
to say at that
meeting, what you want

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:51.960
to accomplish at that
meeting, what you need

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.126
to get done at that meeting.

00:30:53.126 --> 00:30:55.310
Any questions you need to ask--

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.020
make that checklist.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.790
And actually come into the
meeting with that checklist

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:02.570
so you don't have to
draw on your hazy mind

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:04.057
when you're at your worst.

00:31:04.057 --> 00:31:06.390
Figure out what you want to
do when you're at your best,

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:08.330
and then give yourself
those guidelines

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:10.520
to rely on when
you're at your worst.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.244
The other thing that I would
absolutely recommend is--

00:31:13.244 --> 00:31:14.660
and this goes to
the whole chapter

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.690
that I have on breaks-- is
before that 9:00 meeting,

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:19.370
take a walk around the block.

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:22.670
Movement, sunlight, nature--
take a walk around the block.

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.640
The other thing-- someone
here mentioned gratitude,

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.720
and there's a first
cousin of this.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.000
Doing a good deed
for somebody else

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.320
is a pretty significant
mood booster.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.630
So maybe bring somebody a cup
of coffee or help somebody

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:41.130
move something--
that kind of thing.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.242
So go into that 9:00
meeting with your checklist.

00:31:43.242 --> 00:31:45.200
Before you do it, take
a walk around the block.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.670
Maybe do somebody a good deed.

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:48.330
You're going to be
a little bit better.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.270
And the key here that
I want to emphasize,

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.879
not only the
individual variation--

00:31:52.879 --> 00:31:54.920
the fact that science
gives us these broad design

00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:04.396
principles-- but
individual variation

00:32:04.396 --> 00:32:06.020
is going to play a
role in all of this.

00:32:12.225 --> 00:32:14.550
You really have to get better--

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:16.800
what we're talking about
here is not like, oh, my God,

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.180
you're going to be a
superstar in every meeting

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.931
now at 9:00 in the
morning if you do this.

00:32:19.931 --> 00:32:21.263
Here's what we're talking about.

00:32:21.263 --> 00:32:23.380
We're talking about this
in a probabilistic way.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.170
So let's say that you have--

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:30.040
for you going to
a 9:00 AM meeting,

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.490
you have a 23% chance of
getting good work done,

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:34.950
getting good stuff accomplished.

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:36.360
And if you do
these other things,

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:41.178
we can dial that
up to a 28% chance.

00:32:41.178 --> 00:32:43.320
There's still a 72% chance
this meeting is going

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.420
to be a bomb, Chris, right?

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:49.890
But I'll take that
turn from 24%--

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.870
whatever I said-- to
28%, because you're

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:53.864
going to go to a lot
of meetings, right?

00:32:53.864 --> 00:32:55.780
Over and over and over,
that's going to do it.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.820
So what we're
talking about here is

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.712
turning the dial in
our favor a little bit

00:32:58.712 --> 00:33:01.170
using some of these principles
and the individual variation

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:02.430
that we notice in ourselves.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:03.130
Who else has a question?

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:04.505
Because I get to
throw something.

00:33:04.505 --> 00:33:05.640
All right, back there.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.700
How heavy is this?

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.780
Ooh.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.077
That was my slider.

00:33:12.077 --> 00:33:12.660
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.400
So I noticed that,
yeah, I'm much more

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.260
productive in the mornings.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.900
And also doctors
and dentists are all

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.730
more productive in the morning.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:23.010
So traditionally I've always
scheduled my appointments

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:25.440
in the afternoon, that way
I'm most productive at work.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.136
And then I go to visit
them in the afternoon.

00:33:28.136 --> 00:33:29.510
But what you're
showing now would

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:30.960
be you should actually
try to visit them

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.890
in the middle of the day.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.110
But that means that impacts
my productivity, because I'm

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:35.040
working in the afternoon.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.873
So have you kind of
thought about that trade

00:33:36.873 --> 00:33:39.069
off of optimizing
yours versus others?

00:33:39.069 --> 00:33:40.110
DANIEL PINK: Great point.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:46.087
Great point, particularly
on medical appointments.

00:33:46.087 --> 00:33:46.920
So here's the thing.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:50.970
If it's a significant
medical appointment,

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:53.070
I would pay the price
of my own productivity

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.090
and go in the morning.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:56.400
So for my own family, when
there's something important

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.650
going on-- a visit
to a hospital--

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:03.822
my elder daughter at age 20
had her wisdom teeth taken out.

00:34:03.822 --> 00:34:05.280
She had to have
general anesthesia.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.380
No way in hell she's
going in the afternoon

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.370
to that appointment.

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:09.060
I mean that.

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.340
I'm dead serious about that.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:15.124
For things serious, nobody in
my family goes in the afternoon

00:34:15.124 --> 00:34:15.719
now.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:20.400
The numbers are
that overwhelming,

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.109
so I put a heavy weight on that.

00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:25.650
I'll give you an
example of something

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.590
that I do literally
schedule in the afternoon--

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:30.610
a routine dental visit.

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.497
It's going to be fine.

00:34:32.497 --> 00:34:35.781
It's pretty simple
and straightforward.

00:34:35.781 --> 00:34:37.489
I don't have any
serious dental problems.

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:38.960
They're just going to
do a cleaning and X-rays

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:39.850
and whatever.

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:41.810
They can probably do
that reasonably well,

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.900
and it's not worth
getting a tiny little bit

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:49.150
advantage of slightly,
infinitesimally cleaner teeth

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.946
and sacrifice my best
work period of the day.

00:34:51.946 --> 00:34:53.320
So it's that kind
of a trade off.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.670
But for anything significant?

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:55.270
No way.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.780
Go in the morning.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:56.560
I'm dead serious.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.810
Go in the morning.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:01.220
I don't even think
it's a close call.

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:01.900
Yes sir.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.640
Oh, sorry.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.580
AUDIENCE: Similar to that, have
you thought about time zones?

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.917
Because then the trade
off is interesting.

00:35:09.917 --> 00:35:11.750
Let's say you have a
meeting or an interview

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:13.310
with somebody in London.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:16.920
Do you optimize for their time,
or do you optimize for yours?

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.320
DANIEL PINK: It's really hard.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.166
It depends on the meeting
and to some extent

00:35:20.166 --> 00:35:21.040
who's more important.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:27.100
So if you have an
important customer,

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.600
I would take the hit yourself
and optimize for the customer.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.520
Make it the
customer's best time.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.350
If you're talking
about distributed teams

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.399
within Google,
Alphabet, then I think

00:35:36.399 --> 00:35:37.940
it becomes a little
more complicated.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.790
Because remember, let's
take a step back here.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:43.940
Think about our brains.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:49.910
Our brains evolved in a world
where there were not hours

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:52.610
let alone time zones.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:55.340
It is completely
unnatural for our brain

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:59.940
to be talking to someone who is
literally in a different day,

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:00.440
right?

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:06.300
Our brains aren't wired
to do that kind of thing,

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.110
so it's very hard.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:10.190
So if you have these distributed
teams as is very, very common,

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:13.550
I think there are probably two
solutions-- not even solutions.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:14.960
There are two responses to that.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.850
I think the meta
thing is recognizing

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:20.660
we are not built to do that,
so it's going to be very hard.

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:23.490
I think the key thing to do
tactically are the following.

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:27.077
One-- when we think about
that conference call--

00:36:27.077 --> 00:36:29.660
I imagine everybody in this room
has been in a conference call

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.390
where somebody is in Asia,
and somebody is in Europe,

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:36.792
and somebody is here--
multi-continent kinds of calls.

00:36:36.792 --> 00:36:38.750
I think what you have to
do is, before you even

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:41.100
schedule that call,
you have to say,

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.950
what are we trying
to accomplish?

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:47.690
And what, if anything, can
be done asynchronously?

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:49.162
If you think about a call--

00:36:49.162 --> 00:36:50.120
a meeting of any kind--

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.840
it's basically a series of tasks
to be done, questions to ask,

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.680
tasks to be done.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.630
So you have this bucket
of tasks to be done.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.296
You've got to look
inside of that bucket

00:36:58.296 --> 00:37:01.100
and say, do all these things
need to be done synchronously?

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.460
And they usually don't.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.251
And so what you can do
is you can take some

00:37:04.251 --> 00:37:06.570
of the things that don't need
to be done synchronously,

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.220
have them done asynchronously.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:13.190
So let's say something like
you're going to talk over,

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:16.400
I don't know, ideas for a new
product or something like that.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.900
I think that what
you could do is

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:21.900
you could have people generate
those ideas asynchronously

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.860
and then send them around
and then have the discussion

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.460
synchronously.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.043
Because a discussion
about those ideas

00:37:27.043 --> 00:37:30.350
is going to be more
valuable synchronously.

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:32.787
But if you say, OK,
so who has some ideas,

00:37:32.787 --> 00:37:35.120
you're going to have some
people in their absolute worst

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:35.620
time of day.

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.160
So figure out what you
can do asynchronously.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.842
And then also spread the pain--

00:37:39.842 --> 00:37:42.050
except if it's your customer,
then you take the pain.

00:37:45.151 --> 00:37:45.650
Who else?

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:46.150
Yes.

00:37:49.126 --> 00:37:50.500
I have to say,
I'm very impressed

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.875
with the hand-eye coordination
of the people in this room

00:37:52.875 --> 00:37:54.010
today just throughout.

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:56.781
We have not had a
bobble let alone a drop.

00:37:56.781 --> 00:37:58.780
AUDIENCE: If you have bad
hand-eye coordination,

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.210
you just don't ask
questions with this thing.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:02.050
DANIEL PINK: Oh, I
guess that's right.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:02.420
We're self-selecting.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.250
Yeah, well put.

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:05.800
That's a great point.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.140
So we're only hearing
questions from people with very

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:09.910
good hand-eye coordination.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:11.870
AUDIENCE: Level of confidence.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.590
So given the scope of
normal adult day-- which

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:16.540
is on a weekday, we're working.

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.130
We've got maybe family and kids.

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:19.000
We've got dinners.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.069
We've got maybe some
prayer or meditation time--

00:38:23.069 --> 00:38:24.610
what's the best use
of recovery time?

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:27.670
If you could structure
your perfect day,

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:29.349
what tasks or
activities would you

00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:31.390
do during those recovery
periods where we already

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:34.300
know we're not productive
or mentally sharp?

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.029
DANIEL PINK: OK.

00:38:35.029 --> 00:38:36.570
Yeah, that's an
interesting question.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:38.260
So remember, what
we have on mood is

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.455
we have this sort of
peak, trough, recovery.

00:38:40.455 --> 00:38:42.580
Would you consider yourself
more of a morning, more

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.352
of an evening, or in the middle?

00:38:45.352 --> 00:38:46.810
AUDIENCE: Somewhere
in the middle--

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:49.180
aspiring morning, but
honestly more in the middle.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:49.930
DANIEL PINK: Yeah.

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:52.930
So how would you do on midpoint
of sleep on the question that I

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:56.551
asked Chris on a free day--
not a day you have to wake up

00:38:56.551 --> 00:38:58.300
to an alarm clock, not
a day you have to--

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:05.540
AUDIENCE: Right now I'm aiming
for like 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:06.740
DANIEL PINK: But not aiming.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:07.990
What would you do
naturally if you

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.281
didn't have an aim-- you just
let your body do whatever

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:11.170
it wanted to do?

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:12.879
AUDIENCE: Maybe 11:00 to 8:00.

00:39:12.879 --> 00:39:14.170
DANIEL PINK: OK, 11:00 to 8:00.

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:14.906
So you're--

00:39:14.906 --> 00:39:16.280
AUDIENCE: 11:00
to 7:00, I guess.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:16.910
Eight hours.

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:21.250
DANIEL PINK: So your midpoint
would be 3:00, so you're larky.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.762
You're more of a
lark than an owl.

00:39:23.762 --> 00:39:26.377
AUDIENCE: A lefty.

00:39:26.377 --> 00:39:28.085
DANIEL PINK: Oh, you're
also left-handed?

00:39:33.824 --> 00:39:35.500
So here's what I think about it.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.950
So recovery-- this is mood--

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:38.450
peak.

00:39:40.729 --> 00:39:41.770
Did I screw something up?

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:42.420
OK.

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.211
Here's your mood over
the course of a day--

00:39:44.211 --> 00:39:47.122
peak, trough, recovery.

00:39:47.122 --> 00:39:48.830
So let's talk about
that recovery period,

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:50.914
because it's a very
interesting period.

00:39:50.914 --> 00:39:53.330
The key in the peak period--
whether it's at the beginning

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:55.655
of the day, or whether
it begins at 7:00 PM,

00:39:55.655 --> 00:39:58.280
whether it begins at 8:00 in the
morning or 9:00 in the morning

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.340
as it does for me, or whether
it begins at 7:00 PM as it does

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.210
for Chris--

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:04.280
the key aspect of
the peak is this.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.590
That's when we
are most vigilant.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:08.480
Vigilance is the key point here.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.760
Vigilance means we're able
to bat away distractions.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.910
That makes it a good time for
the heads down, locked down,

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:15.070
analytic kinds of work.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:17.570
The recovery period is actually
a really interesting period,

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:18.860
because here's what happens.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:22.670
Our mood goes back up,
but we're less vigilant.

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:27.260
And that ends up being actually
an interesting combination.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.144
Think about brainstorming,
for instance.

00:40:30.144 --> 00:40:32.060
I'm sure you've been in
brainstorming sessions

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.320
where someone says,
that's a bad idea.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.280
That's a bad idea.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.590
They're hyper-vigilant,
hyper-analytical,

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:39.332
and so they're knocking
down anything that's wobbly.

00:40:39.332 --> 00:40:40.790
But for brainstorming,
you actually

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:42.290
want a little bit
of disinhibition.

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:43.970
You don't want super-vigilance.

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:46.520
And so it turns out that
there's certain kinds

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.500
of problem solving--

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.870
certain kinds of non-obvious
problem solving--

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:55.490
that people do better
in that recovery period

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:58.292
which we look at as kind
of a non-optimal period.

00:40:58.292 --> 00:41:00.500
You want your locked down,
important, heads down work

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.270
during your peak, but
there's an advantage

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:03.470
to that recovery period.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:06.050
You have elevated
mood, less vigilance.

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:08.840
You have some disinhibition,
and you're feeling OK.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.330
Brainstorming, iterative work--

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:15.246
I end up doing a lot
of my interviews--

00:41:15.246 --> 00:41:17.870
so when I'm interviewing people
for books and things like that,

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:18.828
because my interviews--

00:41:18.828 --> 00:41:20.480
I'm not an
investigative reporter.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.770
I'm not taking a deposition.

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:24.590
I'm not trying to trap people
in contradictions or anything

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:25.092
like that.

00:41:25.092 --> 00:41:27.300
My interviews are, hey, what
do you think about this?

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.508
What do you think about that?

00:41:28.508 --> 00:41:30.920
Does that make any sense--
much sort of yeastier.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.320
And I find I do those
interviews better.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.060
I find I do my
locked down writing--

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.120
making the words march
in order on the page--

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.300
in the morning and then the
looser stuff later in the day

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.560
during that recovery period.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.924
Yes.

00:41:46.924 --> 00:41:48.340
I don't even know
if we need this.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.080
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if there's

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.810
been any work done
to help, for example,

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:58.210
the judges or the
anesthesiologists

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:02.610
perform better their
drops or act more fairly.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:04.117
Do you just take more breaks?

00:42:04.117 --> 00:42:05.200
What's the solution there?

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.470
DANIEL PINK: That's part of it.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:08.011
It's a really, really
great question.

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:16.070
At some level, there are two
different kinds of breaks.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:18.876
One of them is a
restorative break,

00:42:18.876 --> 00:42:20.750
and that's the kind of
breaks that most of us

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.650
should be taking at work.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:26.550
So we should be going out
in the afternoon to take--

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:29.460
we know a lot about breaks.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.460
Basically, my view is
that the science of breaks

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.540
is where the science of
sleep was 15 years ago.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:37.530
15 years ago here at
Alphabet-- or Google

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:39.290
then-- writ large,
people who pulled

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:40.549
all-nighters were heroes.

00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:42.590
And now we know a lot
about the science of sleep,

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:43.160
and we say, no.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.540
You're not a hero if
you pull an all-nighter.

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.360
You're an idiot.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.250
You're hurting your performance.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.874
You're probably
hurting the performance

00:42:47.874 --> 00:42:49.271
of people you're working with.

00:42:49.271 --> 00:42:51.770
I think the science of breaks
are where the science of sleep

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:53.000
was 15 years ago.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.041
We should be taking more
breaks, and we should be

00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:57.290
taking certain kinds of breaks.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:01.070
So part of it is actually
in some of this more breaks,

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:03.320
and we should be taking these
certain kinds of breaks.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.290
We should be taking
breaks where we're

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:07.980
moving rather than stationary.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.700
We should be taking them
outside rather than inside.

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.500
We know from the research
that social beats solo

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:16.010
in break taking, so take a
break with somebody else.

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.385
And we know the
importance-- this

00:43:17.385 --> 00:43:19.357
is urgent-- of full detachment.

00:43:19.357 --> 00:43:21.440
So when you take a break,
leave your phone behind.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.790
Don't talk about work.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:25.400
So if you were to
start a regimen where

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.750
twice an afternoon--

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:29.390
once an afternoon-- you
took a 10 or 15 minute break

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:32.282
outside, take a walk outside
with someone you like,

00:43:32.282 --> 00:43:34.490
leaving your phone behind
and talking about something

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:36.850
other than work,
I'm convinced it

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:38.210
will be a performance booster.

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:44.710
Now, another kind of break
is a vigilance break.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:48.880
And so what you see in
medicine is the following.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.004
So the stakes are a
little bit higher.

00:43:51.004 --> 00:43:52.670
Stakes are a little
bit higher if you're

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:55.190
talking about life and
death or human liberty.

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:57.290
And there what you do--

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:58.820
and I write about this.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.160
Go to the University of
Michigan Medical Center,

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.400
and they're about to do a
surgery in the afternoon.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:08.450
And before they even begin the
surgery, they take a time out.

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:12.740
And everybody-- the surgeon, the
nurses, the anesthesiologists--

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.150
take a step back.

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:19.480
They take a break,
look at the checklist,

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.002
go over everything again.

00:44:21.002 --> 00:44:22.960
They basically have a
check on their vigilance.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.160
They don't go right in.

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:29.350
So a way to mitigate
a lot of that

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:32.740
is a vigilance break
for those high stakes

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.440
kinds of encounters
where before you begin,

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.580
you take a step back.

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:40.840
You go back and
say, I know I'm not

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.650
at my vigilance best right now.

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:44.233
So what I want to
do is I want to take

00:44:44.233 --> 00:44:47.650
a step back and actually go
through a list and figure out,

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:48.964
am I following the procedures?

00:44:48.964 --> 00:44:50.380
Am I doing everything
I need to do

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.560
to be as vigilant as possible?

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.641
I actually think there's a good
argument for judges doing that.

00:44:56.641 --> 00:44:58.390
Because I don't think
it's simply a case--

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:01.090
I don't want to rely on
a justice system that--

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:02.980
I don't want the justice
system to hinge on

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.170
whether the judge has
a walk in the park.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:09.920
And so I think there's
ways to do that.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:13.740
In fact, there are a lot
of moves to actually--

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.490
for sentencing and
those kinds of things--

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:19.550
to turn it into a sort of
almost algorithmic sentencing.

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:24.650
So there's a script
that we use for that,

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:27.721
but I think that vigilance
breaks for judges

00:45:27.721 --> 00:45:29.050
would be a big deal.

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:31.600
And so you could
say something like,

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.340
I'm about to make
a decision here.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.920
Am I treating this
like a comparable--

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.200
what have I done in
comparable cases?

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.777
What have I done for
comparable kinds of things?

00:45:41.777 --> 00:45:43.360
And they take a step
back and actually

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.985
make sure they're
being vigilant rather

00:45:44.985 --> 00:45:49.030
than just being a hostage
of the diurnal patterns.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:50.727
Do we have one more, two more?

00:45:50.727 --> 00:45:52.810
AUDIENCE: I wonder if we
have any similar problems

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:54.390
with interviewing
here or elsewhere.

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:55.710
DANIEL PINK: Absolutely.

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:58.130
There's absolutely no
question about that.

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:00.850
There's no question
that there's going

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:02.740
to be time of day
bias introduced

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:03.840
in anything like that.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.160
In interviewing-- no question.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.680
In reading college
admissions files--

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:09.880
no question.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:16.510
Remember, axiomatic--
our cognitive abilities

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:18.350
don't say the same
throughout the day.

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:20.510
Our mood doesn't stay the
same throughout the day.

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:22.390
Our decision making
capacities don't stay the same

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:23.290
throughout the day.

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:25.090
So there are going to be--

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:28.160
now, you guys do multiple
interviews with people.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.400
So your candidates will
interview with multiple people.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.450
So you might be able to actually
tease that out of the system

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:36.420
by having enough
variation so that--

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.249
OK, so every candidate's
going to have some afternoon

00:46:39.249 --> 00:46:41.290
interviews, some evening
interviews, some morning

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:41.710
interviews.

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:44.020
And so you might actually be
able to even it out that way.

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.394
There's no question
there's going

00:46:45.394 --> 00:46:47.770
to be bias in any kind
of human encounter based

00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:49.990
on time of day, period.

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:53.260
AUDIENCE: So I actually
had a question about when

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.995
you should do fun things.

00:46:54.995 --> 00:46:55.870
When will you enjoy--

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:56.661
DANIEL PINK: Don't.

00:46:56.661 --> 00:46:58.362
AUDIENCE: --fun things more?

00:46:58.362 --> 00:46:59.320
DANIEL PINK: You won't.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.240
No, give me an example.

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:04.450
AUDIENCE: Well,
like socializing.

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:08.680
Sometimes you feel like you
have a better time with friends

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:12.000
or sometimes you're
more frustrated.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:19.180
What times are good to bond
with friends or strangers more?

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.150
DANIEL PINK: I think
what you see is--

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:24.694
well, I don't want to recommend
bonding with strangers

00:47:24.694 --> 00:47:26.860
in all cases-- just want
to say that for the record.

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:31.910
As a father, I don't-- you know.

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:37.090
So if we look at the pattern
of mood again, what you see

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:42.410
is there's some chicken
and egg effect here.

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:44.770
So remember-- peak,
trough, recovery.

00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:47.110
And in the evenings,
our mood is--

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:55.150
for the 80% of us who have
that more traditional kind

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.870
of pattern--

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.330
our moods in the evenings
are actually pretty good.

00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:02.875
And so it's a little
chicken and egg,

00:48:02.875 --> 00:48:04.240
and it's hard to disentangle.

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.310
Our moods could be good because
we're more likely to socialize,

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:08.530
but it could also be that
we're more likely to socialize

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:09.655
because our moods are good.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.760
I think that's
the time to do it.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.635
But there's some really,
really good research

00:48:15.635 --> 00:48:21.510
out there irrespective
of timing on friendship

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:24.160
and what are the elements
of maintaining friendships?

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:29.830
And I can't think of the name
of the book, but what it shows

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:34.870
is that making and
maintaining friendships

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:38.710
is actually much harder
than we realized.

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:40.540
It requires two things
that we're often

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:41.414
not comfortable with.

00:48:41.414 --> 00:48:43.690
Number one-- it requires a
significant amount of time.

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:48.280
There's no instant-- you
have to put in the time

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.500
if you really want to have
an enduring friendship.

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:54.790
The other thing-- which is a
reason why men often don't have

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:57.730
as many or as rich friendships
as women talking about broad

00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:00.910
populations-- is that the
research on friendship--

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:02.950
you've got to devote
the time to it.

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:08.920
The second thing is the
importance of self-disclosure.

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:12.010
Self-disclosure ends up
being this incredible bonding

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:15.870
agent for friendships.

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:17.874
I mean, I hate
self-disclosure, and that's

00:49:17.874 --> 00:49:18.790
why I have no friends.

00:49:24.076 --> 00:49:25.450
To answer your
question directly,

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:27.040
mood is better in the evening.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.870
That's probably a good time.

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:31.000
And there's a huge
amount of research

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.310
on the importance of
friendships and relationships

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:35.380
to our overall well being.

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.270
The challenge, as I said, is
that it requires devoting time.

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:40.072
It really does.

00:49:40.072 --> 00:49:42.280
And it requires self-disclosure,
and that's something

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.970
that a lot of us,
myself included,

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:45.520
are a little bit leery of.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.740
Let's take one more,
and then we'll wrap up.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:48.730
AUDIENCE: This is going to
sound like a joke question,

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:50.564
but where does coffee
play into all of this?

00:49:50.564 --> 00:49:52.230
DANIEL PINK: That's
not a joke question.

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:53.590
That's a very serious question.

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:56.140
AUDIENCE: Does it change
those energy patterns?

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:58.210
If you have an important
meeting with someone,

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:01.822
how smart is it to say, it
should be a coffee meeting.

00:50:01.822 --> 00:50:04.030
Because then you can ensure
everybody's energy levels

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:05.754
will be spiked.

00:50:05.754 --> 00:50:08.170
DANIEL PINK: There's going to
be some individual variation

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:14.147
on that, but the positive
benefits of caffeine up

00:50:14.147 --> 00:50:14.980
to a certain limit--

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:16.330
I mean, not going crazy--

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:17.800
are very high.

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:23.154
And so what you also have--

00:50:23.154 --> 00:50:24.820
just remember, it
takes a certain amount

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.028
of time for the caffeine to
get into the bloodstream.

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:35.500
If you and I sit down and
begin to have a cup of coffee,

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:40.080
the caffeine's not going to hit
our bloodstream for 25 minutes.

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.190
It depends on how long
our meeting's going to be.

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:44.060
So what it could be is that you
and I have a crappy meeting,

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.934
and then my meeting with
this guy a half hour

00:50:45.934 --> 00:50:47.440
later is awesome thanks to you.

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:57.790
The effects of caffeine,
obviously, are ephemeral.

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:00.970
There are two caffeine
tips that are in the book.

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:02.590
One of them is this.

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:06.310
You're better off not
having caffeine immediately

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:08.160
when you wake up--

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.822
immediately when you wake up.

00:51:09.822 --> 00:51:11.655
When we wake up we begin
producing cortisol.

00:51:11.655 --> 00:51:12.630
It's a stress hormone.

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:15.480
That's how we wake
up in some ways.

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.010
We have this hormone coming.

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:18.360
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:21.440
So we start producing this
stress hormone of cortisol.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.090
Our cortisol levels
rise as we wake up,

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:27.120
and caffeine
actually can inhibit

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.900
the production of cortisol.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.950
And so if you have coffee
when you first wake up,

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:33.810
you're really not gaining much.

00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:36.690
What you're better off doing is
waiting about an hour after you

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:41.340
wake up when your cortisol
levels begin to drop

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:43.030
and then hit it
with the caffeine.

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:44.404
That's something
that I've tried.

00:51:44.404 --> 00:51:46.904
That's something that
I've tried to do.

00:51:46.904 --> 00:51:48.570
There are other people
who I'm convinced

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:53.029
have basically a conditioned
psychological response

00:51:53.029 --> 00:51:54.570
to coffee first
thing in the morning.

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:56.825
That is, you could
probably switch out decaf.

00:51:56.825 --> 00:51:58.950
And what they're responding
to is not the caffeine,

00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:00.914
but they're responding
to the ritual.

00:52:00.914 --> 00:52:01.830
I'm convinced of that.

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:05.190
Now, another good use of
caffeine is the following.

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:06.981
Do you guys have nap pods here?

00:52:06.981 --> 00:52:07.480
OK.

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:10.240
So anybody ever use them?

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:10.740
No.

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:12.560
All right.

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:13.990
So here's how to use it.

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:16.060
Here's how to take
the ideal nap.

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:17.170
Here's what you do.

00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:19.420
The ideal nap it turns
out is very, very short--

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.670
between 10 and 20 minutes long--

00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:23.520
much shorter than I
would have expected.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.780
10 and 20 minutes is
the ideal length nap--

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.499
gets you that restoration
without what's

00:52:27.499 --> 00:52:29.290
called sleep inertia,
which is that groggy,

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:31.870
boggy feeling that you
get when you take a nap.

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:34.270
So the ideal nap-- what I
do in my office is this.

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:39.940
I sit in a chair in my office.

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:42.730
I will put on noise
canceling headphones.

00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:47.230
I'll set my timer on my
phone for 25 minutes,

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:50.210
and I can usually fall asleep
in about 10 or 12 minutes.

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:55.210
And so that gives me
a 14, 15 minute nap,

00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:57.910
which is ideal, because
the alarm goes off

00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:59.150
after 25 minutes.

00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:03.230
But before I turn on the
timer or close my eyes,

00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:06.780
I down a cup of
coffee before the nap.

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:08.400
And so what happens
is the following.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:12.460
I wake up with that
ideal short nap restored,

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:14.455
but it takes 25 minutes
for the caffeine

00:53:14.455 --> 00:53:15.580
to get into my bloodstream.

00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:18.610
So when I'm waking up, I get
hit with that second boost

00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:19.990
of caffeine.

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:21.815
And it's something
called a "nappuccino."

00:53:24.826 --> 00:53:26.200
There are actually
several papers

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:30.340
on this showing its
efficacy believe it or not.

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.050
You had a question
here in the front row?

00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:35.207
AUDIENCE: My question was,
it all seems like the topic--

00:53:35.207 --> 00:53:36.790
I'll reflect back
what you just said--

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:41.020
is the "when" depends
on freshness of mind.

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:45.864
Is there any other major
causal factor of to when?

00:53:45.864 --> 00:53:47.030
DANIEL PINK: Oh, absolutely.

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.360
Yeah.

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:48.485
So that's a great question.

00:53:48.485 --> 00:53:50.752
So some of it is on the
judges-- this is speculation

00:53:50.752 --> 00:53:51.710
in the judges research.

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:54.529
Some of it has to do with-- it
could be with glucose levels.

00:53:54.529 --> 00:53:56.570
Another big factor,
especially in physical stuff,

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:58.280
is body temperature.

00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:02.080
Body temperature has a
surprisingly large role

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.426
in our--

00:54:03.426 --> 00:54:05.300
not surprising-- in our
physical performance.

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:08.060
So this is one
reason why if you're

00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:09.412
deciding whether to exercise--

00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:11.870
what time of day to exercise--
there are virtues of morning

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:13.040
exercise big time.

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.400
It's better for habit formation,
better for weight loss.

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.950
There are virtues for afternoon
and evening exercise, too.

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:21.045
Because around
4:00 to 7:00 or so,

00:54:21.045 --> 00:54:22.670
our body temperature
is at its highest.

00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:26.600
So afternoon exercise-- you're
less likely to get injured.

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:27.980
Fewer injuries then.

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:31.580
Afternoon exercise-- people
find it less effortful,

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:34.400
and so that can aid
in habit formation.

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.070
And actually, our
performance is better, too.

00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:40.490
Hand-eye coordination improves,
so coming here at 6:00

00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:41.540
would be amazing.

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:43.850
Hand-eye coordination improves,
lung function improves,

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:44.526
speed improves.

00:54:44.526 --> 00:54:46.400
So there's actually a
disproportionate number

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:49.040
of records and speed events
that were set between 4:00

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.750
PM and 7:00 PM local time.

00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:55.940
So body temperature really
surprised me as a driver

00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:56.900
behind that.

00:54:56.900 --> 00:55:00.220
Our bodies and brains
are very complex systems,

00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:01.490
so some of it's hormonal.

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:03.840
Some of it is body temperature.

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.930
Some of it is purely cognitive.

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:07.310
Some of it is neurochemical.

00:55:07.310 --> 00:55:12.840
I mean, these are
exquisitely complex systems,

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:16.397
so it's hard to disentangle what
exactly every causal agent is.

00:55:16.397 --> 00:55:18.230
Let's go one more, then
we'll wrap up-- back

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:23.830
in the left field bleachers
or right field bleachers.

00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:25.580
AUDIENCE: We've talked
a lot about time of

00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:27.410
day, but how about time of year?

00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:30.470
One question is, have you
studied optimal time of year

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:33.764
to take a vacation for a
company's maximum productivity?

00:55:33.764 --> 00:55:35.180
I know some people
kind of scatter

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:36.410
out their vacation days.

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:38.210
Some people save
them for holidays.

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:40.109
Based on your research,
I assume if you're

00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:42.650
most productive at the start of
a quarter, start of the year,

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:46.555
then maybe it would be
middle of a quarter.

00:55:46.555 --> 00:55:47.930
DANIEL PINK: Part
of the question

00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:51.080
is just observing
your own behavior

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.659
and seeing what works for you.

00:55:52.659 --> 00:55:54.200
I don't write about
this in the book,

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.850
but did I have looked at
the research on vacations

00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:58.450
for something else.

00:55:58.450 --> 00:56:03.330
The restorative effects of
vacations are significant.

00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:06.720
They're very fleeting.

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:07.290
It's sad.

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:09.820
They really don't
last for that long.

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:13.320
And so there's an argument
for taking more shorter ones

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.240
than some longer ones.

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.672
It's going to depend, OK?

00:56:16.672 --> 00:56:18.130
There's so many
variables in there.

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:19.950
It depends on your
family situation.

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:22.830
It depends on maybe where
you are in your career.

00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:25.050
It depends on all
kinds of things.

00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:27.510
But vacations have
a positive effect

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:31.230
on restoring mood,
focus, clear thinking,

00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:34.420
but the effects are
shockingly short-lived.

00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:37.590
I mean, it's really
sad how short-lived

00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:38.460
those things can be.

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:45.480
As for time of year,
there's something

00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:49.740
to be said for taking a vacation
or taking some kind of break

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:54.540
or something like that
at a midpoint of a year,

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:58.110
because midpoints have this
effect on getting our attention

00:56:58.110 --> 00:56:59.400
and galvanizing us.

00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:09.600
Here the design principles
are less distinct and clear.

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.390
I think you have to experiment
a little bit with yourself.

00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:17.580
But I do think that there's
a solid argument for fewer,

00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:21.270
shorter vacations just because
the effects of the vacation

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:24.459
are so ephemeral.

00:57:24.459 --> 00:57:25.750
Let me just say one more thing.

00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:27.090
So tell me your first name.

00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:27.820
AUDIENCE: David.

00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:28.200
DANIEL PINK: David?

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:29.950
So David's question
is actually a good way

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:31.900
to end in that what
David's talking about

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:33.900
are two things that are
really, really important

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:36.580
in this overall body of work.

00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:41.490
One of them is asking
the right questions

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:45.340
and observing our own behavior,
which I mentioned before.

00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:47.550
The other one is
being intentional.

00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:49.440
And one of the
things that we don't

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.360
do a very good job
of-- especially when it

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:54.570
comes to temporal things--
is being intentional.

00:57:54.570 --> 00:57:56.490
And so if you look at today--

00:57:56.490 --> 00:57:59.190
anybody here have a to-do list?

00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:01.601
That's intentionality
right there.

00:58:01.601 --> 00:58:04.100
You're being very intentional
about what you're going to do.

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.410
We're intentional about
what we're going to do.

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:07.530
We're intentional about
who we're going to do it.

00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:10.452
So we have at Google
rounds of interviews.

00:58:10.452 --> 00:58:12.160
We're intentional
about how we do things.

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:15.702
But when it comes to
when we do things,

00:58:15.702 --> 00:58:16.910
we're not intentional at all.

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:18.610
You see it in meetings.

00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:19.930
How do we schedule meetings?

00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:21.090
We use only one criterion.

00:58:21.090 --> 00:58:24.310
What criterion do we use
in scheduling meetings?

00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:25.195
Availability.

00:58:25.195 --> 00:58:27.070
Are the people available,
the room available?

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:29.140
We don't say, what kind
of work are we doing?

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.860
Are they morning people
doing this thing?

00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:32.380
Are they afternoon
people doing this thing?

00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:33.490
Is it a purely administrative?

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:34.390
We don't think about that.

00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:35.570
It's all about availability.

00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:36.945
We're not intentional
about that.

00:58:36.945 --> 00:58:39.430
So if we observe our own
behavior and are intentional

00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:41.530
and we recognize that we
are temporal creatures

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:43.720
in a temporal world,
I really think

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.550
that it can be a big boost
to your overall well being

00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:50.380
and a big boost to your
productivity and creativity.

00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:50.980
Thank you.

00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:54.030
[APPLAUSE]
