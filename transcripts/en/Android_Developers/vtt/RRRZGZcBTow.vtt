00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:08.129
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ...or evening, wherever you are.

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:09.870
And welcome to Android Developer Office Hours.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.040
This is your chance to come and ask us the
Android Developer relations team.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.019
And we've also guests from the Google TV Developer
Relations team.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.260
Any questions you'd like about developing
Android applications.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.929
We, as usual, won't be covering any product
announcements or speculating on any future

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:28.929
releases.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.579
So, don't waste time your answering--asking
those questions.

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.860
But do ask us as any and all Android Developer
questions.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.800
So, who do we have here?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.800
We have--I'm joined on my left by Rich Hyndman.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.880
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Hi there.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.320
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And Matt Gaunt.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.630
And in the room we have Al Sutton as always.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.630
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Hi guys.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.630
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Hello.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.300
And is that Todd on there on the right?

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.530
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Are we okay?

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.370
Andrew Kelly the one-man moderator machine.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.370
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.460
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Looks like London have dropped
out on us.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.890
&gt;&gt; The London [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Welcome back, guys.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.000
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It goes well for the rest of this.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.140
I was trying to work with chat window.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.820
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: What is that?

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.820
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.260
It is open this time and welcome to Andrew
Kelly again.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.119
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, feedback.

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.860
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Now we have feedback.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.860
Okay.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.939
Ignoring the feedback, it seems to have been
muted now.

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:21.770
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: So, news--well, while we wait for
a few people to join us, what news is there?

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.469
Google Play Services has finally launched.

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:30.310
It's no longer next week as we've been saying
for a little while.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.959
So has anyone had the chance to check that
out yet?

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.069
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Not yet.

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:36.069
Nope.

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:37.069
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Well, yeah.

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.770
I mean I read the blog post.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.759
Does that kind of [INDISTINCT] me down.

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.729
I'm really looking forward to writing my first
play services based application using the

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.999
[INDISTINCT] and being able to log in to the
services...

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:58.929
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Plus one button and of course
that's going to affect the plus one of your

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.530
application in the Play Store and that might
affect your ranking, who knows?

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.359
Let's see plus one button's inside out.

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.969
But there's also like many other things designed
for you.

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:07.969
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.740
We most recently--a hacker phone where lots
of people are trying to access Google Drive,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.380
and it was quite painful trying to get--perhaps
use the web view to get your non-anonymous

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.750
I guess and just to go [INDISTINCT] of two
tokens.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.120
They nab you there really easily with a really
consistent user experience through Google

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.480
Play Services so yeah, I'm looking forward
to seeing some apps integrate those.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.980
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Is the place of--is this library
going to be supported on Google TV as well?

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.040
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I believe it will be.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.660
But that will probably come with the native
Google Play Store, which is coming.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.660
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Next week?

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.660
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Next week.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.660
Yeah, next week.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.970
Everything happens next week.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.970
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Mañana.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.970
Mañana.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:49.970
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Cool.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.530
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Is that a Chris Banes we had just
pop in?

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.530
Hi there, Chris.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.530
&gt;&gt; BANES: Hi guys.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.530
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Welcome.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.530
&gt;&gt; BANES: Oh God, hang on.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.530
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Timing.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.730
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Someone probably telling you you're
in the Hangout.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.860
&gt;&gt; BANES: Oh, yeah, maybe.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: You had a busy day.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.550
[INDISTINCT] so you updated a bunch of your
libraries?

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.550
&gt;&gt; BANES: Yeah.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.190
Just--I took about all of September off, so
I have just been messing around for the whole

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.190
September.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.190
So, yes.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.190
It's [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; TODD: Pretty cool.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.190
&gt;&gt; BANES: Yeah.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.190
So that's fun.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.190
Do some housekeeping.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.190
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Nice.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.190
&gt;&gt; BANES: Pack some stuff.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.190
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Fun.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.190
&gt;&gt; BANES: Yeah, it's because it is.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.190
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Okay.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.260
So we have a question from Andrew.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.200
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: And so--is the chat window ready?

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.250
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:38.890
Does Google Play Services allow posting to
Google+ or is it an API still coming soon?

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.069
Still coming soon.

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.510
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: As far as I'm aware, Google+ allows
you to post something to someone's timeline

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.670
but it's essentially you're posting it to
no one.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.870
It's not public or anything.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.820
And then you have to select the circle like
these and you have to go into Google+ to do

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.409
it, but even though you think that's Google
Play Services that's just Google+.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.300
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: You're talking about the by the
history API.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.300
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.410
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So it's essentially a bit like
having some upload work.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.430
So you can send stuff to somewhere which is
just owned by you.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.609
And then from there, easily share it later
on if you want.

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:19.950
But, I don't think that's all up and running
yet.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.950
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.360
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: No I wanted to check that because
it's definitely mentioned in the Play Services

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.160
documentation but I think it's just coming
soon to get into the stream.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.160
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Okay.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.110
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: So the only sharing is via the
plus one button right now, I think.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.450
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: As far as where the history API
is still developing previews.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.480
So they're still tying that down so it's not
worth using in production apps until the things

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.910
are stabilized a bit I would guess.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.910
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.330
I would guess as well.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.240
They've been in communication with [INDISTINCT]
let's do it, right?

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.130
It's getting rolled out to all devices Froyo
[INDISTINCT] it's mute.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.260
What else has happened this week then?

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.800
We're talking about tablets this week.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.840
This is week is tablet week on--for all the
shows on the Android Developer Network which

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.250
is coming real soon, at developers.google.com/live/android.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:26.480
So Reto and Ian and the guys from America
will be [INDISTINCT] redesigning Google Apps

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.480
and we're...

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.480
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Done.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.669
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: ...specifically making--are prone
to using the word tablet in this show, so

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.020
we can feel included in the Mountain View
Program as well.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.630
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I'm holding a Tablet.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.990
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Tablet.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.710
This one here too.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.910
I bet you wondered what that was.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.700
And hopefully the audio quality is improved
this week.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.030
We've got a brand new microphone.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.240
Previously, our microphone was poor.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.710
If you have issues with the audio quality
just let us know and we'll try and fix it

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.990
but it's this little puppy that we've got
here, I kind of want to show you, but we'll

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.990
leave it out.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:04.030
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So before we dive into moderator
key, does anyone have any questions now or

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.110
anything you want to talk about?

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.110
&gt;&gt; BANES: No.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.110
Put them in.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.110
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Cool.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.110
Moderator it is.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.110
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.199
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And yeah, we should also explain
Sparky is not here.

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:13.199
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Uh-hmm.

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:14.199
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It is a public holiday in Germany.

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.789
It's apparently not tied to Octoberfest, apparently
not.

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:17.789
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: No way.

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:18.789
No.

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:19.789
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: That's right.

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:20.789
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Definitely not.

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:21.789
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: No.

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:22.789
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:24.030
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: The fact that it wasn't [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.150
He's not around so, next week.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.380
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I don't remember what it was tied
to.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.380
I think.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.720
&gt;&gt; BANES: Berlin wall, wasn't it?

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.720
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Was it?

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.290
&gt;&gt; BANES: The wall coming down I think.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.290
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.290
On to the moderator.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.450
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Go for Rich.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.450
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Hello.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.450
&gt;&gt; BUTHCHER: Hi.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:38.680
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Hey, Andre, from Germany.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.410
I hope you're watching even though it's a
public holiday.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.449
I want to use set preferred network type method
to switch between 2G and 3G.

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:48.100
I don't think however--available to public.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.139
I'm guessing this is apparently, however it's
not available to the public.

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:54.180
Is there an alternative to support [INDISTINCT]
network?

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.180
I personally don't think so.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.180
I've looked into this before for the battery
widget.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.710
People have asked how did you switch to 2G.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:03.610
And once we were in an airport, maybe in the
Czech Republic somewhere, where we wanted

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.720
to limit our data, and we were writing an
app to toggle between 2G and 3G to save battery

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.480
life at the time, which probably is the [INDISTINCT]
and we didn't find a way.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.890
We are just sending the user to the network
setting screens [INDISTINCT]

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.680
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Because they don't have a way
of doing it, yeah.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.020
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It's a secure setting, but it's
not...

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.610
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Thank you to everyone, who just

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:18.610
muted us in time.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.039
So thank you Andre, but I think not.

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:22.039
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So yeah.

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:25.930
One of these secure--is it secure setting
or is it just in another?

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.430
I think it's a secure setting.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.430
&gt;&gt; BANES: That's true, yes.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.430
That's right.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.040
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, it's in a model of their
own.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.040
Yeah.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.910
So unless your signature system--so unless
you kind of have access to that [INDISTINCT]

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.780
so unless you're probably getting wrong [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yup.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.780
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Next.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.780
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Uh-huh.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.780
Right.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.370
So this is from Adicha from Fairfax, Virginia.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.370
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Hi.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.370
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Hey.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.970
My app has a feature where users can upload
documents or pictures.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:57.830
When I try accessing attachments and emails
that are not downloaded, the URI object has

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.830
the scheme of content.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.669
Is there a way to convert these URI objects
that have a scheme of file?

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:05.740
You would almost certainly need to go to the
content provider, that that scheme of content

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.000
is pointing to and try and get it from the
content provider.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.670
We have a post on this for getting Picasa
images from the Gallery.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:16.060
So if you do the image chooser and Gallery
comes up.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:21.020
And instead of choosing a photograph that
they've taken on a camera, they choose a photograph

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.020
that was in Picasa...

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.020
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-hmm.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.220
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: ...again, you get the content
URI.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.940
And you need to go to the content result to
get that in.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:32.000
So you won't be able to resolve it to a file
directly but you'll be able to get hold of

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.559
the content through its respective provider.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.559
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:39.250
Basically it's content a provider and get
a file that's script to that kind of image.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.529
You can then pick the stuff up.

00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:42.529
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yup.

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:49.630
So have a look at that and search for retrieving
Picasa images from Gallery as well because

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:57.410
it's definitely a more detailed post with
the details that's good on that and they will

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.990
[INDISTINCT] your eyes.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:05.400
We get that quite at a lot from companies
that have photo editing applications, things

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.400
like that.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.680
They don't expect selected images to come
back as a content URI, expect files.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:16.420
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It's one of those things that
you look for in application as well its ability

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.209
to read all kinds of contents shared to it.

00:09:19.209 --> 00:09:27.170
So when I often find people falling about
all of this, when you try and attach a photo

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:35.140
or upload a photo and it's coming from a Picasa
gallery, rather than, you know, a local image,

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:40.560
and so yeah, it's really, really is a good
practice to be able to handle every single

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.240
content--or every form of URI you get passed
back.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.879
It works on tablets.

00:09:45.879 --> 00:09:48.750
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Anyway, that was--that was--that
was good.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.339
Keep throwing the ball back.

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:56.810
We've got one question up here in the G+,
asking when Google devices will be available

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.010
in Ukraine.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:09.960
And as per the announcement at the start of
the show, we'd probably have a lot more viewers

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.720
if we could talk about that kind of thing,
but we can't.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.720
Oh.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.050
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And there's more chat in the side
bar going about 2G and 3G.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:23.490
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: There's no, yeah, we can't talk
about potential [INDISTINCT] but I don't know

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.899
about it anyway.

00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:26.770
Chris, can [INDISTINCT] okay.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.110
They're just chatting amongst themselves.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.830
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Just generally, like the discussion
is going really--I was basically saying someone

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.210
really wants to be able to control 2G, 3G
settings to save battery.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:39.150
I kind of think that's the domain of like
the user's choice.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:44.080
Like the user can choose that and they can
set that for the settings.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:54.630
I mean, it's one thing if you want to give
it a lesson in saying, you know, if your apps

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.279
related to the battery.

00:10:56.279 --> 00:11:03.960
Maybe you like to be shown battery levels
and have a link out to take you to the page

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.360
where you can change the setting, that's one
thing.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.180
But you probably don't want to be going and
even if you could just changing the setting

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:14.960
under them because that's kind of--well, it's
kind of what your app does but it sounds like

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.730
it might be an unexpected behavior there.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:17.730
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:22.000
If you're battery's running low, would you
like to blah, blah, blah, go to the network

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
settings.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.840
I know a good battery widget that enables
you to do that.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.880
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Ian.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.910
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Battery.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.980
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: The battery widget.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.050
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: The battery widget that needs
a redesign.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.370
Works on tablets, though.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.110
How do I animate on the expanding collapse
event of an ExpandableListView?

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.160
I would look at the API for ExpandableListView
and see if [INDISTINCT] right the animation

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.160
events.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.160
Usually it's on the...

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.690
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I don't know that trick.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.330
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: No, I don't know this trick either.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:45.330
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: No, I don't.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.190
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Do you anyone who used ExpandableListView?

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.310
&gt;&gt; BANES: I have, but I never change the animation.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.310
Let's have a quick look.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.790
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Most of the time the animation
tends to be, although the default animation

00:11:55.790 --> 00:12:03.240
tends to be quite quick and it probably would
annoy users to slow that down any amount because

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:08.670
it's nice once or twice to see a fancy animation.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.200
That's always good.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.310
You make sure you get the data to the user
as quickly as possible.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.930
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: They want something quicker.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:18.930
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yes.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:19.930
Okay.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.899
&gt;&gt; BANES: Yeah, expanding is just in [INDISTINCT]
no scroll, so you can't change it.

00:12:23.899 --> 00:12:25.000
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: All right.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.150
&gt;&gt; BANES: I'm looking at the source code
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So, again--so, your options are...

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.350
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: That's right.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.740
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ...to make--create your own.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.020
I guess you could...

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.020
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:41.260
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ...subparse it and if you want
it to do your own behavior there.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.560
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: That or you could always go...

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.800
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Then you could toy around special
media when you think about it, if that's what

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.440
you really want to do.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.079
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Let's have a look back on the
thread.

00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:58.880
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So, we got a few more new joiners.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.530
Say hello to Paul--and Paul and Richard who've
joined us.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.520
And I also you got Neil.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:09.500
So, yeah, feel free to, you know, ask questions
here or type in the side bar or anything.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.500
&gt;&gt; Hi guys.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.790
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: You were going to send me [INDISTINCT]
for your NFC question.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.080
&gt;&gt; Yes, I've put them up.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.620
I put it and sent it.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.680
I found out your name is Nick Butcher.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:25.340
I've sent one to Al just as--to see--he said
he might have a look at the service and see

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:29.390
if there's a way of getting to the time out
another way.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:34.209
Yeah, I did double check the stock over.

00:13:34.209 --> 00:13:40.230
I think I put a link on this comment here.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:47.810
But anyway, if you want me to send again I
can find you out on G+ and do it out there.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:48.810
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:49.810
That'd be better.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.520
&gt;&gt; The main thing is, I'm just wondering if
anyone's got any ideas, alternatives to build

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.709
so we can demo this.

00:13:55.709 --> 00:14:02.459
And where we might be able to find the source,
a quick look in the source around all the

00:14:02.459 --> 00:14:03.459
NFC stuff.

00:14:03.459 --> 00:14:07.649
But I don't think the constants are in the
Java.

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:13.180
So, I wonder if there's a resource for [INDISTINCT]
relating from, any ideas?

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.839
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: There's a class--let me just dig
it out the tag class in android NFC has a

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:22.320
get tag--get tech list method and you can
get a list of technologies that is supported

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.970
by the RFC reader from that and parse that
to the get method.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:32.670
To actually get an instance of the NFC class
for that particular type of tag.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.670
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:44.550
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: You can then use some manipulation
methods on that tag instance so you set timeout

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.480
on that to alter the timeout for that specific
type of technology tag.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.480
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.480
Just to explain.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.790
That works in Gingerbread because you can
set it because you get access--the programs

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:59.850
launch far enough for the code to be run.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:04.650
In the cases of Ice Cream Sandwich and later,
the sound goes on the file like it doesn't

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.260
even reach the breakpoints, or the--or the
code in that stage.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.980
So, I wonder, does it have to change the default
timeout so that it gets--it allows you to

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.930
go farther, because in some cases I believe
it's 0.3 of a second.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.190
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: The--I'm just looking at it now.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:20.710
In the android.nfc.tech package there's an
ISO-DEP class which has the get method which

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.319
can get you an instance of that tag class
without actually using the RF radio.

00:15:24.319 --> 00:15:25.319
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:15:25.319 --> 00:15:28.249
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Let me just pop up a link to it
in the chat side bar.

00:15:28.249 --> 00:15:29.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would be great.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:35.230
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: In that you can manipulate the
set timeout on that--the tag that's returned

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.279
from that method.

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:42.470
From looking into the code, there is a lot
of source code in the framework banks, but

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:50.990
that's also some in packages apps NFC and
there's a lot of the management code in there.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.990
&gt;&gt; Uh-hmm.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:57.399
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: From looking at that unless you
close on that tag object you returned by the

00:15:57.399 --> 00:15:58.399
get method in...

00:15:58.399 --> 00:15:59.399
&gt;&gt; Uh-hmm.

00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:00.769
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: ...the ISO-DEP class, the timeout
should stay all the time you're reading tags

00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:01.769
of that class.

00:16:01.769 --> 00:16:02.769
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:16:02.769 --> 00:16:04.889
I believe the closing would reset the timeout.

00:16:04.889 --> 00:16:09.511
And I did one quick test of static tag that
I had set the timeout longer to see if that

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:10.511
worked.

00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:12.410
So I just gave it an hour.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.860
Just a long shot.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.750
It didn't seem to work at that moment but
I'm willing to try again.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.149
I'll look just a bit deeper into it.

00:16:20.149 --> 00:16:21.149
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Okay.

00:16:21.149 --> 00:16:26.779
I'll put the links to the methods into the
comment section of this Hangout post.

00:16:26.779 --> 00:16:27.779
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:30.610
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: You could grab them from there.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.610
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.490
Thank you very much.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:34.490
Cheers.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:35.490
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:36.490
Thanks Al.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:37.490
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: No worries.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:43.059
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: The next moderator question--oh,
Andrew Kelly is looking to chat first.

00:16:43.059 --> 00:16:48.250
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Andrew asks, what is the star
attribute I need to change to alter the text

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.079
color for options menu--option menu items?

00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:53.640
I've managed to change the title color but
couldn't see the option menu style.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.920
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: This is an action bar--yes.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.959
Or you want to have a look at a post written
by...

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:01.970
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, I never remember these offhand
but there's a handy post.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.549
Hopefully if you've seen the post over on
the Android Developers blog, if you asked,

00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:05.549
yes, he says.

00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:07.939
And the--have you looked in the attached--where
the links code project.

00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:12.620
So, if you look in the styles file and the
code project there, it should give you the

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.959
attribute you need to override.

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:16.360
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: That's it.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.769
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I forgot.

00:17:17.769 --> 00:17:22.449
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I've been [INDISTINCT] everything
else but not actual text.

00:17:22.449 --> 00:17:23.780
You want text color?

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.600
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, right, so change it, okay.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.240
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: So, it's...

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:38.700
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I forget it all the time, I cover
it up.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.529
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Did you try Android column text
color?

00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:48.740
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: The way I--the way I--I've worked
out which ones to change, I always end up

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.420
just looking in the original theme stars.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:57.700
If you look in your android home/platforms/whatever
the platform/data value there's the stars

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:02.700
and themes xml, just--they're not particularly
long.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:07.240
And they're, you know, if you're not too scared
about xml, they're fairly readable.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:14.880
So, you go in there and you kind of search
for like action bar, options and stuff like

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.880
that.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:22.530
And you kind of walk it back up towards and
find out which star it inherits from and you

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:28.930
find kind of the value you can override, that's
the way I always end up doing it.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.730
So, sorry I don't know offhand.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:35.230
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It may not be separately styled
to the actual text or the action bar.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:36.960
Interesting to see if there is...

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.640
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It's probably [INDISTINCT] a default
one, yeah.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:46.200
It might just be something like color or text
color they, might be willing to try again.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.200
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Uh-hmm.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.910
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And there we go.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.059
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Cheers Andrew.

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:54.890
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Do you not have an iPhone friend
Andrew, or you're just shy.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:55.890
Okay silence.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.750
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Sammy from Pittsburg has quite
a far reaching question.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:04.760
Which we could do if you're kind of online,
we could talk about.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.559
Because the question is, I have an app idea.

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:12.710
How do I create it perhaps from beginning
to finish?

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:13.710
All right.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:14.710
So, I guess are you a coder?

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:18.360
Are you looking for people to contract work
for you or you're--I mean, are you a designer?

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.020
I don't really know which parts of the role
you could put in yourself but--or you just

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.120
want to make money for the idea?

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:30.790
You can just license it to someone without
actually doing anything.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:31.790
It's quite a wide reaching question.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:32.790
There's so much to say...

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:33.790
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:39.429
So, if you are just, you know, if you know
a bit of writing but never done any Android

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:42.250
before, so a great place to start is on Android
training.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.920
So, if you go to developer--to android.com/training.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.570
There's some basic guides there which talk
you through how to create your first Android

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:50.570
app.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:54.130
So it kind of--it seems you have a certain
level of knowledge of Java and XNOR and so

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.130
on.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.960
So, if you have those then that's a good place
to start.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.350
Beyond that I guess we kind of need a bit
more of context.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:04.550
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: If you just got an idea, I would
start with a piece of paper and a pencil and

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:09.351
start sketching out and start thinking about
how you want the actual application to work

00:20:09.351 --> 00:20:10.500
and flow and get excited about the concepts
behind it.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.300
And then you could go to a user group in whatever
technology you want it to be delivered in

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.830
and have a talk about just some people at
the user group about it.

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:19.840
I'm sure there's plenty in Pittsburgh.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.999
Yeah, there's just a lot of approaches you
can take.

00:20:21.999 --> 00:20:24.179
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And step three, profit.

00:20:24.179 --> 00:20:25.490
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Step three.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:26.490
Profit.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:27.490
Use tablets.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.970
Do an extra large layout.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:29.970
Okay.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:30.970
For Rich.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:32.899
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Go for it, read it.

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:38.570
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Go for Rich, because it's one
of those questions we can't answer.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:42.650
Will all developers on Google Play have reply
to reviews?

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:47.539
I'm sorry we can't talk about things that
aren't already answered.

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:53.530
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Has anyone in the room been using--have
access to a bunch of reviews?

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.130
Been in their beta?

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.130
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.130
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.130
Okay.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:59.130
Yes, if you have...

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:03.850
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I have to replied to [INDISTINCT]
calling some battery widget, of course I have.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:05.010
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And it's been good?

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.860
Have you seen an uplift in your rating?

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:07.860
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.480
No, not particularly, but my latest version
I've got this really weird bug on a Sony Xperia

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.520
phone, not Ice Cream Sandwich, with a widget.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.110
And I can't replicate it.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:21.380
So hey, I've got access to as much [INDISTINCT]
I think they been...

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.630
&gt;&gt; BANES: Phone?

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.130
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Which is fun.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.720
Some Soniacs and P19i something and then also
on their Walkman device.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.720
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: The P19i.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.720
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I don't know.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.809
I didn't even know thing existed until someone
reported a bug on it.

00:21:32.809 --> 00:21:38.520
I believe it's a called a VGA, and in landscape
mode the widgets are a bit freaky.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.870
Who knows, we'll blacklist it.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.360
Is that a good solution?

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:47.090
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: It's the last [INDISTINCT] one.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:51.370
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Thank you very much for your feedback,
you can no longer use the application.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.240
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: That's a good reply.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.240
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.700
So someone just posted, so Nick your remarks
in Designer in Action on Tuesdays were very

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.340
impressive especially the [INDISTINCT] ones.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.669
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Is this the TripAdviser?

00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:02.669
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: You're not a designer.

00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:03.669
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: First thing.

00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:04.730
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: What was your secret?

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:07.110
Have you read any books or resources?

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:13.440
How did you get up to the speed with interaction
design in the designs that you've done?

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.080
How did you get into this?

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:20.770
Because certainly a year ago you weren't designing
stuff as part of the team and now you're going

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:25.460
to go to designer in our team?

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:29.480
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, how did that happen?

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:34.470
I think you just fake it until you make it
right?

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.600
You just--no, I don't know.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:42.000
I've always be really interested in the UI
design and I think I'm pretty--I've got quite

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.850
an attention to detail, I've got quite a good
focus on detail, like I always notice really

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:54.110
small things that are wrong then I think that
probably helps when you're designing stuff.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:59.970
Because I keep on going over and, you know,
you see how long I spend all these months,

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.340
go over and over and over and again until
they get better.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.110
I don't think there's any secret I think I
read a lot on the subject.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:12.390
So blogs like UI, blog on an Android UI design,
Smashing Magazine, you know, I'm a big fan

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:13.390
of, I read a lot of articles on that.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.640
And practice, I think the more you do it,
the better and easier it gets.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.230
So simple things like learning your tool,
like Photoshop has been quite a--I've looked--I

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:21.710
certainly have used it much, I've used GIMP
a fair then, when I used to create apps, I

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:27.260
used to create all my own assets in the GIMP
and got fairly proficient at that but then

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.830
relearning Photoshop because that seems to
be what everyone around here uses so you can

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.870
share PSDs and so on like that, it's really
handy.

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:39.750
That's taken me a while, but I think the biggest
thing that's helped me is working with another

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:44.160
designer so there's a UI Team here in London
to do some of the design for the Google Apps

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.530
such as Google in-house IT here in London
and so that team's been awesome, they've been

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:51.510
really accommodating to me so I've gone in
there and put them--I've shown them sketches

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:55.970
and talked them through and showed them mocks
and got feedback and going round and round

00:23:55.970 --> 00:24:00.340
like that kind of like feedback loop which
has been super helpful to me.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.220
So no secret, just a lot of work, really,
so yes.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:07.200
I wouldn't call myself a designer yet but
I'm trying to like walk like one, I guess.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:13.690
&gt;&gt; BANES: Seventy-four of those designs to
try not to divulge any stuff, or these models.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.950
What's sort of the end goal of that consign?

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:20.190
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: The goal is just to kind of like
increase awareness of like--you know, it's

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:25.940
one thing to talk about what Android design
is, but we think it is better to show it,

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.529
it's like half I think...

00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:28.529
&gt;&gt; BANES: Yes.

00:24:28.529 --> 00:24:30.630
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ...the before and after format
is really useful.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:36.170
It's not so much the goal to have the company
take these mocks and implement them or you

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.290
know incorporate some of their elements.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.640
I mean that's amazing but that's a bonus.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:47.650
It's more to have like a practical insight
into what everyone and their apps can do and

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:50.120
like, you know, how to look at a certain type
of problem and how it might be solved in a

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.120
more Android kind of way.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:56.560
And so if the TripAdvisor won, my colleague
Adam in New York actually works at TripAdvisor.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.690
He said he's going to send them to them so
we're welcome.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:05.250
In fact, Glimmer, the week before that, where
we did the [INDISTINCT] I was in touch with

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:07.940
him and he's going to fix it, and the PSD.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.489
So he said he going to, you know, use it.

00:25:12.489 --> 00:25:19.480
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, well in Developers Strike
Back we often say they're going to take a

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.429
lot of the team back on board, improve it
design wise and best practices wise.

00:25:23.429 --> 00:25:24.429
Thanks a lot.

00:25:24.429 --> 00:25:28.130
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: You're going to take the cameras
here and [INDISTINCT] and incorporate some

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.130
data.

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:30.130
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: That's [INDISTINCT] service.

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:31.820
If you want another, I chose now.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:35.730
Get close enough to the moderator, get your
app redesigned.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.360
I don't know, they're complaining from here
that they don't like the design.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.360
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Basically granting immunity.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.380
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yes, as long as you implement
it well.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.340
I included someone's design badly once and
they just [INDISTINCT]

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.340
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: True story.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.340
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: True story.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.820
Andrew Kelly again on the--actually about
theming.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.419
You don't suggest retheming the action drop
down style from the hollow--the hollow light.

00:25:50.419 --> 00:25:53.290
The overall hollow light and then you extend
the hollow light and then override the drop

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:57.320
down style and then change the text color,
things like that.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:04.480
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: The only thing to look at is if
you're trying to change the text color, generally

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.640
the text color is generally determined on
whether you're inheriting from a dark or light

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.640
style.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.810
So obviously the dark style has light text
and light style has dark text.

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:21.880
And so if you're trying to change the colors
of the action bar, make sure you're inheriting

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.360
them from the correct parent.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:30.340
So you might even if you have a light theme,
you might want inherit from the theme that

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:35.360
[INDISTINCT] the light the dark action bar
and if you have like a darker accent colors

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:41.030
in your action bar and that will give you
the right text colors so I'm just wondering

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:45.350
of there's a bigger [INDISTINCT] where you're
not inheriting for the right light parents

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:46.350
style.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.930
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Because [INDISTINCT] does say
it's got android.textparents.hollow.widget.popup

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:49.360
but now you got small.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:54.200
&gt;&gt; BANES: I think that's what the actual style
is in this light platform, I don't know where

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.590
it--where that's found from but I'm just finding
the source.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:01.510
So just backtrack and try to find that webapps
in the theme, I don't know.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:02.790
It's not here.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.210
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT] one of those.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.159
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yes, Andrew so which is the parent
theme you're inheriting from?

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:11.490
So you're inheriting from hollow light so
you're therefore getting the dark text style

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.830
by default and what's the color--and what's
the color of the--well, I guess the options

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.330
may that you're trying to make the text show
against...

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.330
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Come on.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:20.330
Use the hex code.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:21.330
The custom graphic background.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:22.830
&gt;&gt; BANES: Should you install a caching bar
then?

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.669
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: That's what I was going to say,
yeah, you inherit from theme.hollow or theme.[INDISTINCT].light.dark

00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:28.460
action bar will give you light text.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.740
&gt;&gt; BANES: It could be easier.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:30.740
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:37.480
Any more questions from inside the chat, inside
the--Hangout before I jump to the next one.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:43.050
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I know there's a few new joiners
as well, who we got here, we got Richard Thompson

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:47.600
who's trying to come back and Zavi I think
is--with the fun little [INDISTINCT] I'd say

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.380
hello to you guys, feel free to shout out
or type away if you got questions like--or

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.240
you can just chill out and enjoy the show.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:06.970
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Might be worth putting in a plug
for the new build system, that the guys over

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.390
at Mountain View have made available.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.493
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yes, you guys haven't talked.

00:28:10.493 --> 00:28:11.493
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT] has anyone's else
listened to you?

00:28:11.493 --> 00:28:13.380
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I've started looking at it but
it's based on--it's a Gradle, so I've got

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.970
everything set up to you.

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:16.770
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Not linked to an IDE?

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.900
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Nope, it's very [INDISTINCT] at
the moment.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.660
Haven't got LiMP, haven't got PROGIS stuff
like that, but it...

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.660
&gt;&gt; BANES: Indica.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.660
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Hasn't got Indica, yeah.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:32.270
So it's basically the start of it but it's
case of the earlier you get in the more likely

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:40.130
you are to get the features you want.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:50.330
So were--if anyone is really interested in
the build system who had been hitting their

00:28:50.330 --> 00:29:02.740
head have a look the ADT/DEV Google group
and there'll be details on how to get more

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:03.740
information.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:11.059
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay, Richard Thompson just put
in a chat window, how do you find designers?

00:29:11.059 --> 00:29:21.000
There isn't an easily accessible repository
of designers that I know about.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Dribbble.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: You do?

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.770
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah, I was going to say Dribbble.

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:30.210
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Dribbble with three Bs that is,
is actually a social network for designers

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:33.279
and they--it has a quite big focus on jobs.

00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:34.299
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, yeah.

00:29:34.299 --> 00:29:36.669
[INDISTINCT] plenty of great design companies
around.

00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:42.440
I bump into them at various meetups when I'm
in London or down in Brighton things like

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.440
that.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:53.120
So go to meetups talk to people, have them
look at apps that you like the way they're

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.120
designed.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.170
See if you can find out who designed them.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:02.650
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Have a look at the package name
of the Android application that you like the

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.510
look of and look up who really made it.

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:12.160
And Tim Boggs who I think asked the wider
range of questions how do you make an app?

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:19.360
This time they did a comment to G+, he says
he needs to write a simple app it just does

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:24.320
some math, but it needs to have a good UI,
as he's been watching Design Hangouts, good

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.320
man.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:31.700
So the question is, any tips on who to get
quotes, where to get it written, he knows

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:36.080
the simple codes but it was taking too long
to learn Java, say something [INDISTINCT]

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:42.640
all right so how do you--well, it sounds like
you--if you're willing to pay for the application

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:51.240
I think it's going to be a commercial affair
then you might want to approach something

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.710
like--it's depends, well you're basically
here in London there's a awesome user group

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:57.700
called the London Android user group or Londroid
for short.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:02.550
So that's a great pool of talented developers
and they have a linked in group which they

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:06.350
like to use for the job approaches.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:10.409
And so you can approach those guys asks for
some quotes, ask for--see who's around and

00:31:10.409 --> 00:31:11.650
what they can offer.

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:17.890
I don't know if it's not a paid app, if you're
trying to like just do this thing for fun

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:21.370
or for charity, or something like that then
that might not work.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:24.800
Anyway, oh, yes, I just had--the URL for Londroid
is meetup.com/android.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.929
I see they've gotten there early.

00:31:26.929 --> 00:31:28.059
Any other ideas?

00:31:28.059 --> 00:31:29.059
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: No.

00:31:29.059 --> 00:31:31.700
I think that makes a lot sense.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:36.240
So you're going to get a mix of people who
work for agencies, freelancers.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.309
Yeah, I think Londroid is a good place.

00:31:39.309 --> 00:31:48.549
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And if it's not invented so doesn't
that get donated to Apache or something like

00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:49.549
that?

00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:50.549
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Actually.

00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:53.799
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Isn't that where stuff like that
used to.

00:31:53.799 --> 00:31:54.799
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:31:54.799 --> 00:31:55.799
The...

00:31:55.799 --> 00:31:56.799
&gt;&gt; BANES: The Investools.

00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:57.799
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Say again?

00:31:57.799 --> 00:32:00.200
&gt;&gt; BANES: The Investools it wasn't...

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.779
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: You might say, you got it yeah.

00:32:02.779 --> 00:32:04.200
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BANES: [INDISTINCT]

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:10.110
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yes there--yeah, there was a project
called--yeah App inventor which kind of got

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:11.110
donated.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:16.770
I don't know if it's still useable, which
was kind of that drag and drop type interface

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:19.970
of building applications so if had to pursue
that.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:26.049
To try and get operators like that up and
running show people around to try and generate

00:32:26.049 --> 00:32:27.049
some interest.

00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:28.049
And--yeah that's something actually.

00:32:28.049 --> 00:32:33.450
If often if you try to get people on-board,
often quite helpful to have a--an interactive

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:38.169
kind of like prototype so you can even do
that with something like App inventor or if

00:32:38.169 --> 00:32:43.330
you use something like a Balsamic which is
a mocking tool you can design your mocks in

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:47.590
that and there's often--there's a ton of applications,
if you understand those mocks and how to stick

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:51.740
them together or you can have an interactive
PDF where you have like certain areas of [INDISTINCT]

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:56.080
where you click through and it actually launches
another PDF or another screen in the PDF so

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.389
you can--you can do things like that.

00:32:58.389 --> 00:33:03.009
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I thought we'd have some good
talks about mocking as well, don't we?

00:33:03.009 --> 00:33:04.009
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:33:04.009 --> 00:33:05.009
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:33:05.009 --> 00:33:06.009
From Trovia in Italy.

00:33:06.009 --> 00:33:07.009
This is a good question.

00:33:07.009 --> 00:33:08.510
I'd like to have a good answer to this question.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:09.510
Maybe I'll work on it.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:13.240
To obtain a heterogeneous review, like the
one in Google+, or Pinterest or IM, which

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:19.730
was reviewed last week on the Android show,
should we extend ABS just until you adapt,

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:22.490
do you agree, do you--are there any tutorials
available?

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:26.799
I've been really impressed with some of the
extraneous grid views we've been seen coming

00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:30.850
out recently and I've often looked at them,
and wondered quite how they did it, how they're

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:35.000
doing their layouts of all the different grid
items and some are just really good.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
So...

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So that's not an answer.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.309
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: No I said--I was...

00:33:38.309 --> 00:33:41.350
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I was waiting for--I was waiting
for that, so you...

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:46.650
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Not for that--to all my reviews
have been all very neat and tidy and aligned

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:50.750
and I haven't done anything which--as yet,
looked as good as any of the grid we see right

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:51.750
here.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:52.750
I don't know.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:53.750
&gt;&gt; BANES: They must be custom.

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:54.750
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I think they're just going to
be custom as well, yeah.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:55.750
Loads of custom items.

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:56.750
&gt;&gt; BANES: It's not too difficult to do it.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.080
You just need to know how layout and sizing
works.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.700
Yes, so it's not too bad to do.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:06.620
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, right you still want it
base on adapt--on an adaptive view if possible.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.720
And you want to have asynchronous loading
into the--that thing obviously once you've

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:14.310
got a layout that looks good you still going
to want it to react very smoothly and there's

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:19.709
a lot of that code that we built for you already
for things like previous industries that you

00:34:19.709 --> 00:34:20.709
should review--renew sorry.

00:34:20.709 --> 00:34:21.709
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yes.

00:34:21.709 --> 00:34:24.960
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: So whether you can abuse a grid
view and force it into being extraneous, I

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.960
don't we can.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.529
There'd have to be many of these grid reviews,
it would be horrible.

00:34:28.529 --> 00:34:29.529
I think...

00:34:29.529 --> 00:34:30.740
&gt;&gt; BANES: You choose the column size, don't
you?

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:36.559
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, but that--I think column
size is the next row down as well.

00:34:36.559 --> 00:34:39.079
You can't do it on a column or a row basis,
right?

00:34:39.079 --> 00:34:43.569
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I wonder if some of these are
actually individual--this just list view and

00:34:43.569 --> 00:34:47.889
each get some types of list item, it's just
subdivided...

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:52.190
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I think there will be [INDISTINCT]
of this view, because everything is at least

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.029
the same height on a row basis.

00:34:54.029 --> 00:34:59.549
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Plus the stuff in the list view
were you can say I've got views of multiple

00:34:59.549 --> 00:35:03.499
types and then when you recycle it or try
and recycle the view...

00:35:03.499 --> 00:35:04.499
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Uh-hmm.

00:35:04.499 --> 00:35:05.499
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-hmm.

00:35:05.499 --> 00:35:06.499
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: ...same types and then it's the
fonts.

00:35:06.499 --> 00:35:07.499
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, depending on which way you
go...

00:35:07.499 --> 00:35:08.499
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:35:08.499 --> 00:35:11.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: ...I would say if you can squeeze
it into a list view and just a custom list

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:12.170
items inside a list view.

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:13.329
It'll be the simplest way...

00:35:13.329 --> 00:35:14.329
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Uh-hmm.

00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:16.660
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: ...and you will have a lot of
control over it and you get all the benefits

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.059
of...
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So no one has solved this problem

00:35:19.059 --> 00:35:20.059
yet.

00:35:20.059 --> 00:35:23.419
It's an open source heterogeneous list this
view, grid view.

00:35:23.419 --> 00:35:26.309
&gt;&gt; Sutton: I can hear Chris cross typing as
we speak.

00:35:26.309 --> 00:35:27.499
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It's kind of reflecting in his
glasses.

00:35:27.499 --> 00:35:31.839
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, it sounds like a problem
[INDISTINCT] work together at all.

00:35:31.839 --> 00:35:35.150
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, I think we should just [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Huh?

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:38.079
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: We could do a grid and list view
[INDISTINCT] best one.

00:35:38.079 --> 00:35:40.540
So it wouldn't be totally heterogeneous, you'd
still get rows lines and a [INDISTINCT]

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:48.959
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, if you do, you can go down
the rout of writing your own custom widget

00:35:48.959 --> 00:35:49.959
as well.

00:35:49.959 --> 00:35:54.829
There was a great talk from Devoxx two years
ago I think from Monkey and [INDISTINCT] they

00:35:54.829 --> 00:36:00.680
go over the basics of what Chris is talking
about the layout parses, measuring parses,

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:05.150
it's really, really critical to understand
those ones and especially understand which

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:09.359
one happen often so, you need to be super
efficient and not creating any garbage.

00:36:09.359 --> 00:36:14.460
So I would advise you to seek that out.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:22.609
If you go to parleys.com, is that where all
the Devoxx talk, or just Google Devoxx [INDISTINCT]

00:36:22.609 --> 00:36:26.449
creating custom widgets, it will probably
get you there.

00:36:26.449 --> 00:36:30.569
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I'm going to have to go blog and
maybe draft something.

00:36:30.569 --> 00:36:33.489
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, not for now [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: You won't without our builder.

00:36:33.489 --> 00:36:34.769
It suits--did seem like [INDISTINCT] should
be.

00:36:34.769 --> 00:36:36.160
Anyone else got anything in the chat?

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.779
Or sorry inside the Hangout before we jump
to something else.

00:36:38.779 --> 00:36:41.250
&gt;&gt; Hi guys, can I ask another question please?

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:42.250
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Sure.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:46.369
&gt;&gt; Last week Nick you said that there was
a--I just missed the talk by someone at Google,

00:36:46.369 --> 00:36:51.079
an NFC wiz guy, is there someone I can get
in touch with or who it was you were referring

00:36:51.079 --> 00:36:52.259
to at thins time last week.

00:36:52.259 --> 00:36:56.490
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: You're saying you missed the talk,
I just--I think I want to say send me the

00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:02.930
link to your question and I'll forward it
onto some of the NFC gurus here, see if they...

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:03.930
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:09.309
I'll put it on--I'll our it on your--I found
you on Google+, I'll put it on there.

00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:14.369
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: That's good
&gt;&gt; And because I'm doing a lot of research

00:37:14.369 --> 00:37:21.420
in this area at the moment, so it would be
handy to kind of follow up a few more things

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.420
in more detail.

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:23.420
Thank you very much guys.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.559
Loving the show today.

00:37:24.559 --> 00:37:25.920
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Oh, good.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:26.920
Oh...

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.920
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: You're welcome.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.019
Thanks for asking good questions.

00:37:30.019 --> 00:37:35.489
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Have you seen the latest question
we got in the ++?

00:37:35.489 --> 00:37:37.769
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No, I haven't really.

00:37:37.769 --> 00:37:41.329
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Will you just have a look at the
++.

00:37:41.329 --> 00:37:42.579
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, from...

00:37:42.579 --> 00:37:43.839
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It's from...

00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:44.839
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ...Mayhem.

00:37:44.839 --> 00:37:48.430
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Our good friend of Michael Mahemoff
ex-Googler, Zoogler.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:53.450
Do you have any [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Hi guys, design question for you.

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:59.400
What do you think about two drop down lists
on the option bar, both forces that will work

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.400
together.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.880
Imagine if you had a second voter of the read
status.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:11.960
So I'm guessing this is related to Michael's
Player FM, is it?

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.479
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:38:13.479 --> 00:38:16.519
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: They're podcasting that...

00:38:16.519 --> 00:38:17.749
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Uh-hmm.

00:38:17.749 --> 00:38:19.520
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ...at a podcasting website.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:25.220
What about if you're making a--yes I can think
of situations in fact I think Gallery--initially

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:31.259
when Gallery came out on Honeycomb, it had
two drop downs that you can spin between photos

00:38:31.259 --> 00:38:34.250
and videos and then sort between something
else.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:35.749
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Tell them something...

00:38:35.749 --> 00:38:38.819
&gt;&gt; BANES: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, but I think they removed

00:38:38.819 --> 00:38:39.819
it.

00:38:39.819 --> 00:38:43.240
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I can't think of any--there are
a few attempts on the filters at the top.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.699
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I'm just trying to think about
this.

00:38:46.699 --> 00:38:58.529
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I'm trying to think of one that
I can point to you right now that might--you

00:38:58.529 --> 00:38:59.529
could quite use.

00:38:59.529 --> 00:39:03.380
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, [INDISTINCT] fell free to
send us a mock if you--if you got any sketches

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.920
of what it's going to look like.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:12.910
I'd probably try and avoid it, like it sounds
quite--it's quite hard to understand at a

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:13.910
glance perhaps.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:16.719
It depends like who invented it.

00:39:16.719 --> 00:39:23.450
Like how--if the two sets are like not overlapping
then it might be simpler, whereas if you know,

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:30.259
if you had to change one first and it alters
what's in the second list for example then,

00:39:30.259 --> 00:39:35.079
it's going to be quite hard for it to actually
[INDISTINCT] upon change.

00:39:35.079 --> 00:39:39.730
You might call if it's anything like a, you
know, like a filters button which actually

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:42.379
reveals either subsequent control or a dialogue...

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:44.500
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Hey, he's in the chat.

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:45.789
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Here he is.

00:39:45.789 --> 00:39:47.410
How are you doing Mike?

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:49.990
It seems like he's behind and catching up.

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he is.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:52.569
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks.

00:39:52.569 --> 00:39:55.170
Thanks to Al actually for letting me in here.

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:56.170
&gt;&gt; Well...

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.849
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Yeah, I mean basically its pretty
similar sort of analogy to Gmail, right?

00:39:59.849 --> 00:40:06.369
Because basically the idea is to try to use
it as a kind of a download manager.

00:40:06.369 --> 00:40:09.719
So instead of having a download manager you
could just filter on--sorry [INDISTINCT] going

00:40:09.719 --> 00:40:10.719
here?

00:40:10.719 --> 00:40:11.719
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It's okay.

00:40:11.719 --> 00:40:12.719
No it's okay.

00:40:12.719 --> 00:40:14.440
Carry on, we can hear you.

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.440
It's fine.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:21.469
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Just wait here, if I'm just going
to [INDISTINCT] but yeah, it's basically that.

00:40:21.469 --> 00:40:29.309
So it's--you can see downloads data, so you
can run filter which would probably be just

00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:33.819
be an icon and on any other one of the labels,
tags sort of thing.

00:40:33.819 --> 00:40:36.309
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So you thought about following
the Gmail example.

00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:39.220
So having the kind of label type button at
the bottom?

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:43.481
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I don't think he heard--I don't
think he's plugged his head phones in.

00:40:43.481 --> 00:40:44.799
No he can't hear us.

00:40:44.799 --> 00:40:45.799
&gt;&gt; BANES: No.

00:40:45.799 --> 00:40:46.799
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Mike.

00:40:46.799 --> 00:40:47.799
Mike.

00:40:47.799 --> 00:40:48.799
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: I know, seeing that--oh yeah
okay.

00:40:48.799 --> 00:40:51.579
That's--but not really actually because I've
got--I've got the constraint of having something

00:40:51.579 --> 00:40:54.380
else, a player at the bottom so, I'm trying
to keep it simpler.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.960
Hello?
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: The idea being that you click

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:04.150
a button which takes you to a subsequent screen
which lets you then, you know, have a full

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:06.880
screen pick of what data you're trying to
display.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.009
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It has.

00:41:08.009 --> 00:41:10.269
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Wow, it's got crazy delay.

00:41:10.269 --> 00:41:12.149
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Three, two one and...

00:41:12.149 --> 00:41:15.159
&gt;&gt; BANES: Could you even do that [INDISTINCT]
wise?

00:41:15.159 --> 00:41:16.159
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Because...

00:41:16.159 --> 00:41:20.800
&gt;&gt; BANES: Just in action bars [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: I'm sorry can you say that--I'm

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.549
sorry I'm having some massive--I seem to be
having some massive audio in-synching, just...

00:41:24.549 --> 00:41:25.549
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, we can tell...

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:26.549
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: ...I'm sorry.

00:41:26.549 --> 00:41:27.549
Nick can you repeat that?

00:41:27.549 --> 00:41:30.210
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Oh, you're listening to his on
our podcast?

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:31.660
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I'll repeat it.

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:32.660
Okay.

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:37.209
So I was just saying is it possible to just
have a button which launches the full screen

00:41:37.209 --> 00:41:41.809
so that you pick the slices of data that you
want to view rather that having it all on

00:41:41.809 --> 00:41:42.809
screen at once.

00:41:42.809 --> 00:41:44.720
I mean that's kind of inappropriate.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.720
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: No.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.720
Okay.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.559
Yeah, it's just that I--I think that I keep
hearing myself but.

00:41:49.559 --> 00:41:50.559
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Okay.

00:41:50.559 --> 00:41:51.559
This is weird.

00:41:51.559 --> 00:41:53.539
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I think he just left from the
podcast room.

00:41:53.539 --> 00:41:56.449
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, maybe we should come back
to this one.

00:41:56.449 --> 00:41:59.839
It's just--we're being a little bit, kind
of...

00:41:59.839 --> 00:42:00.839
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, right.

00:42:00.839 --> 00:42:01.839
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:42:01.839 --> 00:42:02.839
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Okay.

00:42:02.839 --> 00:42:03.839
You know, sorry, sorry, guys.

00:42:03.839 --> 00:42:11.460
I'm just having some trouble here with the--I
keep hearing myself at the same time so I'm

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.460
just...

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:16.400
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah let's [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Yeah, basically--I mean the--yeah,

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.400
yeah.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.690
I'll leave it, you know, I'll leave it.

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:23.240
Sorry I'm having some trouble with the audio.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:27.319
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No worries.

00:42:27.319 --> 00:42:28.319
It's all good.

00:42:28.319 --> 00:42:29.319
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:42:29.319 --> 00:42:32.579
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So we were talking about--anything
else?

00:42:32.579 --> 00:42:36.700
I thought there was another question.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:42.499
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: We could start the next question,
that was...

00:42:42.499 --> 00:42:50.609
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: There was a question in the--in
the G+ posted from Adir, who looks a lot like

00:42:50.609 --> 00:43:03.390
Johnny Depp, asks whether you can put an action
bar at the bottom and as it's stupid to have

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:05.069
it at the top.

00:43:05.069 --> 00:43:06.069
That's right.

00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:07.069
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Bold statement.

00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:08.069
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So, no.

00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:11.869
By default you cannot control the placement
of the action bar.

00:43:11.869 --> 00:43:19.949
You can go into split mode where it will be
at the top and bottom when the device is narrow,

00:43:19.949 --> 00:43:22.480
but you can't actually control where it's
placed.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.209
You cloud certainly create a custom control
which looks a bit like an action bar but it's

00:43:26.209 --> 00:43:27.959
at the bottom, but that is your choice.

00:43:27.959 --> 00:43:32.640
As to whether it's stupid or not, I almost
think that's less important because it's mostly--you'll

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.210
use it for its familiarity.

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:37.430
So that users recognize it and know how to
use it.

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:42.480
So, whether you think it's stupid or not,
it's one thing, you know, open for a discussion

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:47.979
with I guess, Rich Fulcher and all the design
people who created it.

00:43:47.979 --> 00:43:51.269
But right now it's such an important as standard
element of your--in your tool box that I would--wouldn't

00:43:51.269 --> 00:43:58.309
deviate from it unless you have really good
reasons.

00:43:58.309 --> 00:44:02.569
&gt;&gt; Do you mind if I say something?

00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:03.790
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:06.230
Oh, that's Adir, hi.

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:08.309
&gt;&gt; I'm Adir by the way.

00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:09.309
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Hi.

00:44:09.309 --> 00:44:11.499
&gt;&gt; That picture is nothing.

00:44:11.499 --> 00:44:17.890
Anyway, the reason I said the word--I'm sorry
I used stupid because I wrote the question

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:19.700
several times and it didn't save.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.180
I really have no idea how this happened.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:29.269
I elaborated and explained and every time
I refresh the page, the question disappeared.

00:44:29.269 --> 00:44:34.029
So the last time was just really--this one
just stayed, I don't know why.

00:44:34.029 --> 00:44:35.029
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: All right.

00:44:35.029 --> 00:44:39.809
&gt;&gt; Anyway, what I meant by it was the--I have
a Galaxy Note and it's pretty much impossible

00:44:39.809 --> 00:44:43.729
to touch the action bar that's on the top
and most new apps now use that action bar

00:44:43.729 --> 00:44:48.920
and it's very hard for me to reach there because
I can't hold it with one hand use the buttons

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.239
up there.

00:44:50.239 --> 00:44:55.119
But if the buttons were on the bottom like
a--with the split one, it's a lot easier to

00:44:55.119 --> 00:45:01.109
use the buttons that are in the bottom because
I don't need to reach all the way to the top.

00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:03.799
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yes, I agree that some phones
are getting really, really big and--but do

00:45:03.799 --> 00:45:07.700
you know--can you even use it?

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.960
The Galaxy Note one-handed, like, is that
possible?

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:10.960
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:15.089
In most old apps--all the old apps, the one
they took from Gingerbread that didn't update

00:45:15.089 --> 00:45:21.959
themselves are very easy to use because all
the buttons are hidden in the menu and the

00:45:21.959 --> 00:45:24.829
menu is normally at the bottom of the phone.

00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:30.059
So I don't--the Galaxy Note has the menu button
unlike the Nexus and other new phones, you

00:45:30.059 --> 00:45:34.569
can just hit the menu and they pop up--they
pop at the bottom so it's very easy.

00:45:34.569 --> 00:45:35.569
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:45:35.569 --> 00:45:36.569
&gt;&gt; The top is normally just for information.

00:45:36.569 --> 00:45:40.359
I just look at the top, I don't need to touch
it.

00:45:40.359 --> 00:45:41.359
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:45:41.359 --> 00:45:43.069
&gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter.

00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:48.659
And I intend to get the Note 2 so it's going
to be even harder.

00:45:48.659 --> 00:45:49.659
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh.

00:45:49.659 --> 00:45:58.329
At the risk of saying you're holding it wrong
kind of question--answer.

00:45:58.329 --> 00:46:05.360
It's--no, I think it's the general direction
of Android that, you know, have--a lot of

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:11.290
devices have these soft buttons at the bottom
of their phone, so generally having your controls

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:16.900
right next to those is problematic in itself
because you can then have missed touches where

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:22.849
you're touching the--kind of the system home
and back buttons rather than the in app controls.

00:46:22.849 --> 00:46:26.440
So, I generally think separating away from
that is good.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:33.459
But I do agree that some of these bigger phones
could be hard and I don't really have good

00:46:33.459 --> 00:46:41.880
answer for what to do about actions but I'd
say this is what is really important to have

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:47.420
swipe on tabs as well whenever you have a
tabbed in space because it's very--it's not

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.849
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; I understand.

00:46:48.849 --> 00:46:50.969
Thank for your time.

00:46:50.969 --> 00:46:57.150
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Mike, so you joined us.

00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:01.640
Mike, are you in real time?

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.599
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Yes.

00:47:03.599 --> 00:47:06.549
Sorry about that.

00:47:06.549 --> 00:47:18.249
I actually had the double whammy of not only
leaving the YouTube video on but not having

00:47:18.249 --> 00:47:24.910
the audio in the Hangout because I normally
record my podcast using a Hangout and I had

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:26.260
it piped into Soundflower.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:29.990
So I was hearing like one perfect audio just
ten seconds off.

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:31.010
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, indeed.

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:32.010
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Wonderful.

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:33.730
I'm glad it's sorted out now.

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:34.730
I was...

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:36.099
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Yeah, yeah, sorry guys.

00:47:36.099 --> 00:47:44.660
So just to explain again, basically--I mean
the idea is to have one sort of set of tags

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:53.349
in one drop down and a kind of--initially
it would just be an icon in the action bar

00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:58.660
which if you opened it up that you would see
the different statuses like whether it's downloading

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:03.419
or downloaded or so on which gets you around
the traditional downloading manager interface.

00:48:03.419 --> 00:48:06.709
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Sorry, we just had a system update
on screen.

00:48:06.709 --> 00:48:08.179
I was wondering why you went quiet for a second.

00:48:08.179 --> 00:48:13.780
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: So I was trying to get around
the download manager kind of concept by basically

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:18.670
making a whole thing--a set of filters, if
you like, by adding an extra filter for download

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:19.670
status.

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:20.670
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:24.940
So my worries about having them next to each
other is that--it's kind of a bit hard to

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:25.989
parse this.

00:48:25.989 --> 00:48:28.079
It might look a bit complicated.

00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:33.189
Could you just have like one in the drop down
and one like in line in the control itself--in

00:48:33.189 --> 00:48:34.539
the screen itself?

00:48:34.539 --> 00:48:39.239
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: It's a little tricky because
down the bottom, we've got a player at the

00:48:39.239 --> 00:48:42.479
moment in the design so it's a little hard
to add some extra--it's just, you know, trying

00:48:42.479 --> 00:48:43.539
to avoid adding an extra...

00:48:43.539 --> 00:48:46.249
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Well, not necessarily on the bottom
but like a row underneath.

00:48:46.249 --> 00:48:47.769
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Second row below the action bar?

00:48:47.769 --> 00:48:49.599
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, for like a search control
to...

00:48:49.599 --> 00:48:50.599
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Could you...

00:48:50.599 --> 00:48:51.599
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Could do.

00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:55.069
I mean we're trying to avoid it because we've
also got tabs as well.

00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:56.069
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: All right.

00:48:56.069 --> 00:49:01.869
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Could you have a view pager or something
to sort of swipe through the different statuses.

00:49:01.869 --> 00:49:03.519
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Well you've got tabs already.

00:49:03.519 --> 00:49:04.519
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Oh.

00:49:04.519 --> 00:49:05.519
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Yeah.

00:49:05.519 --> 00:49:10.349
I mean that's a--it's actually kind of separate
question because I would like to have a view

00:49:10.349 --> 00:49:13.819
pager to tab between different entities, you
know, effectively labeled, so genres, but

00:49:13.819 --> 00:49:14.819
I don't know.

00:49:14.819 --> 00:49:18.099
It seems like with tabs what you want to do
is just swipe between tabs.

00:49:18.099 --> 00:49:19.099
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:49:19.099 --> 00:49:20.099
Definitely.

00:49:20.099 --> 00:49:21.099
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Yeah.

00:49:21.099 --> 00:49:24.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And especially if you have a list
of similar things, like, different views or

00:49:24.619 --> 00:49:27.900
different data, then, yeah, that works really
well with tabs--with swiping tabs.

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:28.900
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Yeah.

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:29.900
&gt;&gt; Butcher: And...

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.719
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Marie is trying to give some feedback
as well.

00:49:31.719 --> 00:49:32.719
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, yeah?

00:49:32.719 --> 00:49:33.719
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Let's hear it.

00:49:33.719 --> 00:49:35.519
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Marie says, hello, we can help.

00:49:35.519 --> 00:49:37.390
Two drop downs, have no different weight.

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:38.719
Good is a simple structure.

00:49:38.719 --> 00:49:41.562
If you have a different logical structure
like a grid view on menu on the top and a

00:49:41.562 --> 00:49:43.270
drop down inside it would be easier.

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:44.270
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Right.

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:45.270
A grid view or menu view on top.

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:46.270
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So, can you just describe the
problem again?

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:49.940
So you have a list of podcasts and you want
to have different ways to slice that by downloaded

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:51.039
versus downloading and then...

00:49:51.039 --> 00:49:52.039
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Yes.

00:49:52.039 --> 00:49:53.039
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ...all...

00:49:53.039 --> 00:49:59.250
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Yeah, the kind of status as well
as like arrows and so on so you could quickly

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:01.140
see, you know what's actually arrowed...

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:02.140
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-hmm.

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.140
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: ...and then the genres basically.

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.140
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-hmm.

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:05.140
Okay.

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:06.140
I--I'm just trying to wonder if you can like
have one...

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.140
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I think...

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:08.140
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ...complete controls somehow.

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.220
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: With your Music Player's view
of having the genres split horizontally by--like

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:20.009
a view pager or in tabs so you have all the
podcasts and you can swipe for genre one,

00:50:20.009 --> 00:50:33.190
swipe for that--and then at the top you just
have one drop-down to filter.

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:35.630
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Right, different status...

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:38.680
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: All of the things...

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:43.739
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Yeah, I mean that is a possibility.

00:50:43.739 --> 00:50:54.730
I have to look at that if you could--I mean
how would the users discover what's actually

00:50:54.730 --> 00:51:00.890
there because I like the idea of being something
like Google+ or, you know...

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:05.589
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Oh, you have--you have them at
the top so they can see which genres they

00:51:05.589 --> 00:51:06.589
go...

00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:07.589
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: I see.

00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:08.589
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: ...on the top bar.

00:51:08.589 --> 00:51:10.940
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: And then the tabs would still
be...

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.430
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: They tap the tabs.

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:13.430
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Yeah.

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:15.880
Yeah, I mean it is possible the only thing...

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:16.880
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.910
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: [INDISTINCT] potentially tabs
inside there as well.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:19.910
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:26.390
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: We could potentially get around
that but I see what you mean and then the

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:36.289
tabs would potentially be able to scroll as
well like you wouldn't have to fill all the

00:51:36.289 --> 00:51:37.289
tabs...

00:51:37.289 --> 00:51:38.289
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:51:38.289 --> 00:51:41.239
And if you look at the Music Player on--for
Android...

00:51:41.239 --> 00:51:44.699
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Or the Play Store is the same--similar
as well.

00:51:44.699 --> 00:51:46.510
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Or the Play Store, yeah.

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:47.510
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:48.510
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Okay.

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:49.510
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Might as well...

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:50.510
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So you could...

00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:51.510
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:54.249
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, you could--you could also,
you know, you--by default, go into an all

00:51:54.249 --> 00:51:58.269
view so you can see all your podcasts but
then you can swipe across to go into genres.

00:51:58.269 --> 00:51:59.269
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Okay.

00:51:59.269 --> 00:52:00.269
Yeah, that's good.

00:52:00.269 --> 00:52:01.269
Yeah.

00:52:01.269 --> 00:52:09.239
I mean just in terms of--I mean is the actual
drop down, it sounds like you guiding me against

00:52:09.239 --> 00:52:10.239
it right?

00:52:10.239 --> 00:52:11.700
Like it's just kind of unstandard and...

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:15.769
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Double drop down, yeah, I would--I
don't like the sound of it.

00:52:15.769 --> 00:52:20.880
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It's probably--yeah, actually
you have to make your own custom action bar

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:21.880
as well.

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:22.880
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Yeah, okay.

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.880
Okay.

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:24.880
That's a good--that's a good overview.

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.880
Thanks.

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:26.880
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Oh, cheers, Mike.

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.880
Good to see you.

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:32.199
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, type some sketches on Plus
and we'll have a conversation.

00:52:32.199 --> 00:52:33.709
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: All right.

00:52:33.709 --> 00:52:35.229
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, definitely.

00:52:35.229 --> 00:52:37.189
It sounds like a good plan.

00:52:37.189 --> 00:52:38.189
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:52:38.189 --> 00:52:39.949
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: How are we doing?

00:52:39.949 --> 00:52:41.519
Got any more questions?

00:52:41.519 --> 00:52:43.689
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: We do have more questions.

00:52:43.689 --> 00:52:47.609
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And thanks Marie as well for chiming
in.

00:52:47.609 --> 00:52:49.329
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Thank you Marie.

00:52:49.329 --> 00:52:52.049
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Yeah, thank you.

00:52:52.049 --> 00:52:54.089
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: All right.

00:52:54.089 --> 00:52:56.430
Let's see if we do.

00:52:56.430 --> 00:52:58.740
Slightly strange question, maybe just skip
it.

00:52:58.740 --> 00:52:59.740
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Go ahead.

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:00.740
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:05.319
One of the development features from Jelly
Bean and Ice Cream Sandwich used for, for

00:53:05.319 --> 00:53:06.319
building [INDISTINCT] applications.

00:53:06.319 --> 00:53:10.119
It would be nice if you could provide codes
to fit some examples.

00:53:10.119 --> 00:53:14.529
I guess NFC would be useful for that set of
applications.

00:53:14.529 --> 00:53:15.529
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:53:15.529 --> 00:53:16.829
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: A very specific question.

00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:22.440
I mean you can do anything you want in Android--that's
why I said we should skip it.

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:32.809
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I mean I interpret that as a lot
of people want to create kind of kiosk type

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:37.839
applications, I was wondering if it's that,
where you, you know, you don't have the home

00:53:37.839 --> 00:53:45.329
and back and reset button switch out the application,
I mean I was if that was the real question

00:53:45.329 --> 00:53:47.469
at hand here so...

00:53:47.469 --> 00:53:51.579
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I'll tell you the best way of
doing that.

00:53:51.579 --> 00:53:56.910
Put it in a case where it comes with a home,
back and reset button.

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:57.910
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:53:57.910 --> 00:54:02.539
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: And think with any functionality
you want this idea of--like we did in that

00:54:02.539 --> 00:54:03.539
magazine recently.

00:54:03.539 --> 00:54:04.539
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-hmm.

00:54:04.539 --> 00:54:05.539
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Which magazine was it?

00:54:05.539 --> 00:54:06.539
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Entertainment Weekly.

00:54:06.539 --> 00:54:10.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Entertainment Weekly, where they
embedded an Android device inside--in between

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:13.990
the pages, but you could just see the screen
so you wouldn't really know.

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:16.430
People often ask actually how can they lock
down Android to use in controlling inside

00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:19.780
house lighting controls, whatever it's going
to be and without changing the phoneware,

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:23.829
the easiest way is to put in a custom housing
so you can't actually get to the buttons.

00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:30.660
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: There was an app in there if you
have root access you can hide the system bar

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:31.660
and have...

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:35.430
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: If you have root access, you can
do that kind of stuff, yeah.

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:39.910
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Seeing that--so that could be
an option if you're doing a kiosk solution

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:42.539
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Or go and play with the AOSP.

00:54:42.539 --> 00:54:47.679
Have a word [INDISTINCT] about the AOSP on
how to customize it and build it yourself

00:54:47.679 --> 00:54:48.910
and go down that route.

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:56.240
But if you have actual devices just change
the housing then.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.920
Okay, onwards.

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:01.660
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Anymore live questions in the
room?

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:03.049
We should turn on the moderator key.

00:55:03.049 --> 00:55:08.279
&gt;&gt; Nick, it's Paul here, it's not about a
question.

00:55:08.279 --> 00:55:15.299
It's just that I checked my notes from last
week and you've mentioned a guy called Trevor

00:55:15.299 --> 00:55:19.919
at Mountain View Time, does that ring any
bells?

00:55:19.919 --> 00:55:21.549
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: We did that.

00:55:21.549 --> 00:55:22.549
Yeah.

00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:23.579
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Oh, we did.

00:55:23.579 --> 00:55:24.579
Yeah.

00:55:24.579 --> 00:55:25.579
That was during...

00:55:25.579 --> 00:55:26.839
&gt;&gt; That was during the...

00:55:26.839 --> 00:55:28.059
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Last week.

00:55:28.059 --> 00:55:30.099
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: During Mobile World Congress.

00:55:30.099 --> 00:55:33.069
I said that he wrote an application to read
the patches...

00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:34.069
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Patches.

00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:35.069
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: ...at Mobile World Congress.

00:55:35.069 --> 00:55:36.069
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:40.420
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: So, you can put on the Android
scan and scan people's patches using NFC,

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:45.980
so he gained quite a bit of NFC experience
at the time.

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:50.760
He hosts the Developer Office Hours in the
Mountain View Time Zone.

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:51.760
&gt;&gt; Uh-hmm.

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:52.760
Right.

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:58.089
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It's eight hours from now, 10:00
PM UK Time.

00:55:58.089 --> 00:55:59.920
They have their Office Hours.

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.920
So...

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.169
&gt;&gt; Do you know what his surname is?

00:56:03.169 --> 00:56:04.389
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Trevor Johns.

00:56:04.389 --> 00:56:05.599
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Trevor Johns.

00:56:05.599 --> 00:56:06.599
Yeah.

00:56:06.599 --> 00:56:10.690
He's on code.google.com/team, all of our bios
and everything and G+ pages are listed there.

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:11.690
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:14.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Google.com/team, which runs very
well on tablets I've heard.

00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:15.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you, guys.

00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:16.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No worries.

00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:17.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:56:17.170 --> 00:56:18.170
Yeah.

00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:23.239
But you can definitely post the same question
to the US Time Zone and you will get a--probably

00:56:23.239 --> 00:56:25.089
a more expert answer.

00:56:25.089 --> 00:56:26.089
&gt;&gt; Cheers.

00:56:26.089 --> 00:56:29.099
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I think we've got one of London's
famous freezes again.

00:56:29.099 --> 00:56:30.099
&gt;&gt; I'm here, Al.

00:56:30.099 --> 00:56:31.099
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Who was that?

00:56:31.099 --> 00:56:32.099
I'm sorry.

00:56:32.099 --> 00:56:33.099
I didn't...

00:56:33.099 --> 00:56:34.099
&gt;&gt; It's Paul.

00:56:34.099 --> 00:56:35.099
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Hi, Paul.

00:56:35.099 --> 00:56:36.099
&gt;&gt; I think everyone else has gone frozen.

00:56:36.099 --> 00:56:37.740
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I can see some people still moving
around.

00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:45.509
It's just the London guys who--I think they're
missing a slot, so I'm going to drop out and

00:56:45.509 --> 00:56:50.160
that should give them a slot to rejoin in.

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.160
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.170
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: And we're back.

00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:53.170
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:54.750
&gt;&gt; MAHEMOFF: Dropped out again, so that...

00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:55.750
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Thanks.

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:56.750
Nice.

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:57.750
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Thanks.

00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:58.799
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; We can hear you.

00:56:58.799 --> 00:56:59.799
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Cool.

00:56:59.799 --> 00:57:03.209
Thank you very much.

00:57:03.209 --> 00:57:05.170
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: There's Al.

00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:07.569
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Al, being very gracious again
this week.

00:57:07.569 --> 00:57:08.569
Cheers, Al.

00:57:08.569 --> 00:57:09.569
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: No problem.

00:57:09.569 --> 00:57:10.789
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT] is required.

00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:13.979
So we do have a question that we've answered
before.

00:57:13.979 --> 00:57:18.740
I am executing an AsyncTask inside an object
intended to be part of a library.

00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:21.799
Actually, maybe that's a slightly different
variant, I'm sorry.

00:57:21.799 --> 00:57:24.099
Still, how can I deal with orientation changes?

00:57:24.099 --> 00:57:27.839
Because as we know, orientation changes on
Android are going to kill your activity and

00:57:27.839 --> 00:57:28.839
restart it.

00:57:28.839 --> 00:57:31.999
But if you're in a library, it's a slightly
different question.

00:57:31.999 --> 00:57:32.999
I wonder.

00:57:32.999 --> 00:57:35.889
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Why you have to be quiet?

00:57:35.889 --> 00:57:40.199
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: You have to be quiet because you're
in a library.

00:57:40.199 --> 00:57:41.199
Nice.

00:57:41.199 --> 00:57:42.199
Yeah.

00:57:42.199 --> 00:57:45.529
You have to be--I mean you're not--not necessarily
have the activities but you have to be--plus

00:57:45.529 --> 00:57:49.460
you're using your library to make sure that
they might have orientation changes in keeping

00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:51.559
your space, and things like that.

00:57:51.559 --> 00:57:58.140
So, if you're using an AsyncTask inside a
library and you don't know what context your

00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:02.179
library is being used in, it's going to be
much harder.

00:58:02.179 --> 00:58:04.679
So I think...

00:58:04.679 --> 00:58:06.709
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: I think you.

00:58:06.709 --> 00:58:07.759
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It would be...

00:58:07.759 --> 00:58:08.799
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: You can't really.

00:58:08.799 --> 00:58:09.849
You either have to...

00:58:09.849 --> 00:58:13.029
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: You'd have to do it in the service,
wouldn't you?

00:58:13.029 --> 00:58:14.029
And then...

00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:15.029
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:17.509
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: ...just say to the developer that
you've got to include in their manifest, so

00:58:17.509 --> 00:58:19.079
that the service can be fired off whenever.

00:58:19.079 --> 00:58:20.079
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: A service would be a much lighter
thing to do.

00:58:20.079 --> 00:58:21.079
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:58:21.079 --> 00:58:22.079
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Or use a Loader.

00:58:22.079 --> 00:58:23.959
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Or as I say, extend the AsyncTaskLoader
as well because that will handle the orientation

00:58:23.959 --> 00:58:24.959
change for you.

00:58:24.959 --> 00:58:25.959
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Well...

00:58:25.959 --> 00:58:26.959
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: As well as an AsyncTask.

00:58:26.959 --> 00:58:27.959
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Certainly, I think you've answered
the question yourself inside the question.

00:58:27.959 --> 00:58:30.259
I don't use AsyncTask inside libraries when
you don't have a context tab, you're just

00:58:30.259 --> 00:58:31.259
going to use it like that.

00:58:31.259 --> 00:58:32.719
You'd have to be very specific to the use.

00:58:32.719 --> 00:58:40.180
You don't have to implement your library or
they'll be seeing issues all over the place.

00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:41.809
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:43.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: But I am surprised it hasn't come
up earlier actually.

00:58:43.619 --> 00:58:44.619
Saying that, I thought we've answered it before.

00:58:44.619 --> 00:58:45.619
It is a--slightly more interesting slant to
the AsyncTask issue.

00:58:45.619 --> 00:58:46.619
Okay.

00:58:46.619 --> 00:58:47.619
Anything else coming in on the...

00:58:47.619 --> 00:58:48.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No.

00:58:48.619 --> 00:58:49.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: ...G+ thread.

00:58:49.619 --> 00:58:50.619
It's only four minutes to go and we'll have
a final question.

00:58:50.619 --> 00:58:51.619
Last four minutes.

00:58:51.619 --> 00:58:54.989
Of course, we've just spent four minutes saying
the word tablet.

00:58:54.989 --> 00:58:55.989
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Okay.

00:58:55.989 --> 00:59:00.549
Are we done with the--oh no, we've done it
all.

00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:01.549
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:02.869
Oh, damn it.

00:59:02.869 --> 00:59:04.130
There's a lot of pages.

00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:07.430
I'm sure the other pages are questions that
we've answered.

00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:09.079
My device has a screen...

00:59:09.079 --> 00:59:10.400
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Sparky got that...

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.049
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: ...that doesn't matter, sir.

00:59:12.049 --> 00:59:13.930
I know, after you're done it's all...

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:17.189
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Have you ever found out who done
it, Rich?

00:59:17.189 --> 00:59:18.929
Or did you just miss that last page?

00:59:18.929 --> 00:59:22.539
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: So, we've answered all of the
questions except the ones on the last page.

00:59:22.539 --> 00:59:25.950
We have to--my device screen has a resolution
of 800 by 480 and an HDMI connector.

00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:30.630
How do I get a full HD res in all apps when
I plug it to full HD monitor with an HDMI

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:31.630
cable while connecting it to monitor with
apps screen around 800 by 480 but films are

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:32.630
in full HD.

00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:33.630
Well...

00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:34.630
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Great.

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:35.630
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:36.630
That's...

00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:37.630
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:38.630
By default, an Android just is mirroring,
so it will just do--mirror what's on your

00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:39.630
screen, so you get the same screen resolution
on Android except--so there's the special

00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:40.630
case where a video could use, which will do
something funky.

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:41.630
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:42.630
It's going to be hard where overlaying stuff
isn't going over the HDMI.

00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:43.630
There's nothing you can do about it, and certainly
no APIs.

00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:44.630
Nick was looking at different ways of detecting
when HDMI cables are being plugged in but--yeah.

00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:45.880
You can't actually change what's going through.

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.920
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: A question in [INDISTINCT] and
Andrew Kelly asks can HDMI mirroring be disabled?

00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:48.989
That's quite--I was looking at this issue.

00:59:48.989 --> 00:59:49.989
There's no platform level way of doing it.

00:59:49.989 --> 00:59:51.349
There's--certain OEMs include APIs, so Motorola
has an API for detecting the HDMI state and

00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:52.349
reacting accordingly, and other people do
as well.

00:59:52.349 --> 01:00:03.130
There is a event--a broadcast event that happens
when HDMI cables plugged in and out but it's

01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:04.130
currently hidden for good reasons, I assume.

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:05.130
So like you can't rely on that always being
there.

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:06.130
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yup.

01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:08.650
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So for now, there's not a great

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:09.650
story.

01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:12.769
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: How can I get screen-captured
film device with 25 to 30 frames per seconds

01:00:12.769 --> 01:00:13.769
in my computer?

01:00:13.769 --> 01:00:14.769
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: HDMI app.

01:00:14.769 --> 01:00:22.849
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Or only to another monitor like
on presentations on Google AEO device does

01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:25.619
not HDMI or any other video connectors.

01:00:25.619 --> 01:00:26.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: In [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Google AEO, we use HDMI app.

01:00:26.619 --> 01:00:27.619
&gt;&gt; There's also DLNA.

01:00:27.619 --> 01:00:28.619
DLNA.

01:00:28.619 --> 01:00:29.619
You can also use it.

01:00:29.619 --> 01:00:30.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Well, if you want video content,
I think, it doesn't necessarily mirror the

01:00:30.619 --> 01:00:31.619
device [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: DLNA doesn't do mirroring, they

01:00:31.619 --> 01:00:32.619
wouldn't show the live screen, it would just
be able to show like a specific content of

01:00:32.619 --> 01:00:33.619
a file or something.

01:00:33.619 --> 01:00:34.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Other good things...

01:00:34.619 --> 01:00:35.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Okay.

01:00:35.619 --> 01:00:36.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: ...of the new hardware-accelerated
emulators, I've made a video using one of

01:00:36.619 --> 01:00:37.619
those quite recently.

01:00:37.619 --> 01:00:38.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-hmm.

01:00:38.619 --> 01:00:39.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: And it came out very well.

01:00:39.619 --> 01:00:40.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It's true.

01:00:40.619 --> 01:00:41.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Good.

01:00:41.619 --> 01:00:42.619
Good.

01:00:42.619 --> 01:00:43.619
You know, you can watch video, you can watch
YouTube in there and the video frame rate

01:00:43.619 --> 01:00:44.619
is good.

01:00:44.619 --> 01:00:45.619
So, the hardware-accelerated emulators with
images provided by Intel.

01:00:45.619 --> 01:00:46.619
&gt;&gt; All right.

01:00:46.619 --> 01:00:47.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: And GPU acceleration, very good.

01:00:47.619 --> 01:00:48.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

01:00:48.619 --> 01:00:49.619
I'd say, you either need HDMI app or...

01:00:49.619 --> 01:00:50.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: The HDMI app is the way to go.

01:00:50.619 --> 01:00:51.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ...emulator is your best.

01:00:51.619 --> 01:00:52.619
Yeah.

01:00:52.619 --> 01:00:53.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: And it's going to be the fastest,
most responsible with the highest resolutions.

01:00:53.619 --> 01:00:54.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Using like BlueStacks maybe, even
on your PC.

01:00:54.619 --> 01:00:55.619
I really have tried that.

01:00:55.619 --> 01:00:56.619
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: BlueStacks runs in a Window, so
probably it would have the same problems as,

01:00:56.619 --> 01:00:57.619
say, using the emulator or using a VirtualBox.

01:00:57.619 --> 01:00:58.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: What do you mean the same problems?

01:00:58.619 --> 01:00:59.619
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Recording from a window, unless
you've got an application that will do that

01:00:59.619 --> 01:01:00.619
well and give you a good quality output.

01:01:00.619 --> 01:01:01.619
You...

01:01:01.619 --> 01:01:02.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

01:01:02.619 --> 01:01:03.619
But--yes.

01:01:03.619 --> 01:01:04.619
It's got like desktop screen recording.

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:05.619
There's tons of stuff where apps will do that
for you, right?

01:01:05.619 --> 01:01:06.619
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I'm not sure.

01:01:06.619 --> 01:01:07.619
I have not come across any ones that I'm a
hundred percent happy with, but I think if

01:01:07.619 --> 01:01:08.619
you looked...

01:01:08.619 --> 01:01:09.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I just want to [INDISTINCT] haven't
use one on that.

01:01:09.619 --> 01:01:10.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So, the remedy is when we did
that scrolling tricks with the sticky scrolling

01:01:10.619 --> 01:01:11.619
and stuff, just desktop recorder [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Oh, cool.

01:01:11.619 --> 01:01:12.619
I'll give it a shot again.

01:01:12.619 --> 01:01:13.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

01:01:13.619 --> 01:01:14.619
The hardware emulator--I mean hardware-accelerated
emulator, it certainly makes the emulator

01:01:14.619 --> 01:01:15.619
much more perform--and useful for this kind
of thing.

01:01:15.619 --> 01:01:16.619
But yeah, the best bet you're going to get
is--well, one of my favorite tricks is using

01:01:16.619 --> 01:01:17.619
a real device with the show touches turn on,
which can create really good quality videos.

01:01:17.619 --> 01:01:18.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Show touches.

01:01:18.619 --> 01:01:19.619
Good tip.

01:01:19.619 --> 01:01:20.619
To finish it off, Paul asks, is anyone would
to join from London in late October?

01:01:20.619 --> 01:01:21.619
&gt;&gt; Wait.

01:01:21.619 --> 01:01:22.619
One--can I--one more thing?

01:01:22.619 --> 01:01:23.619
Sorry.

01:01:23.619 --> 01:01:24.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Oh, go ahead.

01:01:24.619 --> 01:01:25.619
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.

01:01:25.619 --> 01:01:26.619
I heard in news app called AppGeek that Google
released a template for building apps.

01:01:26.619 --> 01:01:27.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

01:01:27.619 --> 01:01:28.619
&gt;&gt; But I've not seen it anywhere and like
I've searched Google.

01:01:28.619 --> 01:01:29.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It's in your ADT.

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:30.619
&gt;&gt; What?

01:01:30.619 --> 01:01:31.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It's in your ADT.

01:01:31.619 --> 01:01:32.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Your Android Developer Tools inside
Eclipse plug-in.

01:01:32.619 --> 01:01:33.619
&gt;&gt; Oh.

01:01:33.619 --> 01:01:34.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: See that new project in there,
it's a template.

01:01:34.619 --> 01:01:35.619
It's not being point to IntelliJ at this point.

01:01:35.619 --> 01:01:36.619
So, yeah.

01:01:36.619 --> 01:01:37.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: That's in ADT.

01:01:37.619 --> 01:01:38.619
&gt;&gt; I'm a software engineer but I only work
with computers.

01:01:38.619 --> 01:01:39.619
I only started working with Android now but
currently my app looks like C, it doesn't

01:01:39.619 --> 01:01:40.619
look anything like Java.

01:01:40.619 --> 01:01:41.619
I don't use threads and stuff like that.

01:01:41.619 --> 01:01:42.619
It simply looks like C++.

01:01:42.619 --> 01:01:43.619
So...

01:01:43.619 --> 01:01:44.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Are you using Eclipse to write
it?

01:01:44.619 --> 01:01:45.619
&gt;&gt; ...I want it to be an app that's created--huh?

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:46.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Are you using Eclipse to write
it?

01:01:46.619 --> 01:01:47.619
&gt;&gt; Using a what?

01:01:47.619 --> 01:01:48.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Eclipse.

01:01:48.619 --> 01:01:49.619
&gt;&gt; Eclipse.

01:01:49.619 --> 01:01:50.619
Yes.

01:01:50.619 --> 01:01:51.619
Of course.

01:01:51.619 --> 01:01:52.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

01:01:52.619 --> 01:01:53.619
It's in Eclipse in the Development Tools.

01:01:53.619 --> 01:01:54.619
You can just do trial...

01:01:54.619 --> 01:01:55.619
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.

01:01:55.619 --> 01:01:56.619
I've downloaded the--some of your sample apps
but the spaceship one and the snake...

01:01:56.619 --> 01:01:57.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Uh-hmm.
&gt;&gt; ...like

01:01:57.619 --> 01:01:58.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Oh, they've been C++.

01:01:58.619 --> 01:01:59.619
&gt;&gt; These are just the only ones I have access
to.

01:01:59.619 --> 01:02:00.619
Are there anything newer?

01:02:00.619 --> 01:02:01.619
I need to update something, doesn't do automatically.

01:02:01.619 --> 01:02:02.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: What are you writing, a game or...

01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:03.619
&gt;&gt; I'm making--I'm currently making a game.

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:04.619
Yes.

01:02:04.619 --> 01:02:05.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: You could look at--if you Google
for--what's Chris' game called again?

01:02:05.619 --> 01:02:06.619
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Wind-up Knight?

01:02:06.619 --> 01:02:07.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: No.

01:02:07.619 --> 01:02:08.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No.

01:02:08.619 --> 01:02:09.619
No.

01:02:09.619 --> 01:02:10.619
It's got like a source code.

01:02:10.619 --> 01:02:11.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: The Replica Island.

01:02:11.619 --> 01:02:12.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, Replica Island.

01:02:12.619 --> 01:02:13.619
Thanks.

01:02:13.619 --> 01:02:14.619
&gt;&gt; GAUNT: Yeah.

01:02:14.619 --> 01:02:15.619
&gt;&gt; How?

01:02:15.619 --> 01:02:16.619
Replica Island?

01:02:16.619 --> 01:02:17.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

01:02:17.619 --> 01:02:18.619
This is a former teammate of ours who open-sourced
a game written--it's all written in Java and...

01:02:18.619 --> 01:02:19.619
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:02:19.619 --> 01:02:20.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, and so on.

01:02:20.619 --> 01:02:21.619
So that's--that will help you bootstrap because
[INDISTINCT] your game loop and all that stuff.

01:02:21.619 --> 01:02:22.619
They'll be some good codes to copy.

01:02:22.619 --> 01:02:23.619
Again, a little bit dated but it's...

01:02:23.619 --> 01:02:24.619
&gt;&gt; I've already made several games but they
all use--I use one class to make like a loop.

01:02:24.619 --> 01:02:25.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-hmm.

01:02:25.619 --> 01:02:26.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Uh-hmm.

01:02:26.619 --> 01:02:27.619
&gt;&gt; And the rest of it looked just like the
main in C, so it just repeats that one, so

01:02:27.619 --> 01:02:28.619
all the threadings and all the advance stuff
are not available for me, so it looks like

01:02:28.619 --> 01:02:29.619
this.

01:02:29.619 --> 01:02:30.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

01:02:30.619 --> 01:02:31.619
It definitely improves that Replica Island
source code.

01:02:31.619 --> 01:02:32.619
It will give you a lot of ways to handle inputs
and, you know...

01:02:32.619 --> 01:02:33.619
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:02:33.619 --> 01:02:34.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ...something on the device, so
[INDISTINCT]

01:02:34.619 --> 01:02:35.619
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:02:35.619 --> 01:02:36.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Thank you.

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:37.619
Thank you all very much for joining us on
this week's Android Developer Office Hours,

01:02:37.619 --> 01:02:38.619
EMEA Edition.

01:02:38.619 --> 01:02:39.619
We'll catch you all next Wednesday.

01:02:39.619 --> 01:02:40.619
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Thanks, guys.

01:02:40.619 --> 01:02:41.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Tablets.

01:02:41.619 --> 01:02:42.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Bye, everyone.

01:02:42.619 --> 01:02:43.619
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Tablets.

01:02:43.619 --> 01:02:44.619
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Tablets.

01:02:44.619 --> 01:02:44.620
Tablets.
