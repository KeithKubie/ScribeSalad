00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:05.170
 We have 35, the number of which is 3, 

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.247
 that is, it's the same 30, three, 

00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:11.881
 1 tenth, 2 tenth and 3rd tier group of 10, 

00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:14.108
 and also have 5, which is a unit of units written, 

00:00:14.108 --> 00:00:17.638
 means we have 5 points. Look 

00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:19.740
 one, two, three, four, five. 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.421
 Now I want three of these 35's 

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.382
 and add 6 points to 5 points. 

00:00:25.382 --> 00:00:26.845
 These six points are written in the order of the units, 

00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:30.837
 Look at one, two, three, four, five and six points. 

00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:32.381
 And I advise you to stop the video 

00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:35.458
 and try it yourself on 35 to 6. 

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:37.479
 So, let's just think about it. 

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.162
 I'll start from the order of units. 

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:42.958
 We have 5 points and we want to add 6 points. 

00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.544
 What will happen together? 

00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:51.583
 Very good, 5 points plus 6 points, which will get 11 points 

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:55.159
 and we still have these three top ten 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.580
 will remain 3 dozens and 11 points. 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.157
 Let me write it. 

00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:05.396
 Now we have a little problem as I can not 

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:07.860
 double digit number 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.821
 category of units. 

00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:13.583
 If not, this number is not 311, 

00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:15.881
 It's three tens and 11 points, 

00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:19.620
 verb now how to group or move this number, 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.174
 so I can only get a double digit. 

00:01:22.174 --> 00:01:24.820
 We have zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.800
 and nine, here, instead of a double digit, we can write 1 point. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.637
 Can I group and say? 

00:01:30.637 --> 00:01:34.560
 "Look, I can quote these points as a dozen" 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.780
 because I have 10 points, then 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.398
 I can group them together 

00:01:41.398 --> 00:01:44.834
 and make a group of 10s. 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.440
 Let me explain again what we did. 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.655
 I took 10, these ten points 

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.837
 and I just wrote them together 

00:01:56.837 --> 00:02:00.913
 in one group. 

00:02:00.913 --> 00:02:02.561
 So, what will happen to us now? 

00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:04.975
 We have already got it after the grouping 

00:02:04.975 --> 00:02:09.678
 one, two, three, four, four. 

00:02:09.678 --> 00:02:12.579
 And how many points will we have now? 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.156
 In the fourteen we have grouped 10 points, 

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:20.335
 and only 1 point left us. 

00:02:20.335 --> 00:02:24.270
 So, this can be written as 4 points plus 1 point. 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.894
 Remember, we had 3 dozens and 11 points, 

00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:29.831
 which resulted in fourteen and one points. 

00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:31.734
 And let me write it like this, 

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:40.266
 as 1 unit and 4 dozens. 

00:02:40.386 --> 00:02:43.550
 And how do we get the answer? 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.655
 if this picture was not. 

00:02:45.655 --> 00:02:47.755
 You can actually group 

00:02:47.755 --> 00:02:49.591
 Doing so in your mind, 

00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:52.318
 but there is another option. Can you say that? 

00:02:52.318 --> 00:02:55.882
 "Very well, we have 5 plus 6, which is equal to 11 points." 

00:02:55.882 --> 00:02:59.640
 but I can not write these 11 in the order of units, 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.594
 That is why it is the same, 

00:03:01.594 --> 00:03:07.736
 what 10 plus 1, one ten plus plus 1. 

00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:11.460
 Often they say that 5 out of 6 are equal to 11, 

00:03:11.461 --> 00:03:14.620
 just remember 1, but in reality: 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.200
 Remember that 5 out of 6 is equal to 1 dozen and one units. 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.420
 And those 11 numbers, 

00:03:26.274 --> 00:03:27.818
 he has a category of heights of 1 and 

00:03:27.818 --> 00:03:31.930
 The unit of units also has 1 point. 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.709
 And as a result, we make the tens of each other, 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.375
 1 dozens plus 3 dozens will be fourteen. 

00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:45.673
 But I really want you to understand, 

00:03:45.673 --> 00:03:49.354
 it is not necessary to mechanically say that 5 of the 6 guesses are equal to 11, 

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:51.815
 but rather it is 1 point and 1 point 

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:53.533
 and that's why we are writing this tenth of the categories. 

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:55.518
 And it turns out to be a grouping. 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.793
 We rolled up dozens. 

00:03:58.793 --> 00:04:01.334
 I took these 10 points, 

00:04:01.334 --> 00:04:04.270
 and I can make them a dozen, 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.674
 from which I get the tenth of the order 1. 

00:04:06.675 --> 00:04:09.320
 the remaining 1 point in the rankings.
