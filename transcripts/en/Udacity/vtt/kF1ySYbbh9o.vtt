00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.130
The second way to submit assignments is through to

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.640
the Udacity site itself. I'm going to walk you through

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.175
an example from the advanced operating systems course. As you

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:11.898
can see in this project, questions are being asked directly

00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:14.672
in this IDE, I can submit my answers by typing

00:00:14.672 --> 00:00:19.220
them in directly here. Then I click the Submit button

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.130
to send it through the site. I'll get some feedback

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.170
to let me know that my submission was accepted and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.740
to note that my grade will be assigned by a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.680
human being. An important thing to note is that I can

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.470
change my answer and resubmit my submission through the site.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.080
The class schedule will tell me up to the minute of

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.290
when my submission will be pulled from the site and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.710
graded. I can continue to change my answer and resubmit as

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.140
many times as I want up until this deadline. After

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.240
the deadline, I can still change my answers and submit them

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.250
through the site but they won't go anywhere and no one will be grading

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.730
them. Please check with your TA instructor

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.010
if you have any questions about these deadlines.
