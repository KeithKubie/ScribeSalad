00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.540
Placentas are strange alien-looking pancake-shaped
life-support organ for a fetus, but once that

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.680
baby is born...

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.330
I'm hungry, DIBS!

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:19.020
There are people out there who eat the placenta
after birth.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.280
Some are celebrities, some are just weirdos
like you and me, and some are completely normal.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.480
But placentophagy, as it's known in the scientific
world, doesn't seem to have the benefits claimed

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.050
by the people who eat it.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.660
Look, science can take the fun out of anything,
so why not this too?

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.590
Humans are among a few animals who DON'T practice
placentophagia -- almost all land mammals

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.040
eat the afterbirth.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.500
And that fact is a common one people cite
when they DO eat placentas.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.620
Though the ones who don't are pretty telling...
chimpanzees and scavengers don't, and a study

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:59.610
of 179 cultures found basically zero evidence
of placentophagy in any historic or prehistoric

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.610
human cultures!

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.200
I mean, maybe during a famine, sure, but otherwise,
nah.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.200
Why?

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.840
A study in Ecology and Food Nutrition says,
"[If] placentophagia is not a biologically

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.810
determined behavior in humans, we should assume
that there must be a good adaptive reason

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.009
for its elimination."

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.549
Placentas aren't some purple sack of miracles.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.490
They’re part of the fetal life-support system,
which also includes the amniotic sac and umbilical

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.490
cord.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.119
The placenta attaches to the uterus, allowing
the transfer of nutrients and oxygen from

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.679
the mother's blood to the fetal blood -- keeping
them separate.

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.719
It protects against bacterial -- not viral
-- infections and passes antibodies to the

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.990
baby creating three months of immune response
at birth… like a 90-day warranty!

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.029
It also produces pregnancy hormones like estrogen,
progesterone, and hCG.

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:47.789
After the birth, the placenta is ejected,
in what's called the afterbirth.

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.639
The placenta is a life-support filter, so
it can contain high levels of bacteria, selenium,

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:56.020
cadmium, mercury, or lead.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.459
It can also still contain many of the hormones
for its fetal charge which can cause any number

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.009
of effects if ingested.

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.859
And yet, People claim eating their placentas
balanced their hormones, kept them from developing

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:12.720
postpartum depression, boosted their energy,
helped them regain nutrients, or stopped their

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.950
bleeding immediately after birth!

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.310
The most scientific sounding research has
to do with pain relief after birth.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.010
A 1986 study from the University at Buffalo
found an opioid-enhancing molecule in amniotic

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.099
fluid and in the placenta which promoted quote
"maternal behavior" in RATS, and another study

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.819
also from U-B in 2005 found placentophagia
may have analgesic -- or pain killing -- properties

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:48.519
for rats.

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.269
One researcher believes, some of the claimed
natural energy buzz and the possible lessening

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.540
of the baby blues COULD have to do with the
hormones in the placenta, but again, there's

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.969
no evidence whatsoever either way; and if
that's the case, it would be better to treat

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:07.260
the postpartum depression than eat an organ
that may not do so.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.280
In the end, though, there's just not really
any new double-blind controlled studies on

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.629
placental ingestions.

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.340
There's a LOT of anecdotal information out
there and a TON of media attention, but it's

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.379
not a common practice, one hospital in DC
found of 3,500 annual births only two mothers

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.540
took their placenta home in a year.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.439
So there's no hard evidence to support whether
it's bad OR good.

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:36.980
If you DO go for it, just remember it's meat,
and bacteria can infect meat; so eating it

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.780
raw can be dangerous.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:55.609
It 
is meat grown even if it's grown by a human

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.109
fetus, after all.

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:02.129
Anyway, if you go for it; you do you, people.
