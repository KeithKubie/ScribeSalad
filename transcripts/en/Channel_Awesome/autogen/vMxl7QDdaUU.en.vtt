the world to me it is the world that
little bit of positivity is just

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960
little bit of positivity is just
 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.640
little bit of positivity is just
everything and that's what I remember

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650
everything and that's what I remember
 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.010
everything and that's what I remember
about the Nostalgia Critic

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020
 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.819
by the way don't worry I'm shaving this
