00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.750
&gt;&gt; Sue Vita: Good
evening, everyone.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.140
Thank you for coming tonight.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.010
My name is Susan Vita,
and I'm the Chief

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.370
of the Music Division
here at the Library.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.470
It is my pleasure to welcome
you tonight to the latest

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.730
in our ongoing collaborative
lecture series

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.900
with the American
Musicological Society.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.560
This series has been
going strong

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.930
since the inaugural
lecture by Judith Tick

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.170
on Ruth Crawford Seeger
probably 10 years ago.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.710
And we are pleased to
co-sponsor the series

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.240
which highlights
research that was done

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.770
in the Music Division
either in-house or online.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.840
Tonight's lecture by Dr. Daniel
Callahan will explore the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.250
physicality of Leonard
Bernstein's

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.400
conflicting practices.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.950
Sorry, conducting practices.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.840
Probably both.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.110
And fits right in with
the worldwide celebration

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.400
of Bernstein's centenary
this year.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.010
Somebody told me that there are
20 events celebrating Bernstein

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.860
this week, so I'm glad that
you all chose ours, and --

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.160
as you know, the Library

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.680
of Congress holds the
Leonard Bernstein Collection

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.240
which contains 400,000 items.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.500
This AMS Lecture is part
of a week-long series

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.090
of events looking at
many different aspects

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.560
of the American icon.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.540
We hope that you will join us
for our other events as well

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.190
which include a screening of <i>On
the Waterfront, </i>on Thursday,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.220
a concert on Friday of known

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.650
and unknow Bernstein songs
featuring Michael Barrett

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.640
and a fantastic team
of young singers.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.280
I'm just really looking
forward to that,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.270
and another all-day
affair on Saturday,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.700
which is not the Royal
Wedding [laughter],

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.190
in which we will have six
speakers and performers talking

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.160
about all things Bernstein.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.210
We will also have a
selection of the treasures

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.070
from the Bernstein
collection that will be

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.800
on display all day long, and
we hope to see you there.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.180
While there is nothing
like being there in person,

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.500
one great thing about
the AMS Library

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.390
of Congress partnership is
that we record the lectures

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.060
for future webcasts on the
Library's website and YouTube.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.750
And the lectures of the
talented scholars selected

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.390
for the series are available for
all to enjoy around the world.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.370
Before Dr. Callahan speaks,

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.120
I'd like to introduce
Martha Feldman,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.280
the Mable Green Meyers Professor
of Music and the Humanities

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.170
at the College -- in the College
at the University of Chicago.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.210
Professor Feldman
is the President

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.420
of the American Musicological
Society

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.840
and will be offering her
greetings from the Society.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.840
So thank you all again for
joining us this evening

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.510
and please join me in
welcoming Professor Feldman.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.360
&gt;&gt; Martha Feldman: It's really
an enormous pleasure to be here

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.580
and to be able to introduce an
AMS Library of Congress Lecturer

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.130
at this amazing great
institution

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.310
where I actually carried
out dissertation research

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:07.800
as an avid, very zealous PhD
student quite some time ago,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.100
decades ago.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.350
I won't say how many.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.150
Like many AMS members,
I've returned

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.630
to the Library's collections
in music and have worked

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.720
in other areas of the Library
many times over the years

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.880
in person, by correspondence,
and now digitally as well.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.820
So it's very, very rewarding
to be able to participate

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.680
in this collaboration during
my tenure as AMS President.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.270
I want to thank very sincerely
the staff who have helped

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.190
with this -- David Plyler,
Kate Miller, Ben Walsh,

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.560
and, of course Susan Vita.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.220
And with that, let me just say
that I'm particularly happy

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.840
and honored to introduce
tonight's speaker,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.610
Professor Daniel Callahan, a
valued colleague in musicology

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.600
and a dear friend as well.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.830
Daniel earned his BA at
NYU and his MA, M.Phil.,

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:17.450
and PhD at Columbia University,
the last of those in 2012.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.140
Since 2014, Daniel has been
Assistant Professor of Music

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.640
at Boston College where he
teaches courses that range

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.100
from Aesthetics, Empathy, and
Ethics to Modernism in Dance.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.770
Before that, he was the Mellon
Postdoctoral Fellow and Lecturer

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.560
in Music in the Humanities
at the University of Chicago,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.420
a position into which I was
lucky enough to have hired him

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.780
in 2012 when chairing
my department,

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.920
that's before we were
friends, and where he taught

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.810
for two years Undergraduate
and Graduate Courses.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.390
He taught wonderful
courses on music video,

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.660
Soundies to YouTube,
and Choreomusicalities,

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.460
and collaborations
between different composers

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.830
and choreographers, and things
that none of us were doing

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.230
and none of us had, in
some cases, even heard of.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.920
A cellist and dancer himself,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.410
Daniel has given an
extraordinary number

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.610
of professional papers on topics
that stretch from Bernstein,

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.810
Copeland, and John Cage, to
Mullermae [assumed spelling],

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.010
1930's cartoons, Maersk
Cunningham, Nijinsky, Ted Shawn

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.980
and his Men Dancers,
and in approaches

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.710
that suture together the
concerns of music, dance,

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.130
and image with those of
gay aesthetics and desire.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.670
Daniel Callahan is the recipient
of many grants, fellowships,

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.510
and awards in addition
to the Mellon Postdoc

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.560
that I mentioned earlier.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.880
He's won a Whiting Dissertation
Completion Fellowship,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.390
the Selma Jeanne Cohen
Award from the Society

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.430
of Dance History
Scholars, and various awards

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.090
from Boston College,
Columbia, and AMS.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.980
This summer we'll
see the publication

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.380
of Daniel's ambitious and
much anticipated article

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.540
for the <i>Journal of the American
Musicological Society </i>entitled,

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.390
"The Gay Divorce of Music
and Dance, Choreomusicality,

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:20.650
and the Early Works
of Cage-Cunningham,"

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.790
which adduces new archival
and performative evidence

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.330
for the early collaborations of
John Cage and Merce Cunningham,

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.660
to argue that music and
dance were not divided

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.370
in their early years but
were interrelated intimately,

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.830
especially through gay critiques
of heterosexual marriage.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.950
Given that Daniel has
established himself

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.060
in public presentations as an
intellect to be reckoned with,

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.370
there's reason for great
excitement about his book

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.580
in progress, <i>The Dancer From
the Music, Choreomusicalities</i>

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.360
<i>in American Modern Dance </i>which
is bound to set American music

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.140
and dance studies
on a new course.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.600
Please join me in welcoming
Professor Daniel Callahan

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.570
in his AMS Library of
Congress lecture entitled

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.510
"Bernstein Conducting Himself."

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:18.060
[ Applause ]

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.810
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan:
Thank all of you for coming.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.870
Thank you, Susan Vita, our Chief
Librarian of Music Division,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.020
thank you Martha Feldman

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.470
for that incredibly
generous introduction.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.170
I wasn't sure who you were
talking about some part of that,

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:35.090
and also for your exemplary
leadership as President

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.240
of the American Musicological
Society, and for being a mentor

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.860
and friend to me for
these past six years.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.960
Words to not being to
express how honored I am

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.120
to share my research with
all of you today here

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.840
at the Library of Congress.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.690
In September, 2011,
during my final year

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.530
of writing my dissertation
on music and modern dance,

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.710
I came to the Library's
Music Division

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.330
to research what had then been
a long brewing side project,

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.780
"The Complicated Gestation of
Bernstein's Westside Story."

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.860
I had intended to stay in
Washington, D.C. for just a week

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.890
and then go back to my
dissertation in New York.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.190
That was the plan.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.460
The Music Division's
Senior Music Specialist,

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.750
Mark Eden Horowitz, welcomed me.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.080
He talked with my about
my research and alerted me

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.540
that hundred and
hundreds of letters

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.370
in the personal correspondence
of Leonard Bernstein,

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.230
letters that had previously
been sealed and unavailable

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:34.160
to researchers, had very
recently been unsealed and were

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.650
in the midst of being processed.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.690
Much to the chagrin
of my then boyfriend

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.670
and my dissertation advisers
my one-week stay turned

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.320
into three weeks.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.800
Since that time, my side
project has now turned

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.750
into a second book project.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.470
For that I want to thank
Mark Eden Horowitz,

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.790
who is one of the national
treasures here at the Library

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.230
of Congress, along
with the amazing staff

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.860
who helped make today
possible, especially Kate Miller

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.180
and David Pylar [assumed
spelling], and in the back,

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.990
Jay Ken Lock and Mike
Terpin [assumed spelling]

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.290
on audio visual.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.960
We had a near meltdown
earlier and they saved the day.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.870
Like the 90-degree weather
in Washington, D.C. today,

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.790
Leonard Bernstein is hot.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.590
You do not need a
musicologist to tell you this.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.820
Just look at my title
slide's photograph of him

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.750
after a concert [laughter].

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.140
Backstage in 1951, a
photograph taken by Ruth Orkin

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.870
and held here in the
Library of Congress,

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.570
this massive Leonard
Bernstein collection.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.620
If that doesn't convince you,
maybe he's not your type,

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.670
consider the myriad
concerts and special events

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:40.220
that are taking place around the
globe this year in celebration

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.030
of Bernstein's centennial.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.890
If you are a classical
music fan, the Bernstein

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.120
at 100 Events, which
are occurring

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.270
at a local symphony orchestra
near you, are not news.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.280
If you are not a classical music
fan, and perhaps joining us

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.860
on YouTube, and have
just stumbled upon this,

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.490
you still might not be
convinced that Bernstein is hot.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.470
In that case, I look to
Hollywood and I ask you

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:09.460
to consider the news that came
out two weeks ago today --

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.530
"Jake Gyllenhaal Plays
Music Icon Leonard Bernstein

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:16.330
in Cary Fukunago-Helmed 'The
American'" We have a kind

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.290
of famous actor who really
wants an Oscar who's also a bit

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:24.070
of a heartthrob agreeing to play
Leonard Bernstein on screen.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:28.590
On that very same day,
May 1st, on Netflix,

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.290
former <i>Saturday
Night Live </i>writer,

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.320
John Mulaney released his
stand-up special <i>Cape</i>

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.720
<i>Gorgeous </i>.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.450
Within six minutes into his
routine, Mulaney relates how,

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.690
when he was 12 years old,
his father brought up

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.830
and made Leonard
Bernstein the center

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.880
of what might be the world's
most mysterious sex talk.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.080
Instead of butchering the joke,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.600
I will just direct
you to Netflix.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.430
Finally, only a few days
ago, it was announced

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.040
that Bradley Cooper
will also star in,

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.270
and in this case direct, a
Leonard Bernstein biopic.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:08.880
So, the question is not
whether or not Bernstein is hot.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.860
The question is now, "Wer
Wird Bernstein Besser

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.310
Spielen [laughter]?"

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:18.180
Who will be better at playing
Leonard Bernstein on screen?

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:22.710
As two of Hollywood's leading
men wish to embody him,

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.110
it's kind of not surprising.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.720
Leonard Bernstein made
embodying himself look

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.640
so easy, so smart, so musical.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.470
Take, for example,
this, my first clip

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.340
from a <i>Young People's
Concert </i>, nationally televised

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.640
in 1960 called "Who
is Gustav Mahler?

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.930
I like to imagine my
mother back in Chicago,

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.460
age eight in Ukrainian village,

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:51.730
perhaps my first generation
grandparents also watching

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.440
Bernstein in their living room.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.510
So let's just watch this now.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:13:51.050
[ Music ]

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:52.350
&gt;&gt; Now, was

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:56.380
that heartbroken-sounding
music the real Mahler?

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.550
Or is the other happy
sleigh bell music?

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:01.230
No, they're both Mahler.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:05.790
They're the voices of the two
different people inside him.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.770
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan:

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.710
If the real Mahler had two
different people inside him,

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.520
according to Leonard Bernstein,
one might very well wonder,

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.880
how many different people
were inside the real

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.550
Leonard Bernstein?

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:22.230
And how will any actor, even one
as talented as Jake Gyllenhaal

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:26.770
or Bradley Cooper, play him
and convey this on screen --

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:31.890
conductor, composer, pianist,
writer, educator, activist,

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:35.530
television celebrity,
husband to his wife, Felicia,

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.320
father to three children,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.140
lover to countless men,
and devoted friend.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:45.280
Bernstein sought to be the
best in all possible worlds.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.290
Both during and after
his life, critics

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.420
and biographers diagnosed
him as a precocious genius

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.720
who squandered his talent
because of an inability

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.180
to focus on a single activity.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.980
In the past decade, multiple
scholars have nuanced our

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.700
understanding of Bernstein,

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.020
focused most often
on his compositions.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.660
Today I'm excited to
share some of my research

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.940
on Bernstein's conducting,
an area that has not received

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.180
as much scholarly attention.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.220
Like his other professional
activities,

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.390
Bernstein's conducting has had
a mixed reception among critics.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.020
Considerable ink was
spilled in newspaper reviews

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.450
for half a century, and among
amateur lovers, both fans

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.130
and detractors of his
conducting, have been vocal

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:29.930
from the 1940s up to the
present, now 27 years

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.160
after his death -- 28.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.040
Among critic practitioners
of conducting,

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.120
Bernstein is often
considered a first-rate showman

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.350
and a second-rate technician.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.050
Take Gunther Schuller

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.210
who presents his scorched
Earth perspective on a century

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.220
of conducting his his book,
<i>The Complete Conductor </i>.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.850
Schuller makes no secret of his
preference for conductors who,

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:58.070
like himself, quote, "Respect
rigorously the content

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.580
of a score," end quote,
so much so that, quote,

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:06.490
"The score becomes a kind of
sacred document," end quote.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:10.120
Once one accepts Schuller's
idealization of the score,

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.520
most of his large book
seems logical enough.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.820
Schuller's criticisms

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.560
of Bernstein most
often regard temp beat.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.860
Usually he's too slow.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:23.350
For example, Bernstein once
did conduct the andante second

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.120
movement of Brahms's <i>First
Symphony </i>with the quarter note

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.790
at 24 beats per minute.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.900
While that might be a
flagrant and specific foul,

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.200
Schuller's criticism

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.740
of Bernstein is unflagging
throughout his book.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.570
For the most part he is concise,

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.660
never exceeding a
phrase or sentence.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:46.900
For example, quote, "Leonard
Bernstein was Reiner's pupil,

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.020
but one of the world's
most histrionic

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.870
and exhibitionistic conductors."

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.340
Or, Bernstein's interpretation

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.190
of Brahms's <i>First
Symphony </i>has quote,

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.900
"too much of an oy-vay
Weltschmerz

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.750
to be bearable," end quote.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.980
And, quote, "Bernstein was
one of the most overrated

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.090
and adulated conductors
of recent times.

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:13.030
He rarely practiced what he
preached, to work in service

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.710
of the composer, a sad fact,

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.930
given his enormous basic
natural talent, musical

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.810
and conductorial-gestural."

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.680
Published in 1997,
Schuller's feeling

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.010
that Bernstein was grossly
overrated was obviously not

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.570
shared by the many
classical music lovers

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.980
who had been doing all of
that overrating for decades.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.250
Critic John Rockwell
remembers that as a teenager

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.270
in the late 1950s he
had fierce arguments

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.520
in which he defended
Bernstein again other teenagers

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.170
who labelled his conducting,
quote, "flamboyant,"

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.830
a word that occurs
throughout discourse

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.530
about Bernstein on the podium.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.100
I don't think teenagers
today are talking

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.400
about Bernstein's flamboyance.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.940
Oh, this is the 1950s.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.270
The understanding of Bernstein
as better than his critics

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:02.310
and in need of defense
against them was so widespread

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.770
that it could even provide a
laugh in a primetime sitcom.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:10.410
In "Everyone's a Critic", a
1999 episode of <i>Frasier </i>,

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:13.490
the character Niles Crane
is named a music critic

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:15.220
for a magazine [laughter].

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.280
&gt;&gt; How did this happen, Niles?

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.790
&gt;&gt;I was at a party
thrown by the publisher,

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.090
Olga Swardre [assumed spelling].

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:23.070
The pretentious fop who had the
job before me was there too,

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.090
spouting sheer drivel
about Leonard Bernstein.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.440
Being polite, I kept my
tongue sheathed [laughter],

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.110
until he referred to Bernstein's
conducting as overrated.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.650
&gt;&gt; I assume you pounced.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:39.720
&gt;&gt; Like a ninja [laughter].

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.910
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan:
Back to Gunter Schuller.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.900
After 479 pages, throughout
which Bernstein here

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.220
and there is consistently
criticized for failing to adhere

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.990
to various details, Schuller
finally offers, quote,

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.440
"a word about Bernstein,"
end quote.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.390
It's actually over 500 words
in a page-conquering footnote,

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.630
following yet another
knit-picky critique

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.750
about Bernstein's
Renickderstortions [assumed

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:10.160
spelling] and Measure 92 of
[inaudible] Suite Number Two.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.200
The rest of this footnote,
outlined on the slide,

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.810
is devoted to a critique
in which Schuller touches

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.890
on Bernstein's inability
to focus

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:22.040
on a single professional
activity as well as, quote,

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:27.490
"his ego-driven distortions,
exaggerations, and histrionics,

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:30.840
his drinking, outrageous
behavior, pursuit of the trendy

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.240
and chic, and his
bisexuality," end quote.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.520
Schuller concludes
that Bernstein, quote,

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.440
"had very little
discipline and no shame.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.100
And that his podium antics
and athletic exhibitionism,

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.260
although wonderful for audiences
in television," end quote,

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.270
demonstrate that he did
not put the score first.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:57.060
Schuller wanted more
Beethoven, less Bernstein.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.840
For Bernstein and his fans, the
distinction between Beethoven

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.970
and Bernstein was too
blurred to matter.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.010
Given Bernstein's celebrity
status, it is not surprising

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.790
that discussions
of his conducting

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.170
on stage were sometimes
conflated

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.930
with his conduct off stage.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.460
Histrionic podium antics
and athletic exhibitionism,

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.390
to quote Schuller,
"bothered him."

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:25.830
But so did the fact that
Bernstein, his colleague

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:30.120
for decades, was a less
than puritanical homosexual.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.070
I should note that I will
refer to Bernstein as gay

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:36.940
and homosexual, and
not bisexual.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.830
This is how his closest
friends refer to him.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:44.050
It is also how his wife, Felicia
Montealegre, referred to him

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:49.010
in a letter shortly after they
were married in 1951 or 1952.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:51.730
This is in the Library's
recently unsealed letters.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:57.990
Quote, "You are a homosexual and
may never change," end quote.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.360
Schuller's criticisms
betray a larger fear,

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.660
that fallible bodies

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.920
and performances can never
do justice to ideal works.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.910
A large part of any musical
performance is not just a

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.020
musician's movements that
result in a specific sound, say,

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.160
how tight or wide a
cellist's bravado is,

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.450
but also bodily movements
and facial expressions

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.710
that are often considered
supplementary

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.730
to musical expression.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.570
The distinction between
movements that do and movements

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:31.820
that don't, result in a specific
sound, become wonderfully blurry

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.970
when we consider the conductor.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.580
And so what Schuller calls
histrionics might be worth a

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.290
closer look.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.590
Musicians who played

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.710
under Bernstein maintain
contra Schuller

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.820
that he was not moving
for the audience.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.850
Quote, "He certainly does not
act and gesticulate for the sake

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:54.420
of show," end quote, said
Viennese Violinist Hans Novak.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.930
"He jumps about during
rehearsals

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.400
when he has no public
behind him," end quote.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.200
Bernstein sought to
both lead the musicians

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.850
and become the music,
music that was far larger

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:10.180
than his five feet eight inches
and 140-something pounds.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.490
For Bernstein, as for
the music-loving scholar,

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:17.250
Roland Bart, every score
became, quote, "a muscular music

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.590
in which the body itself must
transcribe what it reads.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:25.260
It is the scripter, not
the receiver, end quote.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.280
Bernstein, more than any
conductor I know spoke and wrote

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.800
of music in just this way.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.030
Bart. when he was fully involved
in a work of music, writes that,

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.590
quote, "Every distinction
between composer, interpreter,

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.510
and auditor is abolished,

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.480
so much so that the musical
text becomes Bart's body."

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.840
Fellow musicologist and future
AMS President, Suzanne Cusack,

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.400
has written of, quote, "the
desire to know the music

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:56.300
as a means to physically
be that music," end quote.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.780
This is empathy.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.830
Today we might think of empathy
as being able to know what it's

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.920
like to be someone else,
to stand into their shoes,

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.430
to know how they feel.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:10.120
So we might think of people
like nurses or Meryl Streep

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.100
or Former President
Barack Obama.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.750
The word empathy, however,

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:18.180
entered the English language
only in the early 20th century

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:22.160
and then, as a translation of
the German aesthetic concept

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.410
of [foreign word], which
is the vitalization

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.180
of a non-living art object
through the projection

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.600
of one's own kinesthetic
self into it.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.630
One projects oneself
into the artwork in order

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.690
to experience the
artwork dynamism,

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.230
its movement, and its form.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.930
You basically say,
I am you to a score,

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.430
or a sculpture, or a painting.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:48.220
This concept was embraced
in the 1930s by John Martin,

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.650
the first full-time dance
critic in the United States.

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.870
He believed that modern dance
offered its viewers the chance

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.100
to experience kinesthetic
empathy with the bodies

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.250
of another engaged
in choreography.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.600
But before I come back to
modern dance, a quick note

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.120
about some older dancing.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.180
Whether in rehearsal
or in concert,

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.000
Bernstein's body might
remined one that the word

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.800
"orchestra" derives from
the Greek "orchestra,"

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.020
orches meaning dancing place.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.150
The part of the stage
in ancient theaters

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:21.930
that was nearest the audience,

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.740
where the chorus
danced and sand.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.440
We might say that Bernstein's
conducting is a kind

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.470
of bodily scripting of the
orchestral music in front

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:34.170
of him, or literally
<i>Orchesographie </i>,

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:37.190
the title of our
[inaudible] 1589 Treatise

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:40.960
on the Relationship Between
Dance and Music and Social Dance

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.680
as well as the word
that would morph

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.110
into choreography
two centuries later.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:49.200
Although Bernstein and
his fans often speak

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.940
of his spontaneity
while conducting,

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.110
of his in the momentness, I
want to propose that we think

00:24:56.110 --> 00:25:00.270
of Bernstein's conducting
instead as choreography.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.740
What's more, by the end of
this talk, I hope to show

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.960
that this choreography actually
remains surprisingly consistent

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.460
from performance to performance,
sometimes even across decades.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.790
This is not just that there
are certain standard gestures

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:16.850
in Bernstein's movement
vocabulary,

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:18.760
but repeat across scores.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.440
There certainly are.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.400
But also that entire set
patterns of movement repeat

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.330
with the precision that strikes
me as uncanny and noteworthy.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.290
A larger conclusion here
is that Bernstein's body,

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:35.950
for all of its movement
and supposed visibility

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.850
on television, on stage, has
actually been taken for granted

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.230
and has never been that
carefully observed.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:46.680
One sometimes even encounters
interpretations of the same work

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.050
that sound fairly different,

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.460
but in which Bernstein's
conducting looks

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.220
nearly identical.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.210
Bernstein's podium
choreography for the "Rite

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:58.330
of Spring" is more
consistent across years,

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.770
I realized in November of 2014,

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.380
than was that of
conductor Andris Nelson's

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:07.680
over a three-concert-weekend
at Boston's Symphony Hall.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:12.050
This was surprising but what,
if anything, did it mean?

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:14.880
Bernstein's choreography

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.590
on the podium registered
his empathy with the score.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.990
It is his shameless presentation
of that empathy that represents,

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:24.930
perhaps, his most
unique contribution

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.230
to the art of conducting.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:30.690
For Bernstein, the podium
was both a dancing place

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:35.560
and a safe space of sorts where,
emboldened and legitimated

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.560
by a beloved score, he could
become both the music and,

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.750
paradoxically, most himself.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:47.860
From the beginning,
reviewers noticed the nearness

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.330
between Bernstein's
conducting and modern dance.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.060
Consider Alan Downs's
rave review

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.310
of Bernstein's breakthrough
performance on Sunday,

00:26:55.310 --> 00:27:00.080
November 14th, 1943, when
famously Bernstein stepped

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.080
in for an ailing Bruno Walter

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.520
and conducted the New York
Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:10.280
Downs writes, quote, "He
conducted without a baton,

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.950
justifying this by his
instinctively expressive use

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:16.840
of his hand and a
bodily plastic which,

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.990
if not always conservative,
was to the point,

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:22.660
alive and expressed
of this music.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.270
And so understood
by the players.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:27.190
Greater reserve will come later.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:28.620
It would be ominous

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.330
if Mr. Bernstein had
it now," end quote.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:35.040
Note that phrase,
"bodily plastic."

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.610
This refers to expressive
movement practices, like dance,

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:42.000
that were widespread in the
first third of the 20th century,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.290
such as Dalcroze Eurhythmics
here with some dancers

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:47.360
at an early program at Peabody

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.280
and then Bernstein
on your right.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.600
An expressive dance
or free dance,

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.310
the craze set off
by Isadora Duncan.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:58.080
Although Downs doesn't
use bodily plastic

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.460
in a directly negative way, he
still suggests that this quote,

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:03.780
"not always conservative,"

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:08.350
unquote movement
is just a phase.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.710
Opportunities to
conduct increased

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:12.780
when Bernstein was
named the Music Director

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.480
of the New York City
Symphony Orchestra in 1945.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.890
So, too, the possibilities
for him to be reviewed,

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:22.710
and these reverences to
the choreographic nature

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:27.010
of his conducting would continue
throughout the rest of his life.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:30.950
For example, we hear at this
chorybantic choreographies,

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.690
which include the
miming of facial gestures

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.100
of uncontrollable states."

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.680
That's Virgil Thompson
writing in '47.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.750
And then Harold Schonberg
who kind of had it in for one

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.300
of Bernstein, wrote, quote,

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.020
"Bernstein is the
most choreographic

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.500
of all contemporary conductors."

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:50.410
And Schonberg again in 1953,
quote, "He rose vertically

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:52.520
into the air, a la Nijinsky,

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.970
and hovered there a good
15 seconds by the clock."

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.340
The two references

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.790
to choreography here
both suggest that,

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.590
as was true when the when the
word began its wider circulation

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.400
in the early 20th
century, that it was a term

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.150
that was only applied to the
more outre modernist dancing

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.380
such as that of Nijinsky.

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:21.450
References to Nijinsky also
portray an understanding

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:24.760
of Bernstein not only as
saltatory, ready to leap

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.560
out of a window on stage,

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.730
but also as unconventionally
masculine.

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:35.450
In his draft for his 1979 "Young
People's Concert, Ballet Birds,"

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:38.600
which you can see online
through the Library of Congress,

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.170
Bernstein was read to
publicly address he fact

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:45.830
that he had been criticized for
being too dancerly for too long.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:49.850
He wrote, "Besides, after
years of reading in the papers

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:52.460
about my own balletic
movements on the podium,

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.390
whatever that may
mean, I probably ought

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.080
to give myself some real
ballet music to dance to,

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.100
so that the critics
can feel justified.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.000
Right?

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.260
Eventually either
Bernstein or someone

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.190
on the Production Team decided
that airing his grievance

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:08.700
with the critics and
further drawing attention

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:13.450
to his style would not make
for good TV for children.

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:17.400
Eventually, Bernstein
developed a thick skin.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.360
He was not the first conductor

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.220
on whose bodily movements
the press became fixated.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:26.410
Consider, of course,
Gustav Mueller, the composer

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.740
who Bernstein famously
championed.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.090
He was also criticized for
his conducting on the podium.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:33.470
Just as some criticism

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:37.010
of Bernstein thinly disguises
the homophobic sentiment beneath

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:40.970
it, so, too, did criticism and
grotesque characterizations

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:45.600
of Mahler's body sometimes
reveal antisemitism.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.650
Over his career, Mahler's
conducting gestures became

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:49.980
more reserved.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.000
According to critics, he used
less of the space around him

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.240
on the podium and his affected
presentations were less dynamic

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.740
with time.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.040
Bernstein's development

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.020
as a conductor took the
exact opposite course.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:08.380
At the Curtis Institute in 1939,
Conductor Fritz Reiner tried

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.750
to instill in Bernstein
a sense of discipline,

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:15.050
an obsessive attention to
detail, control over all parts

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:18.710
of the score, and a
relative economy of gesture.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:21.880
This was the opposite
of the more emotion

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.780
and motion-filled example

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:27.070
of the training Bernstein
was receiving simultaneously

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.170
under Koussevitzky in summers

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:32.180
at the Berkshire Music
Center, today Tanglewood.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.320
But the real impetus
for Bernstein's large,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.540
very physical conducting
came from the example

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:41.450
of Dimitri Mitropoulos.

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:45.450
Mitropoulos awakened in your
Bernstein passions both musical

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:48.490
and sexual, even if they
were never consummated

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:49.820
between the two men.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.230
We can't be sure.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:55.440
In January, 1937, during his
sophomore year of college

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.440
at Harvard, Bernstein
met Mitropoulos.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.860
The conductor immediately
saw something special

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.590
in the young man and
invited him to his rehearsals

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:07.470
for his American debut with
the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:10.910
By all accounts, Bernstein's
own, those of his friends,

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:13.890
letters to others, the
young Bernstein was dazzled

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:15.870
by Mitropoulos's conducting

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:19.120
which included Ravel's <i>Rhapsody
Espanol </i>and Schumann's <i>Second</i>

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.760
<i>Symphony </i>.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.000
Metropoulos took Bernstein and
his friend Mildred to a café

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.830
after the rehearsal they
were invited to watch,

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:31.110
and there he fed the young
man an oyster off of his fork.

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.920
And then, the setting
intimacy was followed

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.180
by Mitropoulos's just
as sudden departure.

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:41.280
It all upturned the
young Bernstein's world.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.750
Over a year after their first
meeting in 1938, Bernstein wrote

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:48.240
about his relationship
with Mitropoulos,

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.040
but renamed him Eros
Mavro [assumed spelling]

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.160
in a very thinly-veiled
autobiographical short story

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.450
titled, <i>The Occult </i>.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.950
Looking at that story, which
he wrote for a writing course

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:01.690
at Harvard, what
Bernstein seems to have seen

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.180
in Mitropoulos was a man

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:07.210
who used his body fully
and without shame.

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:10.380
Carl, as Bernstein renames
himself in the story,

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:13.670
observes the conductor in
rehearsal and is stunned.

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:17.520
While conducting Eros Mavro
rises up and falls back

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.760
down onto the stool
on the podium.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.580
He breaks the stool, but
he never stops conducting.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.840
Eros Mavro jumps up and
then he crashes down again,

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.920
breaking the replacement
stool yet again.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.520
Then he takes Carl to lunch
and feeds him an oyster off

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.220
of his fork [laughter].

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.690
The character Carl becomes
obsessed with Eros Mavro

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:42.230
after he leaves town
for his next engagement.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:45.310
Carl repeats a mantra
in his head.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:48.240
Plato makes Eros the
center of all emotions.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.000
Plato makes Eros the
center of all emotions.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.620
Carl latches onto the importance
that the older man links

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.020
to the word "sympathetic."

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.770
And when Eros Mavro
finally writes back,

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:03.080
it confirms all of
Carl's wishes.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.830
Quote, "Eros writes
to him, 'I want you.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.260
I dared not believe it before.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:13.710
Come to me."' Considering
the sophomore outing

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:17.250
in creating writing, literally
sophomoric, I think it is okay

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:20.680
if we put aside the intentional
fallacy for a moment.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.050
The story, which Bernstein
published in his collection

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:26.830
of writing findings in 1982, and
which exists here at the Library

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:29.650
in the Leonard Bernstein
Collection, demonstrates

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:35.290
that from Mitropoulos learned
to be simultaneously spiritual

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:37.990
and highly physical
nature of conducting,

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:40.620
an act involving
the entire body.

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:44.300
He also learned the importance
of feeling a real connection

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:48.580
with a fellow musician
and fellow gay man.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:52.160
Mitropoulos's influence
can be seen not just

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.100
in Bernstein's leap-heavy
conducting,

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.890
and here we see some slides

00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:59.860
of Mitropoulos midair while
conducting, but also in the way

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:04.020
that Bernstein conceptualized
conducting and its relationship

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:07.810
to sexuality and erotics.

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:09.110
Materials in the Library

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.320
of Congress's Leonard Bernstein
collection revealed the

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.200
vicissitudes of shame
and comfort

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.970
with which Bernstein viewed
his homosexuality and body,

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:19.710
and the relationship of these
relationship of these feeling

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.840
to his career as a conductor.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.060
From his college years
throughout the 1940s,

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.470
Bernstein we now
know had hundreds

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:29.920
of male sexual partners.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.160
Although the majority of these
relationships were casual,

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.660
Bernstein still saved
his correspondence

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.440
with many of these men.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.770
They were filed away
by Helen Coates

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:41.890
who was Bernstein's
first piano teacher

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:46.160
and then later his personal
secretary and confidante.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.990
One of the relationships that
seemed more than casual was

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:51.710
with a man named
Seymour Meyerson.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:55.880
The two first met in 1945.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.230
Helen Coates, in a letter

00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:00.640
to Bernstein several years later
would even question Bernstein's

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.000
decision to marry by brining
up Meyerson as an example

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.360
of a partner who made
Bernstein truly happy.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.400
Coates, Meyerson notes
in a letter to Bernstein,

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.240
would also confide in Meyerson

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.600
about Bernstein's
very busy sex life

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.180
and how she tried to manage it.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.010
Based on the letters available
and trust which Bernstein

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.990
and Coates showed him,
Meyerson seems to have been one

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:27.720
of the more stable relationships
Bernstein had in the 1940s.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.020
The two would continue writing

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:32.340
to each other even years
after they separated.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.920
Like Bernstein, Meyerson also
married and had children.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.520
And we wrote of the joys and
trials of family life and asked

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.180
after Bernstein's wife, Felicia.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:46.030
He would also recall their
previous love for each other.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:48.580
He wrote to Bernstein
of how one night,

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.890
while placing an older
sheet on the bed his wife

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:52.600
and he would shortly share,

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.890
he realized that it was the
same sheet upon which he

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.200
and Bernstein used
to regularly sleep.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:02.510
Throughout the 1940s,
Bernstein also planned

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:06.940
to compose a musical on James
M. Cain's hardboiled novel,

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.520
<i>Serenade </i>, about
a tenor who falls

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.030
under the dangerous
influence of a gay conductor.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:14.330
Kind of just ruined the plot.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:15.630
I apologize.

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:18.850
By the end of the 1940s,
as Bernstein's prospects

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:22.080
for a major conducting position
increased, his datebooks

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.640
and correspondence here
at the Library revealed

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.270
that he was seeing a
psychoanalyst multiple times a

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:31.770
week in an effort to suppress
his homosexual desires.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:36.110
Yet, even after his marriage
to Felicia Montealegre in 1951

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:40.320
and as late as 1954,
Bernstein was still hoping

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.670
to make a musical on
Cain's <i>Serenade </i>.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:46.530
He couldn't let go of this
link between sexuality

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:50.170
and conducting just as he
couldn't let go of the photos

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:54.540
and letters of the men with whom
he had casual relationships,

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.680
the vast majority of
which are now available

00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:00.010
to the public here
at the library.

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:02.240
Bernstein's connection
between conducting

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.250
and the erotic did make its way

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:07.500
into the public and
on prime time.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.730
Consider his third <i>Omnibus</i>
Television Special on the "Art

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:13.550
of Conducting" in 1955.

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:14.980
After going over the elements

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.570
of musicianship a conductor
must have, Bernstein moved

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:20.380
on to the intangibles.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.850
And this is as published
in his "IT Joy of Music .

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:27.860
He wrote, quote, "The conductor
must make the orchestra love the

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.900
music as he loves it.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.240
It is not so much imposing his
will on them like a dictator;

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.880
it is more like projecting
his feelings around him

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.730
so that they reach the last man
in the second violin section.

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:44.510
And when this happens, when 100
men share his feelings, exactly,

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:48.400
simultaneously, responding
as one to each rise and fall

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.800
of the music, to each point
of arrival and departure,

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:56.790
to each little pulse, then there
is a human identity of feeling

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:59.360
that has no equal elsewhere.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:03.180
It is the closest thing
I know to love itself.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:06.550
On this current of love the
conductor can communicate

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:10.180
at the deepest levels with
his players, and ultimately

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:14.020
with his audience," end quote.

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.660
Bernstein called this focus
on an identity of feeling

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:20.000
through empathy with the
music throughout his life.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.400
In outline, it is similar
to the erotic as theorized

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.240
by [inaudible] critic
Audre Lorde in her essay,

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.800
<i>Uses of the Erotic,
Erotic as Power </i>.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.050
"[Inaudible] the
erotic quote comes

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:34.060
from sharing deeply any
pursuit with another person.

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:37.000
The sharing of joy, whether
physical, emotional, psychic,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.980
or intellectual, forms a
bridge between the sharers."

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:44.680
Lord continues writing the
erotic is, quote, "the open

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:48.030
and fearless underlining
of my capacity for joy.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:52.640
In the way my body stretches to
music and opens into response,

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.900
hearkening to its deepest
rhythms, so every level upon

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.180
which I sense also opens

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:01.590
to the erotically satisfying
experience," end quote.

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:05.760
As Bernstein aged and became
increasingly comfortable

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:09.570
discussing his work and sex
and sexuality without fear

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.550
of approach, he made
it clear that, for him,

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:17.000
conducting was a kind of erotic
transfer of power and pleasure.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.370
Consider his words here.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:24.960
&gt;&gt; There's a kind of
closeness that can be developed

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.230
with members of an orchestra.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:35.220
It is a love affair in which you

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:42.190
and a body are breathing
together, closely together,

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:45.120
lifting and sinking together.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.970
And I'm not making this sound
too lurid or too sexual.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.460
It is, sort of, sexual.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.730
But it's with 100 people.

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.110
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan:
Bernstein is clearly being a bit

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:03.910
of a bad boy there at
the end of the quote,

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.280
but I think that
his understanding

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.280
of conducting is
earnest and honest and --

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.800
even if it's kind
of playful here.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.320
And if we take him seriously,
as I think we should,

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.500
I want to now refocus on
his body in performance

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.750
and see how it registers
these ideas.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:23.370
Now, an obvious place to go
would be to a performance

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:26.950
of the Mahler <i>Five
Adagietto </i>which we just heard

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:29.420
as underscore to
Bernstein's comments.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:33.290
Or perhaps to the final movement
of Mahler's <i>Ninth Symphony </i>,

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:36.150
or as any diehard
Mahler fan would suspect,

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:39.190
to the final movement
of Mahler's <i>Second </i>.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:40.640
And these are some photos

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.750
of Bernstein conducting
Mahler's <i>Second Symphony </i>.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.970
Looking at these
photos, we might remember

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:52.420
that when Bernstein learned

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.680
that Mahler's <i>Tenth
Symphony </i>had been edited

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.950
and completed the
performance, he said,

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:58.970
quote, "I have one question.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.450
Will it give me an orgasm"?

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:02.590
End quote.

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:04.710
Kind of a bad boy sometimes.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:07.260
Today, however, I want us first

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:11.540
to consider Bernstein's
conducting of Tchaikovsky.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:12.840
Bernstein programmed

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.230
and performed Tchaikovsky's
<i>Pathetique,</i>

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:16.710
<i>the Sixth Symphony</i>
with increasing relish

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.280
from the early 1970s on.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:23.000
In 1986, on tour, he
partnered it on programs

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.870
with his own <i>Serenade for
Solo Violin </i>after <i>Plato's</i>

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:27.270
<i>Symposium </i>.

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:31.500
Some critics noticed a newfound
drama and level of commitment

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.420
in Bernstein's conducting
of the <i>Pathetique </i>.

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:37.010
Others disagreed.

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.760
After conducting the
New York Philharmonic

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.700
at UCLAs Royce Hall,

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.600
critic Martin Bernheimer
described the Bernstein's body

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.800
as, quote, "Shrugging, jumping,
sighing, soaring, gushing,

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.560
crouching, rocking, rolling,
bounding, bobbing, leaping,

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.900
jiggling, stabbing,
hunching, bumping, grinding,

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.960
and grunting," end quote.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.400
Regarding the fire alarm

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.780
that interrupted Tchaikovsky's
Symphony, Bernheimer wrote,

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:03.790
quote, "A managerial
spokesperson refused

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:05.370
to confirm any connection

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.750
between the potential
conflagration

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:10.760
and the flamboyant
performance on the podium.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.150
Nevertheless, this
was an undeniably,

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:17.200
uniquely flamboyant
performance," unquote.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.050
Regarding Bernstein's
affect during the symphony,

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.420
Bernheimer wrote,
quote, "Emoting above

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.960
and beyond any call,
Bernstein acted out a series

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.190
of virtuosic charades.

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:30.050
He wiggled in moments
of agitation

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:31.350
as if he were auditioning

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:35.790
for the next Twyla Tharp
extravaganza," end quote.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:39.020
Bernheimer ends his review by
comparing the concert's end

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.140
with post-coital affect.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:45.840
Quote, "The Protagonist looked
picturesquely spent, ecstatic,

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:51.040
euphoric, wrung out as he basked
in the post climactic applause.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.360
He also acted as if he and his
symphonic cohorts had somehow

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:58.030
succeeded in scaling at
least three Mount Everest's.

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:00.720
The exquisite ardor of the
moment could be expressed only

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.510
in an ever increasing
orgy of hugs and kisses.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:06.360
I lift before the maestro
embraced the stagehands,"

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.590
end quote.

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:11.800
Bernheimer's depicture of
Bernstein as self-indulgent,

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:16.540
unnecessary, flamboyant,
over-emotional, and excessive

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:20.050
in bodily actions seems
to be motivated by more

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:21.350
than just the desire

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:24.000
to accurately cover
the performance.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.120
Not all critics agreed however.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.520
For example, take Tim Page of
the <i>New York Times </i>who wrote,

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.140
quote, "In the wrong hands,
Tchaikovsky can sound blatant

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.760
and vulgar, and listening

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.180
to his music can be a faintly
embarrassing experience,

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.890
like reading the intimate diary
of somebody you don't know.

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:43.190
There was nothing embarassing

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:46.200
about Mr. Bernstein's
<i>Pathetique </i>, although it was

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.510
as confessional

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:50.790
as any performance I have
ever heard," end quote.

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:55.120
The pathetic symphonist's
scores provided Bernstein an

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:58.610
opportunity to perform
professional climaxes galore.

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.580
Bernstein was particularly
convincing

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:04.290
when embodying late 19th century
sequences such as the one

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:06.150
at Rehearsal O in
the first movement

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:08.800
of Tchaikovsky's
<i>Fourth Symphony </i>.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.870
In this clip, from the first
every <i>Young People's Concert</i>

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:15.210
Min 1958, "What Does
Music Mean?"

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:18.440
note the way that
Bernstein's whole body lands

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.080
on the beginning
of each iteration

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.800
of the sequenced motive.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.110
Each time he says the word
"want" with an increasing sense

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:28.900
of attack and bigger bounce
back, as if charged by the rise

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:33.040
of the sequence, so much so
that by the last three wants,

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:37.460
he is throwing his head back
as if in convulsions of desire.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:41.080
This will make more sense
as you watch the clip.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.910
&gt;&gt; Okay, by saying
that it has the feeling

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:47.290
of wanting something very
badly that you can't have.

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:49.870
Did you ever feel that
you wanted something more

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:52.840
than anything else in the
world, and you said so,

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.530
and they said no,
you can't have it.

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:56.170
And you said, again, I want it.

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:59.010
And, again, they said no,
and again you said louder and

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:03.220
and more excited, I want it,
and again, louder, I want it,

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:06.380
until it seemed that something
would break in your head

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:10.360
and there's nothing
left to do but cry.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.450
Well, that's like this music.

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.250
Listen.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:45.040
[ Music ]

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.510
Finally something breaks
in your head and --

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:52.040
[ Music ]

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.340
-- and you cry.

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:57.690
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan: Now

00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:59.030
that we have seen Bernstein
demonstrate his idea

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:01.740
of this music and the
charmed smile it elicited

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:05.290
from one young viewer in the
audience, let's compare it

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:08.560
to a filmed live
performance 12 years later.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.350
Here, I want you to know
the same increased attacks

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:13.560
and the final throwbacks
of his head.

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.690
But also three other
things that occur

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:18.110
across Bernstein's
conducting on the podium.

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:22.230
First, the tiny look of ecstasy
signified by the open mouth

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:25.580
and the slump of the body at
the beginning of the sequence.

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.930
Two, Bernstein's use of
two hands on the baton

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:31.370
as he nears the climax
of the phrase.

00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:34.190
And, three, the famous
Bernstein leap.

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:37.220
He gets airtime off of
the podium at the arrival

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:40.510
of the interrupting
stormy motive.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:48:43.790
[ Music ]

00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:46.010
Now that we've seen
three common features

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:49.240
in Bernstein's movement
vocabulary, and also the kind

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:52.910
of sense of his face
registering the music on it,

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:55.620
you might even say that
Bernstein faces the music,

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:57.570
meaning not that just he's
conducting the orchestra,

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:00.840
but he's also reflecting
the music on his face,

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.900
we can now turn to
something else.

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:04.770
Presumably this is something

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:07.950
that only [inaudible] orchestra
could see that's presumably not

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:11.210
for the audience even though he
knew he was being filmed here.

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:14.740
As bassist Orin O'Brien, who
was the first female member

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:18.260
of the New York Philharmonic who
was not a harpist, as she noted

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:21.410
about watching Bernstein
both from the auditorium

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:25.720
and the stage, she wrote, quote,
"From the audience as an usher

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.400
at Carnegie, I found it
difficult to take some

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:31.980
of Bernstein's gyrations and
dancing around the podium.

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.510
Upon joining the orchestra as
a bassist in 1966, however,"

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:37.920
she realized "his
movements weren't put

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.010
on for the audience's benefit.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:44.110
He was simply living music
that he believed in so deeply."

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:46.600
In my remaining time with you,

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.500
I want us to consider
a few moments

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:52.660
where Bernstein's conducting
is clearly a set choreography,

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:55.440
one that repeats across years.

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.570
First, I'd like us to
consider the end of part one,

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:02.110
"The Dance of the Earth," from
Stravinsky's <i>Rite of Spring </i>.

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:04.900
I'd like to draw your
attention to the three levels

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.020
of Bernstein's forward jabs.

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.730
You'll notice him doing this.

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:11.280
And then, the very, very
dramatic kind of pause.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:14.910
He's frozen at the very,
very end of part one.

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:18.510
So let's watch this from 1966.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:36.210
[ Music ]

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:42.510
And now, six years later,
in 1972, the same passage.

00:50:42.510 --> 00:51:00.380
[ Music ]

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:04.400
This is a very clear, I hope,

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.250
example of how exactly
the movement repeats.

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:10.560
And this happens
again in my next

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.050
and what will be
my final example.

00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:15.660
Bernstein might leave us
almost fairly breathless

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.490
as we watch him conduct.

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:22.420
Bernstein himself also found
himself increasingly breathless.

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:25.740
At Alan J. Warner's memorial
service in New York City,

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:28.030
a bunch of Bernstein fans
knew he would be there.

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:31.580
And they gathered and they held
up signs saying, "We love you.

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.890
Please stop smoking."

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:37.880
And Bernstein, at the end
of his life, wrote, quote,

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.660
"The great thing about
conducting is you don't smoke

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:44.380
and you breathe in great
gobs of oxygen," end quote.

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:48.870
This seems kind of funny and
cute, but in August 1990,

00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:51.850
Bernstein was to conduct the
Koussevitzky Memorial Concert

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:55.030
at Tanglewood with the
Boston Symphony Orchestra.

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:58.230
Because his emphysema
was kind of progressing,

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:00.420
they had to actually
line up oxygen tanks

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:02.470
and bring them backstage.

00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:05.420
He was supposed to conduct
everything on the program.

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:09.380
But because he was very, very
ill, Carl St. Clair had to step

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.570
in and conduct Bernstein's
arias and barcarolles

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:16.540
which had just been
orchestrated by Bright Sheng.

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:20.960
When you read reviews
of this final concert,

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:24.680
newspaper writers all
kind of focus on the fact

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.350
that Bernstein was
very clearly ill.

00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:30.140
Several of them mentioned his
coughing fit in the middle

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:31.440
of the third movement

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.100
of the <i>Seventh Symphony</i>
which would be the last work

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:35.970
that he would ever conduct.

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:38.840
Having read these stories
and also the biographies

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.960
if Bernstein, especially the
great Humphrey Bearden biography

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:45.650
and Tim Page's Concert Review,
and having not yet seen the film

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:48.490
that I will shortly show
you, I was incredulous

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:51.430
when my colleague at Boston
College, Sandra Hebert,

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:53.880
who was studying piano at
Tanglewood that summer,

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:58.010
insisted to me that Bernstein
performed his signature leap

00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:01.250
at some point during
the <i>Seventh Symphony </i>.

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:03.260
And I said, you know,
Sandy, that's not possible.

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.610
He was coughing,
he's conducting.

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:08.080
You were just imagining
the great Bernstein,

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.190
which didn't square
with everything.

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:13.730
Furthermore, I had
heard the 1990 concert

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:16.130
on commercial recording
multiple times.

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:18.790
It's a recording that I love.

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:23.390
And hearing it, I didn't
believe that Bernstein --

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:24.820
the tempo was slower --

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:28.130
would have jumped in his
final conducting appearance.

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:32.600
The concert was very,
very special in 1990.

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:36.350
It marked 50 years since his
first professional appearance

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:38.180
at Tanglewood in 1940.

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:40.750
He conducts Britain's
[inaudible]

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:43.550
"Britain's Four Sea Interludes"
from <i>Peter Grimes </i>.

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:45.470
This is very important as well

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:47.450
because Bernstein
conducted the premier

00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:50.520
of <i>Peter Grimes </i>in
the U.S. at Tanglewood.

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.790
And he also -- the final
work on the program

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:56.560
that he conducted was --
he conducted Bernstein's --

00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:59.140
Beethoven's <i>Seventh Symphony </i>.

00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:01.890
Beethoven's <i>Seventh </i>is
one of the two scores

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:03.990
that Bernstein had to
prepare for his audition

00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:07.900
with Fritz Reiner at the
Curtis Institute in 1939.

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:10.230
It was also Beethoven's
<i>Seventh </i>programmed

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:13.520
for his first concert
as a Music Director

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.540
of the New York Philharmonic
in 1958.

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:18.710
It's a very -- a work
that's very, very near

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:20.490
and dear to Bernstein.

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:23.910
I'm going to show you
two sets of two clips.

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:26.530
The first will come from a
filmed performance of Bernstein

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:29.480
with the Vienna Philharmonic
in 1978.

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.670
And this is from the beginning
of the fourth movement

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:34.000
of Beethoven's <i>Seventh
Symphony </i>.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.030
I want you to notice the nearly
identical movements in this clip

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:39.980
and in the following clip.

00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:42.240
And this suggests that
Bernstein was really thinking

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.040
of conducting as a
kind of choreography,

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.160
or at least performing
it that way.

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:49.700
You'll notice that there's a lot
of elbow pumping that he does.

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:53.360
It's kind of like a dance in the
countryside imagined by someone

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.660
who lives in the city.

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:57.090
That sounds odd, but
I'll just show you

00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:59.510
and I think you'll see
what I see pretty quickly.

00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:33.480
at Bernstein's final
appearance at Tanglewood.

00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:57.020
You can see the same
gestures here.

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.280
And I think that's pretty clear.

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.870
And then for my final
example of the talk

00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:04.930
and of the evening tonight,
this is Bernstein's own score

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:07.670
of Beethoven <i>Seven </i>which
the New York Philharmonic has

00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:11.230
digitized and put online
at the wonderful archives.

00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:13.940
I wanted to use this
final passage

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:16.020
of descending 16th notes.

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:18.620
We're going to watch
Bernstein conduct it again

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:23.590
with the Vienna Philharmonic
in 1978 and you'll notice that,

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:25.830
again, that there's
this kind of wind-up,

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:29.700
a kind of pitch forward, a pitch
up and down, and then it ends.

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:32.510
And you'll just see
this right here.

And so again that same
wind-up and then the kind

00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:01.000
of punch forward,
the up and down.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.510

final conducting at Tanglewood.

Though physically exhausted,
and less than two months away

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.410
from his death on
October 14, 1990,

00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:47.180
Bernstein conducted Beethoven's
<i>Seventh Symphony </i>that

00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.380
afternoon with the
same choreography

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.750
that he had been
using for decades.

00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:53.780
Like the dancers with
whom he had personal

00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:56.640
and professional relationships
throughout his career,

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.060
like any musician,
Bernstein relied

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:01.680
on muscle memory he
had long internalized

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.790
after numerous performances.

00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:07.070
Quote, "We are in a profound

00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:11.150
and virtually inescapable
sense prisoners of our bodies,"

00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:15.290
notes Gunter Schuller in his
book, <i>The Complete Conductor </i>.

00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:17.870
Prisoners seems a bit strong.

00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:21.900
If we take that out, it sounds
less bleak and more obvious.

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:23.200
"We are in a profound

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.110
and virtually inescapable
sense, our bodies."

00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:30.600
Is the actions our bodies
perform the constant iterations

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:34.630
that come to identify us
as musicians and otherwise?

00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:38.090
Then I suggest it is time
we fully acknowledge.

00:58:38.090 --> 00:58:41.730
In Bernstein's final
performance, the vast majority

00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:43.770
of the audience didn't recognize

00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:46.360
that he was repeating the
choreography long stored

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:49.740
in his muscle memory, a
choreography predicated

00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:52.260
on kinesthetic empathy
with a series of notes

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:54.300
that has been dubbed
"The Apotheosis

00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:56.730
of the Dance" by Wagner.

00:58:56.730 --> 00:59:00.230
Many in the shot at Tanglewood
even missed his small jump

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:04.130
at the beginning of the fourth
movement, but it was there.

00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:07.560
The podium was still a dancing
place that Sunday afternoon.

00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:11.180
But Bernstein's body took
up slightly less of it.

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:13.910
The podium also remained
a kind of safe space,

00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:17.180
the place where Bernstein
could move shamelessly

00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:20.940
in no small part because he
could temporarily forget many

00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:25.410
of his other identities, even if
others could not, and focus only

00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:27.910
on the music that
he sought to become.

00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:31.230
As the musical community
celebrates Bernstein's 100th

00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:35.050
anniversary in 2018, we might
also fully appreciate his

00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:38.100
conducting as both
carefully choreographed

00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:40.730
and instructively shameless.

I believe we now have
time for questions.

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.400
There's a microphone
at the back.

the microphone before asking

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.600
a question.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:08.190
And if you could kindly identify
yourself for the microphone,

01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:09.490
that would be appreciated.

01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:12.350
I live here in Washington.

01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:21.210
My question is, with all of this
energy and dance skill, did --

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:23.840
that he demonstrated with
music, did he demonstrate

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.850
that in other parts of his life?

01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:28.000
Did he literally like
to go out dancing?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.890
Did you see it in, you know,
his leisure time, sports,

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:33.390
anything else like that?

01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:34.690
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan:
You know, there's --

01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:36.010
if you look through the
photograph-like record

01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:38.180
of Bernstein both here at
the Library of Congress,

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.990
at other archives, if you
plug in a Google Search,

01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:42.880
you can see him that
he's a -- he has --

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.590
seemed to have had
a lot of energy.

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:47.460
People always say,
oh, I'm too busy.

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.280
You know, I'm really,
really busy.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.110
Bernstein was really, really,

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:54.550
really busy in the 1940s
and across his life.

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:56.450
And, yes, you see
photos of him swimming,

01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:59.660
running around with the kids
and the dog in the backyard.

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:04.130
There does seem to
be a lot of energy.

01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:07.130
I probably need more
film footage about him

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:09.450
on the dance floor, like
a bar mitzvah or a wedding

01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:12.990
or something to give you my full
kind of appraisal of his dancing

01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:14.290
and social situations.

01:01:14.290 --> 01:01:15.590
But I wouldn't be surprised

01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:18.080
if there was quite
a bit of it, yes.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.980
&gt;&gt; So as a non-musicologist,
have a very basic question.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.890
I'm sold on everything
you've said.

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.190
I think it's terrific talk.

01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:29.300
And I love the way it hangs
together and everything.

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:34.830
Can you help me understand
how other conductors --

01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:36.300
because it seems to
me, it would seem

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:38.530
that muscle memory would
work for everybody.

01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:39.890
So why didn't it
work for others.

01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:41.190
What were they responding

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:42.560
to at the time what they
were responding, you know,

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:43.860
10 years apart, or why would

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.160
that be different
than what he did?

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.460
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan:
Good question.

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.780
So I don't mean to imply
or sell as you say.

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.630
I'm a musicologist,
but you are not.

01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:51.930
I make no money.

01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:53.880
I make a little bit,
but not enough.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.370
So I didn't mean
to imply or to sell

01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:58.840
that other conductors
weren't doing this.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.350
Yes. I think I even say that,
you know, like any musician

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:03.190
in the final paragraph
of my talk,

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:05.470
Bernstein relied
on muscle memory.

01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:10.670
However, there's this thing that
happens, both with conductors

01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:14.190
and when we see people who maybe
do things with their bodies,

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:18.760
a certain dance move, whatever,
that are kind of more out there,

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.980
that are not, that we're not
used to, where we begin to talk

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:25.360
about the music, the movement,
in this case conducting,

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:31.950
as if it is disordered or
random or kind of outrageous.

01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:35.750
My point here is that for all
of the talk of Bernstein's kind

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:40.150
of flamboyance and largeness,
there is a consistency,

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:43.000
one that we could kind
of expect, I think,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.090
from most musicians who
have to get on stage

01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:49.300
and give a performance
in front of an audience.

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.820
There are some conductors
who do seem --

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:54.790
I mean, of course there's many,
many styles of conducting.

01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:57.030
There are some who
seem to kind of mix it

01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:58.920
up from performance
to performance.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:01.670
I gave the example
of Andris Nelsons

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:06.250
at the Boston Symphony Orchestra
because my first month in Boston

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:10.380
or second month in Boston in
2014 I took a bunch of students

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.840
over three different
nights to see him conduct.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:16.210
And I was shocked at how
different the conducting was

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:19.590
when he put his right arm back
on the podium, when he went

01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:22.330
up onto the balls of his feet,
when he would do this kind of --

01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:25.310
he does this kind of
left-hand wave sometime.

01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:28.850
And for someone who thinks
about people dancing and moving

01:03:28.850 --> 01:03:32.110
around a lot, that kind
of stuck out to me.

01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:35.650
And it was only then that
I began to think, wow,

01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:38.820
for all of Bernstein's supposed
kind of craziness and dancing

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:41.760
around on the podium, he's
actually pretty darn consistent.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.480
So that's kind of the
larger point and the context

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.680
for why I'm kind of saying.

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.860
It's also a great
excuse to watch a lot

01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:51.590
of Bernstein clips
over and over again.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.340

I live here in Washington.

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:01.350
Perhaps an obvious question,
but, yeah, very interesting.

01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:05.130
You talk about how -- about
Bernstein's consistency.

01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:08.760
This was also, would you say,
instinctive, unconscious?

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:11.650
I mean, if he were here now,
would he say to us, oh, yeah,

01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:13.250
I planned it that
way, or would --

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:16.550
or you think he'd be surprised
at what you had found?

01:04:16.550 --> 01:04:18.470
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan: While
I've done a lot of research,

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:20.850
I feel no way able to speak

01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:23.410
for Leonard Bernstein
or what he thought.

01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:25.730
I think that there,
there is a --

01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:27.430
for a lot of people
there's a thing.

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:32.380
For example, the way you speak,
the way you move in general,

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:36.020
where you do certain things
kind of over and over again,

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.640
and you just get used to it.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.230
And you maybe don't
even think about it.

01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:43.420
In my hide, you know,
my voice sounds kind

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:47.420
of very specific and,
you know, deep and rich,

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.160
and then I hear a
recording of myself and I'm

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.610
like that's not what
my voice sounds like.

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:51.910
And I'm not thinking.

01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:53.390
I'm not trying to sound
the way that I do.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:54.690
It just is.

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.680
So I'm going to guess,
if I had to guess,

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:00.480
I would say that it's probably
partly just a matter of practice

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.470
and having run through
a score so many times.

01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:05.720
So that's like many
things in life --

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.500
partly kind of done on
purpose and cultivated

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:12.380
and probably learned, and
partly in a way natural

01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:14.890
or instinctive is the
word that you just used.

01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:17.470
&gt;&gt; And last question, have
you been in touch, by chance,

01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:19.820
with any of his children
and presented this research

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:21.120
and gotten their reaction?

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.420
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan: Right.

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.930
So Jamie Bernstein,
Bernstein's daughter,

01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:26.410
who has a book coming out, or
just out right now, I believe.

01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:27.710
&gt;&gt; Coming out in June.

01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:29.010
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan:
Coming out in June.

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:31.930
I met her this past
February in Colorado Springs,

01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:34.540
Colorado because
she, like her dad.

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:37.850
Is kind of in demand,
especially this year.

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:39.560
She had to leave the
morning of my talk,

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:43.330
but that night before the talk
I went over the talk with her.

01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:46.570
I discussed it with her over
the a drink in the hotel lobby,

01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:48.610
and I kind of focused
on this idea

01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:50.330
of Bernstein's muscle memory.

01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:52.540
And I said, you know,
it seems like, you know,

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:54.430
you dad would do a lot
of certain things over

01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:57.490
and over again, and people
don't really kind of realize

01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:58.790
that or give them credit.

01:05:58.790 --> 01:06:00.960
And I say that partly because
I didn't really realize that,

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.900
until I sat down and watched
the videos over and over again.

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:08.340
And she said, that's the
exact same phrase that I use

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.820
when I talk about my
dad, muscle memory.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.920
So, but, yes, I have met Jamie.

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.950
I've heard from Roger Englander

01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:18.550
who was Bernstein's longtime
producer whom I did a series

01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:22.080
of interviews with, an oral
history with, back in 2011.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:25.090
That -- his son Alex is kind of
wonderful, so I do look forward

01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:28.980
to meeting more of the
family as time goes on.

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.280
&gt;&gt; Kwon Kwon.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.580
I'm a local resident.

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:33.210
I've got two questions.

01:06:33.210 --> 01:06:35.870
You mentioned something
about three levels

01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:41.010
when Bernstein was conducting
"Dances of the Earth",

01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:42.670
Stravinsky's <i>Rite of Spring </i>.

01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:44.370
Could you repeat those three --

01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:45.670
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan:
Oh, right.

01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:47.580
So there's -- both here
and in the day [inaudible],

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:49.130
I tried to pick examples
[finger-snap]

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:51.790
that you could kind of
very, very quickly grasp.

01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:54.710
I know that many of you
have not seen these videos.

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:57.420
None of you have seen
them the 1990 film

01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.190
of the final performance.

01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:01.870
And you probably haven't
been in front of the mirror

01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:05.070
in your bedroom repeating what
Bernstein does, like I do.

01:07:05.070 --> 01:07:08.940
So there's a kind of thing in
both of these where the kind

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.880
of place where you kind of
-- when he's conducting,

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:14.270
he goes here, he goes down,
he goes up, and the kind

01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:18.010
of specificity with which this
happens in both of these clips,

01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:20.220
you see it again
in the Beethoven.

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:22.840
It's the exact same sequence.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.860
An audience member in Colorado
Springs who was extremely lovely

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:28.440
and who I've been emailing with,

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.680
suggested that I might
consider having the two clips

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:35.190
side-by-side and
slowing down one of them.

01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:37.770
I've done various work
with video editing,

01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:41.710
taking kind of silent film of
modern dancers who were dancing

01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:43.400
to a record, and
then synchronized it.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.320
She suggested I should do
a split screen because --

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.060
especially to see the
time kind of winding

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:49.360
down on the clock over here.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.420
We're at 8:11 p.m. I kind
of rushed through the end

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:52.720
of the talk a little bit.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.020
My apologies.

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:55.980
But, so yeah, there's this --
there's a very kind of clear --

01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:57.600
the kind of spots
that he's hitting

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:00.770
and what a dance analyst
would call his kinosphere.

01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:03.220
If you imagine like
the DaVinci circle.

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:04.750
He goes to the same spots.

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:07.300
And this is, you know,
over a decade later.

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:09.440
So I hope that answers
your first question.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:15.830
&gt;&gt; Second question is, since
he had his own choreography,

01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:17.520
could he have choreographed
something

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.340
like <i>West Side Story </i>?

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.640
No [laughter].

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:25.040
No. Because I could feel Jerome
Robbins in the grave doing

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.170
like you better say no quickly
[laughter], and put a box

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:31.080
around my name as it
is in the contract.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.220
No. He couldn't.

01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:40.280
However, I would guess Ben Stein
was intimate with, you know,

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.940
in working offstage
with many, many dancers.

01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:45.440
Robbins especially.

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.230
You see these great
photos of Bernstein

01:08:48.230 --> 01:08:52.210
at the piano trying things
out of <i>West Side Story </i>.

01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:53.510
And Robbins is literally --

01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:56.000
has his hands on his
shoulders touching him.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.290
Dancers tend to be very,
very touchy people, you know?

01:08:59.290 --> 01:09:00.940
You're sitting around
one moment.

01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:02.610
[Inaudible] your dancer
is braiding their hair,

01:09:02.610 --> 01:09:03.910
giving massages.

01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:05.950
I think that Bernstein
was very, very comfortable

01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:07.430
in this world because
he had to be.

01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:11.100
He was working with
dancers a lot in the 1940s.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:13.810
Do I think that being
around dancers a lot --

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:16.070
I mean, I hand out with
the dancers sometimes.

01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:17.480
Does that mean that
I can choreograph

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.780
like a Morris Cunningham?

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.180
Absolutely not.

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:23.810
So that's my best guess on that.

01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:27.330
&gt;&gt; Merin Alsop frequently refers

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:29.140
to his experiences
with Bernstein.

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:30.850
I wonder if you've
ever had a chance

01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:33.490
to compare notes with her and --

01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:35.260
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan:
That's an excellent question.

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:38.080
I'm so busy kind of
teaching and writing the book

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.690
that I'm currently
writing that I haven't.

01:09:39.690 --> 01:09:43.970
But if you look at the recently
-- or not [inaudible] anymore.

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:47.430
The Bernstein, the last
interview with Jonathan Cott.

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:51.730
There's this wonderful
passage where Bernstein talks

01:09:51.730 --> 01:09:54.920
about Merin Alsop and
says that you really have

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.490
to look out for this one.

01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:58.280
She's going to kick some ass.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:02.150
And so -- and you also see Alsop
in her own promotional materials

01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:05.120
for Baltimore kind of
promoting how active she is.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.230
You see her in [inaudible]
of the podium

01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:10.390
but they had a video camera
follow her into the gym,

01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:13.680
and you see Marin on the
treadmill kind of going because,

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.620
as she says, conducting
his a highly physical art.

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:18.920
It's many things.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.530
It's also promotional
and dealing stoners

01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:23.730
and programming with
the orchestra.

01:10:23.730 --> 01:10:28.110
But it is ultimately a
body moving around trying

01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:31.400
to create a certain
sound from a 100

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.720
or so people in front of you.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.410
So I would relish
the opportunity

01:10:34.410 --> 01:10:36.460
to interview Marin Alsop.

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:40.440
Marin, if you're watching on
YouTube, please contact me.

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:41.740
So, yeah. Thank you.

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:43.040
Very great question.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.140
&gt;&gt; A couple of comments
and a question.

01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:50.240
My first time to Tanglewood in
1972 was Bernstein conducting.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.370
I have no recollection of what.

01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:54.770
I just remember it was lovely.

01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:56.070
It was magical.

01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:57.840
And then I lived in
Boston for a long time

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.870
and it was [inaudible]
and the whole thing.

01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:02.190
And just two weeks ago I went to
the Ken-Cen for the [inaudible]

01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:05.870
and the L.A. Phil,
and I watched him

01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:10.120
and I guess the Philharmonic
was great, but I don't remember.

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.260
I watched him and his hair flew

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:13.610
and his tails flew,
his baton flew.

01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:16.410
He jumped several times
and I was in love.

01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:20.230
My question is, when you were
here for your three weeks

01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:24.160
and since then with the
material that you've researched

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:28.170
at the Library of Congress,
was there any great, wonderful,

01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:31.110
magical moment of
something that you found

01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:33.300
that you didn't know before?

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.300
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan:
Yes, a lot.

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:36.600
Yeah, a lot.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.900
How much time do we have?

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:42.950
I mean there -- you know, at
the beginning of the talk,

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:46.090
Susan Vita, Chief Librarian,
said that there are, you know,

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:49.420
over 400,000 items
in the collection.

01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:53.220
This is a archivist's -- I
worked in an archive in college.

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:56.950
One of my first kind of gigs
was being an Archival Assistant

01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:59.220
at the Arnold Schoenberg
Center when I was younger.

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:01.780
Archivists often speak
of the linear feet

01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:04.160
when they describe a collection.

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:06.870
And it's only a small
exaggeration to say

01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:09.990
that Bernstein's would
circle the globe twice here

01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:11.290
at the Library.

01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:14.270
The personal letters
were amazing

01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:19.170
because we have this very, very
kind of polished presentation.

01:12:19.170 --> 01:12:21.470
This is someone who really
knows how to work a stage,

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:24.500
who knows how to work a
camera, which I do not.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:29.160
And, you know, seeing him talk
kind of freely with people --

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.090
that was really, really amazing.

01:12:31.090 --> 01:12:34.680
Seeing the archival
video that I got

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.240
from the wonderful Bridget Carr

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.870
at the Boston Symphony
Orchestra Archives.

01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:42.650
That was a real aha moment.

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:43.950
I knew that there was video.

01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:45.540
I knew it existed.

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:48.210
And it kind of confirmed
in a really,

01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:50.360
really beautiful, poignant way.

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:55.180
I mean, when I first saw that
video I was sobbing, basically.

01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:58.650
And then I realized this
is actually wonderful.

01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:01.840
I mean this is -- even at
the very, very end, you know,

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:04.900
kind of, you know, dealing
with his own, you know,

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:07.150
physical fitness at that time.

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:09.600
Ben Stein is like still
on it, and is still doing

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.900
that same choreography.

01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:13.660
So I think, yes, the first --

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:15.820
you know, when I was here
looking at all those letters,

01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:19.010
that was very, very
overwhelming and kind of aha.

01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:22.710
And then a few years
ago, now, in the basement

01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:25.060
of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, at the lower level,

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:27.490
their archives, seeing that
film for the first time.

01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:35.350
Those were both kind of bookend
archival aha moments for me.

01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:37.440
&gt;&gt; Hi. Susan Garfinkel.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.740
I work here at the Library.

01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:40.250
I guess a comment
and a question.

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:43.600
And I'll follow up and say that
-- like the last questioner,

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:47.950
I also went to Tanglewood in the
'70s as a child with my family.

01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:54.440
And just [inaudible] like Marin
Alsop except that I did not go

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.670
onto become a wonderful
conductor.

01:13:56.670 --> 01:13:59.300
I dreamed of becoming
a conductor

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:01.070
because of Leonard Bernstein.

01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:04.320
And what's probably relevant
to you is, as a, you know,

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.800
a student who was studying
music, but was no, you know,

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:11.050
genius or anything, his
conducting made perfect sense

01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:13.800
to me and without
knowing anything about any

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:17.350
of this critical
discourse about it.

01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:21.080
It didn't -- it never occurred
to me that it didn't make sense

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.370
or that it wasn't
related to the music.

01:14:23.370 --> 01:14:25.420
It helped me understand
the music

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:27.990
to watch him conduct the same
symphonies that I was playing

01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:30.140
at summer camp or
in high school.

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:33.300
My question is, since you
started your talk mentioning

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:36.890
that he was often criticized for
doing too many different things

01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:39.690
or trying to do too
many different things,

01:14:39.690 --> 01:14:41.670
and I don't want to put
you on the spot too much,

01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:45.110
but do you have an assessment
of how successful he was

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:48.370
as a conductor compared
-- I say that --

01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:50.160
I think of him as
a conductor first

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.990
because that's how
I encountered him.

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:54.560
What is your sense of his
conducting in relation

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.810
to his other activities,
his television,

01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:59.190
and his composing, and all that?

01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:00.490
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan:
I can only answer --

01:15:00.490 --> 01:15:02.190
I mean, this is not
my musicological

01:15:02.190 --> 01:15:03.490
expertise speaking.

01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:06.850
This is just me as
Daniel speaking.

01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:11.340
For me, the -- it's hard
to separate all the things.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.780
Number one, number two.

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.870
It -- since -- if like you
just put me on the spot,

01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:20.350
if I had to pick which do
I think he kind of excelled

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:22.840
at more between conducting
and composing,

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.620
I would say conducting,
and I would say that partly

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:29.500
because it was what he was doing
[inaudible] so much of his time.

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:33.020
The man had to take a
sabbatical from conducting

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:35.270
because he was conducting
too much, and he wanted

01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:36.570
to compose some stuff.

01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:38.350
He had to say, New
York Philharmonic,

01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:39.650
see you later like in a year.

01:15:39.650 --> 01:15:41.730
I need to -- I need some
time to do other things.

01:15:41.730 --> 01:15:46.710
I think because, just hours
per day, so much of it was --

01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:49.470
more of it was conducting
than composing.

01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:53.290
I would say that that in some
ways he probably saw his own

01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:54.880
achievement as a
conductor rise more.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.060
Of course there's tons of
stories about Bernstein feeling

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:01.940
like he did not live up to these
kind of impossible standards

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:05.560
that he set for himself
about composition, you know.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:09.530
He wondered why are more people
not listening to my symphonies?

01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:12.940
Why do more people not know
the "Serenade for Solo Violin?"

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:16.100
You know, everybody
knows <i>West Side Story </i>,

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:18.970
and which is how
I first, you know,

01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:21.120
came across Leonard
Bernstein as a child when --

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:24.090
before I was imitating him
conducting in the mirror

01:16:24.090 --> 01:16:27.600
as an adult, as a child, I would
imitate the sharks on the street

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.610
with that beautiful low
shot on the Lego Lift.

01:16:29.610 --> 01:16:33.650
So I guess partly because
he was -- he just had --

01:16:33.650 --> 01:16:38.130
he was giving it more,
I would say, conducting.

01:16:38.130 --> 01:16:40.120
That was a very long answer.

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.020
I don't -- it's like
picking, you know,

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:43.360
your favorite child
or something.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.810
You don't want to do that.

01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:48.210
But I would say conducting
I guess.

01:16:48.210 --> 01:16:49.530
&gt;&gt; I'm Steve [inaudible].

01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:54.510
The examples you gave were a --

01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:59.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.340
-- that there are differences

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:03.860
in the way you approached
[inaudible].

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:05.160
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan:
Very, very good question.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.800
And one that I have not
actually have had that known

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.290
or has actually asked me before.

01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:11.270
I haven't -- to be very honest,

01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:14.740
I haven't compared
enough repeat performance

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:17.110
of him conducting
the same things.

01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:19.850
There is, of course,
a lot of footage

01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:21.530
of Bernstein conducting
his own work.

01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:23.240
For example, the recording

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:25.450
of <i>West Side Story</i>
with Carreras.

01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:28.500
There's that horrible
scene where he has

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:31.140
to keep conducting the same
passage over and over again.

01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:33.680
I would not be able
to use that to judge.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.120
A very painful scene
to watch in some ways.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.660
So I guess my short answer is
that's a very good question.

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:42.010
And I will get back to
you if you email me.

01:17:42.010 --> 01:17:47.510
And I kind of go through
my file and think about it.

01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:52.400
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:57.510
-- and I live in Washington,
D.C. And I think of Bernstein --

01:17:57.510 --> 01:18:04.060
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:05.360
All right.

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:08.080
My question is, was he
more staid, more reserved

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:16.380
in conducting high or -- would
something such as the "Surprise"

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:19.710
in the <i>94th Symphony</i>
have surely caused him

01:18:19.710 --> 01:18:21.980
to execute the Bernstein Leap.

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.280
&gt;&gt; Daniel M. Callahan: Right.

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:27.290
I would say that if you compare
his conducting -- this is --

01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:29.680
I did kind of maybe
cheat a little bit

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:31.700
by taking a late
19th century work

01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.160
and an early 20th century work,

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.420
both of which are
very loud and big.

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:38.260
I would say that if you
look at his conducting

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:42.300
of classical composers
-- Mozart, Haydn --

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.560
that actually I don't --

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:49.340
it's not necessarily as a
whole more reserved, actually.

01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:54.860
Obviously you don't have the
reason to do things like you do

01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:56.840
at the conclusion of the
"Dance of the Earth" at the end

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.140
of Part One of the
<i>Rite of Spring </i>.

01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:00.660
If you conducted
Haydn like that,

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:02.430
there might be a slight mismatch

01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:04.420
or you would get a very
interesting sounding Haydn.

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:05.720
I don't know.

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:09.530
But in terms of the kind of
engagement and the full use

01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:11.900
of the body, I would
say that kind

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:14.250
of occurs throughout the rep.

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:17.250
Yes. So, yeah.

01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:19.820
Does that answer your question?

01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:21.120
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.420

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.600

our speaker one last time.
