JANET RANKIN: A
general comment is by

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.430
and large, I thought you
guys did a great job.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.310
Your learning outcomes
were for the most part

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.950
specific, measurable,
and realistic.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.310
The biggest problem I think
I had was with-- the biggest

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.650
problem that you
had on average was

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.390
the idea of the
learning outcomes

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.620
really have to be measurable.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.580
So if you use a word
like appreciate,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.710
it's not measurable.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.740
So that's something to remember.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.037
If you use words like discuss,
it's potentially measurable.

00:00:57.037 --> 00:00:59.620
But you need to make sure that
you set up a venue for students

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.120
to discuss.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.252
You can't just say you'll be
able to discuss that and assume

00:01:04.252 --> 00:01:05.710
that they'll be
able to discuss it,

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.376
That If that's in
your learning outcome,

00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:09.850
you have to set up some
venue for them to discuss

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.570
and you to know what
they're discussing.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.520
And then the two biggest
things that come up,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.490
or the two most problematic
words that come up--

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.040
and I compliment you all,
because you did a great job.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.740
Nobody used understand.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.780
So that was awesome.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.550
But the other
thing, there's words

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.190
like explain and describe,
which are perfectly good words

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.490
to use in a learning outcome.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.370
But you have to make
sure that when you say,

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:44.950
students will explain
the ideal gas law.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.440
They'll be able to
explain the ideal gas law.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.010
Well do you know that
they're really explaining it

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.740
in the true sense of that
word that they actually

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.700
internalized what it means, and
they're really explaining it?

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.190
Or are they just spitting it
back, spitting back, maybe,

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.990
what they read in a
book, a definition

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.160
that they read in the book?

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.810
So you have to make
sure that you've

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.830
set up a situation wherein
they really are explaining.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.460
And they're not
just remembering.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.810
So it's a great word to use.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.310
But you have to
make sure that we're

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.280
using in the right context.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.350
Same thing for describe.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.840
You can imagine that
has the same issues.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.460
Describe da, da da, da, da.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.477
Well are you sure they're
doing the describing?

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.810
Or are they just remembering
somebody else's description

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.520
and writing it down?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.070
One good way around
that is to tweak

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.780
the parameters a little bit.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.170
To say, in a world where
there is no oxygen,

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.480
what do you expect this
organism to look like,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.660
given that it has to run
really fast or something?

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.360
So come up with
alternate realities

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.840
that that actually force
students to transfer and then

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.130
re-explain.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.090
That can be helpful.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.830
That can be really,
really helpful.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.140
I remember once in
a kinetics class,

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.990
we had been deriving
the critical nucleus

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.130
size for growth.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.970
And it's all based on a
radius, a critical radius.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.954
And then on the exam,
the guy said OK,

00:03:05.954 --> 00:03:07.120
they don't grow as sphere's.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.676
They grow as rectangular boxes.

00:03:11.676 --> 00:03:13.300
So then all of a
sudden, we had to look

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.190
at the ratio of the length
to the height of the box

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.880
or something.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.010
So that really wasn't
just we were just

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.920
remembering a solution
or remembering a method.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.270
We had to actually think
about what it meant

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.930
and then reapply it.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.820
So just think about how
you can get students

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.810
to really describe, explain,
derive even, because you

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.990
can memorize a derivation.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.929
But if you really want them to
derive it, what does that mean?

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.220
How are you going to test that?

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.232
So those are generally
the biggest problems

00:03:45.232 --> 00:03:46.690
people have with
learning outcomes.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.610
But by and large, you
all did a great job.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.985
If you came in late, I'll give
you your learning outcomes

00:03:50.985 --> 00:03:52.870
at the end to class.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.620
If you looked at the Wiki--
and this is a test to see who

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.540
looked at the Wiki--

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.220
I had suggested you bring a web
enabled device if you had one.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.020
And that's because
I wanted to set up

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.660
something called Back
Channel The topic today

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.550
is on active learning.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.030
And so this is just one method
that might help your students,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.980
especially if you
have a big class.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.916
So we don't really
need it in this class,

00:04:16.916 --> 00:04:18.790
but I just wanted to
give you the opportunity

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.070
to play with it a little bit.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.660
It was designed for
conferences actually.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.340
But it works pretty well,
I think, in classes.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.960
So if you login to
here, this is the URL.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.837
If you go to our
Wiki page bookmarked,

00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:33.670
there's a link on the
Wiki page, if you just

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.972
want to link to it that way.

00:04:34.972 --> 00:04:36.430
And then at any
point in the class,

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.230
you can type a question in.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.842
And if you're on
the page, you can

00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:41.050
see other people's questions.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.350
You can upvote and
downvote their questions.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.840
And I will take a break
in the middle, when you're

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.570
doing some other things, and
read what people have posted

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.860
and then get back to you.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.440
So it's an opportunity
for students to interact

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.310
who may be a little more
shy, who may not want to.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.019
I don't think we need
that in this class.

00:04:58.019 --> 00:04:59.934
I don't think that there's
any one of you that

00:04:59.934 --> 00:05:02.330
isn't willing to share
your ideas, which is great.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.950
But this may be something
that's of interest to you.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.742
Before we jump into the
topic today, active learning,

00:05:10.742 --> 00:05:12.450
there were a couple
of mud card questions

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.760
that I just wanted
to talk about.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.810
One was sometimes students
may nod off during class.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.390
And if it's a big
class, there's probably

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.220
not a lot you can do about it.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.810
If you do enough
active learning,

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.640
though, that will keep them--
that will make them wake up.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.360
Especially pair
activities or activities

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.604
where they have to talk to
one or two other people,

00:05:39.604 --> 00:05:41.520
or two or three other
people, it's pretty hard

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.505
to be asleep during those.

00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:44.130
And you'll see.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.810
We're going to do something
called a lightning round later

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:46.399
on.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.690
And it's virtually impossible
to be asleep during that.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.730
So you want to make
sure that it's worth

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.460
the student's time to
actually be in class

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.690
and be awake for it.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.850
And active learning can
play a huge role in that.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.047
Sometimes people are tired.

00:06:01.047 --> 00:06:02.880
They stayed up too late
for whatever reason.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.590
And you can't control
everybody in your class.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.510
But you want to make sure that
you're doing everything you

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.070
can do to keep them engaged.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.430
And if it's just one
student every now and then,

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.494
you probably don't want
to take it personally.

00:06:16.494 --> 00:06:17.410
It's probably not you.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.990
If the whole class
is falling asleep,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.090
then it's probably
a good opportunity

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.430
to rethink your strategies.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.380
Somebody asked if there
were good times of day

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.700
to have a lecture.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.040
And part of it is you.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.339
Part of is your schedule.

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:32.380
Sometimes you're allowed.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.130
You can pick that.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.280
And sometimes you really don't
have much control over when

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.720
you choose to teach your class.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.940
People do say that
students, undergrads,

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.900
people between the
ages of 18 and 21

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.540
are not particularly interested
in being up at 8:00 or 9:00

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.130
in the morning.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.370
But again you may not have
any control over that.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.425
Generally speaking, that's a
pretty low time for people.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.750
So if you want to take that
into consideration, you might.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.380
But it depends as much
on you as the students.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.130
If you're going to be
really tired at 4:00

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.980
but they're just waking up,
then don't teach it at 4:00.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.410
Maybe don't teach at 4:00.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.360
And the last one was
guiding readings.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.751
If you just put a
lot of readings up,

00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:23.000
students might not know where
to focus their attention

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.470
until after the class.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.910
So there are reading
questions, reading guides

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.170
that you can post.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.180
Read such and such
and try and think

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.730
about how you might explain
this, that, or the other thing.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.370
And then there's also
pre-class questions

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.380
you can ask that
they might derive,

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.110
that they may have to pull
from the readings to answer.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:48.310
So the concept of just in
time teaching, the idea

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.720
that students do
a reading and then

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.970
they actually have to answer
questions on the reading

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.060
before they come to class
and submit their answers.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.610
So there's a whole
procedure around that.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.990
It can be very, very effective.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.406
You can do it for a large class.

00:08:01.406 --> 00:08:02.780
There's strategies
and techniques

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.270
to streamline the amount
of time you put into it.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.730
But it does force them
to do the reading.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.830
And it does guide, at some
level, what they read.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.580
And that's a great
great approach.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.620
And I'm happy to talk more about
that at another time or later

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.590
or offline.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.160
I did go to the Teaching
with Technology conference,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.150
the Teaching Professor
Technology Conference.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.402
And they were giving out little
ribbons to stack on your badge.

00:08:30.402 --> 00:08:31.610
And this was a prominent one.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.200
It's in the syllabus,
which I thought

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.179
was just crazy timely because
a couple of weeks ago.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:38.330
So if you want one of
these to stick somewhere.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:43.070
And then they all said when I
tweet, which was sort of weird.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.610
But anyway I brought those back.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.360
Anybody want some.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.340
Sometimes my computer
doesn't wake up.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:09.830
So let's pretend that instead
of the class active learning

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.040
today, I decided I was going
to teach you how to juggle.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.420
And I said, here's the
equation for how to juggle.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.300
And here's the variables,
F, D, V N, and H,

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.910
which are ball in the
air, ball in an hand,

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:26.450
time hand is vacant, number
of balls, number of hands.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.580
And this is this
handy dandy equation,

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.704
which if you balance it out, it
describes the juggling process.

00:09:32.704 --> 00:09:34.620
And for those of you
that are visual learners,

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.100
I have a graph here, a
yellow ball, a blue ball,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.390
and a pink ball.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.680
And then you can see that just
shows the path of the balls.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.810
If you remember from
physics, there's

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:49.190
the equations of motion in the
x direction in the y direction.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:54.350
And so I think I probably did a
pretty good job of teaching you

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.950
how to juggle.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.890
No, did a terrible job of
teaching you how to juggle.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.530
I didn't even come close to
teaching you how to juggle.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.150
And if I were to
give you a test,

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.550
let's say, and I were to
measure whether or not

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.060
you could juggle, I
guarantee that some of you

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.580
would be able to juggle.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:21.310
And I could say, I did a great
job teaching how to juggle.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:22.780
But I didn't.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.580
If you knew how to
juggle coming in,

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.320
presumably you still
know how to juggle.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.990
I did no harm, I think.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.665
However if you didn't know
how to juggle coming in,

00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:33.040
you don't know
how to juggle now.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.040
So why is this here now?

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.605
Why did I bother to
do this stupid thought

00:10:40.605 --> 00:10:41.480
experiment right now?

00:10:48.735 --> 00:10:50.110
AUDIENCE: Because
this is clearly

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.939
how most classes are taught.

00:10:52.939 --> 00:10:54.730
Obviously it would be
easier to have a ball

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.969
and show us how to juggle,
active learning as opposed

00:10:56.969 --> 00:11:00.894
to just showing the theory
behind it and ending there.

00:11:00.894 --> 00:11:02.560
JANET RANKIN: And I
think a lot of times

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.830
we really do, in science and
engineering classes, we really

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.720
put up a lot of equations.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.490
And then it's not like
we expect somebody

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.474
to do something
physically with them.

00:11:12.474 --> 00:11:14.890
But we expect them to be able
to manipulate the equations,

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.680
transfer the equations,
apply the equations.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.740
And we never really
talked about that.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.500
We talked about the equations.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.460
So it's a real call
in my mind, for us

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.990
to think about what
it is we really

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.070
want students to be able to do.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.040
And then make sure that
they're doing stuff

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.760
to teach them that helps
them learn how to do that.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.300
And I know you all
read the readings

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.040
and that they talk a lot
about active learning.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.710
There's a few things about
techniques for active learning.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.043
There's a few things about
the why's of active learning.

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:53.310
There's some data for why
active learning works.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.100
But I'm guessing that
there's a range of buy in

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.170
at this point from you guys.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.700
Eh, I don't think it's worth it.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.820
Or I don't really know.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.690
So for the first 20
minutes, 25 minutes

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.970
of class, what
I'd like you to do

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.980
is I'd like you to
pretend that you

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.240
were part of a department,
the STEM department.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.500
Call it whatever field you want.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.900
And there is a proposal
that your department

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.580
should commit funds
to train professors

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.530
and develop resources,
the resources

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.950
necessary for the adoption and
ongoing use of active learning

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.840
techniques in all courses.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.460
And the target date is 2017.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.060
You've got a year to
get all courses up

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.080
to speed with active
learning stuff introduced

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.780
into these classes and with
a plan for how to do that.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.850
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to just count off one,

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.620
two, three, one, two, three.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.320
And I'm going to ask
you to form a group.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.780
If you're a one, go
with the one group.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.920
Two go with the two group.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.870
A three go with the three group.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.300
And you're going to
have to physically move.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.520
So just remember your number.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.147
One.

00:13:04.147 --> 00:13:04.921
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:13:04.921 --> 00:13:06.170
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:07.057
AUDIENCE: One.

00:13:07.057 --> 00:13:07.640
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.090
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:10.977
AUDIENCE: One.

00:13:10.977 --> 00:13:11.560
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.226
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:13:12.226 --> 00:13:13.030
AUDIENCE: One.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.010
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:14.990
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:16.370
AUDIENCE: One.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.040
JANET RANKIN: It doesn't matter
that they're not the same size.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.790
Can we get all the ones, let's
say all the ones up here?

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.850
All the twos here.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.629
And all the threes there.

00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:31.420
And I'll tell you what
to do in just a sec.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.520
So if you're group
number one, you

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.530
have to adopt the
position that you are pro.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.122
You are going to push for the
adoption of this resolution.

00:13:39.122 --> 00:13:41.080
And you have to come up
with a set of arguments

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.030
and a set of reasons
why it's a good thing.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.100
I don't care what
you think personally.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.350
I don't care if you think
active learning is the worst

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.580
idea ever.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.380
For the purposes
of this debate, you

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.930
need to pretend you're
totally into it.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.890
And you need to come up with
some good arguments why.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.310
Two are against it.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.680
Again, I don't care how
you feel personally.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.600
But come up with some
good solid arguments

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.715
why you should not do this.

00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:08.110
AUDIENCE: We are against it?

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.440
JANET RANKIN: Against,
you do you not want it.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.449
No.

00:14:12.449 --> 00:14:14.490
Group number three, you
got a little bit of time.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.560
But get to know each other.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.800
And you're going to
hear the arguments.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.320
You're going to hear a case
presented by the pro people,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.490
the con people.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.400
And then you are going
to deliberate and decide

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.590
what's going to happen
in your department.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.617
You guys are the deciders.

00:14:30.617 --> 00:14:31.950
It's an American political joke.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.046
But we'll let that go.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.910
And you guys get this
lovely microphone.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.500
So I'm going to give
you 10 minutes for this.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.980
So be ready to share your views.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.350
You've got about,
maybe, two or three

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.630
minutes of a spiel of proof.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.330
And then we'll do one
exchange of debate.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.250
And then the
deciders will decide.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.230
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:15:06.969 --> 00:15:09.552
JANET RANKIN: I'm going to ask
someone from each of the groups

00:15:09.552 --> 00:15:13.600
to make a statement
that puts forth the side

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.016
that you're supposed to defend,
if that is the side you're

00:15:16.016 --> 00:15:17.520
supposed to defend.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.430
So we'll start with the pros.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.684
So someone from your
group ready to talk pros?

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.160
All right, Michelle.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.120
AUDIENCE: So we are
pro active learning.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.197
And part of the
basis for thinking

00:15:38.197 --> 00:15:39.655
that active learning's
important is

00:15:39.655 --> 00:15:42.945
that we believe that
without active learning,

00:15:42.945 --> 00:15:45.606
the professor usually
just resorts to lecturing.

00:15:45.606 --> 00:15:47.871
And we think that lectures
are not effective.

00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:49.870
Students don't learn
simply because the material

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.440
is presented to them.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.146
Lecturing wastes
resources, because you

00:15:54.146 --> 00:15:55.910
could be lecturing to 1,000.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.620
But only 15 students
may be reached.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.020
And if you use active
learning instead of lecturing,

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.215
it can make sure the students
are paying attention.

00:16:03.215 --> 00:16:04.923
You can check that
they're understanding.

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:07.670
You can know what
they are getting

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.430
and what they're not getting.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.240
We also feel that active
learning is a life skill.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.660
And that if students learn
to learn by do things

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.040
and they learn by
talking to each other

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.740
and by going through a
process and solving problems,

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.848
that they can take this skill to
outside of the classroom later

00:16:26.848 --> 00:16:27.971
in society.

00:16:27.971 --> 00:16:29.804
Then that the society
that you have students

00:16:29.804 --> 00:16:31.345
who are used to
being active learners

00:16:31.345 --> 00:16:34.710
and who know how to
solve problems that way.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:39.525
And we also think that the
end, the big point that we have

00:16:39.525 --> 00:16:41.620
is that you remember
things that you use.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.494
If you learn something,
if it goes in one ear

00:16:43.494 --> 00:16:45.494
and out the other, if you
don't actually use it,

00:16:45.494 --> 00:16:47.440
you're not going to remember it.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.844
If you're not forced to
actually work through a problem

00:16:49.844 --> 00:16:52.706
and really think about it
and use it in a classroom,

00:16:52.706 --> 00:16:55.077
that you're much less
likely to actually hold on

00:16:55.077 --> 00:16:55.910
to that information.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.439
So these are all
reasons why we think

00:16:58.439 --> 00:17:04.970
that we should promote active
learning in our department.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.280
JANET RANKIN: OK,
thank you very much.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:11.410
The con, or I guess I
should say the not whatever.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:12.406
Anyway, group two.

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:16.140
AUDIENCE: Do you want to do it?

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:16.681
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.730
We start with a basic question.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:26.180
The question is, why do we
want to change what is working?

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.559
We are training our students.

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:28.885
They are getting job.

00:17:28.885 --> 00:17:30.220
The professor are doing well.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.055
They are collecting grants.

00:17:32.055 --> 00:17:34.756
The original [INAUDIBLE] is OK.

00:17:34.756 --> 00:17:36.655
So why do you want to
change what is working?

00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:38.450
So that is the first question.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.980
Now the first thing is that,
if you want to go about this,

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.756
it's going to consume
a lot of money.

00:17:42.756 --> 00:17:44.408
It's going to take
a lot of money.

00:17:44.408 --> 00:17:45.783
And then it cuts
into your funds.

00:17:45.783 --> 00:17:49.574
The one funds for other
such, want to buy equipment

00:17:49.574 --> 00:17:51.576
for the laboratory, want
to go hire scientists,

00:17:51.576 --> 00:17:53.240
want to go hire post doc.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.492
So why do we want to change?

00:17:54.492 --> 00:17:55.665
Where do we get these funds?

00:17:55.665 --> 00:17:57.623
We divert funds for the
training of professors.

00:17:57.623 --> 00:18:01.265
And they're going to be
little bit of no funds for all

00:18:01.265 --> 00:18:03.470
this such work.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.390
And secondly, the efforts
to train professors

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.703
is likely to be very huge.

00:18:08.703 --> 00:18:10.661
Professors are used to
this method of teaching.

00:18:10.661 --> 00:18:12.810
And as you saw, they
will not want to change.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.020
There's going to be a lot
of time changing them.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.230
And we're not even sure,
if we try to change them,

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:22.380
whether they're going to be able
to do it at the end of the day.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.210
Thirdly, we are not sure that
the stakeholder would be happy.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.578
What about the alumni
that are very much

00:18:27.578 --> 00:18:29.072
used to the method of teaching?

00:18:29.072 --> 00:18:30.330
What about the parents?

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.060
are they now going
to go against us?

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.220
Will they not see that
the professor no longer,

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.580
just come to the class, give
them group work like this

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.302
without teaching,
without writing?

00:18:41.302 --> 00:18:43.010
Then the professor is
no longer teaching.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.800
And they are just going
to collect their salary.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.990
And then, there's
not to be constrained

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.940
on time to cover syllabus.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.760
When I saw I spend
a lot of money

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.459
being in group work,
individual, or this and that.

00:18:55.459 --> 00:18:57.000
So how do you complete
your syllabus?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.133
You have about 20 topics
to cover this semester.

00:19:00.133 --> 00:19:01.883
And by the time you
start active learning,

00:19:01.883 --> 00:19:05.065
how are going you cover
about 50% of them?

00:19:05.065 --> 00:19:07.929
Then you push all of
that up [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:09.012
So it's not going to work.

00:19:09.012 --> 00:19:12.000
We should just drop the idea.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.150
What have we value
very last class?

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.038
You have your class of 500.

00:19:16.038 --> 00:19:18.398
How do you want active
learning to be effective?

00:19:18.398 --> 00:19:20.030
How do you want to treat them?

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.310
It's good here, because we are
just about 15 or less than 20.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:26.399
By the time you have
500 students in a class,

00:19:26.399 --> 00:19:28.024
it's going to be very
difficult for you

00:19:28.024 --> 00:19:31.420
to have active learning,
difficult for the professor

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.870
to control classes,
and of course,

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.147
difficult for you to really
get something concrete out

00:19:35.147 --> 00:19:37.650
of the whole thing.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:42.333
So my final guys and professors,
I think it's not necessary.

00:19:42.333 --> 00:19:42.833
the.

00:19:42.833 --> 00:19:43.598
System is working.

00:19:43.598 --> 00:19:45.480
Let it continue
to work this way.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.136
Thank you.

00:19:47.136 --> 00:19:48.844
JANET RANKIN: So now
what I'm going to do

00:19:48.844 --> 00:19:51.746
is I'm going to
let each group ask

00:19:51.746 --> 00:19:55.400
one question or a set
of clustered questions

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.777
to the other group.

00:19:56.777 --> 00:19:58.154
The other group can answer them.

00:19:58.154 --> 00:20:02.195
And then the deciders can
ask a couple questions.

00:20:02.195 --> 00:20:05.311
And then we'll let
them deliberate.

00:20:05.311 --> 00:20:07.936
So group number one, like to ask
some questions to group number

00:20:07.936 --> 00:20:10.792
two or make some comments?

00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:12.660
Go ahead.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
listened to you speak.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:18.846
And I want to ask you.

00:20:18.846 --> 00:20:21.630
You are saying that
the system is changing.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:28.590
It is changing because the
status quo isn't delivering.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.770
So that is why we are
adopting active learning.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.610
And this is proven from
a research perspective.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:40.110
There is actually letting more
students learn more materials

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:43.050
faster and more effectively.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:46.296
So what do you think about that?

00:20:46.296 --> 00:20:50.361
AUDIENCE: I'll
answer it by saying

00:20:50.361 --> 00:20:55.434
the different research shows us
that the student that is good

00:20:55.434 --> 00:20:56.253
is good.

00:20:56.253 --> 00:20:59.690
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:03.127
So why can't we just concentrate
on getting those students?

00:21:03.127 --> 00:21:07.738
And what your presentation
didn't say about funds,

00:21:07.738 --> 00:21:11.838
was the whole idea is
to fund the proposal.

00:21:11.838 --> 00:21:16.790
And if we divert funds
to this new program,

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.610
and that's a very big issue.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.112
You have to concentrate
on the question that

00:21:21.112 --> 00:21:24.490
is the diversion of
funds away from research.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.420
So if we can get the new
students and they can learn

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.690
by [INAUDIBLE], and
it's working great--

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.770
go ahead.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.300
AUDIENCE: So you
want to throw away

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.180
the baby with the bath water?

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.770
If you have 20
students in a class,

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.600
and you have five
active learners,

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.870
and then you want to
discover 15 that wouldn't.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:53.790
This program is geared towards
each one of the students

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.190
in the class to participate.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.010
And I think it's
more cost effective.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.560
If you could get
all the 20 students

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.750
to learn and to
learn actively, I

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.510
think that would pay itself
off at the end of the--

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.590
AUDIENCE: No, the
problem there is that you

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:13.040
have to face the proposal.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.310
This is 2017.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:19.530
It's a lot of change
in a very short time.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.530
The proposal itself
is already against--

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:22.530
AUDIENCE: Our department
could be three people big.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:25.029
We don't know how much
the department is.

00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:28.022
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:28.522 --> 00:22:30.019
AUDIENCE: But then
the issue there

00:22:30.019 --> 00:22:31.810
is that you're going
to retrain professors.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.011
Professors are really
stuck in their ways.

00:22:34.011 --> 00:22:35.508
And you spend all this money.

00:22:35.508 --> 00:22:39.001
And it's very short time.

00:22:39.001 --> 00:22:41.995
There's lots of
people from the labs,

00:22:41.995 --> 00:22:44.478
and money from the labs
in this very short time

00:22:44.478 --> 00:22:45.936
to train them on
something we don't

00:22:45.936 --> 00:22:48.202
know if they're
ready to buy into it.

00:22:48.202 --> 00:22:51.450
AUDIENCE: So I think
your assumption is that--

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:55.060
you're like, we're deferring
funds from labs and resort.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:59.010
But you never once said you're
diverting funds from anything

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.710
related to the students.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:04.050
You're thinking of it from
the professor perspective.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:06.740
But really professors are
here to teach their students.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.603
And you're like, oh,
we're taking money away

00:23:08.603 --> 00:23:10.353
from the research,
from the lab equipment,

00:23:10.353 --> 00:23:11.964
from all these
different things that

00:23:11.964 --> 00:23:14.255
sound great to the professor
but have literally nothing

00:23:14.255 --> 00:23:16.190
to do with the students
learning experience

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.432
or the student's
experience on campus.

00:23:18.432 --> 00:23:19.890
And from the
student's perspective,

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.055
that's really frustrating, when
that's all the professors care

00:23:22.055 --> 00:23:22.606
about.

00:23:22.606 --> 00:23:24.022
And that's what
makes a difference

00:23:24.022 --> 00:23:26.463
between a good professor
and a crap professor

00:23:26.463 --> 00:23:28.290
is one who cares.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:31.260
And I think, if you want
a professor to care,

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.422
oftentimes they're willing
to make the effort that

00:23:34.422 --> 00:23:36.430
is needed to change
their teaching style

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.340
or do whatever it is
that's necessary to have

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.966
their kid interested and
engaged in the same material

00:23:41.966 --> 00:23:43.630
that this professor loves.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.396
So you keep talking
about diverting funds.

00:23:45.396 --> 00:23:48.160
But you never once mentioned
diverting these funds

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.418
away from this one
teaching initiative

00:23:50.418 --> 00:23:52.560
to a different
teaching initiative.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.639
So just keep that in mind .

00:23:54.639 --> 00:23:56.180
AUDIENCE: So the
problem is that when

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.612
we are looking at the proposal
itself, the time, 2017, this

00:23:59.612 --> 00:24:01.367
is already the end of 2015.

00:24:01.367 --> 00:24:05.404
So that means you
are going to do this,

00:24:05.404 --> 00:24:09.035
by 2017, that means you're
going to do it by 2016.

00:24:09.035 --> 00:24:13.025
We're not against active
learning in the [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:13.025 --> 00:24:15.005
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:15.005 --> 00:24:17.480
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:18.914 --> 00:24:19.955
AUDIENCE: --the proposal.

00:24:19.955 --> 00:24:21.681
We are against-- we
need these two group

00:24:21.681 --> 00:24:22.764
and against this proposal.

00:24:22.764 --> 00:24:25.592
So for this proposal, we
are against this proposal,

00:24:25.592 --> 00:24:29.496
because you know how
much it's about the funds

00:24:29.496 --> 00:24:31.440
and the resources.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.308
And that is why we are
against the proposal.

00:24:34.308 --> 00:24:36.730
And also you pick
whatever [INAUDIBLE],

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.284
we're not even sure that
it is going to work.

00:24:39.284 --> 00:24:41.700
JANET RANKIN: I'm going to
take, because you guys actually

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.850
did ask a question, so I'm
going to count that to you

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.140
Did you have another
separate one?

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.340
AJ, you look like you
might have some questions.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah actually
I was just curious,

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:55.980
so if this initiative
is really great,

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.480
it looks like a lot
of this research

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.040
has been done since '80s.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.050
Why isn't it adopted?

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:05.820
Why are we having this
conversation now in 2015?

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.295
AUDIENCE: I think
we should look back

00:25:08.295 --> 00:25:11.925
at this issue of the lecturing
system that we are using now.

00:25:11.925 --> 00:25:13.250
It's static.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:19.320
When there was no
printing, lecturers then,

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.390
they get the material.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:21.390
They reach the students.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:25.350
So lecturing is a Latin
word that means reading.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.160
Now since then, now
we are printing.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.190
We have information
readily available

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.309
that people can get on at
their home and their own

00:25:31.309 --> 00:25:32.350
and develop to something.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:36.510
Too So there is a need for
us to change to a new system,

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:41.696
because the old system that
more facilitated lecturing has

00:25:41.696 --> 00:25:42.726
changed.

00:25:42.726 --> 00:25:45.099
So then we have to change.

00:25:45.099 --> 00:25:46.724
JANET RANKIN: I'm
going to turn it over

00:25:46.724 --> 00:25:50.556
to the deciders who
now have to discuss.

00:25:50.556 --> 00:25:53.430
They've been resting
for many minutes.

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:54.735
So now they have to.

00:25:54.735 --> 00:25:56.610
So you have questions
for each of the groups?

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:57.446
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:57.446 --> 00:25:59.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.137
Great arguments on both sides.

00:26:01.137 --> 00:26:03.470
I found it interesting, when
you talked about the larger

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.070
classes, so my first
question is for this group.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:10.350
So how would active learning
apply to a large class?

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.950
The proposal is that
it's for all courses.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.973
And so are there courses where
this doesn't lend itself to?

00:26:16.973 --> 00:26:19.838
AUDIENCE: Even in the classes
with 700, 800 students here,

00:26:19.838 --> 00:26:22.034
they still do active learning
for the freshmen, i.e.

00:26:22.034 --> 00:26:22.784
Clicker questions.

00:26:22.784 --> 00:26:26.370
Oftentimes professors have
to talk to your partners.

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:28.260
So they'll pose a question.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:31.013
Everyone will click
on their answer.

00:26:31.013 --> 00:26:32.650
And then they'll be
like, now go back

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.130
and talk to the person
sitting next to you.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:38.072
And then you'll vote
again in two minutes.

00:26:38.072 --> 00:26:42.500
So I think that's just one
example of how you can engage

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.730
a class of a lot of students.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:50.150
AUDIENCE: And to add
to that, actually it's

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:55.520
also been found out that when
peers speak to themselves,

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.860
they even learn the
material better than when

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:04.760
the expert, who may have lost
touch to what it could be

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:09.020
like to learn from a
student's perspective.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:12.660
So peers speak to themselves
and teach themselves even faster

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:19.500
than the expert who
is in front of them.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:27.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah I have comment
for the against group.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:33.170
You mentioned that you
don't require to create

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:38.100
or active learning, because
some students are very smart.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.510
They get it right.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:41.940
But don't you think
that education

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.740
is a right of every child?

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.530
And they deserve to
have a good shot at it.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:48.880
So why do you want to pull
one child out of here,

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.130
because he's not smart enough?

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.550
AUDIENCE: I just
to answer, I think

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.530
we are pushing for
the best education.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:00.320
We believe that is
the traditional way.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.060
We think that active
learning can happen

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.660
outside of the classroom.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.520
This is the way it's
worked for 300 plus years

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.780
over at Harvard, one of
the best universities, MIT

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.940
for 100 plus years.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:19.045
We think that
essentially it's working.

00:28:19.045 --> 00:28:21.170
And the reason we're having
this conversation right

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:23.420
now is because it has worked.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.900
So we want to
continue that legacy.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.270
We think that every system
is going to have problems.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:33.740
And if you analyze any system,
you're going to find issues.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:37.220
And there are certainly
some smaller inefficiencies

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.690
within the lecture.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:40.400
But by and large, it's trusted.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.440
And it works.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:47.730
AUDIENCE: I want to
add on what adding.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.865
So I think we are not pushing
those less smart kids away,

00:28:51.865 --> 00:28:56.690
because they can actually
learn from each other outside

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:57.440
of class.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.790
We just want to say
that doing the lecture

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:06.416
is more efficient if the
professor lecturing at them,

00:29:06.416 --> 00:29:09.835
giving all the information.

00:29:09.835 --> 00:29:11.570
As a footnote to that-- sorry--

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:16.970
if professors come to the
class and just give theory

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:19.380
and go away, and the
smart kids get it,

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.860
then how do you measure the
professor's performance?

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.640
How do you think
about, say, something

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.531
like students information
on educational quality?

00:29:29.531 --> 00:29:30.530
How do you measure that?

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.140
AUDIENCE: You don't
really need the professor

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.370
to be extremely active and do
active teaching in the class.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:43.561
The full student can
actually get what they need.

00:29:43.561 --> 00:29:44.810
You have a bunch of homeworks.

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:48.710
You have a bunch of test
questions, exam questions,

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:50.460
that student, whether
they like it or not,

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.820
they will surely be forced
to read those things.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:56.689
And by the time they come
back, they come back learning.

00:29:56.689 --> 00:29:58.980
Lot of graduate from MIT,
they are l really doing well.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.590
About 25% start up
their own business.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:04.750
Probably like 70% get
jobs when they finish.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:06.480
What are you talking about?

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.660
The system is working.

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:08.930
And That's what we're saying.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.390
And their value is a great.

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:11.806
The evaluation is
done on the type

00:30:11.806 --> 00:30:13.276
of textbook, the
mode of lecture,

00:30:13.276 --> 00:30:14.730
the [INAUDIBLE] lecture.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.000
So these are the things
that I try to evaluate

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.705
in the evaluation process.

00:30:18.705 --> 00:30:19.862
And it has been great.

00:30:19.862 --> 00:30:21.602
And we want it to continue.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.645
AUDIENCE: So we addressed
the measuring impact.

00:30:26.645 --> 00:30:28.620
And that goes for both.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.950
But for the active
learning, how do we

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.080
quantify how much
active learning needs

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:39.360
to go into these different
classrooms in the department?

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:44.550
So how will we ensure
the appropriate amount

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.296
has been implemented in
different classrooms?

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.450
Basically, how much
active learning

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:02.640
needs to go into a
classroom to create change

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.562
or to strengthen our
student learning?

00:31:05.562 --> 00:31:07.614
AUDIENCE: How much
has to go in or how

00:31:07.614 --> 00:31:10.072
you're going to make sure that
the professors are doing it?

00:31:10.072 --> 00:31:12.210
AUDIENCE: Both, I
guess, is the question.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.990
If there's a professor that's
more on the lecture side

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:20.610
that might throw one thing pair
share in and call it a day.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:24.300
So how do we ensure the
appropriate active learning

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.110
techniques and the quantity
are there for the classrooms?

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.450
AUDIENCE: I think we'd have
to go back to the research

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.840
and see how much, whether
it's 30% of the time needs

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.730
to be spent on active
learning activities,

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:40.620
or to see what has been proven,
because active learning has

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.090
been proven to be effective.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:44.040
But we would have to
go back and make sure

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:48.600
that we set a standard that,
if it is 30% of the time

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.350
or 70% of the time.

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:52.250
And I think oversight
from the department

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:54.750
would be important, in that the
leadership in the department

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.060
will have to sit in on classes.

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.150
And as part of the
training of the professors,

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:01.290
there has to be training.

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:04.680
But then there has to be someone
to observe them in the class,

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.150
give feedback.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:07.830
The training has to be ongoing.

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:09.950
It's not just a three
hour seminar on this

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:11.075
is with active learning is.

00:32:11.075 --> 00:32:11.990
And this is what you should do.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:13.800
I think it's going
to be a long term

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.660
investment in the
professor training

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:18.000
that someone's going to have
to check up and give them

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:18.550
feedback.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:21.325
And then they can
adjust from there.

00:32:21.325 --> 00:32:24.310
JANET RANKIN: I'm sure that
we could [INAUDIBLE] all day.

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:28.310
But I'm going to give the
deciders two and a half

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:31.280
minutes, three minutes,
to talk to each other

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:35.184
and come up with a decision.

00:32:35.184 --> 00:32:37.706
All right, the
committee has met.

00:32:37.706 --> 00:32:42.790
And now they're going
to determine your fate

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.162
in this department.

00:32:45.162 --> 00:32:46.370
AUDIENCE: Does this mic work?

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:46.900
Is this on?

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.560
Do I need to use the mic.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.030
You can hear?

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:52.670
Well thank you again
for your arguments.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.720
Certainly the panel felt
that the pro arguments

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.530
in terms of the benefits of
active learning are great.

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:02.790
And we definitely support that.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:05.900
However, given the time
frame, and this proposal

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.930
is very aggressive, it would
be extremely disruptive.

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.180
Also the amount of
funds that we think

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.410
that it would take
to implement this

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:17.430
would be very high without any
proven way to measure success.

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:19.850
So what we are willing
to do is commit funds

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:22.370
to a pilot program,
where we can then

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.420
measure what the success
will be and then make

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.930
it a decision next year
as to whether or not

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.240
we invest for the rest
of the departments.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.776
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.340
JANET RANKIN: So I hope you
found this exercise useful.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:50.630
I just want to debrief
on the exercise itself,

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.210
why we bothered to do it.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:56.780
It took probably 45
minutes of time to do it.

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.850
But I made a decision
that would be useful.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:02.920
So what did we get
out of this exercise?

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.730
What was the point?

00:34:07.027 --> 00:34:09.493
AUDIENCE: Whether you think
that's it's worth it or not,

00:34:09.493 --> 00:34:10.913
it's really important time.

00:34:10.913 --> 00:34:12.288
Also, it seems
this confrontation

00:34:12.288 --> 00:34:17.645
is happening a lot in the
department, especially

00:34:17.645 --> 00:34:22.970
[INAUDIBLE] as they go
through the program.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.770
I assumed this test would
be debated quite a bit,

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:31.760
internally and externally.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.538
JANET RANKIN: Other
reasons we engaged in this?

00:34:34.538 --> 00:34:36.410
AUDIENCE: I think
it gives everybody

00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:40.121
the opportunity to think deeply
about the subject matter.

00:34:40.121 --> 00:34:45.522
And it also, even if you are
against or for something,

00:34:45.522 --> 00:34:47.486
you have to have
a deeper knowledge

00:34:47.486 --> 00:34:51.989
to be able to bring out the
good points, certain issues that

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:57.040
might actually make
see [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.760
JANET RANKIN: [INAUDIBLE],
you want to add to that?

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.460
AUDIENCE: The topic
is active learning.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:06.240
And what we just demonstrated
is active learning in practice.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.380
JANET RANKIN: Yes, exactly.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:11.160
And the idea to
Gordon's point, the idea

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:15.390
that it can be very, very
useful for you to have students

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:18.571
take an arbitrary
position and argue it,

00:35:18.571 --> 00:35:20.070
because they will
learn things, they

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.230
will think about things,
that they would not

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:24.300
have thought about otherwise.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.180
And it's usually not a good
idea to say OK everybody that

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.320
thinks this, go over here.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.060
Everybody that thinks
this, go over here,

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.027
because all that
does is reinforce

00:35:33.027 --> 00:35:34.110
what people think already.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:36.540
And maybe it's not
completely correct.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.990
So this is often a
very good technique,

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:45.570
when there's two clear
viewpoints or two clear sides.

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.180
And you want students to
really engage with that.

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.310
And exactly, we could
have had a discussion.

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:52.139
Or I could have had
PowerPoint slides that

00:35:52.139 --> 00:35:53.430
said, here are the good things.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:56.530
Here are the pros with active
learning, bum, bum, bum, bum,

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:57.210
bum.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.132
Here are the cons of active
learning, bum, bum, bum, bum,

00:35:59.132 --> 00:35:59.632
bum.

00:35:59.632 --> 00:36:00.880
And that would've taken--

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.310
just to come out of my
neutral position here--

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:08.340
that would have taken
probably four minutes.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:13.460
Instead we took 35
or so, 40 minutes.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.850
But I think you probably
engaged with some

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:18.770
of the ideas and
concepts a little bit

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:22.190
deeper, because you had to
come up with it yourself.

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:29.490
So yes, all those reasons.

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:30.660
And it does come up often.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.850
People are discussing it.

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:33.350
And it's not so clear cut.

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:34.970
There's not a right answer.

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:38.900
And you're going to want to say,
OK, well we'll do it by 2019.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.120
Or we'll do it.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.487
But we won't do that.

00:36:42.487 --> 00:36:44.820
There's going to be deals and
all those kinds of things.

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:45.590
And that's OK.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:48.110
It's OK that there's
not a right answer.

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:50.190
But that was the point
of this exercise.

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:53.060
So that served as our
discussion for active learning.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.830
But you guys did it.

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.960
I didn't do anything.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.130
AUDIENCE: And that
buttresses the point

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:03.250
that active learning
is the way to go.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:04.250
JANET RANKIN: Thank you.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:06.190
Yes, this is very meta.

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:08.259
This is very meta here.

00:37:08.259 --> 00:37:10.050
Yeah and I do have to
feel a little bit bad

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:11.180
when you're like, what?

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.680
Then we're going
to do all the work.

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.430
And the lecturer's just going
to sit back and not do anything.

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:17.400
I took it personally.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.970
But no, no, it's OK.

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:22.460
One thing I wanted
to bring up is

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:25.280
if you haven't read the
Scott Freeman article,

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.280
it's in the reading
list for today.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.210
It shows-- let me
just bump to it--

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:35.390
it shows essentially
these results.

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:39.490
He did a meta analysis of 225
studies on active learning

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:42.560
or on classes that that
used active learning.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.190
And they showed a 12%
decrease in the failure rate

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:50.090
in classes that used
active learning.

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:53.330
And so I was telling the
pro group that what say

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:57.650
in the paper is that if it had
been a clinical drug trial,

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:00.890
and 12% of the people on the
drug were having a better

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:05.620
outcome than the people on the
placebo, they would have had--

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.260
or the people on the control--

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.070
they would have had
to stop the trial

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:13.370
and give everyone the drug.

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:18.970
So in the sense of why
we're still lecturing,

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:21.290
that's to me one of the
biggest compelling reasons

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:23.330
for why we should be doing
more active learning.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:28.400
12% of the students are going
to pass the class, on average,

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.450
normalized.

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:36.760
And they actually considered
both experienced lecturers, who

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.920
were just lecturing,
people that were considered

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.080
to be good lecturers
that were just lecturing,

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.680
as well as graduate students
who were first time teachers

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.630
but were using active learning.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.250
So they looked at
all sorts of-- they

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:49.780
mixed up all sorts of outcomes.

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.000
And active learning appears to,
the data's pretty conclusive.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.360
And this isn't the only
study that shows it.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.400
So there are definitely issues.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.350
There are definitely
implementation issues.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:02.200
They're definitely
sticking points.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:06.490
But it's something that
I think we can't ignore.

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:08.400
AUDIENCE: I just want
to add that it's not

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.880
only that we have 12%
decrease in the failure rate.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:16.530
We also have big shifts in
the letter grade students get.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:20.880
For instance, more people
shift from grade C to grade B

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.023
or from B to A. And B
to see a test like that.

00:39:24.023 --> 00:39:25.696
So that's really
significant also.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:37.535
JANET RANKIN: So I just want
not have learning outcomes.

00:39:37.535 --> 00:39:39.660
But I did want to have the
discussion before I even

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:40.110
introduced them.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:41.790
So I think you'll
be able to explain

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:44.190
the impact of active learning
exercises in the classroom.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.820
You've already
started to do that.

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.090
And then you'll be able
to identify and develop

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:50.310
active learning exercises
that you'll want to use.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:53.880
And you'll be able to think
about how you might use them.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:57.360
I think, pretty attainable
learning outcomes.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.050
I'm going to show
the slide a lot

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:01.940
throughout the rest of the time.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.340
But remember, it's
constructive alignment.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.540
We've seen this diagram before.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.740
But the beauty of some of these
active learning techniques

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.600
is that their
formative assessments

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.620
of students' understanding,
of students' learning.

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.670
And so they are
actually activities

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:18.110
that happen in the class.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:23.390
But they're also measures,
informative, formative measures

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:27.170
of whether students
are learning or not.

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:30.920
So if somebody had come up with
a really terrible argument,

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.590
or it was clear that nobody
had read any of the papers

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:36.710
on the active learning
research, then I

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:39.520
would know that
from this debate.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.775
I know what you've read
and what you haven't read,

00:40:41.775 --> 00:40:43.400
and what you're
thinking about and what

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.862
you're not thinking about.

00:40:44.862 --> 00:40:47.195
And I get a good sense for
whether or not it you know it

00:40:47.195 --> 00:40:48.778
and how much and how
well you know it.

00:40:48.778 --> 00:40:51.350
And so do you.

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:52.850
And we'll see that
a little bit more

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:55.058
in these other situations,
where if you get a clicker

00:40:55.058 --> 00:40:57.980
question wrong or you get a
multiple choice question wrong

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:01.190
or that you can't participate
in the lightning round,

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:04.696
then you know that you've
got to step up to the plate.

00:41:04.696 --> 00:41:06.320
Or you need to try
something different.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.140
Or you're not really getting it.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.310
So you get information.

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:11.660
The learner gets information.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.739
And the teacher
gets information.

00:41:13.739 --> 00:41:15.780
AUDIENCE: I just thought
that was really powerful

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.420
in the readings, as well.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:19.321
They mentioned that,
that students who,

00:41:19.321 --> 00:41:20.820
when they get in
the group sections,

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:24.140
if it's clear they really are
getting a lot of things wrong,

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.660
they know they need to step up.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:29.930
And that's in a different way, I
think, than getting a bad grade

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:30.500
on a paper.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.530
And you know the average
distribution or whatever.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:35.240
Or the professor
says you're wrong.

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.390
But when you know that the
people sitting right next

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:41.140
to you are getting it and you're
not, that really, I think,

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:45.501
will push the student
forward to do something.

00:41:45.501 --> 00:41:47.000
JANET RANKIN: It's
news you can use.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.620
It's information.

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:50.540
And then you're not
being penalized.

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:51.950
You're not in trouble.

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:54.680
It's not affecting
your grade if you

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.950
act on it, if you take the
information and use it.

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:00.640
So that's why, I think
that's the beauty of it.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.420
There are many, many
active learning techniques.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.940
And if you looked at the
website from University

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.310
of South Florida
has just, I think,

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:12.980
it's close to 200 techniques
for what you might do.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.380
I'm doing a bit of a--

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.940
I call it the foie gras method.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.810
You know how they
make foie gras?

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:22.430
They force feed the goose.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:23.690
So I'm going to give a lot.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:25.580
And we're going to do a lot
of different active learning

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.810
things in this session.

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:30.424
It's a little bit comical.

00:42:30.424 --> 00:42:32.090
I know it's kind of
funny how many we're

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:34.117
trying to cram into two hours.

00:42:34.117 --> 00:42:35.450
But I'm going to try to do that.

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:37.520
So we'll do some of these.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.310
And we can talk about any
one of them in particular.

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:45.590
But a nice one to get students
in the frame of your class

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:46.940
is to they come in.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.010
And they have five minutes
before you do anything

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:51.890
to write down what they thought
was the most interesting part

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:54.440
of the reading or answer
a certain question related

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:58.520
to the reading or solve a
problem or whatever it is.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.600
You give them a prompt.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.320
You sit down.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.740
You focus them.

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.090
And then they're off.

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:10.360
I do want to just focus on the
word active for just a second.

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:13.120
It may help you to think
about active and interactive

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:13.934
learning.

00:43:13.934 --> 00:43:15.600
There's all sorts of
ways to chop it up.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.030
And at some level,
it's semantics.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:20.710
But at some level, it isn't.

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:23.110
So students can be
active if they're

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:25.900
sitting by themselves
thinking about something

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:28.360
and writing something
down or solving a problem.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.887
That is active learning.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:36.170
They don't have to be
talking to each other.

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:43.320
You can do active learning
in a class of 3,000 people.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.040
Stop and think.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.860
Answer this question.

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.570
That's active learning.

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:52.260
That's way more than
happens in a lot of classes.

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:54.870
Interactive learning generally
implies that students

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:57.250
are talking to each other.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:00.390
That's the most general
categorizations you can get,

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:04.070
active, interactive.

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:05.900
So we're going to
do a bunch of stuff

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:11.526
with clickers or
plickers, these things.

00:44:11.526 --> 00:44:13.400
But there's some other
techniques you can do.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.345
You can put up a
graph or an image.

00:44:15.345 --> 00:44:16.970
And you could say,
OK, somebody come up

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:19.250
and show me the green
boundary in this picture.

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:21.080
Show me a triple junction.

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:25.910
Show me where the building, the
crack in the building started.

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:28.450
Show me whatever.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:29.540
And you pass the pointer.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.914
And then you have
the student who

00:44:30.914 --> 00:44:32.990
has the pointer come up
with another question

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:35.570
and pass it to somebody else.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:42.480
So that's another nice technique
that takes the responsibility

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:47.440
off of the teacher.

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:51.522
And so you're not
picking on students.

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:53.480
We've been doing mud
cards, think, pair, share.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.130
We're going to do
a lightning round.

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:57.530
I'll talk a little bit
more about jigsaw later.

00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:59.180
And if time allows,
I'll show you

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:03.650
a demo I did on diffusion using
the students as the atoms.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:13.690
Sometimes if you're trying
to ease in active learning,

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:17.800
slowly into your class-- you
don't want to do too much--

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.290
you want to think about
the short time things that

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:23.700
don't require huge disruptions.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.800
If you want to go back
to your seats, you can.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.730
Maybe I should let
you guys do that.

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:29.240
So you know what we'll do?

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.690
While they're
taking a break, I'm

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:33.540
going to demo the beach ball.

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:34.810
So this is nice.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.390
This is the beach
ball technique.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:38.790
So when you catch
the ball, I'd like

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:41.050
you to tell me if you've
had any experiences

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:44.565
with active learning in
classes that you've taken.

00:45:44.565 --> 00:45:45.773
And you can't count this one.

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:54.453
AUDIENCE: I had active learning
in my electricity and magnetism

00:45:54.453 --> 00:45:55.355
class.

00:45:55.355 --> 00:45:58.760
And that was called TEAL.

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.410
And it's very polarized.

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:04.630
The people for and against
it, especially the students.

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:08.338
So they basically
tables of nine.

00:46:08.338 --> 00:46:11.125
And then within that table,
you had groups of three.

00:46:11.125 --> 00:46:13.250
And each of those would be
a problem solving group.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.918
So you'd have four problems
to solve per two hour class

00:46:16.918 --> 00:46:17.512
period.

00:46:17.512 --> 00:46:19.345
And that would be going
up to the board look

00:46:19.345 --> 00:46:20.470
and doing it by themselves.

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:22.803
And then the teacher at the
end would reveal the answers

00:46:22.803 --> 00:46:24.280
and tell us how
to go through it.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:27.830
And, for my group at
least, there was always--

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:29.251
or my table--

00:46:29.251 --> 00:46:30.750
there was always
this one person who

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:32.910
would write every single time--

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:37.100
JANET RANKIN: 3,000 People.

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:37.790
Stop and think.

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:39.630
Answer this question.

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.340
That's active learning.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:46.030
That's way more that
happens in a lot of classes.

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:48.640
Interactive learning generally
implies that students

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.830
are talking to each other.

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:53.710
And that's the most
general categorizations

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:57.840
you can get active, interactive.

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.750
So we're going to do a bunch
of stuff with clickers,

00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:05.296
or plickers, these things.

00:47:05.296 --> 00:47:07.170
But there's some other
techniques you can do.

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:09.115
You can put up a
graph or an image.

00:47:09.115 --> 00:47:10.740
And you could say,
OK, somebody come up

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:13.020
and show me the green
boundary in this picture.

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:16.290
Show me a triple junction.

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:19.690
Show me where the building, the
crack in the building started.

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:22.230
Show me whatever.

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:23.310
And you pass the pointer.

00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:24.684
And then you have
the student who

00:47:24.684 --> 00:47:26.790
has the pointer come up
with another question

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:29.370
and pass it to somebody else.

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:36.250
So that's another nice technique
that takes the responsibility

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:41.112
off of the teacher.

00:47:41.112 --> 00:47:42.695
And so you're not
picking on students.

00:47:45.302 --> 00:47:47.260
We've been doing mud
cards, think, pair, share.

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:48.910
We're going to do
a lightning round.

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:51.310
I'll talk a little bit
more about jigsaw later on.

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:52.960
And if time allows,
I'll show you

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:57.175
a demo I did on diffusion using
the students as the atoms.

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:07.460
Sometimes if you're trying
to ease in active learning,

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:10.160
slowly into your class--

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.600
you don't want to do too much--

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.060
you want to think about
the short time things that

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:17.470
don't require huge disruptions.

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:19.550
If you want to go back
to your seats, you can.

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:22.750
Maybe I should let
you guys do that.

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:24.250
So you know what we'll do?

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:25.730
While they're
taking a break, I'm

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:28.580
going to demo the beach ball.

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.880
So this is nice.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.430
This is the beach
ball technique.

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:33.830
So when you catch
the ball, I'd like

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:36.090
you to tell me if you've
had any experiences

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:39.190
with active learning in
classes that you've taken.

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:40.776
And you can't count this one.

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.697
AUDIENCE: I had active learning
in my electricity and magnetism

00:48:49.697 --> 00:48:50.197
class.

00:48:50.197 --> 00:48:54.040
And that was called TEAL.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.756
It's very polarized, the people
for and against it, especially

00:48:58.756 --> 00:48:59.870
the students.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:03.731
So we basically
had tables of nine.

00:49:03.731 --> 00:49:05.856
And then within that table,
we had groups of three.

00:49:05.856 --> 00:49:07.980
And each of those would be
a problem solving group.

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:11.973
So you'd have four problems
to solve per two hour class

00:49:11.973 --> 00:49:12.473
period.

00:49:12.473 --> 00:49:14.098
And that would be
going up to the board

00:49:14.098 --> 00:49:16.647
and doing it by themselves.
and then the teacher at the end

00:49:16.647 --> 00:49:18.230
would reveal the
answer and telling us

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:19.565
how to go through it.

00:49:19.565 --> 00:49:22.952
And for my group at least--

00:49:22.952 --> 00:49:25.638
or my table-- there
was always this one who

00:49:25.638 --> 00:49:28.370
would write every single time.

00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:30.680
And I feel like that detracted
from active learning.

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.430
I think it worked
better for other people.

00:49:35.224 --> 00:49:36.890
JANET RANKIN: It's
definitely polarized.

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:38.062
Students really are not--

00:49:38.062 --> 00:49:39.770
I think we talked a
little bit about this

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:42.950
when we did some of
the learning theories--

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:46.220
but students really are
polarized about whether they

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:48.110
like it or not.

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:51.830
The data that there's been
some pretty good analysis

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:54.350
of learning, measuring
how much students learn,

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:56.990
and then how much they retain
and all that kind of stuff.

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:59.240
And when you go
through that, students

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:03.710
seem to learn more and retain
more in the active learning

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:06.770
format, even though they
really at least half of them

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:08.010
don't like it at all.

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:10.920
So it's an
interesting commentary

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.410
That's a good great story.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:13.993
So why don't you
give the ball a toss?

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:17.505
There you go.

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:22.010
No, you have to
answer a question.

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:24.560
Have you ever experienced
active learning

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.270
in a classroom
besides this class?

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:29.510
And how did it work or not work?

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:31.580
AUDIENCE: I would
say yes to that.

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:35.347
It's definitely the traditional
method, sitting in front,

00:50:35.347 --> 00:50:36.780
face to face lecture.

00:50:39.437 --> 00:50:40.520
JANET RANKIN: Fair enough.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:41.695
Give a toss, toss to anyone.

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.770
Are we going to get the
same answer from all of you?

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:50.044
If it's just--

00:50:50.044 --> 00:50:51.460
AUDIENCE: Is it
the same question?

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.840
JANET RANKIN: Yeah,
same question.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.638
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have.

00:50:56.638 --> 00:50:59.720
Because I recently
studied in Sweden.

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.000
And that's the way, most
of the time that way,

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:03.970
they teach in Sweden.

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:10.494
So for some classes, generally
in higher level classes,

00:51:10.494 --> 00:51:13.910
according with d-level classes,
they use active learning.

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:17.870
JANET RANKIN: Great and
students buy into it?

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:18.730
They're OK with it?

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:21.034
They work at it?

00:51:21.034 --> 00:51:23.472
AUDIENCE: Culturally,
they tend to veer

00:51:23.472 --> 00:51:24.472
towards active learning.

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:29.200
JANET RANKIN: And that's
a very interesting point,

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:34.801
the idea that it can
be a cultural thing.

00:51:34.801 --> 00:51:37.660
If everybody else is doing
it, or it's expected,

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:39.070
then that's what you do right.

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:43.210
So some of these changes,
there's an incubation period

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:46.427
before they actually take off
and they're widely accepted.

00:51:46.427 --> 00:51:47.968
AUDIENCE: In fact
in Denmark, I think

00:51:47.968 --> 00:51:50.805
that's the only way they each.

00:51:50.805 --> 00:51:52.180
JANET RANKIN: It's
pretty active.

00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:54.860
I have a colleague
who's in, or friend

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.600
who works at the
University of Copenhagen,

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:03.670
and all new faculty have to take
a yearlong course on teaching,

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:07.690
no matter what department,
physics, math, a year long,

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:08.530
the faculty.

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:13.030
And here you could never force
the faculty to do anything.

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:14.770
So it's pretty
interesting that they've

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:16.140
been doing it for so long.

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.765
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about that.

00:52:17.765 --> 00:52:24.106
Is it the way that professors,
their role as actual teachers

00:52:24.106 --> 00:52:25.097
is viewed?

00:52:25.097 --> 00:52:25.597
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:25.597 --> 00:52:27.088
But seriously,
people [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:27.088 --> 00:52:30.402
or something, I think definitely
trying to enforce a teaching

00:52:30.402 --> 00:52:31.860
class would be a
lot more receptive

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.290
than if you tried to enforce
that here, where teaching

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:38.210
isn't necessarily the focus.

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:42.890
JANET RANKIN: But there, it's
a good research university.

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:45.732
But on the teaching
side, that's the norm.

00:52:45.732 --> 00:52:46.690
That's the expectation.

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:47.690
AUDIENCE: But what
about requiring--

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:49.190
I know it's hard when
you have professors

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:50.564
that have been
doing what they're

00:52:50.564 --> 00:52:53.026
doing for 25, 30, 40 years.

00:52:53.026 --> 00:52:54.942
It's hard to get them
to adopt new techniques.

00:52:54.942 --> 00:52:57.796
But I think that requiring
things-- the faculty

00:52:57.796 --> 00:53:01.212
that you can require things
of are the new faculty, who

00:53:01.212 --> 00:53:03.650
have no power yet.

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:05.360
JANET RANKIN: Yes and no.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.450
If the tenured system, the
requirements for tenure

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:13.700
don't change, then asking
them to take on new-- oh,

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.410
you guys should try
active learning.

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:16.670
Revamp this course.

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:18.980
And then they don't get tenure.

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:21.740
So it really has to be
a whole systemic change,

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.680
where the department buys in.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.180
The school buys in.

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:27.950
The university buys
in and says, OK, these

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:29.750
are the criteria for tenure.

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:34.070
And in that is you have
to use active learning.

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:35.210
Or you have to--

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:36.960
that's where it would
have to get change.

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.780
Otherwise you
can't expect people

00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:40.460
that aren't tenured to do it.

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:41.780
You shouldn't.

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.250
Let's give the
ball one more toss.

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:53.316
AUDIENCE: So it's
been a long time

00:53:53.316 --> 00:53:54.618
since I've been in a classroom.

00:53:54.618 --> 00:53:59.010
I would say, in a
regular classroom,

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:01.286
I don't that I've
been in a class that

00:54:01.286 --> 00:54:02.350
does active learning.

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:08.309
But I have taken courses
that are largely lab courses,

00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:09.850
like a mouse embryology
course, where

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:14.896
you have 15 minutes of lecture.

00:54:14.896 --> 00:54:17.190
And then you go into
the lab And you do it.

00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:19.479
And the professor will
walk around and help you

00:54:19.479 --> 00:54:20.270
with the technique.

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:21.770
You're actually
there with the mice.

00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:24.160
And you're actually
doing something.

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.750
So does that count?

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:31.430
JANET RANKIN: Lab courses
can be their own genre.

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:34.310
But there has been
this movement to take

00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:39.130
that's a little bit of what TEAL
does, at a more simple level.

00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:40.820
And there's a little
bit of lecture.

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.111
And then students are supposed
to answer some questions

00:54:43.111 --> 00:54:44.240
or do something.

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.280
And then they come
back together.

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.880
And Studio Labs at WPI
has that same format,

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:53.600
where the classrooms are
built with lab benches.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:57.710
And students sit at lab
benches and see a lecture.

00:54:57.710 --> 00:55:00.110
And then they do
some experiments.

00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:01.310
They're mini experiments.

00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:07.190
It's not whole mouse dissection.

00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:09.140
But they do a mini experiment.

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.700
And then they report back.

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.530
And there's an
interchange like that.

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:17.330
So there are some
blending of the two.

00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:20.390
Often what people do
in labs is different.

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:23.405
And usually a good
lab is fabulous.

00:55:23.405 --> 00:55:26.120
A good lab is fabulous, which
is another argument for why

00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.394
active learning is
good, because everybody

00:55:28.394 --> 00:55:30.560
thinks back about, oh, that
lab course was so great.

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.040
I learned so much
and did so much.

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.980
And yet that's the lab course.

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.220
And then we have the lecture.

00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:40.440
So it's an interesting comment.

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.200
So that was the beach ball.

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.090
And you see you
guys got to throw

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:45.890
the ball at other students.

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:48.290
So I didn't have
to pick on every--

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:50.420
I didn't have to call on
people or pick on people.

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:56.390
I had a little demo here
about why it's important,

00:55:56.390 --> 00:56:01.280
just if you ask a question
or you ask students

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.629
if there are any questions
or what questions they have.

00:56:04.629 --> 00:56:06.170
And that's generally
a better phrase.

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:08.330
What questions do you have?

00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:11.900
It's more welcoming, opposed to
saying OK, who's stupid enough.

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:15.010
Who's not following me?

00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:17.980
Say, OK, what are the questions?

00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:20.540
It's a more welcoming phrase.

00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:23.300
But the idea of waiting.

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:26.000
So here, if I click
on this little guy,

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:31.380
you should hear 30
seconds of music.

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:33.890
So imagine you ask a question,
30 seconds for people

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:36.210
to think about it and
formulate an answer.

00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:41.240
This is what 30 seconds
feels like of dead time.

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:43.098
Well, there'll be music.

00:56:43.098 --> 00:56:46.062
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:57:07.259 --> 00:57:08.175
That's not part of it.

00:57:15.734 --> 00:57:17.150
So did that feel
like a long time?

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:20.270
I know we had a
little break there.

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:22.580
But that feels like a lot.

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:24.650
Especially when you're
standing up here,

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:25.970
it feels like a long time.

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:30.260
But 30 seconds, give
them 30 seconds.

00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:32.767
The point is, if you want
to give students 30 seconds,

00:57:32.767 --> 00:57:34.100
you're going to have to time it.

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:37.010
You totally have to time it,
because you will not estimate

00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:38.990
30 seconds effectively.

00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:41.750
You will totally
underestimate it.

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:44.420
And then another
technique that you

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:47.450
can piggyback on that is
saying, OK, take 30 seconds.

00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:51.170
I'm not going to take any
answers for 30 seconds.

00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:52.790
So you may have an
answer right away.

00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:54.590
But I don't want to
hear it for 30 seconds,

00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:56.465
because there's always
that guy in the front.

00:57:56.465 --> 00:57:59.060
I had this guy in my
high school math class.

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:01.540
And he used to sit on his--
this little short guy--

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.821
and he used to sit on
his foot on the chair.

00:58:03.821 --> 00:58:04.570
He's on his chair.

00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:05.750
And he's sitting on his foot.

00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:06.740
And he had his hand like this.

00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:07.910
And he was in the front row.

00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:11.870
And whenever the teacher asked
the question, he would go.

00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:14.079
And he would come up off of it.

00:58:14.079 --> 00:58:16.370
And so he was always the guy
that answer the questions.

00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:21.452
But that left some of us
who took a little more time

00:58:21.452 --> 00:58:22.910
not having the
opportunity, kind of

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:27.090
like having the one person write
all the time in the TEAL group.

00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:31.830
So that's a good way
to go about that.

00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:34.910
We talk a little bit about
using clicker questions

00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:35.770
to solicit feedback.

00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:37.520
And we've used the
plickers in this class.

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:40.430
We'll use them again.

00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:44.280
You can get dedicated
clickers, these dedicated punch

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:44.870
in things.

00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:47.492
They use them for TEAL, I think.

00:58:47.492 --> 00:58:48.950
Students may have
to purchase them.

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:49.790
That may cost money.

00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:51.498
The department may
have to purchase them.

00:58:51.498 --> 00:58:53.202
That's another source of money.

00:58:53.202 --> 00:58:55.720
AUDIENCE: They make
us buy everything.

00:58:55.720 --> 00:59:00.520
JANET RANKIN: So when I
was at Brown, actually,

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:01.770
the department would buy them.

00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:03.360
And they'd leave
them in the library.

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:06.120
And then you could check them
out with your student ID.

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.550
And then you got that.

00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:09.090
So you got it for the semester.

00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:10.050
But it was linked to your ID.

00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:12.466
And if you didn't bring it
back, they'd charge you for it.

00:59:12.466 --> 00:59:16.840
But that's another way to do
it, a fairer way to do it.

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:20.195
We'll look at something
called Socrative later on.

00:59:20.195 --> 00:59:21.070
I'll use it later on.

00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:22.410
But it's a text.

00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:23.860
It's an online format.

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:27.030
So students need a
smartphone or a laptop.

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:29.490
But they don't need
a separate clicker.

00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:32.550
There are issues with that,
because not everybody is

00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:33.780
going to have a smartphone.

00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:37.590
And are you biasing your class
against people that don't

00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:40.320
happen to have the technology?

00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:42.510
This is why I like
plickers, because you

00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:43.890
don't need to buy anything.

00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:45.090
I give you the card.

00:59:45.090 --> 00:59:48.330
And I need to have
the smartphone.

00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:49.980
But you don't.

00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:51.900
And then you could
always use index cards

00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:54.570
or do the whole,
put one finger up

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:57.480
if you think it's A and two
if it's B and three if it's

00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:01.050
C. That gets a little
tough in a bigger class,

01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:02.550
because it's hard to see.

01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:04.710
It's hard to count.

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:08.160
I like the fact that
the clickers, plickers,

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.990
and the Socrative
or Poll Everywhere

01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:11.290
give you a histogram.

01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:14.330
So you get a really quick
idea about who's getting it

01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:17.566
and who isn't getting it.

01:00:17.566 --> 01:00:19.190
So we're going to do
a couple of these.

01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:21.950
Remember-- this is from
the label of the free body

01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:28.640
diagram-- that these
misconceptions always

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.500
linger in a lecture class.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:34.940
We talked about this free
diagram the other day.

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.240
So let's just try this one here,
give you another little warm up

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.320
on the picker's.

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.640
So you have the card.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:47.290
And I'm just going to ask
you to look at the question.

01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:52.180
And when you're ready to
answer, just hold up your card.

01:00:52.180 --> 01:01:00.020
And if you can keep your
finger away from the pattern,

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:05.000
that would be great, because
it makes it hard to read it.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.360
And then however you want to--

01:01:14.932 --> 01:01:16.890
AUDIENCE: Does this work
for larger classrooms?

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:18.300
JANET RANKIN: It does.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.490
I have a colleague
who uses it at Brown.

01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:22.950
And he just started
teaching this semester.

01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:24.610
And he showed me his--

01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:28.560
or a friend-- he
showed me his plickers.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.460
And he printed them
out on 8 by 10,

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.220
like a sheet of
paper, cardstock.

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:37.380
And they're enormous.

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.540
They're like this big.

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.951
AUDIENCE: How do you
not get [INAUDIBLE]?

01:01:41.951 --> 01:01:43.450
Well Well they have
to hold them up.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:44.040
You have to.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.581
And you can walk
around a little bit.

01:01:45.581 --> 01:01:47.320
But I'll show you this.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.990
So I have the histogram.

01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:53.100
And I measured everybody.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:56.100
So now I know what you
think about this question.

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.677
I know who's got it right.

01:01:57.677 --> 01:01:59.010
I don't know who's got it right.

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:12.260
But I know that most of you
have chosen the correct answer.

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:17.220
But there were a
few of you picked up

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:18.790
one of the other answers.

01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:23.440
And so now I know that it's a
non-trivial number of you that

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.000
picked an incorrect answer.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.950
So now I know exactly
what I need to do.

01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:31.690
It's given me incredibly
good information

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:33.160
that there is some
out there that

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.640
have a pretty strong
misunderstanding

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.920
of the literature.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.420
And that's that
some of you picked

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:48.070
A. There's a lot of data to
support that active learning,

01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:50.746
active technique supports
student learning.

01:02:50.746 --> 01:02:52.495
I call your attention
to the Freeman paper

01:02:52.495 --> 01:02:55.810
that's in the reading for
today, also to the [? Haik ?]

01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:58.320
article, which was referenced.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:01.010
So those are two of the
more compelling readings.

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:03.820
But if you go through, you'll
see quite a few studies

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:08.890
that unambiguously show that
active learning has an impact.

01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:11.770
So the incorrect answer is that
it always involves group work.

01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:12.610
That's not true.

01:03:12.610 --> 01:03:13.930
It doesn't always involve work.

01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:15.760
As we said, you could
just ask students

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.730
to sit and think and then do
something with their thoughts.

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:20.200
And that would be active.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.770
So Rachel, you're smiling.

01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:24.380
Is there a--

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.410
OK.

01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:28.267
AUDIENCE: Sometimes my
face just does that.

01:03:28.267 --> 01:03:30.350
JANET RANKIN: I didn't
know whether it was a smirk

01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:31.620
or whatever.

01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:34.610
And did I show you
what this looks like?

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:37.410
So you can see with the
histogram looks like.

01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:38.088
I did?

01:03:38.088 --> 01:03:39.720
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:43.160
You weren't here,
though, when I did.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.490
The time I used it before.

01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:46.560
I'll show you offline.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.900
So the histogram is
really, really useful.

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:56.667
So it really can ferret
out some misunderstanding.

01:03:56.667 --> 01:03:58.250
We don't have to go
through all these.

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:01.537
But this is another way to
check for misunderstanding.

01:04:01.537 --> 01:04:02.870
I can ask this kind of question.

01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:03.870
It's a concept question.

01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:06.030
It's a conceptual question.

01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:08.790
And then I can ask
you to pick an answer.

01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:13.020
And then I can see where
your misconceptions

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:15.150
lie about this topic.

01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:19.110
So it can be very, very-- it
should be very, very focused.

01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:20.490
It's not just a
busywork question

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:23.650
it's a focused question
with focus distractors.

01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:27.315
The distractors are
the incorrect answers.

01:04:27.315 --> 01:04:28.356
AUDIENCE: Can we do this?

01:04:28.356 --> 01:04:30.150
I want to see what the
spread of answers is.

01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.950
JANET RANKIN: Sure.

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:31.140
Let's do it.

01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:32.639
AUDIENCE: They asked
this question--

01:04:32.639 --> 01:04:35.246
I laughed, because they
asked a very similar question

01:04:35.246 --> 01:04:37.140
at Harvard graduation.

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:38.800
JANET RANKIN: Exactly.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.036
What was it called,
a world of their own?

01:04:41.036 --> 01:04:42.202
AUDIENCE: Yeah one of those.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.270
JANET RANKIN: Two times, check.

01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:49.454
I've got to clear my responses.

01:04:54.843 --> 01:04:55.343
Let's go.

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:03.780
So I'm getting you folks in
the back without a problem.

01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:11.470
I got one.

01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:12.987
I'm missing one of you.

01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:19.507
Wow.

01:05:19.507 --> 01:05:21.340
So there's any number
of things I could ask.

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:22.881
We're going to do
another pair, share

01:05:22.881 --> 01:05:24.430
around this kind of thing.

01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:26.200
But maybe not for this one.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:28.060
But this is amazing.

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:31.180
Basically it's A
got three votes.

01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:32.000
B got three votes.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.350
C got four votes.

01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:34.330
And D got three votes.

01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:41.132
So it's pretty amazing.

01:05:41.132 --> 01:05:42.590
AUDIENCE: What is
the right answer?

01:05:45.399 --> 01:05:46.440
JANET RANKIN: Biologists?

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:52.106
AUDIENCE: B.

01:05:52.106 --> 01:05:56.600
JANET RANKIN: The answer
is B. And it's the most--

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.000
maybe not surprising--
but the idea

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.490
that it's taking in
things from the air.

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:04.100
They're taking in gases.

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:08.600
But there's chemical reactions
which manifest themselves

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.672
in a weight gain.

01:06:10.672 --> 01:06:13.152
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:22.630
It's not a biology
class, which is why--

01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:25.170
so that's just super telling.

01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:26.250
That would be incredible.

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:29.300
If this were a biology class
and that was the spread,

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:31.465
that would just be
really, really informative

01:06:31.465 --> 01:06:32.256
for the instructor.

01:06:32.256 --> 01:06:33.390
AUDIENCE: Really worrying.

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:34.320
JANET RANKIN: Well
yeah, that too.

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.420
But it's biology class.

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.045
So don't worry.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.890
But you do want to think
very, very carefully

01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:43.080
about the wrong
answers, because you

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.940
want the wrong
answers to tell you

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:48.088
something about what students
understand or don't understand.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.360
Generally speaking in
the adoption of clickers,

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:59.570
plickers, whatever, takes
a three step process.

01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:01.150
One is that people
generally start

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:04.660
with these simple
fact questions,

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:07.200
and then more challenging
conceptual questions, which

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.720
I would put the
one we just did at.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.700
That students, they might--

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:16.450
arguing with each
other could be useful.

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:18.490
And then the third
is you've just

01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:20.080
totally revamped the lecture.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.980
And it's all centered
around these questions.

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:23.740
And depending on
how students answer,

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:27.460
that's how you navigate
through the lecture

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.860
or through the
course, class period.

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:33.210
I would never recommend that
anybody start with this one.

01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:36.190
I think that we're all capable
of starting with two actually.

01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:39.610
And I think starting with
three may be a waste of time,

01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:41.860
unless you really just want
to check and see if people

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:42.770
did the reading or something.

01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:43.280
It's a big class.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.488
And you just want to see if
they've done the reading.

01:07:45.488 --> 01:07:47.912
But in general, I would
say put your energy

01:07:47.912 --> 01:07:49.870
into coming up with some
really good questions.

01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:51.040
And maybe don't ask as many.

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:56.890
And then as I keep
saying, I hope

01:07:56.890 --> 01:08:00.257
you can start to see how
that's really, really linked.

01:08:00.257 --> 01:08:01.840
It's a measure of
whether they get it.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.756
But it's also an activity
to help them get it.

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.220
So I've been minoring
the Back Channel.

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:13.630
Nobody's saying anything
except for Dave.

01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:15.780
And I answered him.

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:17.600
And because I gave
you a break before,

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:22.439
I may scoot on, continue on.

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:28.396
So if you want take a second
and login, that's fine.

01:08:28.396 --> 01:08:29.020
But I may not--

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:31.994
AUDIENCE: That's the
link for last year's.

01:08:31.994 --> 01:08:34.827
AUDIENCE: I entered it, and I
put entered into last year's.

01:08:34.827 --> 01:08:35.910
And I got really confused.

01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:36.840
JANET RANKIN: Uh oh.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.029
So the one for this
year is back here.

01:08:39.029 --> 01:08:40.425
Hold on.

01:08:40.425 --> 01:08:42.700
AUDIENCE: It's like
four something,

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:45.044
4125 instead of 3969.

01:08:45.044 --> 01:08:46.335
JANET RANKIN: Oh OK, thank you.

01:08:55.969 --> 01:08:57.510
So while you're
doing that, I'm going

01:08:57.510 --> 01:09:01.460
to set up something which
is called lightning round.

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:04.819
And we're doing these two.

01:09:04.819 --> 01:09:07.760
So I'm going to just,
sitting in your seat,

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:13.100
if you can think about this
question, just the question

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:13.970
on the left.

01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:15.830
Based on research
at NASA, what was

01:09:15.830 --> 01:09:18.020
the approximate net global
change in temperature

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:22.819
between 1880 and 1975?

01:09:22.819 --> 01:09:25.170
It's not a plicker question.

01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:26.179
It's just a question.

01:09:26.179 --> 01:09:28.179
Try to think about what
you think the answer is.

01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:39.656
AUDIENCE: What is
Celsius to Fahrenheit?

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:46.010
JANET RANKIN: To get from
Celsius to Fahrenheit?

01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:47.439
So you have to--

01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:49.149
well I always just
double it and add 30.

01:09:51.729 --> 01:10:01.562
So it's 8/5 plus 32.

01:10:01.562 --> 01:10:02.910
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:05.370
8/56 plus 32 is
the real equation.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:27.195
Is it 8/5 or 9/5?

01:10:27.195 --> 01:10:27.695
AUDIENCE: 9.

01:10:27.695 --> 01:10:33.405
JANET RANKIN: 9/5 That's
why I just double it.

01:10:33.405 --> 01:10:34.375
Close enough.

01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:48.110
So what I'm going to ask
is that-- let's see--

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:52.970
David, Gordon, and Julie.

01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:59.330
And if you can move down,
down, just to the end.

01:10:59.330 --> 01:11:09.320
And then if Adam, [INAUDIBLE],
Dave can come around?

01:11:22.284 --> 01:11:22.950
Just keep going.

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:24.900
Keep going.

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:25.860
Keep going.

01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:27.540
That's fine.

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:29.160
One, two, three, four-- no, no.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.440
You have to stand up, guys.

No relaxing.

01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:35.890
Yes, but that's not--

01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:37.110
I can tell a story.

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:39.600
Please stand up and move over.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.990
Move over.

need six, Michelle

next to [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:56.931 --> 01:11:58.520
That's fine.

Now [INAUDIBLE],
you come around here

01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:06.410
please, and go
opposite David, please.

01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:08.870
And everybody else just file
in and go opposite someone.

Sarah, do you want
to participate?

01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:23.530
So here's what happens.

01:12:23.530 --> 01:12:24.930
I'm going to tell you to go.

And you have two minutes.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.200
The person in this line
takes some amount of time

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:36.420
and says what their answer
is and why they chose it.

And the person in that line
can ask questions or whatever,

and then say what they thought
and say why they thought that.

So you're going to have a
really quick conversation

01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:46.770
about your choices.

01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:50.790
And after two minutes, I'm going
to tell you to please stop.

01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:54.870
And then you have
to get a new person.

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:56.520
And I'll show you
how to do that.

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.380
Everybody understand
what we're doing?

01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:00.840
You're having a two
minute exchange of ideas.

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:02.970
And it's going to be loud.

01:13:02.970 --> 01:13:03.500
Believe me.

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.265
And it's the person
opposite you.

01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:11.330
Are you ready?

01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:13.450
Everyone ready?

01:13:13.450 --> 01:13:19.030
On your mark, get set, go.

01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:21.230
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:13:45.594 --> 01:13:46.510
Let me ask a question.

01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:49.860
Did you encounter people that
had different choices than you?

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.500
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:53.350
JANET RANKIN: Yes.

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:58.360
So that generally means
it's a pretty good question,

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.760
because you get to hear lots
of different perspectives.

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:05.050
Now if this were the central
part of the class, this topic,

01:14:05.050 --> 01:14:08.680
you might let the pairings
go even longer, even more

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.240
pairings.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:13.090
So did anybody change
their mind based on what

01:14:13.090 --> 01:14:14.545
they heard a partner say?

01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:20.002
OK, a couple of you.

01:14:20.002 --> 01:14:21.460
Generally, what
happens then is you

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:23.860
would want to have
a de-brief, where

01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:27.040
we talk about why you
picked the answer you picked

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.810
and what you picked.

01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:31.180
And most of the
time, the choices

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.950
are a little been informative.

01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:36.970
If you found, as the instructor,
that everybody picked

01:14:36.970 --> 01:14:40.420
a negative number, well you're
in a very different place

01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:44.920
than if people are arguing
over how much positive it is.

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.630
So you're going to
use that information

01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:52.340
to find out about where
the misconceptions are.

01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:54.216
What's the advantage
of this method?

01:14:58.522 --> 01:14:59.384
Gordon.

01:14:59.384 --> 01:15:02.003
AUDIENCE: It's very
interesting, I thought.

01:15:02.003 --> 01:15:05.044
One I found out is that the
students talk to each other.

01:15:05.044 --> 01:15:07.529
We never talk to each other.

01:15:07.529 --> 01:15:12.002
And it's easier for
them as to [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:12.002 --> 01:15:16.105
So at the beginning, they
are aware of conflicts.

01:15:16.105 --> 01:15:19.556
But as we rotated,
there was a convergence.

01:15:19.556 --> 01:15:22.514
It was very interesting.

01:15:22.514 --> 01:15:25.965
JANET RANKIN: [INAUDIBLE]
have your hand up.

01:15:25.965 --> 01:15:30.410
AUDIENCE: Yes, one time
I was laughing just

01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:32.330
because it was very effective.

01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:34.903
There was so much [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:34.903 --> 01:15:39.020
And when we started,
one resisted

01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:42.620
some passionated idea about
this is how it should be.

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:44.370
And by the time it
went to all the people,

01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:46.860
people can get all the idea.

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:48.880
You try to look for
the superior idea.

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:52.410
Then you decide,
oh, this is better.

01:15:52.410 --> 01:15:56.933
When we try to switch again,
you listen to a better argument.

01:15:59.630 --> 01:16:02.298
So from which one decides
without [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:02.298 --> 01:16:03.170
the first one?

01:16:05.615 --> 01:16:06.990
JANET RANKIN: A
couple of points.

01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:11.190
One is that it's impossible not
to-- when you pair people up,

01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:16.190
it's pretty hard for
somebody not to participate.

01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:18.000
So if you have somebody
that's resistant,

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.250
they might still be resistant.

01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:21.914
But it's virtually impossible
for them not to participate.

01:16:21.914 --> 01:16:23.330
And also it's a
little less scary.

01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:24.710
One person, it's really noisy.

01:16:24.710 --> 01:16:27.168
You know you only have to talk
to them for a minute or two.

01:16:27.168 --> 01:16:28.790
So it's a little less scary.

01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:30.950
Everybody's doing it.

01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:33.800
The other thing is that
you definitely want

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.660
to have some sort of de-brief.

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:38.002
You can't just stop and
go, OK, let's go on.

01:16:38.002 --> 01:16:40.460
You're going to have to find
out what people's answers are.

01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:43.190
And you're going to have to
address it or at least reveal

01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:46.220
the right answer, because
there's many places

01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:49.730
many, many places
for misconception.

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:52.160
And also, then, if
you do it enough,

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.260
you can maybe--
students can find

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:57.200
arguments or people's
explanations that

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.520
resonate with them.

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:02.870
And then you get exposed to
different kinds of arguments

01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:05.760
or different kinds of ways
of explaining the problem.

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:11.540
So in this case, the answer is
actually positive 0.4 degrees.

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:18.334
So B is the correct
answer, just so you know.

01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:19.750
AUDIENCE: Yes, I
just want to make

01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:23.100
a comment that sometimes this
method could be confusing

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:23.770
as well.

01:17:23.770 --> 01:17:27.102
For instance, if you listen
to two superior arguments,

01:17:27.102 --> 01:17:28.250
one against.

01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:31.840
For instance, I talked to
someone who was actually

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.155
in support of negative.

01:17:34.155 --> 01:17:37.944
And she brought an argument
and so forth like that.

01:17:37.944 --> 01:17:39.625
And somebody
thought of positive.

01:17:39.625 --> 01:17:42.210
And there was a strong
argument also for that.

01:17:42.210 --> 01:17:44.601
Sometimes if you just
be sitting on the fence,

01:17:44.601 --> 01:17:45.850
I don't know where to get off.

01:17:45.850 --> 01:17:48.670
JANET RANKIN: Well I think it's
OK to be confused for a while.

01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:49.900
That's fine.

01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:52.150
As I said, if this were a
course on global warming,

01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:55.810
climate change, whatever it
is, we would have to make sure

01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:57.940
that we heard all of
those explanations

01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:00.250
or a sampling of those
explanations and said,

01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:02.470
oh, well that's a good.

01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:03.700
I can see why you think that.

01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:06.370
But you've forgotten about this.

01:18:06.370 --> 01:18:09.100
Or I can see why, so
that you can process it

01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:11.990
all so that people
don't leave confused.

01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:14.479
But it's good to hear
the wrong answer,

01:18:14.479 --> 01:18:16.270
to be convinced of the
wrong answer, maybe,

01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:19.920
but then to see why it's wrong.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:22.590
That's an important
learning activity.

01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:25.867
AUDIENCE: But this
method is only

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:29.703
applicable for where you have
cases where you can debate.

01:18:29.703 --> 01:18:33.160
Because if you have very clear
cases, for example, if I ask,

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:37.830
what is the color of the sky?

01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:38.790
It's a definite.

01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:42.390
But when it's fuzzy,
then this can be--

01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:44.530
JANET RANKIN: Yes, or
when it's a concept

01:18:44.530 --> 01:18:47.620
you think people might
have difficulty with.

01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:52.890
Yeah, it's not going to work
if it's a real clear cut.

01:18:52.890 --> 01:18:55.890
I want to demo one more method.

01:18:55.890 --> 01:18:59.120
This is think, pair, share.

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.100
And I know we've been
doing those forever.

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:06.155
But I'm going to couple it
with a clicker question.

01:19:06.155 --> 01:19:10.790
And I think we can do
it in seven minutes.

01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:11.390
So

01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:15.110
I have two blocks here, because
this is just too fun, really.

01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:16.956
I have two blocks.

01:19:16.956 --> 01:19:19.740
They're the same
width and the same.

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:22.710
Length but they are
different thickness.

01:19:22.710 --> 01:19:25.070
And I have this thing.

01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:27.780
And I'm going to tap
on the thin block.

01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:33.872
Makes more or less--

01:19:33.872 --> 01:19:34.830
it's not really a note.

01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:38.010
But it's some sound.

01:19:38.010 --> 01:19:39.960
And I'm going to
ask you, when I do

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:46.290
the same thing, the same
force, the same place

01:19:46.290 --> 01:19:49.380
on the thick block, will
the note be higher, lower,

01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:53.970
or the same as the thin block?

01:19:53.970 --> 01:19:57.720
And this should be A, B, and
C, not one two and three.

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.520
So but if it's A,
B, and C go ahead

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:01.245
and vote with your plickers.

01:20:04.115 --> 01:20:05.990
Do you know that's what
they auto correct to?

01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:09.340
That's what it, if you're
typing and you write plickers,

01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:11.780
it autocorrects
to pluckers, which

01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:13.250
can be pretty embarrassing.

01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:17.190
AUDIENCE: So high
is for A. You've not

01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:20.330
clicked on the thicker one.

01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:21.380
JANET RANKIN: I know.

01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:25.084
That's why you have to tell
me what you think it is.

01:20:25.084 --> 01:20:26.930
AUDIENCE: Is this a A, B, and C?

01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:29.570
JANET RANKIN: A B
and C. So there's

01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:33.740
no D. There's a reason for this.

01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:36.639
If I told you the
answer, then there

01:20:36.639 --> 01:20:37.930
wouldn't be much fun in voting.

01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:48.890
And I have everybody.

01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:51.609
So I have a distribution.

01:20:51.609 --> 01:20:53.400
I'm not going to tell
you the distribution.

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:56.500
I'm not going to share that
with you I'd like you to take--

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.250
just cluster.

01:20:58.250 --> 01:21:02.330
It could be groups of three or
four, whenever you have nearby,

01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:06.369
and talk about why you
picked the answer you picked.

01:21:06.369 --> 01:21:08.910
And then I'm going to give you
the opportunity to vote again.

01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:12.890
So in the interest of time,
two minutes to discuss this.

01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:15.390
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:39.650
I wanted to just call attention
to a couple things I did.

01:21:39.650 --> 01:21:43.850
I walked around and tried to
eavesdrop on your conversations

01:21:43.850 --> 01:21:46.380
so that I could tell what
you were thinking about,

01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:48.230
but without putting
you on the spot,

01:21:48.230 --> 01:21:50.390
without asking you to say,
in front of everybody,

01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:51.410
what you thought.

01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:52.960
So that's one thing to do.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.937
Now I have a sense for
your mental models,

01:21:54.937 --> 01:21:56.520
how you're thinking
about the problem.

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.610
So I have some really
good information

01:21:58.610 --> 01:22:04.357
about why you think
the answers you think.

01:22:04.357 --> 01:22:06.690
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to give you the chance

01:22:06.690 --> 01:22:08.550
to re-vote.

01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:10.920
If you want to change
your vote, you may.

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:12.250
Or you don't have to.

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.450
Some of the clicker
software actually

01:22:19.450 --> 01:22:22.600
lets you save
consecutive histograms,

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:23.450
which can be useful.

01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:26.036
You can compare
if there's change.

01:22:26.036 --> 01:22:27.160
This doesn't let you do it.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.204
So I just have to--

01:22:28.204 --> 01:22:29.412
AUDIENCE: Voting twice there?

01:22:29.412 --> 01:22:33.974
AUDIENCE: I'm voting
for [INAUDIBLE].

01:22:33.974 --> 01:22:35.370
He's not present, so--

01:22:35.370 --> 01:22:37.460
JANET RANKIN: Voting in
Chicago, early and often.

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:54.780
We have exactly the
same distribution,

01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:59.264
which flies in the face
of some other data I

01:22:59.264 --> 01:23:00.180
was going to show you.

01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:02.660
But that's OK.

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:05.010
I'll just in the interest of--

01:23:05.010 --> 01:23:07.170
so one thing I could do
is I could call on you.

01:23:07.170 --> 01:23:09.750
And I could say, OK, if you
said it was lower, tell me

01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:11.030
why you thought it was lower.

01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:13.113
And I could get some
arguments for why you thought

01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:14.460
it was lower on the board.

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:21.330
So some people think of cellos
make lower sounds than violins.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:29.700
And some people think that doors
on mansions have a low sound.

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:35.730
And other people talked about
xylophones and the length

01:23:35.730 --> 01:23:38.960
and the wavelength
of the xylophone,

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:44.100
and the longer wavelengths
for the longer pieces.

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:50.240
So I know a lot about how you're
thinking about this problem.

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:53.410
The other thing I
know is that I am not

01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:55.150
telling you the answer yet.

01:23:55.150 --> 01:23:57.200
So there's a little bit
of suspense in here.

01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:00.400
There's a little bit to
try to keep you interested

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.944
and wanting to know, wanting
to understand the answer.

01:24:02.944 --> 01:24:03.610
AUDIENCE: Janet?

01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:04.210
JANET RANKIN: Yes?

01:24:04.210 --> 01:24:06.250
AUDIENCE: So you said we
had the same distribution.

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:08.410
But can we have a show of
hands for how many people

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:10.310
changed their answer?

01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:12.940
JANET RANKIN: That's
a great question.

01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:13.759
Yes.

01:24:13.759 --> 01:24:15.550
Raise your hand if you
changed your answer.

01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:19.980
It could've been amazing.

01:24:24.490 --> 01:24:27.190
AUDIENCE: So sometimes we've
done that in my physics class.

01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:29.150
When they ask, who
changed their answer?

01:24:29.150 --> 01:24:29.510
And everyone raises their hand.

01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:30.970
It's the same
exact distribution.

01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:33.920
Or everyone goes from
A and B to C and D.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.504
And even C and D originally
only had three people,

01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:37.670
you'll see the entire shift.

01:24:37.670 --> 01:24:40.032
And it turns out
A and B was right.

01:24:40.032 --> 01:24:42.490
When we vote the second time,
we all picked another answer.

01:24:42.490 --> 01:24:44.620
JANET RANKIN: That's very funny.

01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:45.880
That could have happened.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.610
Sometimes a nice
follow up question

01:24:47.610 --> 01:24:51.500
is how confident are
you in your answer.

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.780
So then that's a really
good-- because you

01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:55.730
may have 80% of the
people h the right answer

01:24:55.730 --> 01:24:58.220
but if you say how confident
and hardly anybody is

01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:01.650
very confident then, you do
need to talk about it some more.

01:25:01.650 --> 01:25:04.020
So it gives you some really,
really good information.

01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:06.050
So here we go.

01:25:06.050 --> 01:25:06.770
Here's this one.

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:13.778
It's higher.

01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:18.972
Exact same material.

01:25:18.972 --> 01:25:21.680
AUDIENCE: So when you play
the marimba and the xylophone,

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:22.950
you have bigger bars.

01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:25.609
That they get really thin
when they're on the bass.

01:25:25.609 --> 01:25:26.900
The bass notes are really thin.

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:31.654
And the really small high notes,
they're really, really thick.

01:25:31.654 --> 01:25:33.070
JANET RANKIN: So
that's one thing.

01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:34.760
The other thing is
that on a xylophone,

01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:37.950
it's a standing wave, because
you fixed the endpoints.

01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:41.010
And the wave just vibrates
based on the length

01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:44.520
of the pins, the separation
of the pins or the mounts.

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:48.280
So in this case, it's
a free vibration.

01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:52.176
So that's another
different misconception.

01:25:52.176 --> 01:25:54.675
And then if you think-- so the
easiest way to think about it

01:25:54.675 --> 01:25:55.425
is a diving board.

01:25:55.425 --> 01:25:59.100
If you had a thin diving board,
and you went and jumped on it,

01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:01.350
it would go way down
and come back up again.

01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:03.220
That's a long wavelength.

01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:05.057
And that's a low note.

01:26:05.057 --> 01:26:07.140
And then if you think about
a stiffer diving board

01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:08.970
that you'd be kind of like, mmm.

01:26:08.970 --> 01:26:10.710
That's a shorter wavelength.

01:26:10.710 --> 01:26:11.850
So it's different.

01:26:11.850 --> 01:26:15.120
You have different-- and
then any kind of a cavity,

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:19.384
like a cello or a door of a
house, if it's a big cavity,

01:26:19.384 --> 01:26:20.550
it's a bigger standing wave.

01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:21.840
It's still a standing wave.

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:23.670
So those are very different.

01:26:23.670 --> 01:26:25.350
They are different models.

01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:28.320
So this technique
is really great,

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.130
because it really gives you
incredible insight into what

01:26:32.130 --> 01:26:34.200
students' misconceptions are.

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.720
And then you can really
make sure to address

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:41.350
those misconceptions to deal
with their faulty models.

01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:43.080
So for the post-class
assignment,

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:45.995
I've asked you to
think about what active

01:26:45.995 --> 01:26:49.290
learning techniques you might
adopt in your own teaching,

01:26:49.290 --> 01:26:50.490
in your own classes.

01:26:50.490 --> 01:26:52.950
And then think about how
you would adapt them,

01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:54.720
anticipate any
issues or whatever.

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:57.870
So hopefully you've
gotten a good smattering.

01:26:57.870 --> 01:27:01.020
And I'll post the
slides, which have

01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:04.590
some links and things in there
if you want to look at videos.

01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:08.430
And also check out that
list from University

01:27:08.430 --> 01:27:09.350
of South Florida.

01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:13.560
That has some amazing techniques
that you might find useful.

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.630
I'm going to send everybody off.

01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:18.330
But if you'd like to
comment on the mud cards--

01:27:18.330 --> 01:27:20.640
I know we're over time--

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.950
I have them here, if you
want to make a comment.

01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:25.890
But otherwise, I will
see you next time.

01:27:25.890 --> 01:27:28.410
And I'd like the plickers back.
