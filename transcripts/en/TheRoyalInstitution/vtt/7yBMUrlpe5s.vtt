00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.540
Hello! Have you ever wondered, do blind birds
can navigate?

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.870
Welcome to monthly mailbag,

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.040
where we answer science questions
from the comments section.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.700
Seris Efthimiadis asked this one after watching
Jim Al-Khalili’s Discourse on quantum biology.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.500
It’s a fantastic question and I’m not
sure there really is a definitive answer to,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.210
but let’s dive in and see if we can peck
away at an answer.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.199
We all know birds are amazing navigators.
Think of the massive migrations of Canadian

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.699
Geese, thousands of kilometres every year
across North America. Or the homing ability

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:32.820
of pigeons.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.030
In fact pigeons are probably the best studied
and most impressive navigators, so lets focus

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.820
on them for today.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.030
Pigeons can find their way back across hundreds
of kilometres of totally unfamiliar territory.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.320
How do they do it?

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.710
It turns out to be pretty complicated and
scientists think pigeons use a whole toolbox

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.820
of senses and strategies, many, but not all,
of which do rely on functional eyes. But first,

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.449
to understand what’s going on, let’s break
down navigation:

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.269
There are two key parts of navigation: determining
where you are in space, a map, and which determining

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.630
direction is which, a compass.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.110
You then need to constantly update those two
things to make sure you are where you think

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.500
you are and you’re going where you think
you're going.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.810
So let’s imagine dropping a bird off at
the Eiffel Tower in Paris, 342km from the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.060
Ri in London. How will it get home?

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.210
Our bird's never been to Paris, so there’s
no chance of it navigating just by visual

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.799
landmarks it might recognise. Which is what
we think pigeons usually do. So how is it

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.310
going to get home?

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.750
First, the compass we talked about. Birds
use two major sources of information: the

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.490
position of the sun and the stars in the sky,
and magnetoreceptors in their eyes. Both of

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.130
these mechanisms depend on working eyes at
least to some extent, so it’s not looking

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.970
very good for Seris’ blind birds.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.610
The sun can act as a compass for pigeons because
they have a very accurate internal clock,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.299
so they can tell which direction is which
based on the position of the sun or the stars

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.829
in the sky. Scientists have been able to test
this ability by artificially making birds

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.649
change time zones. They turn lights on in
the middle of the night and they turn them

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.060
off during the day. Birds that have been time-shifted
like this will get their directions wrong,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.819
but not randomly, they'll get them wrong in
a very predictable way.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.060
For example, if home is due west and it is
6pm in their head, then they’ll expect the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.180
sun to be, let’s say, 20 degrees above the
Western horizon. So they’ll fly towards

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.790
it. But if they’ve been time shifted so
that it’s actually 10am and the sun has

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.790
recently risen, they’ll fly East, in exactly
the wrong direction.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.370
But if it’s cloudy, then even time-shifted
birds navigate just fine, so we think the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.400
pigeon’s first option is the sun compass,
and then they resort to using their other

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.290
senses, including magnetoreceptors in their
eyes.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.550
Now THIS is cool…

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.590
There’s a type of protein called cryptochrome
that lives in the retinas of a lot of birds.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.470
And it's reactive to blue light. So what scientists
think happens is that when blue light hits

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.750
cryptochrome, it becomes “active” and
will remain so for a little while until it

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.560
deactivates again. The amount of time that
it stays active is affected by the strength

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.260
of the Earth’s magnetic field. And cryptochrome
is also known to affect the sensitivity of

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.260
the retina. To see what that might look like
to a bird, let’s go to the roof.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.519
So what scientists think happens is that when
a bird looks South, dark patches align over

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.040
their vision, kind of like this.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.120
As they look around, the patches move too,
giving a constant sense of compass direction.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.840
We also have cryptochrome in our eyes, but
the molecule that lets it stay active for

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.430
long enough to be affected by the magnetic
field, superoxide, is toxic, so the antioxidants

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:40.709
in our eyes lock it down too quickly. Researchers
think we’ve traded longevity for magnetovision.

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.360
So our pigeon in Paris is going to be able
to orient itself pretty well, as long as it’s

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.780
not blind, Seris. It knows where North is,
but how does it know that London is North?

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.280
How does it build itself a map? It’s still
kind of an open question, but we do have some

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.290
more clues. It's either more magnetoreception
or odour maps.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.569
Apart from the cryptochrome in their eyes,
pigeons also have magnetite, a biologically

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.560
formed, iron-rich material that reacts to
magnetic fields, in their heads. Exactly where

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.840
is still a matter of some debate - it could
be in the skin on the top of their beak, near

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.510
their nostrils, or between their brain and
their skull. But in any case we’re pretty

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.320
sure it sends signals to the brain via the
trigeminal nerve, which is the same one that

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.960
controls the eyes, so if Seris’s blind birds
have nerve damage, this method won’t be

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.290
of much help.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.960
Tiny particles of magnetite get aligned to
the Earth’s magnetic field, just like needles

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.220
in this demonstration from our museum. The
mini compasses will align to the strong magnetic

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.750
field imposed by this bar magnet. So imagine
the pigeon’s beak is full of micrometre-sized

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.250
compasses, each a fraction the width of a
human hair.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.220
So that works fine as a compass, but it can
also work as a map. The way they all get aligned

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.200
will tell the bird where it is on Earth, because
of a concept called a gradient map. The intensity

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.860
of the Earth’s magnetic field varies with
distance to the poles, being stronger near

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.450
the poles and weaker near the equator, so
that gives latitude information. But the field

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.550
also varies in inclination, being vertical
at the poles and horizontal near the equator.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.880
And it's the combination of these two things
where the bird can build a bicoordinate system.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.610
Intensity and inclination vary across the
world and there's a unique set of values for

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.960
any given point on Earth.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.760
The bird builds up a feeling for the magnetic
field at home and how it changes when it moves

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.650
in various directions. It then extrapolates
that local map out, assuming the pattern will

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.690
continue to cover the rest of the Earth.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.390
It turns out that this magnetite map probably
only works on a very local level, up to 15km

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.520
or so, or at very large scales, 50km or more,
because in small areas variation caused by

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.290
the metal content of underlying rocks is too
localised to be extrapolated very far, and

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:56.020
in contrast the gradual change in the Earth’s
magnetic field can only be reliably sensed

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.160
at very long distances.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.740
There’s also some suggestion that pigeons
can extrapolate familiar prevailing smells

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.850
in similar ways, to build up an olfactory
map. But it’s unlikely that this can create

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.690
the kind of gradient map that could reach
as far as Paris, so it’s probably restricted

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.590
to creating more of a pungent mosaic of the
bird’s home town. Useful when the journey

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.850
is nearly over, but not so great for setting
a course 300km away.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.550
So to wrap this all together, let’s return
to our brave pigeon’s voyage. He sets off

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.150
from the Eiffel Tower and starts looping around,
getting his bearings. He quickly realises

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.770
he doesn’t recognise anything around him
in this strange and foreign land. So he checks

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.180
the position of the sun against his internal
clock and cross-references that with his perception

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.110
of the Earth’s magnetic field to calibrate
his compass.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.000
He has a sniff but doesn’t recognise the
cheesy smells of France so extrapolates what

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.440
he knows about the large-scale gradients in
the Earth’s magnetic field to place him

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.960
on a basic mental map, and sets off roughly
in the right direction.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.270
As he crosses the Channel small cues from
his olfactory map confirm he’s heading in

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.490
the right direction as he catches the unmistakable
pong of England. He speeds up. He hits the

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.850
Thames and can see the Shard poking up in
the heart of London in the distance. He picks

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.330
up those familiar tinglings of the local magnetic
field variations, and in no time he’s found

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.490
his way back to the warm embrace of the Royal
Institution.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.310
But he used his vision and his eyes an awful
lot there. So to answer the question once

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.630
and for all, do blind birds can navigate?

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.760
No, probably not.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.800
