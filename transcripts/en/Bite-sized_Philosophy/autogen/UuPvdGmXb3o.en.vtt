00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.929
so what happens while Cain makes his

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939
so what happens while Cain makes his
 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.120
so what happens while Cain makes his
offerings and God isn't happy with them

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130
offerings and God isn't happy with them
 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.700
offerings and God isn't happy with them
now we don't know how Cain figures out

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710
now we don't know how Cain figures out
 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.440
now we don't know how Cain figures out
that God isn't happy with his offerings

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450
that God isn't happy with his offerings
 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.780
that God isn't happy with his offerings
we get some hints of that too but the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
we get some hints of that too but the
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.789
we get some hints of that too but the
story does tell us that's what happens

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799
story does tell us that's what happens
 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.950
story does tell us that's what happens
and so then we get the psychological

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960
and so then we get the psychological
 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.260
and so then we get the psychological
response on the part of Cain now one

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270
response on the part of Cain now one
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.540
response on the part of Cain now one
response could be Jesus I must be doing

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
response could be Jesus I must be doing
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.320
response could be Jesus I must be doing
something wrong

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
something wrong
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.300
something wrong
I better straighten myself out you know

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
I better straighten myself out you know
 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.340
I better straighten myself out you know
I better come up with a better quality

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350
I better come up with a better quality
 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.870
I better come up with a better quality
offering and try that again

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
offering and try that again
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.910
offering and try that again
that isn't what happens what happens

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920
that isn't what happens what happens
 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.609
that isn't what happens what happens
instead is that Cain becomes angry Roth

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619
instead is that Cain becomes angry Roth
 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.889
instead is that Cain becomes angry Roth
and his countenance falls and so what

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899
and his countenance falls and so what
 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.350
and his countenance falls and so what
does that mean it means this right it

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360
does that mean it means this right it
 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.770
does that mean it means this right it
means he is not happy he's angry and out

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780
means he is not happy he's angry and out
 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.010
means he is not happy he's angry and out
for revenge and so one of the I've been

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
for revenge and so one of the I've been
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.750
for revenge and so one of the I've been
thinking about this a lot lately with

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
thinking about this a lot lately with
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.020
thinking about this a lot lately with
regards to the literature on inequality

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030
regards to the literature on inequality
 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.979
regards to the literature on inequality
because there's a very good literature

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989
because there's a very good literature
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.049
because there's a very good literature
that shows for example that there's

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059
that shows for example that there's
 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.459
that shows for example that there's
there's a there's a measure called the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469
there's a there's a measure called the
 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.319
there's a there's a measure called the
Gini coefficient and the Gini

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
Gini coefficient and the Gini
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.630
Gini coefficient and the Gini
coefficient is a numerical index of the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
coefficient is a numerical index of the
 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.670
coefficient is a numerical index of the
relative inequality of a geographical

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
relative inequality of a geographical
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.920
relative inequality of a geographical
locale so for example if you went to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930
locale so for example if you went to
 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.689
locale so for example if you went to
Newfoundland where everyone is roughly

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699
Newfoundland where everyone is roughly
 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.690
Newfoundland where everyone is roughly
not very rich or North Dakota say almost

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700
not very rich or North Dakota say almost
 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.300
not very rich or North Dakota say almost
everyone there is say lower middle class

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
everyone there is say lower middle class
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.920
everyone there is say lower middle class
something like that or upper working

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
something like that or upper working
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.750
something like that or upper working
class something like that very little

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
class something like that very little
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.230
class something like that very little
variability low Gini coefficient okay if

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
variability low Gini coefficient okay if
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.969
variability low Gini coefficient okay if
you go to Miami Beach say where

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
you go to Miami Beach say where
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.160
you go to Miami Beach say where
everyone's rich low Gini coefficient

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170
everyone's rich low Gini coefficient
 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.039
everyone's rich low Gini coefficient
because it isn't an index of absolute

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049
because it isn't an index of absolute
 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.929
because it isn't an index of absolute
wealth or absolute poverty it's an index

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
wealth or absolute poverty it's an index
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.630
wealth or absolute poverty it's an index
of relative poverty and so if everyone's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640
of relative poverty and so if everyone's
 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.550
of relative poverty and so if everyone's
rich the relative poverty is low and if

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560
rich the relative poverty is low and if
 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.469
rich the relative poverty is low and if
everyone's poor the relative poverty is

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479
everyone's poor the relative poverty is
 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.100
everyone's poor the relative poverty is
low now one question is where is the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110
low now one question is where is the
 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.469
low now one question is where is the
crime and you might think well the crime

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
crime and you might think well the crime
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.590
crime and you might think well the crime
is where the absolute poverty is high

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600
is where the absolute poverty is high
 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.179
is where the absolute poverty is high
right or the absolute wealth is low

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
right or the absolute wealth is low
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.780
right or the absolute wealth is low
that's where the crime is that's wrong

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790
that's where the crime is that's wrong
 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.179
that's where the crime is that's wrong
if it's if things are relatively

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
if it's if things are relatively
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.270
if it's if things are relatively
distributed in an egalitarian manner the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
distributed in an egalitarian manner the
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.609
distributed in an egalitarian manner the
male-on-male crime especially homicide

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
male-on-male crime especially homicide
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.950
male-on-male crime especially homicide
is low and it's also the case where

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
is low and it's also the case where
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.719
is low and it's also the case where
everyone is rich but if you go into

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
everyone is rich but if you go into
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.090
everyone is rich but if you go into
places where there's some rich people

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100
places where there's some rich people
 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.010
places where there's some rich people
but not very many and there's a lot of

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
but not very many and there's a lot of
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.020
but not very many and there's a lot of
people who are comparatively poor than

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030
people who are comparatively poor than
 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.789
people who are comparatively poor than
the male homicide rapes rates and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799
the male homicide rapes rates and
 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.100
the male homicide rapes rates and
violent crime rates amp up substantially

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110
violent crime rates amp up substantially
 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.199
violent crime rates amp up substantially
and it's a consequence of male-on-male

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209
and it's a consequence of male-on-male
 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.390
and it's a consequence of male-on-male
competition and so what you couldn't

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400
competition and so what you couldn't
 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.610
competition and so what you couldn't
derive from that

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620
derive from that
 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.800
derive from that
and maybe even reasonably is that you

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810
and maybe even reasonably is that you
 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.509
and maybe even reasonably is that you
should flatten out today I'm income into

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519
should flatten out today I'm income into
 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.190
should flatten out today I'm income into
its distribution because you're

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200
its distribution because you're
 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.899
its distribution because you're
destabilizing the society by

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909
destabilizing the society by
 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.030
destabilizing the society by
facilitating male criminal aggression

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040
facilitating male criminal aggression
 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.039
facilitating male criminal aggression
you can make a good case for that you

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049
you can make a good case for that you
 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.199
you can make a good case for that you
know in places like Colombia where the

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209
know in places like Colombia where the
 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.149
know in places like Colombia where the
Gini coefficient got unbelievably

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159
Gini coefficient got unbelievably
 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.369
Gini coefficient got unbelievably
extreme society got so violent that it

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379
extreme society got so violent that it
 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.069
extreme society got so violent that it
could barely hold itself together so so

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079
could barely hold itself together so so
 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.130
could barely hold itself together so so
you can make a conservative argument for

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140
you can make a conservative argument for
 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.289
you can make a conservative argument for
redistribution of income using the

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299
redistribution of income using the
 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.610
redistribution of income using the
observation that if the income

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620
observation that if the income
 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.229
observation that if the income
distribution gets too extreme the whole

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239
distribution gets too extreme the whole
 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.910
distribution gets too extreme the whole
bloody thing starts to destabilize it

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920
bloody thing starts to destabilize it
 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.819
bloody thing starts to destabilize it
might fall but but then you also might

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829
might fall but but then you also might
 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.229
might fall but but then you also might
say wait a minute

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239
say wait a minute
 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.900
say wait a minute
is it inequality that's driving the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910
is it inequality that's driving the
 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.839
is it inequality that's driving the
violence or is it resentment of the

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849
violence or is it resentment of the
 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.660
violence or is it resentment of the
inequality that's driving the violence

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670
inequality that's driving the violence
 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.490
inequality that's driving the violence
now that's a tough question because you

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500
now that's a tough question because you
 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.720
now that's a tough question because you
might say well what if the game is

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730
might say well what if the game is
 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.220
might say well what if the game is
rigged and there's no way of moving up

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230
rigged and there's no way of moving up
 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.180
rigged and there's no way of moving up
the power hierarchy

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190
the power hierarchy
 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.580
the power hierarchy
well then maybe anger and the desire for

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590
well then maybe anger and the desire for
 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.500
well then maybe anger and the desire for
revolution is the appropriate response

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510
revolution is the appropriate response
 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.750
revolution is the appropriate response
but that doesn't really mean to me that

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760
but that doesn't really mean to me that
 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.119
but that doesn't really mean to me that
the response should be the sort of thing

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129
the response should be the sort of thing
 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.099
the response should be the sort of thing
that you see in high Gini coefficient

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109
that you see in high Gini coefficient
 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.759
that you see in high Gini coefficient
neighborhoods which is interracial

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769
neighborhoods which is interracial
 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.030
neighborhoods which is interracial
intra-racial violence between men so for

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040
intra-racial violence between men so for
 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.710
intra-racial violence between men so for
example in neighborhoods where there's

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720
example in neighborhoods where there's
 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.440
example in neighborhoods where there's
high murder rates the murders are always

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450
high murder rates the murders are always
 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.420
high murder rates the murders are always
between young men and they're always

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430
between young men and they're always
 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.089
between young men and they're always
within race and so that doesn't seem to

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099
within race and so that doesn't seem to
 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.409
within race and so that doesn't seem to
me to be exactly a politically

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419
me to be exactly a politically
 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.599

revolutionary move right it's more like

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609
revolutionary move right it's more like
 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.780
revolutionary move right it's more like
it's more like violent competition for

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790
it's more like violent competition for
 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.659
it's more like violent competition for
the sake of attaining status and you

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669
the sake of attaining status and you
 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.099
the sake of attaining status and you
might say well that's reasonable but

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109
might say well that's reasonable but
 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.470
might say well that's reasonable but
because the inequality is there and then

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480
because the inequality is there and then
 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.629
because the inequality is there and then
need to find status because it's part of

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639
need to find status because it's part of
 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:44.830
need to find status because it's part of
what drives them forward it's part of

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840
what drives them forward it's part of
 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.390
what drives them forward it's part of
what makes them attractive to women it's

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400
what makes them attractive to women it's
 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.319
what makes them attractive to women it's
a necessity

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329
a necessity
 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.360
a necessity
well the question is do you attain

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370
well the question is do you attain
 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.369
well the question is do you attain
status through destruction or do you

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379
status through destruction or do you
 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.379
status through destruction or do you
start making your offerings putting your

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389
start making your offerings putting your
 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.150
start making your offerings putting your
offerings in order and that's something

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160
offerings in order and that's something
 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.470
offerings in order and that's something
we really need to figure out because

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480
we really need to figure out because
 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.360
we really need to figure out because
that's a fundamental political question

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370
that's a fundamental political question
 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.039
that's a fundamental political question
it's a fundamental political question

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049
it's a fundamental political question
 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.289
it's a fundamental political question
anyways what happens in this story is

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299
anyways what happens in this story is
 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.170
anyways what happens in this story is
that khane decides that the fact that

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180
that khane decides that the fact that
 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.449
that khane decides that the fact that
god isn't accepting his offerings means

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459
god isn't accepting his offerings means
 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.610
god isn't accepting his offerings means
that he's entitled to become angry and

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620
that he's entitled to become angry and
 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.080
that he's entitled to become angry and
and and negative but it's good those two

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090
and and negative but it's good those two
 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.550
and and negative but it's good those two
things are both put together right he's

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560
things are both put together right he's
 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.680
things are both put together right he's
Roth he's angry and he's also depressed

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690
Roth he's angry and he's also depressed
 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.050
Roth he's angry and he's also depressed
and so he's in a state of mind that well

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060
and so he's in a state of mind that well
 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.729
and so he's in a state of mind that well
I think the best characterization for

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739
I think the best characterization for
 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.010
I think the best characterization for
that is hostile resentment because it's

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020
that is hostile resentment because it's
 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.379
that is hostile resentment because it's
unfair it's like yeah

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389
unfair it's like yeah
 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.110
unfair it's like yeah
fare so what you going to do about it

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120
fare so what you going to do about it
 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.939
fare so what you going to do about it
getting it destructive about it you're

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949
getting it destructive about it you're
 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.739
getting it destructive about it you're
going to change your approach well Cain

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:32.749
going to change your approach well Cain
 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:34.239
going to change your approach well Cain
he does the ultimate thing and this is

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:34.249
he does the ultimate thing and this is
 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:36.760
he does the ultimate thing and this is
what people do when they do the ultimate

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770
what people do when they do the ultimate
 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.950
what people do when they do the ultimate
thing because that kind of hostile

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960
thing because that kind of hostile
 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.850
thing because that kind of hostile
resentment has an archetypal endpoint an

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860
resentment has an archetypal endpoint an
 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.929
resentment has an archetypal endpoint an
archetypal endpoint is the point that

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:43.939
archetypal endpoint is the point that
 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:45.519
archetypal endpoint is the point that
you get when you're hostile and

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:45.529
you get when you're hostile and
 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:46.689
you get when you're hostile and
resentful because you haven't been

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699
resentful because you haven't been
 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.820
resentful because you haven't been
successful and then you go sit in your

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830
successful and then you go sit in your
 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.140
successful and then you go sit in your
mother's basement for about ten years

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150
mother's basement for about ten years
 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.269
mother's basement for about ten years
and then you start imagining just how

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:52.279
and then you start imagining just how
 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:53.649
and then you start imagining just how
nice it would be if you shot up the

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:53.659
nice it would be if you shot up the
 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.209
nice it would be if you shot up the
local high school so that everybody knew

00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:55.219
local high school so that everybody knew
 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:57.309
local high school so that everybody knew
your name and what happens is you go

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:57.319
your name and what happens is you go
 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.469
your name and what happens is you go
from I'm irritated because things aren't

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479
from I'm irritated because things aren't
 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.600
from I'm irritated because things aren't
working out for me very well - I'm

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610
working out for me very well - I'm
 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.760
working out for me very well - I'm
irritated I hate those people for whom

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770
irritated I hate those people for whom
 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.369
irritated I hate those people for whom
things are working out well - I'm

things are working out well - I'm
 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:08.409
things are working out well - I'm
irritated and I hate the fact that the

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419
irritated and I hate the fact that the
 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:09.879
irritated and I hate the fact that the
world is set up so that this has

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889
world is set up so that this has
 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.159
world is set up so that this has
happened to me and then you go - well

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169
happened to me and then you go - well
 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.719
happened to me and then you go - well
because I'm irritated and hate the world

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729
because I'm irritated and hate the world
 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.279
because I'm irritated and hate the world
I'm going to do whatever I can that will

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289
I'm going to do whatever I can that will
 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.050
I'm going to do whatever I can that will
destroy it most rapidly and with the

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060
destroy it most rapidly and with the
 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.869
destroy it most rapidly and with the
with the highest possible amount of pain

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879
with the highest possible amount of pain
 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.929
with the highest possible amount of pain
and suffering conceivable and at that

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:22.939
and suffering conceivable and at that
 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:24.369
and suffering conceivable and at that
point then you don't just go shoot up

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:24.379
point then you don't just go shoot up
 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:25.809
point then you don't just go shoot up
the high school you go up and shoot up

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819
the high school you go up and shoot up
 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:27.879
the high school you go up and shoot up
the elementary school and so if you're

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889
the elementary school and so if you're
 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.649
the elementary school and so if you're
wondering what kind of pathway people

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659
wondering what kind of pathway people
 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:31.929
wondering what kind of pathway people
walk down to get to that point that's

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:31.939
walk down to get to that point that's
 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:34.450
walk down to get to that point that's
the pathway and the ultimate cap of that

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460
the pathway and the ultimate cap of that
 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.600
the pathway and the ultimate cap of that
is well I'll kill the kids because well

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610
is well I'll kill the kids because well
 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.309
is well I'll kill the kids because well
we already know that killing the

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319
we already know that killing the
 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:40.570
we already know that killing the
innocent is a lot more effective than

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580
innocent is a lot more effective than
 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.309
innocent is a lot more effective than
killing the guilty and then just to cap

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319
killing the guilty and then just to cap
 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.809
killing the guilty and then just to cap
it off I'll blow my head off at the end

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:43.819
it off I'll blow my head off at the end
 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:45.159
it off I'll blow my head off at the end
just to show you just how goddamn

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169
just to show you just how goddamn
 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.679
just to show you just how goddamn
pointless it all is and so that's the

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:47.689
pointless it all is and so that's the
 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:50.499
pointless it all is and so that's the
logical extension of Kane's attitude and

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509
logical extension of Kane's attitude and
 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:52.119
logical extension of Kane's attitude and
you might think well that's a bit of an

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:52.129
you might think well that's a bit of an
 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:53.709
you might think well that's a bit of an
over-reading and I will say it's not an

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:53.719
over-reading and I will say it's not an
 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:55.029
over-reading and I will say it's not an
over-reading at all it's exactly what

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039
over-reading at all it's exactly what
 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.610
over-reading at all it's exactly what
happens in the text so it's exactly what

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620
happens in the text so it's exactly what
 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.459
happens in the text so it's exactly what
follows it so fine so Cain is not happy

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:00.469
follows it so fine so Cain is not happy
 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:05.110
follows it so fine so Cain is not happy
and so who's he not happy with well he's

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120
and so who's he not happy with well he's
 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.790
and so who's he not happy with well he's
not happy with God so what does that

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800
not happy with God so what does that
 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.309
not happy with God so what does that
mean well we've already unpacked this

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319
mean well we've already unpacked this
 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:11.529
mean well we've already unpacked this
he's not happy with the social contract

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539
he's not happy with the social contract
 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.510
he's not happy with the social contract
cuz that's part of the spirit the

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520
cuz that's part of the spirit the
 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.760
cuz that's part of the spirit the
patriarchal spirit let's say men there's

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770
patriarchal spirit let's say men there's
 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.769
patriarchal spirit let's say men there's
more to it than that because we already

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:17.779
more to it than that because we already
 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:20.829
more to it than that because we already
we've already analyzed what God the idea

00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:20.839
we've already analyzed what God the idea
 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.480
we've already analyzed what God the idea
of God might represent in the background

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490
of God might represent in the background
 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.040
of God might represent in the background
of this story he's not happy with the

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050
of this story he's not happy with the
 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.290
of this story he's not happy with the
transcendent he's not happy with the

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300
transcendent he's not happy with the
 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.899
transcendent he's not happy with the
idea of the logos all of that no faith

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:28.909
idea of the logos all of that no faith
 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.350
idea of the logos all of that no faith
in the transcendent nothing but he does

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360
in the transcendent nothing but he does
