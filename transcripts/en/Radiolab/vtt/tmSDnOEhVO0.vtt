1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.200
Jad. Yeah. Let me play you this. Mm Buddy. Yes, ma'am.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.830
You're listening to Mike Nichols. I've been thinking, and Elaine May,

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.970
you're getting old and now you're nearly a man and you should start thinking

4
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:13.470
about your future a little bit.

5
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:17.190
You know you're listening to like her soul that happened to get caught on tape.

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.320
<v 1>You're happy with</v>

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.740
30 gods.

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.410
He has a joke in his head. I know what I'd like to do with my life.

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.580
He just can't punchline out without ruining it.

10
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.220
There's all that you have to train for some years. What is the JV?

11
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.450
Here's a general or you haven't heard it yet

12
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.270
and wants to be when he grows up, you're ready.

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.010
He registered nurse. The joke is, I want to be a nurse.

14
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.040
I wanted to be a nurse so he can't say the word without worry about losing.

15
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.810
She say the word nurse. That is their punchline.

16
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.230
<v 0>And why is that funny?</v>

17
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.700
You will remember it's 1959 and boys don't want to be registered nurses.

18
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:11.350
Not In 1959 from Mike Nichols. The funniest thing he thought of all week.

19
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.520
Not Funny, but he can't,

20
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.810
<v 1>which was but a mother.</v>

21
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.430
I want very much to be a registered.

22
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.300
Yes. I love this. We heard so I don't know why I could listen to this.

23
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.510
150 listen to an now 50 times.

24
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.240
I want very much to be a registered nurse.

25
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.620
So no, go on that one. Understand this.

26
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:46.190
Laughter just keeps bubbling up. Mike can't control it.

27
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.770
Ilene can people here.

28
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.573
Here's the thing.

29
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.350
These are two of the greatest humorist of the mid 20th century.

30
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.260
The United States, they're professional improvisational comics.

31
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.040
They lived to laugh. They control if they try to create laugh,

32
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.180
they're all about laughter and yet left to mix them.

33
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.470
<v 2>Here we are the species with the capacity for language,</v>

34
00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:16.910
which allows us exquisitely nuanced expressions. This is Tyler Stillman.

35
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:20.840
He studies laughter at Florida State University and yet we produce these kinds

36
00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:23.070
of bizarre Sam.

37
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.350
No laughter is this kind of clumsy in articulate way of expressing ourselves,

38
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:35.180
but it's also kind of awesome.

39
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.670
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

40
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.320
<v 0>so looking forward is the question then. Why is laughter so awesome? Highways,</v>

41
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.710
I hate that word. Awesome, but I will say that it's a good question to ask.

42
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:51.180
Why do we laugh? What is laughter for and why those sounds,

43
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:54.900
why those sounds. All right. Well let's go. Our topic today is laughter.

44
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:57.690
I'm Jad Abumrad hi, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

45
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.453
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

46
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.800
<v 0>Okay, so to get started, that thing we just talked about,</v>

47
00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:09.540
the weirdness of laughter.

48
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.900
Now how it's both like I'm clumsy on one hand,

49
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.130
but also kind of awesome. Yeah, I know you love that word. Awesome.

50
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.100
I'll see why you have to see that word all the way delightful.

51
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.690
Delightful is a great, delightful.

52
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.510
What do I really want to say is that that sort of paradox is something that some

53
00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:28.530
of the greatest minds in history have thought about and written about.

54
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.360
Like Aristotle

55
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.090
<v 1>in a book called De Unimog. Liam.</v>

56
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.900
Aristotle wants to describe what separates human beings out from all the other

57
00:03:39.631 --> 00:03:40.260
creatures.

58
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.690
<v 0>That's historian. Very Sandra's.</v>

59
00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:44.390
He wrote a book about laughter called Settin Gloria, and according to him,

60
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.650
after pages and pages of complicated reasoning about what makes us special.

61
00:03:48.651 --> 00:03:50.990
Is it language? Is it reason? Is it this? Is it that?

62
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.940
<v 1>Aristotle concludes one thing. What?</v>

63
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.280
What makes us absolutely different is our capacity to laugh. When you laugh,

64
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.680
go ahead and do it. [inaudible]

65
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.450
<v 0>that right there. Okay. That is a specifically human endeavor.</v>

66
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.870
No other creatures can do it. Not only that, the first time you do it,

67
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.860
you mean like when you're a little paper and you're doing your tiny baby and you

68
00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:14.640
make your first left.

69
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.330
That to Aristotle might be the most important moment of your life because it's

70
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.370
the moment that your life, at least as a human being begins.

71
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.570
When the infant utters its first left, emits its first left.

72
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.680
<v 1>At that moment,</v>

73
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.430
heated air from lower in the stomach moves through a membrane into the soul in

74
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.403
souls

75
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:41.690
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

76
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.320
<v 1>and at that point then this is the fine distinction. At that point,</v>

77
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.510
the creature moves from being a human into a human being.

78
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.130
Yes, yes. He's absolutely, I remember it so clearly. The symbols,

79
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.190
the clashes, I think, oh, I'm a human being, but, but, but,

80
00:04:58.191 --> 00:05:01.230
but do you remember when it happened? No. Yeah.

81
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.130
Well Aristotle was very specific about this.

82
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.160
He thought it always happened or should happen on the 40th day of your

83
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.333
existence.

84
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.690
<v 4>Oh, okay.</v>

85
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.310
[inaudible] today is your 40th day.

86
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.500
<v 0>We wanted to check this proposition.</v>

87
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.990
So we called up radio producer Amanda Aronchick who just had a brand new baby

88
00:05:26.991 --> 00:05:27.330
girl.

89
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.480
<v 4>Nina is celebrating her 40th day of existence today.</v>

90
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.040
We're going to get you to laugh now.

91
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:35.460
Were you able to record with Mina this morning? You're ready for that? Oh yeah.

92
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.270
Oh yeah. No, we recorded for 50 minutes. Really? We just like went for it.

93
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.980
And did she laugh? Well I tried pretty rob tried. Hmm.

94
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.700
Or aunt tried a laugh. I went almost ugly.

95
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.870
We all tried and tried to kind of harass her and like stick your tongue out

96
00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:55.740
editor and try to tickle her and, and then at the end she's like

97
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.553
[inaudible]

98
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.640
<v 5>we have yet to get a kick out of her. I need to smile.</v>

99
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.683
You laugh.

100
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.140
<v 4>But you made some sounds we've never ever heard before.</v>

101
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.790
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

102
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.320
<v 4>like her level of interaction in the last two days has been more than anything</v>

103
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:24.440
we've seen. Really. Like, if you stick your tongue out at her, she does it back.

104
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.100
And if you open your mouth, she kind of tries to do that too.

105
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.540
That has been a milestone, you know, aside from the actual day count,

106
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:35.330
like it really is. She's becoming a little beanie.

107
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.040
It's, it's much more emotional.

108
00:06:45.041 --> 00:06:48.810
It's like you're looking at this thing that you're deeply in love with and it's

109
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.820
finally like looking back at you.

110
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.370
<v 0>Well, Romanda when it happens, will you call us right back? Okay.</v>

111
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:56.204
I will for sure.

112
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.930
<v 3>Oh,</v>

113
00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.430
<v 0>do you agree with Aristotle that,</v>

114
00:06:59.431 --> 00:07:04.020
that this is the ability to laugh is what literally separates us from the rest

115
00:07:04.021 --> 00:07:07.560
of the animal kingdom? God, how can I disagree with Aristotle? That would be,

116
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.140
you know, blessing has been not as a negative. I mean, you as a person,

117
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.140
as a person. Um, I, I w I,

118
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.530
I truly believe we're the only creature that laughs.

119
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.260
<v 6>What about you? I,</v>

120
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.520
I do think there's something about the way we laugh,

121
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.390
the way we share, uh, the emotional feeling that leads to laugh.

122
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.210
That is kind of, I don't know of any other creatures that do that.

123
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.680
<v 0>Um, you can't do that to me. I don't know if we're,</v>

124
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.410
I don't know if it's wrong because in truth, in all honesty, this,

125
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.050
this scientific debate is still, uh,

126
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.260
the jury is still out on this question whether we are the only ones that laugh,

127
00:07:47.261 --> 00:07:50.560
but it's one of those things that if you poke around a bit and let's poke,

128
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.310
shall we? Okay. Guide you. The question becomes much more common.

129
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.920
<v 6>Oh, okay. So, uh, introduce yourself so I don't,</v>

130
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.950
I don't mangle your name too badly. Oh, absolutely. Uh,

131
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.700
my name is Jaak Panksepp. Jaak Panksepp. Yes. Yuck.

132
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:07.790
Panksepp is in neuroscientists, Washington State University,

133
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.260
and for the last 30 years he has studied animal emotion particularly.

134
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:17.290
And this is his specialty happiness and play play playfulness in rats,

135
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:21.350
for example, to do duets play. Oh yeah. Oh yes.

136
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.960
When they're still young and you put them together,

137
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.570
they start tussling immediately.

138
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.420
<v 0>Well, when they play, they're silent. I mean, no,</v>

139
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.740
we've got no squeaks or anything.

140
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:35.070
[inaudible] all the while their head butting each other or they're flipping each

141
00:08:35.071 --> 00:08:39.240
other over. They play really hard. No sounds. That's our starting point. Okay.

142
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.560
So one day Jaak Undergrad students are standing in front of a rat cage washing

143
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.950
two rats wrestle silently. And the Grad students,

144
00:08:46.951 --> 00:08:50.370
guy by the name of Brian Turns to you, I can says, is it really possible?

145
00:08:50.371 --> 00:08:52.020
They're not making any noises. I mean, look at them.

146
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.580
Maybe they're making sounds, but we just can't them. Uh,

147
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.590
<v 6>so he suggested to [inaudible],</v>

148
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.140
why don't we order one of these little black boxes?

149
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:04.710
They call them back detectors and nature. People used to listen to bats.

150
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.600
What if we put one on the rat cage?

151
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:10.140
Maybe it will take whatever sounds might or might not be there,

152
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.340
lower them down to a range that humans can hear that. I said, okay,

153
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.640
well buy the equipment and the equipment arrived.

154
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.820
And the first day we had a couple of animals playing and we tuned it through the

155
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:25.860
various frequencies and lo and behold,

156
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.100
it's like our playground f 50 killer.

157
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.820
What did it sound like? It's like,

158
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.360
<v 7>could you, did you [inaudible]</v>

159
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.590
<v 5>so all of a sudden you just heard this sound erupt from the little box? Yeah,</v>

160
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.820
absolutely. Absolutely. Wow.

161
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.660
<v 6>So now they had the sound that no one had ever heard before and there's two</v>

162
00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:59.130
things you need to know. First, the rats would make the sound sporadically.

163
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:03.810
Each villa rap would make it just like the chicken chip chip and second,

164
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.650
y'all had no idea what the sound was. What did it mean? What does it mean?

165
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.990
What does it, what are they saying? What are they saying to each other?

166
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.800
You knew had something to do with play, but was it just like a, hi, hi, hi.

167
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.470
Or was it something more aggressive? Like you want a piece of me,

168
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.430
let's wrestle best one. I think. Or maybe they're excited and they're saying,

169
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.450
give me sex. You want to have sex and get rallied.

170
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.550
You make couple of chirps and maybe it was just a grunt of some sort.

171
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.880
There's a lot of possibilities. 10 years, 10 years.

172
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.960
They study this sound trying to figure out what it means and every theory failed

173
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:36.710
somehow. Well, nothing was conclusive. [inaudible].

174
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.630
Then one morning yuck walks in to the lab,

175
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:43.440
which she showed us her going to the animal facility on the fifth floor with a

176
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:48.060
crazy idea. One morning I came in and says, Jeff is Grad student at the time.

177
00:10:48.061 --> 00:10:50.400
Jeff, let's go tickle some rats.

178
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.790
What on Earth gave you that idea? I don't know.

179
00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.560
This is the mystery of having a new idea. Oh, okay.

180
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.520
So he and his Grad student quickly walk over to the rat cage, pick up our rent,

181
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.080
and we carry it to a box. We put it in the box. Yeah. Okay.

182
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:13.610
And the animals going in and I began to tickle it. Am I tickle?

183
00:11:13.611 --> 00:11:16.700
It's just like you. You would tickle a baby. Meaning what? Like could you,

184
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.290
could you, could you cool with the fingers?

185
00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:23.610
You're moving your fingers rapidly all over the animal's body or some male rant.

186
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.390
He demonstrated tickle

187
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.360
<v 5>sound. The chemo is the same as before,</v>

188
00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:40.190
but now it was louder. More continuous. You can see how consistent it is.

189
00:11:40.191 --> 00:11:45.191
Plus it had this very familiar rhythm and familiar dynamic quality.

190
00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:46.274
The way it went

191
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.350
in for the first time it occurred to Yuck. I'm like, God,

192
00:11:51.351 --> 00:11:52.350
what if that's left there?

193
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.800
What if that sound is laughter and visually?

194
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.230
I'm going to say it's pretty convincing when you see him do it.

195
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:03.160
When you put a video on a website, radiolab.org when you see him,

196
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.310
particular rat and the rat kick its little rat legs and Chirp like mad.

197
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:10.920
It does look at the animals cracking up like a little kid. Yeah.

198
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.140
<v 3>Oh, oh,</v>

199
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:24.480
oh, oh.

200
00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.920
<v 6>To where you're thinking at this moment we were thinking this a fluke.</v>

201
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.900
It's a fluke. This will float. See it and trust what you were hearing. Oh,

202
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.610
well we trust what we're hearing, but I said, let me get another animal.

203
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.930
Here's another rent. Ready for a tickle session. Tickle.

204
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.080
Whoa. Syngo exactly the same. [inaudible]. Exactly.

205
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.350
I still kind of said, come on. This is too good to be true.

206
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.050
Let me get another animal. You tickle

207
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.900
<v 5>exactly the same chat. Here's the kicker.</v>

208
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.930
<v 6>The moment Jaak stops tickling the rats moves his hand away.</v>

209
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:07.460
The rat starts chasing his hand and moves his hand left. The rat goes, left,

210
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.100
moves to the hand, right. The rat goes, right, exactly.

211
00:13:10.101 --> 00:13:14.090
The animal does glued to your hand because it wants to be tickled again at once

212
00:13:14.091 --> 00:13:17.940
more. Exactly. So cool. Whoa. Hello.

213
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.890
I'm just running circles with my hand and the animals running circles right

214
00:13:21.891 --> 00:13:25.160
after my fingers. Once some more. Ho Ho. Okay.

215
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:29.060
And if you stop tickling and you just leave your hand there in the cage,

216
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.260
like a dead piece of meat [inaudible] the animal knows you're alive and

217
00:13:33.261 --> 00:13:37.660
gradually it begins to pounce on your head and it begins to nitpick your face.

218
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.390
It's like, c'mon. C'Mon. Exactly.

219
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.270
<v 5>Let me ask you this though, in terms of calling me the squeaking,</v>

220
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.980
a squeak or a Chirp or a chip or whenever you want to call it,

221
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.061
that would be one thing,

222
00:13:51.061 --> 00:13:53.940
but to call it laughter is saying something very specific. Yeah.

223
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.330
<v 6>Yeah. A lot of people don't like that word. Huh? Oh.</v>

224
00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:02.200
Even my friends have advised me to drop that word because they don't think that

225
00:14:02.201 --> 00:14:04.960
a rat can feel joy or is that, is that,

226
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.780
is that what giving human qualities to animals has been unknown? No.

227
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:14.260
Since we are closer to the angels than the other creatures in the world.

228
00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.323
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

229
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:31.450
<v 6>AH, two laughs. Two feeling. He was kidding by the way.</v>

230
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:35.410
Oh really? Oh. Oh. I kind of believed him. Oh, you think that he was being,

231
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.570
I thought he meant the laughter in the subtle way that he imagined. No, no, no,

232
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.360
no. He thinks human laughter is not special. He thinks the Aristotle's wrong.

233
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.940
Basically. Check it out. Aristotle do an experiment.

234
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:50.080
Like it goes back a long way. Back to rats. Pigeons. Who knows?

235
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.010
And that all these creatures

236
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.240
<v 0>laugh like us and they laugh more or less for the same reason as us.</v>

237
00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.340
Hmm. I don't know.

238
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.580
Utila pigeon a good chicken crushing the old joke and you're going to get

239
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:04.970
nothing. Why? What do you don't think that a pigeon has a rich emotional life?

240
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:09.290
No. Joy. No. I have taught with pigeons. Let me tell you something. All right.

241
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.800
I'll give it that. We probably left for irony. Yeah, we, we'd probably do that.

242
00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.370
And I'd like you think legend last for delight. I don't know. But sure.

243
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:18.950
A pigeon experiences delight, but don't even know you're not a pigeon.

244
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.710
You forget the pigeon. I'm a kid. Oh, take a bird that sings. I bet.

245
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.450
I bet birds sing because they're happy and singing is probably in a way like

246
00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:29.340
laughing. Oh, if you're going to get all general, I'm the, yeah.

247
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.820
Where it was like the wiggle and wiggling. It's Kinda like

248
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.820
why would my day, what's happened to the bay to Baby Amanda Humane?

249
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.880
When did she laugh yet? Yeah. Uh, no, actually not.

250
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:47.690
Oh, see, so Aristotle's really in deep doodoo here. I mean these days,

251
00:15:47.691 --> 00:15:49.460
I don't know about ancient Greece, but these days,

252
00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:54.100
people who study this stuff say it's usually around 90 days is what is the

253
00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:57.600
general time [inaudible] the time. So I told her to call us back when,

254
00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.470
when she does laugh.

255
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.810
<v 8>Message One, hey there dad,</v>

256
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:05.830
it's Amanda Roger Calling and I am calling to say that Nina just laughed.

257
00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.440
She just laughed. She actually full on did a life. Ha ha ha.

258
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.010
Like that. Um, there was incredibly exciting. Um,

259
00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.840
but it was not day 40. It was day by my calculations in 97. So,

260
00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.410
uh, I don't know about Aristotle and those babies, but um,

261
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.710
this baby here left for real,

262
00:16:28.711 --> 00:16:31.650
definitely 100% on day 97.

263
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:36.540
So it's very exciting and we're very excited and now she's crying because there

264
00:16:36.541 --> 00:16:39.630
was so much effort to laugh, I think. Um, okay.

265
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.090
And this message

266
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.090
<v 1>now for the next question, forgetting for a moment how we laugh.</v>

267
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.740
Let's ask why we laugh and I'll tell you why we laugh. Why do we laugh?

268
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.370
We laugh cause something's funny. No, no, no, no.

269
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:57.790
The most important thing to remember about laughter is that it's social and it's

270
00:16:57.791 --> 00:16:59.840
not about humor. That's Robert Pro,

271
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.890
Vine and euro scientists at the University of Maryland who got very interested

272
00:17:02.891 --> 00:17:03.724
in this question.

273
00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:07.060
So he went out on the street with some of his Grad students pen in hand,

274
00:17:07.061 --> 00:17:08.220
and they listened. Well,

275
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:13.230
what people actually in real life say just before they laugh and in 85% of the

276
00:17:14.561 --> 00:17:18.970
cases are you writing this now? Is he 5% of the cases? Nothing funny.

277
00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:21.450
Proceeded the lab. Yeah. So first of all,

278
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.860
people weren't really telling jokes to other people.

279
00:17:23.861 --> 00:17:28.780
They were saying things like, Hey, what are you being on? I've got to go now.

280
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.390
I have a class, I have a class.

281
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.350
[inaudible] this is the kind of things that people say before they life.

282
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.870
Now don't take my word for this. Got Cocktail Party.

283
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:39.310
You're going to be a lot of laughter there,

284
00:17:39.311 --> 00:17:42.250
but people are not telling jokes to each other to furious. Right?

285
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.020
So laughter isn't about joking. It's about something else.

286
00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.580
It's about social relationships. You gotta have those people there.

287
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.450
When you're alone. Laughter basically disappears

288
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.700
when you're at home along Jad. Do you never find yourself laughing?

289
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.940
[inaudible] hell yeah. Well, you see sometimes when,

290
00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:01.750
like when I'm watching the TV or something like that,

291
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.870
kind of vicarious social stimulus. I mean like when you are solitary,

292
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.620
if you take away media, no radio, no TV, no nothing in your ears,

293
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.380
no laughter basically disappears. So we have an unconsciously controlled,

294
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:21.060
neurologically programmed social behavior that will only work if there's a

295
00:18:21.061 --> 00:18:21.660
sharer,

296
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.950
even if the share is just in your head and neurologic neurologically programmed

297
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.880
by who? By M evolution. In this case. Towards the end of the interview,

298
00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:33.900
he walked me over to his a TV VCR thing. He has state of the art stuff.

299
00:18:33.901 --> 00:18:38.040
This is pretty fancy, and he showed me a video of a woman tickling a chimpanzee.

300
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:42.930
What is this? I have an example here of laughter from our primate ancestors.

301
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.100
They be chimps.

302
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:50.831
<v 2>Okay?</v>

303
00:18:50.831 --> 00:18:54.490
We have now a chimpanzee on the screen and you're listening to a chimpanzee

304
00:18:54.491 --> 00:18:59.470
playing with a, a a woman. If you get a game going, that's the woman laughing.

305
00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:04.870
She is now puddling and smothering the chimp with cogs

306
00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:08.950
and he's being tickled.

307
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.970
That's chimpanzee laughter at panning sound. Do you hear

308
00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.580
<v 1>chimpanzee laughter? The low level of chimpanzee panting laugh too.</v>

309
00:19:21.581 --> 00:19:22.414
It'd be like [inaudible].

310
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:23.930
<v 3>Okay.</v>

311
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.180
<v 1>When they really get into it, it becomes more guttural like</v>

312
00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.813
<v 3>sound</v>

313
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.340
<v 1>pro things. It has nothing to do with jokes.</v>

314
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.310
This is not a reaction to any other. Tickling is kind of delightful [inaudible],

315
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.050
<v 9>but what it really is doing,</v>

316
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:43.520
he says that particular sound is a signal. One chimp to the other,

317
00:19:43.521 --> 00:19:46.640
and those two chimps to any other animals that happened to come by.

318
00:19:46.641 --> 00:19:51.290
Other chimps. We're just playing. Shims have evolved.

319
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.710
It's taken them a long time, but they figured out a way to signal,

320
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:58.490
we're not fighting. I'm not going to kill you. This is just play.

321
00:19:58.491 --> 00:20:00.880
It's the signal of we're just,

322
00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.310
<v 1>I to get into it, it becomes more aggressive. Safe.</v>

323
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:11.270
According to pro vine, we inherited that signal from our chimp relatives. Yeah.

324
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:15.500
So basically panting became, Haha.

325
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.030
Oh, in a human.

326
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.530
We've just added one little wonderful extra.

327
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:24.540
The H.
