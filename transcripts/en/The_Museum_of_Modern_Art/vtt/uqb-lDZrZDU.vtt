00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.490
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.650
We're here in the Exhibition Model and
Planning Room at the Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:07.650
My name is Lana Hum.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.290
I'm the Director of Exhibition Design and Production.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.540
My name is Mack Cole-Edelsack.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.180
I'm Senior Design Manager on the
Exhibition Design and Production team.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.240
Today, we're here to answer your questions
about how we work with curators and artists

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.040
to craft the exhibitions you see here at MoMA and

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.600
what it means to be a member of
the Exhibition Design team.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.380
We received a lot of great questions from
the trailer we posted a couple of days ago.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.689
So we'll start with some of those.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.840
But our producer will also be
passing some questions along to us.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.780
So let's get to the first question.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.540
This is a multiple question, single subject.

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:47.620
Essentially, what did you study to
become an exhibition designer?

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.220
We heard from María López Vlk,
mossykittens, and shkvart.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.600
So what did you study to
become an exhibition designer?

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.420
Well, Mack, I studied the same thing
you studied to become an exhibition designer.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.600
I studied architecture and Mack did as well.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.600
However, I should note that the exhibition
designers at the Museum of Modern Art come

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.560
from all different educational backgrounds.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.369
We have among our staff people who
studied industrial design, interior design.

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.670
We have lots of artists on our team as well.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.299
In particular, the carpenters and
the framers and the builders.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.780
The makers in our department are artists.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.530
Many of them are musicians.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.100
So I would say that it's a very diverse
background that we come from.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.340
Did you wanna elaborate on any
other educational experiences that

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.400
I also studied philosophy and religious studies

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.180
which did not necessarily inform Exhibition Design.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.160
I would argue that it does.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.480
But now it certainly does.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.039
Okay.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.380
This comes from nataliealan.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.380
What's the best way for a graphic designer
to transition into an exhibition designer?

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.939
By continuing education or experience?

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.920
Could you tell us more about how you
work with the Graphic Design team

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.140
at MoMA when creating exhibits?

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.150
Mack?

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.080
Well, I'll focus on the second part which
is how we work with Graphic Design.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.870
And this is true for most of the
departments in the Museum.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.440
We work quite closely with Graphic Design.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.620
While they have their own design timeline
and work specifically on title graphics and

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.780
in-exhibition graphics, we do model reviews
together and we work together in the space

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.049
in terms of placement and scale tests and
just thinking through how the graphics will

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.370
interact with the artwork and the flow of the show.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.080
It's a very integrated process.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.159
So I would say that a graphic designer can
transition into an exhibition designer.

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:01.310
I mean, I think when you're thinking about
graphic design, you are thinking spatially.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.470
That's where the Exhibition Design team here
intersects with the Graphic Design team here.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.220
But I think that we're all being spatial
thinkers when we work together.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.709
But I would recommend for the
transition to do more sculptural things.

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:28.980
Like perhaps taking a sculpture class
or studying architecture, those things.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.709
And I think when I transitioned from being
a studio art major who focused on drawing,

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:36.750
I was interested in architecture.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.140
One of the things that was recommended
to me was to take a sculpture class.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.220
This question comes from YouTube.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.379
Sanna Chang asks, "What is unique to the
way that MoMA approaches Exhibition Design

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.000
compared to other museums?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.959
Have you ever been to an exhibition
that was badly designed?

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.480
And if so, what about it was off?

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.719
What kinds of skills are needed to
be a good Exhibition Designer?"

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:06.719
Okay.

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:08.580
Well, that's several questions.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.900
I'll take on the first.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.500
I don't know exactly how exhibition
is done in other museums.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.500
I find that at MoMA, like the hallmark of
our processes, that we're very collaborative.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:31.400
I would say that we feel Exhibition
Design is a very critical process.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.780
It's also a very integrated process.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.920
I think we work very closely with our curators.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.520
We're lucky enough that we're
fully integrated into the process.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.300
I also think that another way that distinguishes
how Exhibition Design is done here at MoMA

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.780
is that we have a full team of people, of
builders that we work very closely with.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:06.990
I think that perhaps at other institutions,
I think I know that at some other institutions,

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.900
the building is outsourced.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.670
So it's more of a process that is aligned
with the way architecture is done where you

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.000
have idea phase, a design development phase

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.900
and then you go into a construction document phase.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.940
And then those documents
are handed off to a builder

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.300
and then that's when the building process begins.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:37.430
We have a much more integrated process, fluid
process where we ideate iteratively and we

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.520
go back and forth on the ideas with our builders,
with our full teams of carpenters and painters

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.650
and mechanics and framers.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.060
Yeah.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.120
To the second part of the question, without
necessarily throwing shade on any specific

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.180
exhibition, I think we've all experienced
being in a space that didn't feel like it

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.100
was either married to what it was trying to do

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.680
or felt generous in the way that we might want it to feel.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.920
True.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.380
Or maybe wasn't as considered, well
considered as we would have liked it to be.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.120
Right. Sure.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.080
Krista Kimble and her fifth grade
students in Haymarket, Virginia.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.000
What are some specific ways that you plan
for your exhibit to engage the audience and

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.130
make them feel an emotional connection?

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.100
What a lovely question!

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.170
Did you wanna speak to that?

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.170
Sure.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:49.020
I mean, I think, in some ways,
that's what Exhibition Design is.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.600
And so some of the specific things we do are,
for example, work in model and really work

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.580
with the curators and all the other teams on
what it's gonna feel like as we move through

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:07.700
the space that then develops into drawings
and construction documents and eventually

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:13.370
the in-gallery installation where, again,
those are exactly the kinds of considerations

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:19.780
along with art history and the curatorial
concept that are coming into play.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:25.370
We also work across the other
fields of expertise at the Museum.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.850
We work with an interpretive strategy team
to include multiple voices to get different

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.380
perspectives on the exhibit.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:44.280
We also work with other materials in our collections
like the archives to maybe put more context

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.920
to a show, give it some historical context.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:56.500
I think, again, it's about that process, that
collaborative process that we're trying to engage.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:04.000
We're trying to think about all the different ways
that an audience can connect into the exhibition.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.050
Yeah.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:10.500
I mean, also to just jump on that with some
specifics, I think questions of scale, varying

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:17.850
scale, how sound and video are incorporated,
often, we sort of can consider the entire

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.830
soundscape of the gallery as another layer.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.350
Color is an obvious one.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.880
So, it's a great question.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.860
Let's see.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:38.820
From Instagram, chezfoxyjam asks, "If
MoMA published a book on its principles of

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:43.100
Exhibition Design, what would be
the most surprising insight?"

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.920
I think that one of the most surprising
insights would be, in exhibition design

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:58.260
there's so many, again, so many different
people that go into making the exhibition.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.180
I think that might be surprising, that
it's not about a singular person.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.400
It's not about this kind of
singular attribution of authorship.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:13.700
I think that there are so many people that
contribute. That might be surprising.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.410
Like I really think that it's
a collective process.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.699
Can you think of other things?

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.960
It seems right to me.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.300
From Manny.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.060
The question is, "Hello.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.300
Love the channel.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.420
My question is how does architecture play
into the designing of an exhibition?

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.640
Do you work with architects at all? Thanks."

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.740
Well, we do.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:54.460
At the Museum of Modern Art, we do
change the architecture of the galleries.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.360
It plays a very important part.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.370
Mack mentioned kind of the issues of scale
and how we create environments to evoke different

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:09.139
types of scale, like maybe grand
scales or more intimate scales.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.880
We're always taking our cues from the artwork itself.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:19.560
So it is an important part of what we do.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.459
And to the question, do we work with architects at all?

00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:26.480
That's another thing that's unique at MoMA.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.160
I mean, definitely, we work with architects.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:41.949
But we also have like a really great team of
internal staff that come from so many different

00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:49.740
backgrounds that I feel that we can.
We're always collaborating with people.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:57.360
So even if we do use architects, I think our team
still completely engages in the design process.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:06.380
And I think also, just to add in, that most
of our galleries were designed as completely

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:07.889
open spaces without partitions.

00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:11.699
Sorry, not most but a lot of our
special exhibitions galleries were.

00:11:11.699 --> 00:11:16.829
And so whenever we're putting in partitions,
considerations of egress, sprinkler coverage,

00:11:16.829 --> 00:11:23.649
lighting, come even more to the fore because
we're modifying a space that was designed

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:25.160
as a completely open plan.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.720
And we do have to maintain all the normal
things that any public space has to maintain.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.720
Correct.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:36.089
I think we're also very respectful of the
architects that are part of the building's

00:11:36.089 --> 00:11:39.589
history, of our building's history,
of our entire campus history.

00:11:39.589 --> 00:11:46.970
So there are the Taniguchi galleries that
we love the proportions of and that we often

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.770
reference to create a nicely proportioned gallery.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:57.699
We like to respect the details
that the architect has given us.

00:11:57.699 --> 00:12:03.430
I mean, our campus is made
out of a few different buildings.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:08.560
So among the architects that we've
gotten to know via their architecture are

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.000
the Goodwin/Stone building

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.900
has a particular feeling and
a particular architecture.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:21.079
The Philip Johnson building has
a particular feeling as well.

00:12:21.079 --> 00:12:24.350
I mentioned the Taniguchi building.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:31.240
And now we're in the next phase of an expansion
project, which will give us more spaces to

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.690
consider and to get to know.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.920
Okay.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:44.680
Alexandra via YouTube asks, "What resources,
for example books or websites, do you go to

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:50.480
for inspiration, installation ideas,
materials, et cetera?"

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.780
So we do have a wonderful
resource on the MoMA website.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.880
It's the MoMA Exhibition History.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:14.560
The MoMA Exhibition History is a full visual
catalog of all the exhibitions in MoMA's past.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.040
Does it date back to 1939?

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.050
So it dates back to 1939.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:24.870
And that's a fantastic resource
that anybody can tap into.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.790
There are links to the catalog when possible.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:34.460
And I find I'm always referencing the Exhibition
History because MoMA does have a great

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:41.999
a very robust history of exploration
and Exhibition Design.

00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:48.100
So, I love to look back at our radical
past and draw ideas from that.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.100
Yeah.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.320
And I think, obviously, going to other shows.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:59.160
And it's easy because we're in the building
but also just, the nice thing about working

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.990
with such a big team and we have a lot of
designers on staff, getting to see how other

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.300
designers even on our own team are working
with spaces that we may have worked in before.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:12.970
I mean, I can't tell you how many times I've
walked into a show that one of my colleagues

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:17.420
here worked on and was like, "I never
thought to do that with the skylight"

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.420
or something like that.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.089
I think this building, one of the wonderful
things about these open plan galleries and

00:14:24.089 --> 00:14:30.470
the spaces that we've been given to work in
is just you've never kind of gotten through

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.509
every possibility.

00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:36.389
There seems to be endless possibilities, like
as much as we get to know the spaces, which

00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:39.069
is great because it's nice to be intimate with the space.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.480
But then it's wonderful to be
surprised by it at the same time.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.580
Okay.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.499
Here's the question.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:59.040
This is a question that comes from
one of our producers I imagine.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.420
What are some of the models on the table?

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.440
Okay.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:16.060
Our team, our wonderful team of exhibition
designers, we work with models a lot.

00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:17.410
The entire team does.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.220
The model's an excellent tool.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.570
And I think people can really relate to models.

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:29.269
But we make maquettes of every
work that's in an exhibition.

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:37.260
So we have models at half-inch scale, and a
half-inch scale is equal to a foot in real space.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:45.680
And we have about two or three models for
every temporary exhibition gallery in the

00:15:45.689 --> 00:15:51.130
Museum so that we can work
on multiple exhibitions at a time.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:59.490
So we make little half-inch scale models
of the artwork that's in the galleries.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.640
And I can show you some of this.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:06.379
This is the Louise Bourgeois Spider that we
had in the atrium space of our Museum.

00:16:06.379 --> 00:16:07.850
Was that last year, Mack?

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.949
It was last year.

00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:16.480
And this is part of our permanent collection,
the Rachel Whiteread Water Tower, which is

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.620
on the roof of our building and can
be seen from the sculpture garden.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:27.240
These are scale figures, people walking in
the galleries, which is also very important.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:34.829
It helps us understand spatially if there's
too many works on a floor, if we have enough

00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:42.910
clear pathways to move comfortably around
the artwork, and also to keep the artwork safe.

00:16:44.199 --> 00:16:48.860
I think this is a wonderful. This
is actually one inch to one foot.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:54.100
It's a scale model of our Brancusi.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:06.040
I forget the title of this work but it represents
one of the works that are currently on view

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.930
in our Brancusi exhibition.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.550
Did you wanna show some others?

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:16.300
I think this is sort of a mock
model with a variety of things.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:23.320
So this isn't of a show but this is a real space
in the Museum and some possible works.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.820
For example, we have a Charles White here.

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:36.100
See, often we print the name
of the artist on the back.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.260
Yeah.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.540
This is how we work.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.220
We move things around.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.800
We see how they feel.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:49.820
The lovely thing about the iPhone is that its camera
is almost perfectly at scale eye-level height.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:55.280
So you can actually take your phone and kind
of make a video walking through the model

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:05.820
and that ends up being almost as good as a
digital rendering but without all the work.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:13.480
And we also have a nice connection to the
database that stores all the images of the

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:20.370
works in our collection so that when we
make these maquettes, we can actually

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:28.120
There's like a program that draws the images from
our database and puts them right into AutoCAD

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.370
at a one-to-one scale.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:34.590
And then we print them out at
whatever scale we need for a model.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:39.450
That's very helpful in quickly
iterating through these models.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:47.120
The other thing about the maquettes that I
wanted to note was that, as you can see, there's

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.690
so many different styles of maquette-making.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.500
It's a wonderful way to really study an object.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:59.360
I think it keeps us in touch with our
process with what we are as makers.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:08.080
I think it's a good way to just study an object
and I think really think about what's evoking

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:13.150
the most salient features of a particular object.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:17.080
I really personally love making models.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.390
It's my secret retirement plan.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:23.260
It's a good one.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.300
Oh, this is for me, right?

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.660
You did the last one?

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.080
YouTube.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.360
YouTube user Abby Broussard says, "So
excited for this livestream.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:43.080
My question is, since design can be so subjective, how
do you decide whether or not a design idea works?

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.620
Is it based on your individual process or
based on feedback after the fact?

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.010
Also, how did you hone your
design process in general?

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:52.010
Thanks."

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.040
This is a great question.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:07.300
So I think that when you ask how do you know
whether a design idea works or not, another

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:14.420
thing that I love about Exhibition Design
and especially here at MoMA is that it's a

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.920
very rapid process.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:26.720
Relative to other design processes where you're
putting out a product, like we very quickly

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.380
iterate through ideas.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.260
So I think we take a very experimental approach.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:41.230
So I feel like a design is successful when
we've honored an artist's vision or when we

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:42.830
tried an idea in earnestness.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.280
We've pushed it as far as we could.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:57.920
In terms of like if it's failed, I don't know
if I can say that it's a failure if we went

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.640
through a very thoughtful considered process
and we kind of pushed it as far as we could

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.670
go with it.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:09.680
I don't consider, like even if it's a critical
failure for instance, if nobody likes it,

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:15.330
or if the press pans it, I still
feel like it's been a success for us.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:20.530
I mean, I still feel if we've learned something
from it, if we've pushed an idea, if we took

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:25.040
a chance, if we took a risk, then it's successful.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.040
Yeah.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.040
Did you...

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.040
Yeah.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:34.370
I think also one of the great things about what
we do is we get to see whether or not it works.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:42.660
Something we tried and we're hoping that visitors
would choose to make this extra turn and it

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.360
turns out most of them didn't and so this
corner of the gallery ended up being emptier

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.530
or less viewed

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.900
We learned something.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.380
As you said, that's something we learn from,
and actually getting to be in the space and

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.370
see how people interact with it was amazing.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.880
And the critique is part of the process.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.170
I think that we invite critique.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:07.180
I know nothing we put out there is
going to be absolutely perfect.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:13.960
I think that if we can keep listening and keep
open, then I think it's a successful process.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.920
And if you see that something is unsuccessful
before we open and we have a chance to fix

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.640
it, we do. Yes, this is true.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.660
What's next?

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.460
Should we pick from here?

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.760
All right.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.960
Okay.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:42.000
This is coming from
renee_pascual via Instagram.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.190
"What's the most challenging part of
designing the exhibition space?

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:52.100
Also, what has been the most difficult exhibit
that you guys have ever worked on?"

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.910
So I think one of the most challenging
parts of designing the exhibition space.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:01.720
Well, there are many challenges.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:07.920
And the exhibition design, each
exhibition will pose its different challenges.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:14.600
I would say we've had some. One example of
a challenge is kind of butting up against

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:22.260
what's possible in the building, because the
building, we like to change our spaces and

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:27.140
we like to think of our building as a
living thing that changes personality.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:35.790
We do, as I said before, want to respect
the original architecture of the building.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:45.540
We're asked sometimes to do things that might
not seem very comfortable in terms of changing

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.940
our building forever.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.330
But we appreciate the challenge.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:50.870
We'll always give it the exploration.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.850
We'll always try to like push it and
see how far we can go with it.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:58.790
And we actually are excited by the
possibility that we can change it.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:01.470
We wanna find the way to do it.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:07.820
So some of the most challenging exhibits we've
worked on have been the most rewarding.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:15.690
I love the example of the Robert Gober exhibition,
The Heart is not a Metaphor, where we did

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:22.860
something that we may have...
we had to figure out that we don't do...

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:27.570
It seemed like a challenge, but we
cored a part of the building slab.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:36.240
We removed part of the building slab for an
artwork and that turned out to be incredibly

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.690
exhilarating and incredibly exhilarating to
figure out how to solve that problem with

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:42.250
Robert Gober.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.750
So, yeah.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:48.180
I would say that the challenges
are really exciting as well.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.550
Do you have other experiences, Mack?

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:51.870
You've had a lot of challenges.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:52.870
It's funny.

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:53.870
Yeah.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:25:00.080
There are these technical challenges and then
also, often in terms of the space, I find

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:08.530
something that comes up again is balancing
a desire to really have a structured path

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:14.210
through space while maintaining a feeling
of openness and not being controlled.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:21.400
And so I find often, like particularly with
developing the floor plan, that's the thing

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.410
that's really exciting and also really challenging.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:26.610
That is true.

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:33.741
And also our curators often time will want
to keep a chronological thread through the

00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:39.810
galleries and sometimes that's difficult because
you can't, as Mack says, control people.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.020
But you wanna suggest.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:46.010
You wanna give them enough visual
cues that you're suggesting a path.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:49.740
We should go to the next one.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.280
From Instagram, joee_richman

00:25:54.280 --> 00:26:00.560
"What was your most exciting exhibition to
design and your most technical?"

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:07.180
Well, I guess exciting could be good and terrifying.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:16.260
It's a show we don't always talk about, but
the Bjork exhibition was really thrilling.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:22.510
We did amazing things and also not just that
exhibition but I was thinking about this thing

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.660
and what we were gonna talk about.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.240
You mentioned Robert Gober but coming...

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.190
This was after that, right?

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:31.190
Bjork was after.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:32.190
Right.

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:36.920
So right after Robert Gober, we did Scenes
for a New Heritage, Bjork, Latin America

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.790
in Construction, and Jacob Lawrence,
all in a rather short period.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.600
And I just remember, I think of that.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.360
I know it's not one exhibition
but that period is just being

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.590
Very challenging.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:53.640
Challenging and exciting and a moment where
the team we have now really like bonded a

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:59.030
lot because some of us were pretty new at
that time and we all were kind of working

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:02.990
with each other and helping each other where
we could, and we're all in a lot of places.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:06.370
And I just remembered that being quite exciting.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:08.200
I agree, Mack.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:15.310
It had such a high opportunity for learning,
that we were learning to work with each other

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:18.120
as a fairly new team.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:24.290
But I think we all showed, again,
our commitment to the artists.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:31.080
We did things that were challenging technically
and we were doing things that were challenging.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.840
It's just an interpretation.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:38.000
But I agree with you.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.900
I'm very proud of the way
that we all work together.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:50.670
And I'm really impressed by how
eager we were to just try new things.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.300
That was the time of really trying a lot of new things.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.720
And most technical…

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:06.180
My mind wanders to something else actually
that was before my time here, which was a

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:13.410
chandelier I had to work on that required
an engineer to actually do static modeling

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:21.550
on a 3D model to test point loads on, I think
it was 140 different ceiling points.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:25.070
I mean, as far as pure technical,
that was one of the

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.130
I remember that project, Mack.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:31.700
That project, it impressed me
when you showed it to me.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:37.730
Sometimes installing a Richard Serra can be
the most technical thing going on even though

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:41.300
it seems like it's just one thing
moving into a building.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.480
True, yeah.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:47.420
And technical things, it's not just scale
that define like a technical challenge.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:51.870
I mean, it could be figuring
out a climate control case.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:56.710
Those challenges are really successful.
I mean, challenging.

00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:06.600
And I can tell you one example of where we...for
the Picasso sculpture, the Picasso sculpture show.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:12.380
Matthew made a climate control
case that performed so beautifully.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:16.320
We tested it for, I think it was how many
months, like three months we tested it.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.710
And it was declared this amazing success.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:28.570
But it did, once we just got it into the space,
it still performed but it required much more

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:32.680
maintenance when it was just sitting
like in a very challenging space

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.970
on the non-climate control space.

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:40.810
And, of course, it just performed beautifully.

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:45.230
But like once we got it to the gallery, it did require more

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:47.660
maintenance than we thought it was going to.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.000
Okay.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.820
Oh, shame on you.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:07.640
So for those of you who saw the trailer,
you will appreciate this question.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.300
vic_tttor from Instagram wants to know.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:15.760
He only wants to know why
he, Mack, smells like a salad.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.340
Mack doesn't smell like a salad.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:25.040
It was during this time that we talked about
the Bjork show where you were just trying

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:34.880
to put nutrition like in the most
efficient possible way into your body.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:35.880
It was efficient nutrition.

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:36.890
Exactly.

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:37.890
It was efficient nutrition.

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:42.690
So with all things, Mack, you solve problems
so beautifully, you solved that one.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:50.270
You had a box of arugula on your desk and
you were just eating from it because...

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:51.270
All day.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:54.690
That way I knew that I've had the
minimum by the end of the day.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:56.810
I'd had plenty of vegetables.

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:59.110
So that's why we're here.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.770
We're problem solvers here.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:04.640
That was a great way to solve a problem.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:11.690
This is from Mike Sorgatz who can be
reached at @mikesorgatz on Twitter.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:15.850
How do you manage traffic flow through exhibitions?

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:20.840
How do you balance the need for people to
contemplate work versus avoiding bottlenecks?

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.770
That's a great question.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.220
Well, we have good partners in this.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.520
We have excellent security team.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:45.610
Like the question suggests, it's really about
achieving a balance and it can be pretty tricky.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:54.771
We'd like to create environments that are
appropriate for the artwork, of course, but

00:31:54.771 --> 00:32:02.720
we also have those practical considerations
that the Museum has about 6,000 visitors,

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.890
average of.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:05.640
Six or eight.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.660
Six or eight, six to eight.

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:13.520
And we can actually experience numbers
far greater than that during busy days.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:22.650
We try to keep certain distances
away from the artwork, for sure.

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:23.970
We try to keep clear pathways.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:30.190
I mean, these pathways are also...not only
are they good for visitor flow, but they're

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:36.000
good for art movement as well because there's
the practical concern of installing the artwork.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.830
So we do have to keep clear path work.

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:43.280
We just have to remember the visitor experience.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:53.070
And so in that way, we try to design enough
space to circulate around the artwork.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:54.260
Right.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:33:00.550
Again, managing traffic flow or managing the
flow of people through the space is one of

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:06.040
the chief things we're thinking about with curatorial
and all our partners in various departments.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:11.420
So I think it is about…it's rhythm.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:16.900
You can use a single-entry room
as a way to create a quieter space.

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:21.700
And sometimes we do have to have a security
officer posted at the entry to a single-entry

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.520
room so that it doesn't get too full.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:28.560
We have had experiences where we even had
to have line management within a show.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.560
This is true.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:34.270
And that VEN security had managed beautifully.

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:39.160
Once a certain number of people are in the
building, you can't totally prevent bottlenecks.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:45.340
Yeah, I think the principles of Exhibition Design
and good circulation hopefully helps us.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:49.690
We've modeled a couple different solutions
like you said, just a controlled entry and

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:54.190
monitoring how many people
are in the gallery at a time.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:58.560
Those are ways in which we can manage visitor flow.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:05.490
I mean, sometimes, not frequently, but sometimes
outside consultants had been brought in to

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:06.490
actually model...

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:07.490
That's true.

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:13.700
Human flow through an exhibition or through
a public space as we're rethinking entries.

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:20.399
We've also reacted very quickly to times when
we are expecting high attendance where we

00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:25.429
will...for instance, when the atrium was in
installation, if we can manage to kind of

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:32.460
open up a gallery before it's ready, if we
can just stanchion off works that are still

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:33.460
in installation.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.889
We've done that to just kind of provide some
relief, provide some more seating in the Museum.

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:42.919
And we want everyone to have
a positive visitor experience.

00:34:42.919 --> 00:34:50.909
So we are constantly considering those things and
we're working together to figure those things out.

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:57.440
For instance, the time that I just mentioned
that we put some more seating in the atrium.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:01.589
I think we worked with our security,
head of security on that.

00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:06.180
And we've got a phone call and we tried
to react very quickly to respond to it.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.620
Okay.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:21.320
This comes from nautilus belauensis.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.360
That's a great name.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.720
It's a beautiful name.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:25.680
You can't see it on camera.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.690
Well, maybe you can.

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:29.690
Belauensis.

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:31.690
Yes, it's very beautiful. From YouTube.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:34.900
How do you choose the color
palette for an exhibition?

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:44.499
What were your favorite pieces of art
or exhibitions to work with and why?

00:35:44.499 --> 00:35:46.900
I love the color question.

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:52.609
I think we both have different experiences to share.

00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:58.589
The color palette, it's one of the
more fun parts of our job I think.

00:35:58.589 --> 00:36:04.980
And choosing the color, the inspiration
for color can come from anywhere.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:10.490
It could just come from like a vision that
the curator has or that the designer has.

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:15.210
It could come from the work itself, something
that we're trying to draw out of the work.

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:16.490
We're always considering the work.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:23.710
It has to look well with the work.

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:29.619
When you're around the work enough, a color
will just come to people like at the same time

00:36:29.619 --> 00:36:31.619
So we're all standing there looking at the artwork.

00:36:31.619 --> 00:36:35.339
There can be something that just suggests itself.

00:36:35.339 --> 00:36:40.680
I love the process that we went through with
Christian Rattemeyer on the Boetti show, the

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.099
Alighiero Boetti show.

00:36:44.099 --> 00:36:50.350
And Boetti is an Italian conceptual artist
that worked in the 1960s and he used very

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:51.770
humble materials.

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:56.170
He used cardboard and paper and aluminum.

00:36:56.170 --> 00:37:03.160
For that first gallery, Christian actually
thought of the color of a newspaper but of

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:12.049
an Italian newspaper which is this like beautiful
peachy color that was just so wonderful and

00:37:12.049 --> 00:37:13.349
subtle and humble.

00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:20.010
It kind of had this glow to it that was so beautiful.

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:26.299
And for the other colors in the gallery, we
drew upon Boetti's tapestries and did a little

00:37:26.299 --> 00:37:39.059
research into what yarns he used in his tapestries
and discovered that that yarn company had

00:37:39.059 --> 00:37:43.099
their original colorway and
were still making these yarns.

00:37:43.099 --> 00:37:48.690
And so we got a bunch of samples of those
yarns and we kind of drew inspiration and

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:52.089
selected a few for the colors in the gallery.

00:37:52.089 --> 00:37:57.470
That process was just so fun and I love going
to all the yarn stores in New York City to

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:00.099
find samples.

00:38:00.099 --> 00:38:03.300
The painters will paint us samples.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.670
Some of those are behind us.

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:10.890
Sometimes we'll bring them out to our storage
facility in Queens to hold this color next

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:15.079
to an artwork or we'll go into the gallery
and see how it looks with the real lighting.

00:38:15.079 --> 00:38:20.410
Sometimes you have to work with the catalogue
to see what a piece…because that's the best

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:24.140
we're gonna get because it's coming
from a lender or something like that.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:27.420
And that's really important to test
it out in the galleries, like you say.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:31.940
We often will test things like that out
and other things in the gallery.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:37.619
Like we'll do paint swatches right on the
wall because the lighting, of course, is important

00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:39.329
and the color of the floor.

00:38:39.329 --> 00:38:40.579
So we have terrazzo floors.

00:38:40.579 --> 00:38:42.049
We have wood floors.

00:38:42.049 --> 00:38:48.980
And so we really try to test the color before choosing it.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:54.789
And another thing that is wonderful about
this color choosing process is the way people

00:38:54.789 --> 00:39:01.869
describe color and the way like it's in their
heads and like you'll hear curators wax poetically

00:39:01.869 --> 00:39:04.930
about like the color of a faded rose petal.

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:06.539
Yeah, it's just wonderful.

00:39:06.539 --> 00:39:09.770
It's like you're writing the poem of colors.

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:14.849
It's just like beautiful and wonderful
to get inspiration from that.

00:39:14.849 --> 00:39:23.490
And then favorite pieces of art or
exhibitions to work with and why?

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:25.049
Oh, man.

00:39:25.049 --> 00:39:27.299
That's a tough question.

00:39:27.299 --> 00:39:31.900
So many, and I think...I still haven't gotten
to work with the piece of art that if you

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.549
had asked me when I started, I was
most looking forward to working with.

00:39:35.549 --> 00:39:37.359
I won't mention it by name.

00:39:37.359 --> 00:39:42.769
But I was actually thinking about Walid Raad's,
I think it's called Scratching on Things

00:39:42.769 --> 00:39:51.010
I Could Disavow, which was an entire stage
set and performance that sort of comprises

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:52.010
a single work.

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:58.390
And I was just remembering how much
fun that was to work on, how complicated.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:02.880
Matthew and I worked on that together and
had to actually divide up different components

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:07.410
because it was so complicated and it went
everything from an actual sculptural object

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:13.940
to an exhibition copy to a collaboration with
our carpentry and painting teams on like tearing

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:17.640
up a wall, just in that one piece.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:21.400
And then our handlers hanging artwork high up.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:27.119
Like on that one piece in the atrium was kind
of everyone's work and then being used by

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:33.230
the artist as a performance space to lead
visitors through, not just creating

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:35.230
Very full process.

00:40:37.839 --> 00:40:40.720
So that's one that I would…

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.160
That's great.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:54.320
Alison Spangler asks, "Can you speak to
collaborating with artists on Exhibition Design?

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.509
Any fun anecdotes."

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:08.080
Actually, working with an artist is one of
the most exciting and interesting things that

00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:09.499
we do, I think.

00:41:09.499 --> 00:41:13.599
And you just described working with Walid Raad.

00:41:13.599 --> 00:41:19.920
I loved working with Robert Gober
who is an artist that I had

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:32.089
I saw his installation at Dia in 1990
something and it just impressed upon

00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:33.430
me so much.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:39.650
I mean, I found, I saved the
little brochure that it...

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:43.410
I was like going through some things
and I saved a brochure from it.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:52.829
And so when we were doing our show of his
work here at the Museum, I was just so thrilled.

00:41:52.829 --> 00:41:58.900
I think it was such a memorable experience.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:07.210
I think the generosity of the artist when you're
working with them, how they put themselves

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:15.829
out there and they invite you into their process,
which I feel is such a gift and I always feel

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.120
honored when that happens.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:27.150
I love working with artists and all the decisions become

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:30.539
There's a million decisions
that go into making an exhibition.

00:42:30.539 --> 00:42:41.349
And I just love the thinking around all those
decisions and really getting to know the process

00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:45.540
and the artist as a result.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.600
It's pretty indescribable.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.500
I'm sorry.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:56.309
Did you want to share something
like about working with an artist?

00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:57.589
I mean, you've also worked with...

00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:58.589
Its' great.

00:42:58.589 --> 00:43:06.170
It's really one of the prime joys, is working
with the people we work with and artists are

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:08.240
among them.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:14.700
I remember there was a show where the artist
had blintzes brought almost daily so that

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:20.150
they didn't have to leave the floor and we
had to set up an area and make sure CBS was

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:23.289
on board and keep it away from the artwork.

00:43:23.289 --> 00:43:28.349
It turned out one of the artists I worked
with once was a college friend of my dad's

00:43:28.349 --> 00:43:29.349
best friend.

00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:31.490
So that was kind of hilarious.

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:32.800
And I managed to bring him to the opening.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:42.880
It's that thing where when you're working
with people collaboratively and things are

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:50.920
going well, it stops being, oh my God, this person

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:54.650
And it goes from Robert Gober to Bob.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:57.119
And it goes from Lana Hum to Lana.

00:43:57.119 --> 00:44:01.339
It goes from Brian Rana to Brina.

00:44:01.339 --> 00:44:02.999
Not Brina, to Brian.

00:44:02.999 --> 00:44:04.640
That got weird.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.019
At a certain point, everyone's just talking.

00:44:08.019 --> 00:44:11.790
I mean, going back to Walid, I remember when
he talked about Kenny the painter because

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:16.269
Kenny was touching up his wall every
day and like they became friendly.

00:44:16.269 --> 00:44:22.349
I think that's one of the beautiful things
about the way we work is just that some of

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:27.360
those barriers fall away and we all
get to like do good work together.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.800
That's right.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.880
reid.dickie

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:38.560
How closely do you work with curators
and what is involved in those interactions?

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.040
You wanna talk about that, Mack?

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:46.359
I think as we've sort of been saying all along,
it is a very close collaboration when it gets

00:44:46.359 --> 00:44:49.589
to the Exhibition Design component.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:57.000
There are many other components of an exhibition
besides the actual physical gallery realization.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.800
For example, on a show like this, which isn't
a show, all our hands will be in there.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.380
I mean, that's how close.

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.910
My hand will be here and someone
else's hand will be there.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.400
And that's how closely we're working.

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.120
Yeah.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:23.200
I think the curatorial process, again, I feel
lucky that we're also invited into that process.

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:31.319
And I think that we do work very closely
from ideas right into execution.

00:45:31.319 --> 00:45:37.519
And all those practical things, those production-related
things, like the making of the show, I think

00:45:37.519 --> 00:45:42.730
we work all the way through from just thinking
about the big concept until the last pieces

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:44.760
hung on the wall or installed.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.520
No.

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.800
You are getting all the best questions, Mack.

00:46:00.819 --> 00:46:07.269
Kenneth Swoyer wants to know,
"Is Mack named after maquette?"

00:46:07.269 --> 00:46:08.680
No.

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:11.440
I'm actually named after the truck.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:17.230
But it is one of these things where it might
have influenced you subconsciously to become

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:19.200
an architect, I think.

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.200
Yeah.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.200
That's fine.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:21.680
I'm gonna go with that.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.560
If I ever had named Charo after Charette,
that would be more interesting.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.200
Okay.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.309
It sounds like we're wrapping up.

00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:35.369

All right.

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.880
