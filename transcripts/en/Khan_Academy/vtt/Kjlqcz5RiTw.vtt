00:00:02.277 --> 00:00:06.227
Voiceover: So I'm here with
famous filmmaker Davis Guggenheim.

00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:08.438
Davis: I'm smirking when
you say this famous-

00:00:08.438 --> 00:00:10.276
Voiceover: You are!

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:14.609
"Inconvenient Truth,"

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:19.962
"Waiting for Superman," a great
teacher's project, amongst others.

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:22.443
Just to rewind I'd like to talk
frankly about all of the stuff

00:00:22.443 --> 00:00:24.842
that you've worked on, but
how did you get started?

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:28.763
I've always been fascinated when
I see people who are filmmakers,

00:00:28.763 --> 00:00:33.225
there's not a traditional
career, how did you get started?

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:36.978
Davis: My father was
a great documentarian.

00:00:36.978 --> 00:00:38.146
No one knew who he was.

00:00:38.146 --> 00:00:40.734
He rode his bike to work
but he made all these great

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:44.238
social justice documentaries
and he was my hero.

00:00:44.238 --> 00:00:48.466
But after college I moved to
L.A. to not make documentaries.

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.285
Voiceover: What did you do in college?

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:51.334
What did you think you were going to do?

00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:56.291
Davis: I was a history major and I
wanted to get out of my father's shadow.

00:00:56.291 --> 00:01:00.211
And I moved up to Hollywood, I'm
not going to make documentaries.

00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:03.464
Voiceover: But did you have an
idea of what you were going to do?

00:01:03.464 --> 00:01:04.716
Davis: I was going to
make Hollywood movies.

00:01:04.716 --> 00:01:08.051
I was going to be, he makes documentaries,

00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:11.180
I want to be a hot shot
Hollywood director.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.977
Voiceover: But you had embraced
this film-making aspect of your-

00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:16.846
Davis: Yes.

00:01:16.846 --> 00:01:18.512
Voiceover: That's not
as big of a departure,

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:20.511
for most people that
seems still pretty close.

00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:24.595
Davis: So kids of doctors
can become a lawyer,

00:01:24.595 --> 00:01:27.595
you know kids of lawyers
can become an accountant,

00:01:27.595 --> 00:01:33.350
but no one is the kid of a
documentarian and becomes a doctor.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.834
It's a degenerative
skill that's passed down.

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:42.178
You never go back.

00:01:42.178 --> 00:01:44.409
Voiceover: I don't understand that right.

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.027
(Davis laughs)

00:01:45.027 --> 00:01:49.501
Is it because your father would have
judged you if you would have become

00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:50.777
Davis: No.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.420
Davis: No, no.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.360
I don't think I could have, frankly.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.299
I think, very dyslexic,
not good in school.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.026
And so I became tuned to other things.

00:02:03.026 --> 00:02:05.722
My brain was tuned to other things.

00:02:05.722 --> 00:02:08.608
Voiceover: So you saw your
father and you saw film crews

00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:11.859
Davis: Right.

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.563
Davis: It's like growing up in the circus.

00:02:13.563 --> 00:02:15.066
Voiceover: In a good way.

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:17.568
Davis: Yeah, lights, cables,
cameras, that's cool.

00:02:17.568 --> 00:02:20.610
Voiceover: What your father did
did strongly influence this-

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.574
Davis: Yes.

00:02:22.574 --> 00:02:23.825
Davis: And he was a hero to me.

00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:25.193
I just could never been as good as him.

00:02:25.193 --> 00:02:29.581
Imagine if your hero was Superman or Iron
Man, you'll never be as good as that.

00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:32.445
Voiceover: So you thought
that it would be amazing to be

00:02:32.445 --> 00:02:35.860
a great documentarian like my dad but
I'm never going to be able to do that.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.091
Davis: He won 4 Academy
Awards, was nominated 12 times.

00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:42.050
Voiceover: So you started off
saying no one knows who he is

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.109
and he rides his bike to
work and now, he was a big-

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.651
Davis: But no one knew who he
was so he had the double threat

00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:54.356
of being totally anonymous but
also remarkable in what he did.

00:02:54.356 --> 00:02:55.828
Voiceover: What were some of his most-?

00:02:55.828 --> 00:03:02.874
Davis: He made films about the Johnstown
flood, the Ku Klux Klan, the Kennedys.

00:03:02.874 --> 00:03:04.127
Voiceover: Are those
out there, can people-

00:03:04.127 --> 00:03:05.419
Davis: Yeah, I'll give you copies of it.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:06.963
Beautiful movies, beautiful movies.

00:03:06.963 --> 00:03:08.189
Voiceover: Can we include
them on Khan Academy?

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:09.547
Davis: Of course.

00:03:09.547 --> 00:03:11.883
Beautiful wonderful movies.

00:03:11.883 --> 00:03:14.386
Voiceover: And so you view
that as like the high watermark

00:03:14.386 --> 00:03:18.608
and you could do that but you could
do a big Hollywood blockbuster?

00:03:18.608 --> 00:03:22.059
Davis: Right, and it's more like...
we talked about this earlier,

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:26.731
the son finding his identity
outside of his father.

00:03:26.731 --> 00:03:33.356
Like you know, just to follow in his
footsteps would have been pathetic

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:35.190
for me as an 18 year old.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.074
So I had to go off and make it on my own.

00:03:37.074 --> 00:03:41.684
Voiceover: But how did you think about it?

00:03:41.684 --> 00:03:44.122
Did you think what are my odds
on being able to succeed here?

00:03:44.122 --> 00:03:45.835
Davis: Yes, I did the math.

00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:48.206
Impossible.

00:03:48.206 --> 00:03:51.884
Voiceover: And so you
still decided to do it?

00:03:51.884 --> 00:03:53.706
Davis: Oh you mean to go to Hollywood?

00:03:53.706 --> 00:03:57.039
Voiceover: Well filmmaker
generally, Hollywood in particular.

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:58.515
Davis: Yeah but like the odds of me being

00:03:58.515 --> 00:04:00.820
a doctor or lawyer was worse. (laughs)

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.455
So it was like it was not even possible.

00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:04.563
There were no odds.

00:04:04.563 --> 00:04:06.937
Voiceover: So you weren't naive.

00:04:06.937 --> 00:04:08.556
Davis: It's like the Mets
winning the world series.

00:04:08.556 --> 00:04:10.775
Voiceover: You knew, so
this was right after college

00:04:10.775 --> 00:04:11.975
Davis: Yeah.

00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:13.056
Voiceover: Where did you go to college?

00:04:13.056 --> 00:04:14.390
Davis: I went to NYU and then Brown.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.949
Voiceover: NYU and Brown and so
history, what did you do at Brown?

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.161
Davis: And I remember walking around
the campus at Brown senior year

00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:26.751
going documentaries are kind of
over, Ken Burns is Ken Burns,

00:04:26.751 --> 00:04:28.724
there's no place for me.

00:04:28.724 --> 00:04:35.474
Like it'll never... like the
establishment is there and it's set.

00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:36.995
Things will never change.

00:04:36.995 --> 00:04:38.929
Voiceover: So you started at
NYU, transferred to Brown.

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:42.377
You were a history major the entire
time but film was always in your mind?

00:04:42.377 --> 00:04:44.140
Davis: I went to NYU to study film.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.892
Voiceover: Right, they're famous for that.

00:04:45.892 --> 00:04:49.437
Davis: And after a year I said I
don't like this, it's not for me.

00:04:49.437 --> 00:04:50.815
I'm going to study history.

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:56.904
Because I think NYU at the time
was very practically based,

00:04:56.904 --> 00:05:04.876
it was teaching a lot of skills a
lot of my fellow students really dug

00:05:04.876 --> 00:05:09.666
and learned from but I knew and
from what my father taught me

00:05:09.666 --> 00:05:18.124
that the key piece, which is the
ultimate thing to learn, is storytelling.

00:05:18.124 --> 00:05:21.460
And I wasn't seeing anyone
who taught storytelling

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.814
so why not learn history
where the great...

00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:28.520
And my father sort of influenced
me and said if you learn to write,

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.480
if you read a lot, if you
sort of figure that part out,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.466
then you can figure out stories.

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:36.904
But the path to becoming a good
filmmaker is not about the equipment

00:05:36.904 --> 00:05:40.657
or the technique, it's about stories.

00:05:40.657 --> 00:05:42.993
Voiceover: And so when you were
sitting in a history class in Brown

00:05:42.993 --> 00:05:46.996
and one of your friends says hey,
I'm going to apply for grad school

00:05:46.996 --> 00:05:49.662
in history or I'm applying for a
job in Wall Street or whatever,

00:05:49.662 --> 00:05:51.287
you would say oh well, I'm
going to go to Hollywood.

00:05:51.287 --> 00:05:52.790
Davis: Yeah.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.792
Voiceover: Even though you were studying
history that film was your thing?

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:55.751
Davis: Yep.

00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:58.544
Voiceover: And when you say the odds
I think you're being a little bit

00:05:58.544 --> 00:06:01.170
faux-humble that you couldn't
have been a doctor, right?

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.682
Davis: I couldn't have been-

00:06:02.682 --> 00:06:04.182
Davis: Very dyslexic, very dyslexic.

00:06:04.182 --> 00:06:05.968
Voiceover: But you transferred
to... well I won't push something.

00:06:05.968 --> 00:06:07.974
Davis: I couldn't have done, what's
the big chem course, I guess-

00:06:07.974 --> 00:06:09.012
Voiceover: Organic chemistry.

00:06:09.012 --> 00:06:10.914
Davis: I mean not even close.

00:06:10.914 --> 00:06:12.097
Davis: Not even close, not even close.

00:06:12.097 --> 00:06:15.544
I in fact wiggled my way
through passing the key things

00:06:15.544 --> 00:06:18.629
and Brown had no core curriculum.

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.712
So I wiggle my way through high
school and I worked really hard

00:06:22.712 --> 00:06:24.400
to get sort of a C minus average.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.234
I'm not boasting.

00:06:26.234 --> 00:06:27.289
I'm not boasting in my
lack of intelligence.

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:29.667
Voiceover: But then you happened to get
in one of the most selective universities?

00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:31.710
Davis: NYU was very easy
to get into in 1982. 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.516
Davis: Very easy.

00:06:33.516 --> 00:06:35.814
Davis: And then I transferred
to Brown after I did really well

00:06:35.814 --> 00:06:37.590
Voiceover: I see.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.540
Davis: I was ambitious
but not a good student. 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.597
Voiceover: So anyway, (Davis
laughs) so you get to Hollywood...

00:06:44.597 --> 00:06:45.975
I'm suspicious of all of this.

00:06:45.975 --> 00:06:47.351
Davis: It's absolutely true.

00:06:47.351 --> 00:06:49.647
I really could not have
been a doctor or a lawyer.

00:06:49.647 --> 00:06:55.344
Voiceover: And then you go to Hollywood,
what are you telling yourself?

00:06:55.344 --> 00:06:57.634
It sounds like you knew the odds.

00:06:57.634 --> 00:07:04.008
Davis: So I'll give you a quick arc.

00:07:04.008 --> 00:07:10.342
The assistant to somebody,
working small jobs 10 years.

00:07:10.342 --> 00:07:15.066
Then I finally get my break and I sold
a script that a friend of mine wrote

00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:19.533
to Warner Brothers, I was going
to direct it, my big break.

00:07:19.533 --> 00:07:24.350
It was Training Day with Denzel
Washington and I got fired.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.619
(laughs)

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:26.497
I got fired.

00:07:26.497 --> 00:07:27.621
I don't even get to meet him.

00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:31.257
I don't get to meet Denzel
Washington, I get fired.

00:07:31.257 --> 00:07:35.426
This is my dream, this is what
I've worked towards for 10 years.

00:07:35.426 --> 00:07:38.801
And it was for all the wrong reasons.

00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:42.757
And I bought into this Hollywood system.

00:07:42.757 --> 00:07:45.425
I thought if I was a good
soldier it would pay off to me

00:07:45.425 --> 00:07:47.601
and if I did everything right and
it was going to be a great movie

00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:51.146
and it was a great movie and I was the
only one who wanted him in the role.

00:07:51.146 --> 00:07:52.843
And I got fired.

00:07:52.843 --> 00:07:58.843
And I was so disillusioned, I hit rock
bottom as a person and as a director

00:07:58.843 --> 00:08:04.617
that I said screw it and I bought
a little 800 dollar HI-8 camera

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:07.954
and I said I'm going to make
a movie about people I like.

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:11.541
And I made this film about first
year teachers called The First Year,

00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:13.010
the first thing I ever did.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.877
And I drove to all these public
schools all around Los Angeles

00:08:15.877 --> 00:08:19.967
and Compton and Watts and east
L.A. and I made my first movie.

00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:21.758
A documentary.

00:08:21.758 --> 00:08:23.759
Voiceover: And it just felt right,
you were able to do it, and-

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:25.591
Davis: It was mine and the
great thing about documentaries

00:08:25.591 --> 00:08:28.258
is you can control the
means of production.

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:29.392
And that was the beginning of it.

00:08:29.392 --> 00:08:33.840
Now, all the means of production
that we use to make a documentary

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.818
can be done in my office in a way
that they couldn't have been done,

00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:40.944
even in documentaries
only a few years earlier.

00:08:40.944 --> 00:08:49.341
But I sort of... it was such a
devastatingly apocalyptic moment

00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:55.508
in my life that I had no choice but
to do the thing that I had to do.

00:08:55.508 --> 00:08:59.258
Which was tell a story about
someone I loved and admired.

00:08:59.258 --> 00:09:04.386
Voiceover: And it was, you're saying
the documentary was an important medium

00:09:04.386 --> 00:09:08.176
for you because you could
be in control of the story

00:09:08.176 --> 00:09:12.009
but all of what you've done, starting
with that first documentary until now,

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:14.343
there's been a social justice piece of it.

00:09:14.343 --> 00:09:16.480
In fact there's always been
this narrative of maybe

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.315
just through this documentary you might
be able to move the dial in some way.

00:09:19.315 --> 00:09:20.444
Is that...?

00:09:20.444 --> 00:09:22.592
Davis: Well my father had some
part of that because he did a lot

00:09:22.592 --> 00:09:27.367
of social justice documentaries
and there is a part,

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:31.258
I direct a lot of television
too, which is very gratifying.

00:09:31.258 --> 00:09:35.591
Shows like 24 and ER and
Deadwood and really gratifying.

00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:39.212
But there's a bit of factory work to it.

00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:43.969
My wife is on the show CSI and there's
a bit of hard work, routine work,

00:09:43.969 --> 00:09:50.942
that the quality of the job is so
good, the people who do it are so good,

00:09:50.942 --> 00:09:53.811
but there's something that
when I got the taste of it,

00:09:53.811 --> 00:09:58.487
and I wanted to be a big Hollywood
director, when I got a taste of it

00:09:58.487 --> 00:10:04.947
having told stories, made documentaries
that had some little fragment

00:10:04.947 --> 00:10:14.059
of this film is going to not even
do good but actually have some kind

00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:19.093
of influence on a conversation
that might do good was addictive.

00:10:19.093 --> 00:10:22.514
And after Inconvenient Truth
which should never have been made

00:10:22.514 --> 00:10:23.736
and I never thought would do any good-

00:10:23.736 --> 00:10:25.236
Voiceover: Why should
it never have been made?

00:10:25.236 --> 00:10:28.201
Davis: But after that movie
I became a junkie for it.

00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:29.873
I'm a junkie for it.

00:10:29.873 --> 00:10:31.324
Voiceover: Why shouldn't
it have been made?

00:10:31.324 --> 00:10:33.120
Davis: So it was pitched
to me like they said,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.289
these people came to me who I knew
and said here's a documentary,

00:10:36.289 --> 00:10:38.583
what do you think?

00:10:38.583 --> 00:10:40.450
It's a documentary about climate change.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:41.294
I'm like, okay.

00:10:41.294 --> 00:10:47.157
I'm in, I like that, I believe
that that's an important issue.

00:10:47.157 --> 00:10:49.824
It's based on a slideshow
that Al Gore gives.

00:10:49.824 --> 00:10:52.574
I'm like no.

00:10:52.574 --> 00:10:53.764
Slideshow?

00:10:53.764 --> 00:10:55.739
You can't make a movie about a slideshow.

00:10:55.739 --> 00:11:00.489
And I have great fondness
and respect for Al Gore

00:11:00.489 --> 00:11:03.275
but I don't think you should
make a film about a politician

00:11:03.275 --> 00:11:04.776
because it comes with its own baggage

00:11:04.776 --> 00:11:06.919
no matter how much you
like that politician.

00:11:06.919 --> 00:11:11.223
Can't be done and I
said no, terrible idea.

00:11:11.223 --> 00:11:15.876
Voiceover: So you weren't at all
enamored, I mean obviously national,

00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:18.838
international figure, it was a hot topic.

00:11:18.838 --> 00:11:20.875
Davis: I told them it
was a terrible idea. 

00:11:20.875 --> 00:11:23.128
Voiceover: So you'd kind
of given up on any of the,

00:11:23.128 --> 00:11:26.631
oh this might be a super
hit or anything like that?

00:11:26.631 --> 00:11:31.510
Davis: Even when we had finished it we
didn't think it was going to do anything.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:37.359
Voiceover: But what convinced you then
to do it, to do this terrible idea?

00:11:37.359 --> 00:11:41.734
Davis: So the producers, Laurie David and
Lawrence Bender said don't say no yet,

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:46.799
go to the Hilton where he's going
to do this thing at a luncheon.

00:11:46.799 --> 00:11:51.655
And Al Gore walks on stage and I
remember this, they were serving cold,

00:11:51.655 --> 00:11:57.179
supposed to be hot but cold chicken,
mashed potatoes and bad gravy,

00:11:57.179 --> 00:11:59.131
and you're like sawing into your chicken.

00:11:59.131 --> 00:12:04.626
Al Gore's like, "history of the planet,"
and I'm like lecture, slideshow,

00:12:04.626 --> 00:12:07.473
Al Gore, terrible idea.

00:12:07.473 --> 00:12:08.018
Really.

00:12:08.018 --> 00:12:17.337
And the graphics were kind of
rudimentary and then by the end of it,

00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:21.679
there was this feeling that I think
people have at the end of the movie,

00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:24.630
which is like holy shit.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:37.951
This is deep and this is urgent
and I was physically shaken.

00:12:37.951 --> 00:12:41.490
And it's a really good lesson
I think in film-making which is

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.745
when your body feels something,
when you feel something

00:12:45.745 --> 00:12:48.459
that you're not convincing
yourself to feel,

00:12:48.459 --> 00:12:58.260
there's something you have to listen
to and that clever is often misleading.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.014
I'm going to do this
movie because it's clever

00:13:00.014 --> 00:13:01.929
or I'm going to make that
choice because it was clever,

00:13:01.929 --> 00:13:07.892
instead of following a feeling
like a response that you have.

00:13:07.892 --> 00:13:11.345
Trust that more than trust clever.

00:13:11.345 --> 00:13:13.459
Voiceover: And so you were-

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:18.770
Davis: My chicken was like,
the gravy had dried up.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.731
Chicken was half eaten, the fork
and the knife were left there

00:13:20.731 --> 00:13:24.208
but I was like oh my gosh.

00:13:24.208 --> 00:13:31.127
And even if I make this movie and 10
people see it, that's a good thing.

00:13:31.127 --> 00:13:34.315
And I want other people to
understand what I just figured out.

00:13:34.315 --> 00:13:39.771
So the power of it was already there
and I don't know how to do this,

00:13:39.771 --> 00:13:41.834
it's a great thing, I
don't know how to do this,

00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:47.214
this slideshow with a politician, it
makes no sense, but I have to do it.

00:13:47.214 --> 00:13:50.315
So I'm driven by that overwhelming desire

00:13:50.315 --> 00:13:55.144
that the clever side of me said do not do.

00:13:55.144 --> 00:13:57.182
Voiceover: There wasn't a
pattern here that you could?

00:13:57.182 --> 00:14:02.457
Davis: Oh like look up all the
very profitable documentaries

00:14:02.457 --> 00:14:04.156
about slideshows with politicians in them.

00:14:04.156 --> 00:14:05.274
You can't find it.

00:14:05.274 --> 00:14:09.220
Voiceover: Do you think
about profitability when
you, even for a documentary?

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.034
Davis: No but I think about
who's going to watch it.

00:14:13.034 --> 00:14:15.673
It's a terrible feeling and
I've had this experience

00:14:15.673 --> 00:14:17.986
where you make a movie and no one sees it.

00:14:17.986 --> 00:14:20.350
It's heartbreaking.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.259
It's heartbreaking when
you work really hard

00:14:22.259 --> 00:14:24.330
and you tell a story and no one sees it.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.265
Voiceover: But then you do
it and it goes where frankly,

00:14:27.265 --> 00:14:29.018
documentaries have never gone before.

00:14:29.018 --> 00:14:32.604
It turns into a mainstream movie.

00:14:32.604 --> 00:14:37.860
Does that change how you
perceive yourself, what you do,

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.264
what your next project was going to be?

00:14:40.264 --> 00:14:44.072
Davis: It puts more pressure on you
when you've had a successful film

00:14:44.072 --> 00:14:46.784
and there's sort of a
expectation on the next film.

00:14:46.784 --> 00:14:50.476
Voiceover: That film, regardless where
someone is on the political spectrum,

00:14:50.476 --> 00:14:53.676
that changed the discussion.

00:14:53.676 --> 00:14:57.480
Davis: A lot of it, a huge
portion of it was Al Gore's work

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.517
in building that slideshow.

00:15:00.517 --> 00:15:01.832
Huge part of it.

00:15:01.832 --> 00:15:08.811
And lightning did strike, it landed
right when President George W. Bush

00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:14.820
was starting to fall from
grace in the public's mind.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.649
So that was helpful and people were
starting to reconsider Gore in history.

00:15:18.649 --> 00:15:21.231
Everything that sort of...
and Katrina had just happened.

00:15:21.231 --> 00:15:22.864
So all these things sort of fit.

00:15:22.864 --> 00:15:25.999
The success of that
movie was not necessarily

00:15:25.999 --> 00:15:31.587
about any of the film-making, I think it
actually had very little to do with it.

00:15:31.587 --> 00:15:33.082
Voiceover: Well we can debate that.

00:15:33.082 --> 00:15:36.249
Davis: The film-making worked
so the experience worked.

00:15:36.249 --> 00:15:39.885
I'm not saying the film-making was poor.

00:15:39.885 --> 00:15:41.229
The film-making worked.

00:15:41.229 --> 00:15:43.449
The audience experienced what
I hoped they would experience

00:15:43.449 --> 00:15:47.308
but its success had very little
to do with the film-making.

00:15:47.308 --> 00:15:51.395
Voiceover: And now do you feel pressure
that you kind of have to do something

00:15:51.395 --> 00:15:54.594
of that magnitude again or?

00:15:54.594 --> 00:15:58.192
Davis: Not so I feel like I have
to, I'll probably never do it again

00:15:58.192 --> 00:15:59.873
but I'm a junkie for that feeling.

00:15:59.873 --> 00:16:02.245
Voiceover: But you kind of did it
again with Waiting for Superman.

00:16:02.245 --> 00:16:07.603
That was another movie that really
entered the national conversation.

00:16:07.603 --> 00:16:09.236
Davis: In a different way.

00:16:09.236 --> 00:16:10.898
It's a more complicated experience

00:16:10.898 --> 00:16:12.954
because it had more
controversy involved in it

00:16:12.954 --> 00:16:19.685
but it's not about box office,
it's about feeling like

00:16:19.685 --> 00:16:23.006
if I tell a story maybe the
conversation will change.

00:16:23.006 --> 00:16:24.758
That's exciting.

00:16:24.758 --> 00:16:27.720
Maybe people with this
movie will think maybe

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.658
we changed their minds about what
a teacher is, that'd be cool.

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:33.480
Voiceover: It's true.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.958
It's funny I could ask you a
question that I've always wondered,

00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:39.438
why was it called Waiting for Superman?

00:16:39.438 --> 00:16:41.124
Where did that, was it
you, was it someone else?

00:16:41.124 --> 00:16:45.073
Davis: So Geoffrey Canada
had this great thing...

00:16:45.073 --> 00:16:48.314
Geoffrey Canada started this
incredible school in Harlem

00:16:48.314 --> 00:16:51.063
and he talked about when he was a kid,

00:16:51.063 --> 00:16:54.008
the heartbreaking moment in
his life was when he realized

00:16:54.008 --> 00:16:57.755
Superman wasn't real, and he
was this kid in the projects.

00:16:57.755 --> 00:17:00.456
And he thought that Superman
could come and help him

00:17:00.456 --> 00:17:04.874
and give him some power and
save him and the day he realized

00:17:04.874 --> 00:17:07.177
that Superman wasn't real...

00:17:07.177 --> 00:17:13.412
And so he sort of had that
metaphor already and I didn't
come up with the title,

00:17:13.412 --> 00:17:15.445
Lesley Chilcott the producer did.

00:17:15.445 --> 00:17:21.439
But it was like wow, we're waiting in
the same way he was waiting for Superman.

00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:25.825
Voiceover: And now that you've done
I mean, frankly several of these,

00:17:25.825 --> 00:17:27.875
whether or not you admit it,
especially in certain circles

00:17:27.875 --> 00:17:30.324
you're a household name,
is there a temptation to-

00:17:30.324 --> 00:17:31.772
Davis: In a couple, in
like three households.

00:17:31.772 --> 00:17:33.482
Voiceover: No, no.

00:17:33.482 --> 00:17:35.690
Davis: You have six million
households, I got three.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.834
Voiceover: I don't know,
well make that assumption.

00:17:39.834 --> 00:17:41.579
Is there any temptation to go back?

00:17:41.579 --> 00:17:43.759
There must have been a little
bit of the Hollywood movie,

00:17:43.759 --> 00:17:48.162
the computer graphics and the real...

00:17:48.162 --> 00:17:51.894
There's no temptation
to do Transformers 4?

00:17:51.894 --> 00:17:54.714
Davis: I would love to do
another Hollywood movie.

00:17:54.714 --> 00:17:58.818
I've done a couple and it'd have
to be something really special.

00:17:58.818 --> 00:18:01.154
I wouldn't want to do Transformers 4.

00:18:01.154 --> 00:18:05.002
It is so much work and
Michael Bay is so good at it.

00:18:05.002 --> 00:18:07.627
Voiceover: Yeah it's not that Michael
Bay needs to be replaced or anything.

00:18:07.627 --> 00:18:09.994
Davis: No no no but I'm saying
that's a different skill.

00:18:09.994 --> 00:18:14.289
But I'm a junkie for that, I much
prefer to make documentaries.

00:18:14.289 --> 00:18:15.926
Much prefer.

00:18:15.926 --> 00:18:23.635
Voiceover: What would have to be true
about a commercial film to have you do it?

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:25.106
Davis: You know I watch
my kids this weekend

00:18:25.106 --> 00:18:28.842
watch the movie 42 about Jackie Robinson.

00:18:28.842 --> 00:18:31.664
And that did something very
different, but did something

00:18:31.664 --> 00:18:39.301
that I love in storytelling
that they got to see a moment.

00:18:39.301 --> 00:18:44.135
It's a true story but it's fictionalized.

00:18:44.135 --> 00:18:48.017
But they just saw a great
story and they learned...

00:18:48.017 --> 00:18:53.522
Learning is not the word.

00:18:53.522 --> 00:18:55.400
They're connecting to the world.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.664
They're connecting to the human
experience in a way in which

00:18:59.664 --> 00:19:04.694
sometimes movies can do and when
that happens that's pretty great.

00:19:04.694 --> 00:19:06.493
If I'm part of that, that's cool.

00:19:06.493 --> 00:19:09.173
Voiceover: You started off
wanting to do Hollywood movies,

00:19:09.173 --> 00:19:12.850
do you think you're inherently
better at one of the two types?

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:17.877
Davis: I made two feature movies
and I would call one a C minus

00:19:17.877 --> 00:19:19.887
and the other a D plus.

00:19:19.887 --> 00:19:21.184
Voiceover: Would you mind
saying what those movies are?

00:19:21.184 --> 00:19:25.416
Davis: One was a movie called Gossip.

00:19:25.416 --> 00:19:28.577
You know, it's sort of a
genre movie, it's okay.

00:19:28.577 --> 00:19:29.787
I did a pretty good job.

00:19:29.787 --> 00:19:31.537
The other was a movie called Gracie.

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:34.622
Which was, you know, it was pretty good.

00:19:34.622 --> 00:19:36.964
Voiceover: So you weren't really
happy with how they turned out?

00:19:36.964 --> 00:19:38.251
Davis: I think I did a pretty good job,

00:19:38.251 --> 00:19:41.522
I think I would have like a workman's job.

00:19:41.522 --> 00:19:45.131
I would say I'm unexceptional
as a feature director.

00:19:45.131 --> 00:19:47.885
Voiceover: Interesting and I
know... how much time do we have?

00:19:47.885 --> 00:19:49.443
10 minutes.

00:19:49.443 --> 00:19:53.291
So the one thing I am fascinated and
I think I'm personally fascinated

00:19:53.291 --> 00:19:56.537
and I hope people listening to this
would be too, you kind of glazed over

00:19:56.537 --> 00:20:01.340
that 10 year period between
college and your first almost break

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:07.401
that ended up being this
thing that changed your view
of yourself and the world.

00:20:07.401 --> 00:20:13.152
That 10 years sounds like you were
just taking whatever job you can

00:20:13.152 --> 00:20:20.294
near a studio just to get
closer to being a principal.

00:20:20.294 --> 00:20:24.746
Did you ever think
about giving up on that?

00:20:24.746 --> 00:20:29.924
Davis: Yeah.

00:20:29.924 --> 00:20:35.604
I directed a lot of episodic
television, guest directors which means

00:20:35.604 --> 00:20:38.808
you're one of 20
directors on a given show.

00:20:38.808 --> 00:20:47.350
When I hear about Malcolm Gladwell's
10,000 hours that rings really true to me.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:52.216
There was a lot of learning
the form and repeating the form

00:20:52.216 --> 00:20:56.921
and doing a pretty good job at the
form to then one day be better at it.

00:20:56.921 --> 00:21:00.762
Like the Beatles playing genre tunes

00:21:00.762 --> 00:21:04.361
that they didn't write over and
over again, three nights a week.

00:21:04.361 --> 00:21:08.169
I learned a lot in that era.

00:21:08.169 --> 00:21:10.213
Voiceover: So you were
getting work, so to speak.

00:21:10.213 --> 00:21:12.281
There was a sense of progress.

00:21:12.281 --> 00:21:15.271
Right out of college
you were able to get...

00:21:15.271 --> 00:21:18.082
When did you get even
your first guest director?

00:21:18.082 --> 00:21:19.983
Davis: I'm so bad at
this, dates and stuff.

00:21:19.983 --> 00:21:35.238
So I land in L.A. in '88 and
I start directing in '93.

00:21:35.238 --> 00:21:36.619
So five years.

00:21:36.619 --> 00:21:38.781
Voiceover: So not too bad,
you're 26 or 27 years old.

00:21:38.781 --> 00:21:40.768
Davis: But then you hit a certain-

00:21:40.768 --> 00:21:42.613
Voiceover: How does that happen?

00:21:42.613 --> 00:21:44.158
How do you even get that job?

00:21:44.158 --> 00:21:47.659
Davis: You get your
first job paying it out,

00:21:47.659 --> 00:21:50.693
making short films and apprenticing.

00:21:50.693 --> 00:21:53.172
Voiceover: So you had a portfolio of
short films that you would send to people?

00:21:53.172 --> 00:21:54.339
Davis: Yeah, kind of.

00:21:54.339 --> 00:21:59.225
And then I would observe
on other TV shows.

00:21:59.225 --> 00:22:03.527
Unpaid jobs standing next to directors,
pretending I knew what I was doing

00:22:03.527 --> 00:22:05.351
and then one day someone took a-

00:22:05.351 --> 00:22:06.769
Voiceover: How do you even get that?

00:22:06.769 --> 00:22:08.364
You just ask?

00:22:08.364 --> 00:22:11.800
I don't think if I called up some
random director for CSI or something,

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.955
that is like yeah, hang out with me.

00:22:13.955 --> 00:22:15.816
How do you get there?

00:22:15.816 --> 00:22:16.443
Davis: That took a while.

00:22:16.443 --> 00:22:19.850
I mean part of it is
getting the low paying job

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:21.781
on another show and then, you know.

00:22:21.781 --> 00:22:23.376
Voiceover: And the low
paying job is anything from-

00:22:23.376 --> 00:22:25.371
Davis: A PA, production assistant.

00:22:25.371 --> 00:22:26.934
Voiceover: I see and that's
something that you kind of

00:22:26.934 --> 00:22:28.299
submitted a resume for?

00:22:28.299 --> 00:22:31.540
Davis: Yeah and producer's
assistant and you sort of like...

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:35.123
The nice thing about Hollywood
is it is entrepreneurial.

00:22:35.123 --> 00:22:38.029
You don't have to go to
graduate school or pass the bar,

00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:43.403
you can worm your way through
the system and find a place.

00:22:43.403 --> 00:22:47.264
Voiceover: Do you think Hollywood
eventually finds the real talent

00:22:47.264 --> 00:22:50.667
that's out there or do you think
a lot of people get lost in this?

00:22:50.667 --> 00:22:52.332
Davis: That's interesting.

00:22:52.332 --> 00:22:55.607
I think talent is so rare in Hollywood.

00:22:55.607 --> 00:22:58.991
Let me put it differently.

00:22:58.991 --> 00:23:00.098
Scratch that.

00:23:00.098 --> 00:23:07.304
I think there's extraordinarily
great talent in all the crafts.

00:23:07.304 --> 00:23:13.204
Cinematographers, sound people,
art direction, wardrobe.

00:23:13.204 --> 00:23:14.493
Incredible people.

00:23:14.493 --> 00:23:19.844
You can find incredible people and the
depth of those people is incredible.

00:23:19.844 --> 00:23:23.451
And the way Hollywood keeps
getting them better is incredible.

00:23:23.451 --> 00:23:25.933
Technology, digital stuff.

00:23:25.933 --> 00:23:31.266
But I think the part
that's really hardest,

00:23:31.266 --> 00:23:34.174
and I think that anyone
intuitively gets this,

00:23:34.174 --> 00:23:38.361
is the lack of great
scripts and storytelling.

00:23:38.361 --> 00:23:40.340
That's the hardest part.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.953
There's so few great scripts.

00:23:42.953 --> 00:23:47.568
That they end up making more
than they have good scripts for.

00:23:47.568 --> 00:23:54.414
Voiceover: One thing that I'm curious,
does everyone who shows up in Hollywood

00:23:54.414 --> 00:23:59.232
and has talent, do they
eventually get found, recognized?

00:23:59.232 --> 00:24:02.979
Davis: I think there's a
certain persistence factor,

00:24:02.979 --> 00:24:06.896
so I'm sure there's very talented
people come and they try and fail

00:24:06.896 --> 00:24:10.910
and then they walk away.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:12.718
So that probably happens.

00:24:12.718 --> 00:24:16.487
But if you're good and you stay for a
while and you keep banging on the door

00:24:16.487 --> 00:24:21.756
and you're good, and you've got something
to say, I think you'll be found.

00:24:21.756 --> 00:24:26.310
Voiceover: How do you know
you're that and not someone who's

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:28.527
on kind of a fool's errand?

00:24:28.527 --> 00:24:29.946
Davis: Well that happens too.

00:24:29.946 --> 00:24:31.915
I know a lot of people who
have written a hundred scripts

00:24:31.915 --> 00:24:35.075
and nothing gets made and for
some reason it doesn't work.

00:24:35.075 --> 00:24:36.814
Voiceover: Is there a clue, is
there anything you told yourself

00:24:36.814 --> 00:24:40.279
in that 10 year period
where you were doing that?

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:42.507
You were being persistent?

00:24:42.507 --> 00:24:44.713
That's a data point, that
shows that I have some talent

00:24:44.713 --> 00:24:50.191
that I persist something
good's going to happen?

00:24:50.191 --> 00:24:52.698
Davis: That question is
the ultimate question.

00:24:52.698 --> 00:25:00.392
You don't know it until you see it.

00:25:00.392 --> 00:25:03.916
And there was many many
years where I really wondered

00:25:03.916 --> 00:25:07.568
whether I had anything at all to say.

00:25:07.568 --> 00:25:11.163
And I for a long time felt
there was nothing to say

00:25:11.163 --> 00:25:17.454
and I think if you said to
Davis when he was even 30 or 35,

00:25:17.454 --> 00:25:22.670
"you think you'll ever tell
a story of any significance?"

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:25.185
In my heart of hearts
I would have said no.

00:25:25.185 --> 00:25:30.220
Voiceover: Is that question the same
as do you think I'll be successful?

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.366
Davis: It's a different question.

00:25:32.366 --> 00:25:34.385
Voiceover: Because in that early
period you were still going after

00:25:34.385 --> 00:25:37.233
commercial Hollywood production
where success is very different then.

00:25:37.233 --> 00:25:42.990
Davis: Yes I was a sought
after television director.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:48.215
But I wasn't my own storyteller I was
in service of someone else's story.

00:25:48.215 --> 00:25:49.194
Voiceover: I see.

00:25:49.194 --> 00:25:52.362
So in that 10 year period you did
have a momentum to your career

00:25:52.362 --> 00:25:54.648
that you were getting more responsibility,

00:25:54.648 --> 00:26:02.653
more prestigious responsibilities
to direct things.

00:26:02.653 --> 00:26:04.879
Davis: I had a chair with my name on it

00:26:04.879 --> 00:26:08.243
and I was a member of a guild
and I made a good living.

00:26:08.243 --> 00:26:12.276
But I wasn't doing what
I came to Hollywood to do

00:26:12.276 --> 00:26:14.931
which is somehow tell a story.

00:26:14.931 --> 00:26:16.558
Voiceover: How long did it take you
to get to that point where you said

00:26:16.558 --> 00:26:24.502
well I can pay the bills with this?

00:26:24.502 --> 00:26:27.898
Davis: Eight years.

00:26:27.898 --> 00:26:29.779
It felt like the longest
eight years of my life.

00:26:29.779 --> 00:26:32.365
Voiceover: So that eight years there
wasn't a period where you felt like

00:26:32.365 --> 00:26:34.809
gee, I'm just going to stop
this, some of my friends went

00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:37.918
and became accountants and
they can buy a nice car

00:26:37.918 --> 00:26:39.204
and they have a down
payment on their house?

00:26:39.204 --> 00:26:40.995
Davis: Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:40.995 --> 00:26:43.591
So I do think there's
a persistence factor.

00:26:43.591 --> 00:26:46.549
There's sort of like showing
up and doing the work

00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:52.936
and knocking on 100 doors for one to open.

00:26:52.936 --> 00:26:55.855
Voiceover: So this whole eight
year period you're just kind of

00:26:55.855 --> 00:26:59.238
getting by but they were film
related jobs that you were doing?

00:26:59.238 --> 00:27:02.235
Davis: Little jobs and some
of them were not paying well

00:27:02.235 --> 00:27:04.468
and some of them were dead ends.

00:27:04.468 --> 00:27:05.946
Voiceover: But you didn't
have to wait tables

00:27:05.946 --> 00:27:08.514
and that type of traditional story?

00:27:08.514 --> 00:27:14.580
Davis: I took some bad jobs.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:20.093
I edited a conference for the CIA.

00:27:20.093 --> 00:27:21.786
Voiceover: That seems interesting.

00:27:21.786 --> 00:27:25.428
Davis: They had all the old spies come out

00:27:25.428 --> 00:27:28.879
and talk about the Cuban missile crisis
but they're all in their 70's and 80's

00:27:28.879 --> 00:27:31.979
and they were at a Hilton
and the sound was bad

00:27:31.979 --> 00:27:33.840
and they were standing
at a podium and they said

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.210
here's 30 hours of footage
can you cut it down to one.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:40.747
And I did that.

00:27:40.747 --> 00:27:48.112
On paper it was a terrible job because
it was never going to go anywhere,

00:27:48.112 --> 00:27:52.392
it wasn't going to do anything.

00:27:52.392 --> 00:27:56.385
But on a fascination level it was great.

00:27:56.385 --> 00:27:58.669
Voiceover: The good thing
is even in those early days

00:27:58.669 --> 00:28:01.737
you were able to pay your bills
doing something in your craft?

00:28:01.737 --> 00:28:03.333
It wasn't the most glamorous thing.

00:28:03.333 --> 00:28:04.022
Davis: Barely

00:28:04.022 --> 00:28:05.290
Voiceover: Barely, you
were able to get by.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:10.016
Davis: I was a producer's
assistant for a long time.

00:28:10.016 --> 00:28:12.522
Picking up dry cleaning,
making phone calls,

00:28:12.522 --> 00:28:15.459
so there was a lot of grunt work.

00:28:15.459 --> 00:28:16.753
Voiceover: And this portfolio of stuff,

00:28:16.753 --> 00:28:19.711
this was just like you and your friends
with a camcorder that you would produce?

00:28:19.711 --> 00:28:21.300
How were you able to do that?

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.060
Davis: I had a little bit of a
break because I worked on this film

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.736
Sex, Lies, and Videotape.

00:28:24.736 --> 00:28:26.123
Voiceover: I remember that.

00:28:26.123 --> 00:28:32.432
Davis: And my boss couldn't pay me
so he gave me a tenth of a point,

00:28:32.432 --> 00:28:36.326
so a thousandth of a piece of a movie.

00:28:36.326 --> 00:28:38.734
No, a hundredth... no a
thousandth of a movie.

00:28:38.734 --> 00:28:43.662
A thousandth of a movie and I was
like this is a low budget movie,

00:28:43.662 --> 00:28:45.327
no one's ever going to
see it and it turned out

00:28:45.327 --> 00:28:54.732
to be worth 30,000
dollars in '90 something.

00:28:54.732 --> 00:28:56.970
So I had 30,000 dollars and I
made a short film with that.

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:59.111
So that was like a
little gift from heaven.

00:28:59.111 --> 00:29:02.790
Voiceover: I remember that
movie distinctly because
my uncles wanted to see it

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:06.078
and they were babysitting me
so they took me and my cousin

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:10.150
and they gave us 20 dollars in
arcade tokens in the movie theatre

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:11.698
and said we're going to
go watch this movie now.

00:29:11.698 --> 00:29:13.046
Davis: And you didn't go?

00:29:13.046 --> 00:29:17.829
Voiceover: No, I think
it was barely rated R.

00:29:17.829 --> 00:29:18.867
Davis: Did you ever see it?

00:29:18.867 --> 00:29:21.030
Voiceover: No I've never (Davis
laughs) I have this distinct memory

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.378
of not being allowed to see it
but I got 20 dollars in tokens

00:29:23.378 --> 00:29:26.991
to spend the next two hours at the arcade
because my uncles wanted to see it.

00:29:26.991 --> 00:29:28.044
Davis: They were probably
very disappointed,

00:29:28.044 --> 00:29:32.716
it was a very deep art film with
very little fun gratuitous sex.

00:29:32.716 --> 00:29:36.435
Voiceover: Would you pinpoint that
as kind of a break that allowed you-

00:29:36.435 --> 00:29:41.555
Davis: That was one of the
breaks, there were a lot of...

00:29:41.555 --> 00:29:43.419
I think luck is a part of it.

00:29:43.419 --> 00:29:46.752
I think being ready when luck
happens is a big part of it.

00:29:46.752 --> 00:29:51.700
Like sometimes if your luck
breaks and you're not ready,

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.633
you got to be ready when the luck happens.

00:29:53.633 --> 00:29:56.677
The door will open but then you've got
to walk through it and do something.

00:29:56.677 --> 00:29:58.105
Voiceover: Do you know people in Hollywood

00:29:58.105 --> 00:29:59.857
who you just think are
the most amazing talent

00:29:59.857 --> 00:30:02.026
and they just got squandered?

00:30:02.026 --> 00:30:04.043
Davis: Mm-hmm.

00:30:04.043 --> 00:30:09.833
Yeah, or sometimes they're stuck.

00:30:09.833 --> 00:30:13.532
They're stuck working on a show
that's paying them enough money

00:30:13.532 --> 00:30:17.070
to put their family through but they're
not doing exactly what they want to do.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:20.655
It's really lucky to be able to
find something where you can tell

00:30:20.655 --> 00:30:25.414
your own stories and have the
independence, have it all.

00:30:25.414 --> 00:30:32.637
Sometimes it's like money and
security or doing your own thing

00:30:32.637 --> 00:30:34.695
and having your independence.

00:30:34.695 --> 00:30:37.858
There's always some combination
of, very few people have both.

00:30:37.858 --> 00:30:39.715
Very few people have both.

00:30:39.715 --> 00:30:41.819
Voiceover: And you do now though.

00:30:41.819 --> 00:30:47.558
Davis: Probably more... documentaries
don't make... I make a good living

00:30:47.558 --> 00:30:51.177
but not the kind of living you'd make
if you were a big Hollywood dude.

00:30:51.177 --> 00:30:58.877
So there's a little bit of a
compromise but I picked independence

00:30:58.877 --> 00:31:05.945
and my own stuff over big name
success and big money success.

00:31:05.945 --> 00:31:10.636
There's always sort of a
choice between those two doors.

00:31:10.636 --> 00:31:15.583
Voiceover: Do you ever
regret the choice you made?

00:31:15.583 --> 00:31:18.444
Davis: I think everyone
always thinks about that,

00:31:18.444 --> 00:31:21.858
the turn of reworking it
in their brain and I do.

00:31:21.858 --> 00:31:27.229
I think what if I'd done
that and what if, could I?

00:31:27.229 --> 00:31:35.202
But I think I've won the
jackpot because I love this job.

00:31:35.202 --> 00:31:38.624
I like being where you are which is
meeting people and asking questions

00:31:38.624 --> 00:31:42.547
and learning, the job
keeps filling you up.

00:31:42.547 --> 00:31:45.879
And the independence to
sort of choose my stuff

00:31:45.879 --> 00:31:48.934
and the stuff I do is pretty great.

00:31:48.934 --> 00:31:50.494
Voiceover: Your dad's passed away now?

00:31:50.494 --> 00:31:52.716
Davis: He saw my very first
film, that first year,

00:31:52.716 --> 00:31:54.123
the first film that we talked about.

00:31:54.123 --> 00:31:55.522
Voiceover: And what did he think of it?

00:31:55.522 --> 00:31:57.910
Davis: So that was one of
the great memories I have

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:02.918
is we were at a screening in Washington
and I left to go to the bathroom.

00:32:02.918 --> 00:32:10.643
It was dark and I saw him watch the
movie and he didn't see me watching him

00:32:10.643 --> 00:32:15.538
watch the movie so I got to
see him sort of watch my movie.

00:32:15.538 --> 00:32:22.143
And he was smiling and enjoying it
and I could tell that he liked it.

00:32:22.143 --> 00:32:23.810
Voiceover: Did he tell
that to you later on?

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:28.233
Davis: No I just saw it and he
was very effusive with praise

00:32:28.233 --> 00:32:37.776
but kids start to hear that praise
and start to not believe it.

00:32:37.776 --> 00:32:45.122
So I got to see it, I got to see
it without him trying to praise me.

00:32:45.122 --> 00:32:49.187
I got to feel his praise without
him having to give it to me.

00:32:49.187 --> 00:32:51.426
Voiceover: And he was supportive
of this the whole time

00:32:51.426 --> 00:32:52.595
that you were pursuing this?

00:32:52.595 --> 00:32:54.689
Davis: The movie I made was not
the kind of movie he would make.

00:32:54.689 --> 00:32:56.618
It was the opposite of what he would make,

00:32:56.618 --> 00:32:58.187
and yet he still appreciated it.

00:32:58.187 --> 00:32:59.093
That was the best part.

00:32:59.093 --> 00:33:01.195
It wasn't making his movies.

00:33:01.195 --> 00:33:02.569
Voiceover: This wasn't
a documentary this was-

00:33:02.569 --> 00:33:04.375
Davis: It was a documentary,
it was The First Year.

00:33:04.375 --> 00:33:05.384
It was my first-

00:33:05.384 --> 00:33:07.466
Voiceover: This was The First
Year, the first one you had made.

00:33:07.466 --> 00:33:12.260
You made the commercial films after that?

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.580
Davis: I made one of the commercial...

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.291
most of my television
career was before that.

00:33:18.291 --> 00:33:20.857
Voiceover: And he'd seen
that stuff as well? 

00:33:20.857 --> 00:33:23.934
Davis: He thought it was okay. (laughs)

00:33:23.934 --> 00:33:25.941
Voiceover: What do your
siblings do, out of curiosity?

00:33:25.941 --> 00:33:28.804
Davis: My brother's a filmmaker and
my sister produced his documentaries.

00:33:28.804 --> 00:33:30.502
Voiceover: So you're right, you're
right about the whole doctor thing?

00:33:30.502 --> 00:33:34.083
Davis: Oh, it's a degenerative thing.

00:33:34.083 --> 00:33:37.016
There's nowhere... you can't undo.

00:33:37.016 --> 00:33:39.262
Voiceover: Not degenerate
like being a doctor's bad,

00:33:39.262 --> 00:33:41.352
it's just that once your
parent is a filmmaker-

00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:44.986
Davis: Right, doctors, teachers, great.

00:33:44.986 --> 00:33:47.128
But it's hard to go back.

00:33:47.128 --> 00:33:48.755
Maybe I'm using the wrong word.

00:33:48.755 --> 00:33:51.006
Voiceover: Right.

00:33:51.006 --> 00:33:54.232
Voiceover: Yeah it's limited
you to that universe.

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:56.741
It's not a bad universe.

00:33:56.741 --> 00:33:58.432
Thank you, this was really fun.

00:33:58.432 --> 00:34:01.060
Davis: It's an honor to be in your
office, sitting in your office.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.374
Voiceover: It's an honor
to hear you say that.
