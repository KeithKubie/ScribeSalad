00:00:04.146 --> 00:00:06.520
NARRATOR: There are a couple
of things in this scene that

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.810
seem unusual, but
one thing sticks out

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.690
more than everything else.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.500
The building's
foundation appears

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.670
to fall away into oblivion.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.130
It looks like something out
of an M.C. Escher picture

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.995
or an Indiana Jones movie.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.730
The scene was
captured by this guy.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.500
BRYAN TIGHE: Hi, my
name is Bryan Tighe.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.259
I'm a software developer
and an amateur photographer.

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.050
NARRATOR: Bryan was
traveling with his wife

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.190
through Lalibela, a mountainous
region in northern Ethiopia.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.540
Bryan took this photo on a visit
to a church that was actually

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.965
carved into a hill.

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:41.840
BRYAN TIGHE: To reach
this particular church,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.617
we walked along a shallow ravine
that eventually became deeper.

00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:46.700
The trail moved up to the
left side of the ravine,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.130
and then we rounded
a corner to the left,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.040
revealing a church to our right
on the other side of this now

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.020
very deep chasm.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.170
NARRATOR: The church
is one of several

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.580
in Lalibela with the same
unusual construction.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.469
Instead of being built
from the ground up,

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.510
these structures were
carved from the surrounding

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.370
volcanic rock.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.144
From the huge monolithic
block, windows and doors

00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:09.810
were carved out.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.380
And inside, an extensive
network of passages,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.054
ceremonial rooms, and catacombs.

00:01:16.054 --> 00:01:18.470
BRYAN TIGHE: The detail on the
craftsmanship were amazing.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.640
And once inside, we
watched the priests slowly

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.940
emerge from a back
room carrying candles,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.480
a large Bible, and a variety
of other sacred objects.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.540
They were all singing
and chanting in unison,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.870
and only the candles
lit the interior, which

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.941
created a very moody scene.

00:01:33.941 --> 00:01:35.690
NARRATOR: There are
13 monolithic churches

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.990
carved into the rocks, which
were commissioned by King

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.160
Lalibela in the 12th century.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.120
When Jerusalem fell to
the Muslims in 1187,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.050
the devoutly
Christian king decided

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.530
to construct a new Jerusalem
in his own homeland.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.390
Today thousands make
the journey to see

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.385
these astounding
man-made monuments.

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:55.010
BRYAN TIGHE: Seeing
this church and all

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.070
of the others for the
first time was a shock,

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.660
because it is just so remarkable
how all of these churches

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.500
were constructed out of
solid rock, and so long ago.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.230
Visiting Lalibela is like
stepping back in time

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.550
into another place,
another culture,

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.370
and another way of life.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.370
NARRATOR: Hey, everyone.
