00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.470
- [Instructor] Sue is a software engineer.

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.470
She wants to create a large scale drawing

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.860
of a processor inside a cell phone.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.060
The processor is a square chip,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.540
nine millimeters on each side.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.530
Draw the processor such that one unit

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.460
on the grid below represents
one half of a millimeter.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.670
All right, so let's just
think about these two worlds.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.180
You have the drawing,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.160
and you have the chip in the real world.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.920
The drawing, we're thinking in terms

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.180
of these units here on this graph paper,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.460
so units.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.150
And the chip, we're thinking
in terms of millimeters.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.403
And so we can set up a table here.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.470
And they tell us draw
it such that one unit

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.320
represents half a millimeter.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.760
So one unit would represent
one half of a millimeter.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.660
They tell us that the processor

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.580
is nine millimeters on each side.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.670
So that is how many times
as many millimeters?

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.130
Well, to go from one half to nine,

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.460
you have to multiply by 18.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.150
So that's going to be 18
times as many units as well.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.410
So if I want to do a scale
drawing right over here,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.110
it's going to be a square.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.600
It's a square chip.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.680
And since the scale is one unit,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.030
it represents half a millimeter.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.930
18 units would represent nine millimeters,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.860
and so I would want to
do 18 units on a side.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.170
So one,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.550
two, three,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.570
four, five, six,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.600
seven, eight, nine,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.250
10, 11,

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.973
12, 13,

00:01:32.973 --> 00:01:34.339
14, 15,

00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:35.256
16, 17, 18.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.490
So that would be the
left side of the chip.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.410
Let me just see if I can
draw a straight line there,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.470
just like that.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.900
And then it would also be 18 wide,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.960
18 units wide,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.450
representing nine millimeters
in the real world.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.450
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.847
11, 12,

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:54.778
13, 14,

00:01:54.778 --> 00:01:55.880
15, 16,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.713
17, 18.

00:01:56.713 --> 00:01:58.430
This is making my eyes hurt.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.080
All right, so just like that,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.780
and then I could draw
the other parts of it.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.830
It would be like that,

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.110
and then I would just go
straight down like that.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.520
And there you have it,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.140
I have drawn a scale
drawing of our processor,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.473
and we are all done.
