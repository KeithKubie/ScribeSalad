00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.210
Hello.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.150
Well, welcome to the next
presentation in the

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.260
trigonometry modules.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.340
Just to start off a little
bit, let's review what

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.070
we've done so far.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.320
In the last couple modules, we
learned the definitions-- or at

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.720
least, I guess, we could call
it a partial definition-- of

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.880
the sine, the cosine, and
the tangent functions.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.250
And the mnemonic we used to
memorize that was sohcahtoa.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.190
Let me write that down.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.620
Sohcahtoa.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.320
And what that told us is, let's
say we had a right triangle.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.705
Let me draw a right triangle.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.850
This is a right angle here.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.355
This is the hypotenuse.

00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:44.680
Let me label the hypotenuse, h.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.570
Let me label this-- and so we
want to figure out, we want to

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.730
use this angle right here.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.110
Theta, we'll call this theta.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.780
Whatever.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.650
Then this is the adjacent side,
and this is the opposite side.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.770
And that's an o.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.310
So soh tells us that sine
is equal to opposite

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.880
over hypotenuse.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.600
Cosine is equal to
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.250
And tangent is equal to
opposite over adjacent.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.310
And I think, by this point--
and especially if you did some

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.590
of the exercises on the Khan
Academy-- that should be second

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.470
nature and should make
a lot of sense to you.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.460
But this definition, using a
right triangle like this,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.140
actually breaks down
at certain points.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.390
Actually, at a lot of points.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.640
For example, what happens
as this angle right here

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.160
approaches 90 degrees?

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.280
You can't have two 90
degree angles in a right

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.330
triangle, can you?

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.620
Then it would be like a
rectangle or something.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.340
But you could actually probably
figure out what happens as

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.510
it approaches 90 degrees.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.980
But the definition, this
definition, breaks

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.340
down for that.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.280
Also, what happens if
this angle is negative?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.655
Or what happens if this angle
is more than 90 degrees?

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:52.600
Or what happens if
it's 800 degrees?

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.600
Or you know, 8 pi radians?

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.830
Not that 800 and 8 pi
radians are the same thing.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.180
But obviously, this definition
starts to break down.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.100
Because we couldn't even
draw a right triangle that

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.890
has those properties.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.630
So now I'm going to introduce
you to an extension

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.500
of this definition.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.920
It's really the same thing, but
it allows the sine, the cosine,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.970
and the tangent functions to be
defined for angles greater than

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.530
or equal to pi over 2, or 90
degrees, or less than 0.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.900
So let's draw a unit circle.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.290
So this is just the coordinate
axis, and here is a

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.700
circle of radius 1.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.540
And let's make-- let me see.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.920
Let me make sure I'm using
the correct pen tool.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.670
OK.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.930
So let's call this right
here-- so this is theta.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.220
This is an angle, right?

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.640
Between the x-axis and this
line I just drew here.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.010
And this is a radius, right?

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.590
And we said that this
has a radius 1.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.600
So the length of this
line is 1, right?

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.020
Because it just goes
from the origin to the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.820
outside of the circle.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.940
So it has a radius of 1.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.890
And now I'm going to draw
a right triangle again.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.500
Let me just drop a
line from here.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.920
So there I have a
right triangle.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.950
So if we use the old
definition we learned before.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.010
Let's just focus
on sine for now.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.920
So sine is equal to
opposite over hypotenuse.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.280
Let's apply that to this
right triangle right here.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.030
This is the right angle.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.170
So what's the opposite
angle of this?

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.840
What's the opposite
side from this angle?

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.090
I'm going to change to yellow.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.960
It's this side, right?

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.630
This is the opposite side.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.040
And what's the hypotenuse?

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.500
The hypotenuse is just
this radius, right?

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.440
And let's just say that this
point, where it intersects

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:54.550
the circle-- let's call this
point right here x comma y.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.450
So what's the height of
this opposite side?

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.300
Well, it's y, right?

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.130
Because it's just the
height of that point.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.570
This is of height y.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:13.170
So sine of this angle right
here, sine of theta, is

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.400
going to equal the opposite
side-- which is this yellow

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.340
side, which is just the
y-coordinate-- is going to

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.490
equal y over the hypotenuse.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.930
The hypotenuse is
this pink side here.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.350
And what's the length
of the hypotenuse?

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.750
Well, it's the radius
of this unit circle.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.600
So it's 1.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.100
And y divided by 1?

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.860
Well, that's just y.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:40.040
So we see that sine of
theta is equal to y.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.520
Let's do the same thing
for cosine of theta.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.700
Well, we know that cosine
is equal to adjacent

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.430
over hypotenuse.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.410
Well, what's the
adjacent side here?

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.470
I'm running out of colors.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.200
The adjacent side is this
bottom side, right here.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.390
So that would equal-- so
if I said-- I'm running

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.760
out of space, too.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.460
Cosine of theta would equal
this gray side-- which is

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.250
the adjacent side--
and what is that?

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.350
What is this length?

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.610
What is the length
of this side?

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.430
Well, it's just x, right?

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.070
If this is the point x, y then
this distance here is x and we

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.250
already learned this distance--
or we already observed--

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.740
that this distance is y.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.100
So this distance being
just x, we know that the

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.280
adjacent length is x.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.980
So we say cosine of theta is
equal to x over the hypotenuse.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.360
And once again, the
hypotenuse is 1.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.330
So cosine of theta
is equal to x.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.120
I know what you're thinking.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.820
Sal, that's very nice and cute.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.280
Cosine of theta equals x,
sine of theta equals y.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.760
But how is this really
different from what we

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.670
were doing before?

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.160
Well, if I define it this way,
now all of a sudden when the

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.940
angle becomes 90 degrees,
now I can actually define

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.980
what sine of theta is.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.540
Sine of theta now is just y.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.190
Is just the y-coordinate,
which is 1.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.400
If theta is equal to-- I'm
going to make sure it's very

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.610
messy right here-- if theta
is equal to 90 degrees,

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.000
or pi over 2 radians.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.680
This is pi over 2.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.870
This angle right here.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.590
And similar, cosine
of pi over 2 is 0.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.650
Because the x-coordinate
right here is 0.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.060
Let me do it with a
couple more examples.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.050
Oh, I'm forgetting the
tangent function.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.740
And you could probably
figure out now, what is the

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.650
definition now we can use
for the tangent function?

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.600
Well, going back-- let's
use this green theta here.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.490
Because it's kind
of a normal angle.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.830
So in this green angle
here, tangent is

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.680
opposite over adjacent.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.040
So tangent now, we
can define as y/x.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.760
And remember, these y's and x's
that we're using are the point

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.780
on the unit circle where the
angle that's defined by this--

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.440
by whatever-- where the radius
that is subtended by this

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.150
angle, or I guess the arc,
intersects-- actually,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.940
I'm getting confused
with terminology.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.810
It's where this line
intersects the circumference.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.800
The coordinate of that-- the
sine of theta is equal to y.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.750
The cosine of theta
is equal to x.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.740
And the tangent of
theta is equal to y/x.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.020
Let's do a couple of examples
and hopefully this'll make a

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.110
little bit more sense to you.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.246
Let me try to really fast
draw a new unit circle.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.030
So that's my unit circle.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.960
And here's the coordinate axis.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.530
It's one of them.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.000
And here is the other one.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:04.010
So if we use the angle-- let's
use the angle pi over 2, right?

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.450
Theta equals pi over 2.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.670
Well, pi over 2 is right here.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.860
It's a 90 degree angle, if
you wanted to use degrees.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.300
And now, we just figure
out where it intersects

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:15.840
the unit circle.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.715
And once again, this is
a unit circle, so it

00:08:17.715 --> 00:08:20.300
has a radius of 1.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:29.210
So we can see that sine of pi
over 2 equals the y-coordinate

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.080
where it intersects
the unit circle.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.630
So that's just 1.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.090
What's cosine of pi over 2?

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.090
Well, it's just the
x-coordinate, where you

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.220
intersect the unit circle.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.060
And the x-coordinate here is 0.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.900
And what's the tangent
of pi over 2?

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.700
This is interesting.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.770
The tangent of pi over 2.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.450
Well, the tangent we
defined now as y/x.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.910
So the y-coordinate, this
is the point 0, 1, right?

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.610
The y-coordinate is 1.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:02.460
So it equals 1/0.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.750
So this is undefined.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.800
So still, we don't have a
tangent function that can

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.640
define itself at
certain points.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.660
But in the next module, we're
actually going to graph this.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.470
And you'll see that it
approaches infinity.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:21.580
And similarly, we could try to
find the functions for when

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.100
theta equals pi, right?

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.060
That's like 180 degrees.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.570
That's this point right here.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.450
So sine of pi.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.820
What's the y-coordinate
at this point?

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.720
Well, this point is
negative 1 comma 0.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.880
So the y-coordinate is 0.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.940
What's the x-coordinate?

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.520
Cosine of pi.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.260
That's negative 1.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.570
And of course, what's the
tangent of pi radians?

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.220
It's y/x.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.400
So it's 0 over negative
1, which equals 0.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.760
Hopefully this makes sense.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.730
Now in the next module I'll
actually graph these points.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:04.450
And you'll see how it all comes
together and why it is useful

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:09.010
to define the sine, the cosine,
the tangent functions this way.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:10.160
See you soon.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.460
Bye.
