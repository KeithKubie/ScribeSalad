RICHARD DOLAN: November, 1944.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.710
One of the early
interesting Foo Fire reports

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.710
comes from the 415th
Night Fighter Squadron.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.670
They're flying missions
over northeastern France.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.380
That's not far from Germany.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.170
And this is still
in Nazi-occupied

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.920
part of France where you've
got a number of lights--

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.920
eight, 10, 12 lights coming
in on the left of the aircraft

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.540
group that are apparently
maneuvering in a very

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.500
unusual way, and
then just take off

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.330
at a very high rate of speed.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.380
This type of thing was
reported many times.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.420
JACQUES VALLEE: The pilots often
described these objects were

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.380
sort of fuzzy
lights that could be

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.000
a plasma light that would
come up from the ground

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.580
towards the airplane.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.250
And we know that
now, because there

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.750
have been re-investigations
of all the flights.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.750
At the time, of course,
there was no Air Force.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.790
There was the Army Air Force.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.620
They were taking reports
from pilots very,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.620
very seriously, because if
there was a new German weapon,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.920
all the pilots needed
to know about it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.580
and they needed to think
about evasive action.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.040
These objects were called
different things at the time

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.750
before they got a name,
and the name that stuck

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.460
was Foo Fighters.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.290
And it comes from a comic strip
that was popular at the time

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.460
called "Smokey Stover."

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.210
And he had a saying which
was, where there's a Foo,

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.960
there's fire.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.620
The US government has never
offered an explanation

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.380
for the Foo Fighters.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.880
We know that the OSS, which
was the precursor of the CIA,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.420
investigated.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.500
We know that British
intelligence investigated this.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.960
And we don't have conclusions.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.830
Dr. Hynek, he was
just as puzzled as,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.620
I think, anybody else.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.080
My father would refer
to the Foo Fighters

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.500
as sort of an
example of something

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.290
that they're something
fairly serious

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.830
that we should look into.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.500
Or, you know, it's worthy
of investigation, at least

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.000
it supports the
idea that there's

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.290
something going on that
we don't understand

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.080
or we should look into.
