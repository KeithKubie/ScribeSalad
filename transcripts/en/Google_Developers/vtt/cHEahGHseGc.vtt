00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.600
IDO GREEN: Hi.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.280
Welcome to our new
series of videos

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.340
that will bring you news
and best practices on Action

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.540
on Google.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.879
I'm Ido Green, a developer
advocate for Action on Google.

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.670
I love to help
entrepreneurs and developers

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.110
to be more productive.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.780
And today, we're going
to learn three design

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.190
tips that will help us build
better apps for the Google

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.100
Assistant.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.270
Cool?

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.760
The Google Assistant
is a conversation

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.950
between the users and Google.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.920
Users can get things done by
talking with their system.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.130
Designing a spoken dialogue
between a human and a computer

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.340
in advance, accounting
for all possibilities

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.830
both in function
and user behavior

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.830
and still have it feel natural--

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.910
it's harder than
it looks or sounds.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.700
The key to building a
good voice interface

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.850
is not to fall into the
trap of simply converting

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.990
a graphical user interface
into a voice user interface.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.710
This defeats the purpose
of using a conversation.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.950
People are not going to change
how they talk anytime soon,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.220
so we need to take what we
know about human-to-human

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.180
conversation and apply it so
our apps can talk to humans

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.760
in a more natural way.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.550
The top three design tips--

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.710
one, create a persona.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.470
Two, think outside
the box, literally.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.350
Three, remember that
in conversations, there

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.520
are no errors.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.850
Now let's go a bit deeper
on each of these tips.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.620
Create a persona.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.200
It's a good way to
start your design phase

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.865
with a persona of your app.

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:44.480
The persona should be based
on the user population

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.560
and their needs and the imagery
and qualities associated

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.620
with your app's brand.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.830
It's the consist characters
captured by the voice

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.980
and interactive experience.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.470
It's the face of the
experience for the users, who

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.490
they will be talking to.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.520
A persona is conveyed through
tone, word or phrase of choice,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.970
style, technique, voice.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.520
Think, for example,
about a realtor persona

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.360
or a warm friend persona.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.720
Which persona will
be best fitted?

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.240
Think outside the
box, literally.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.400
You should write
your core experience

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.050
like you would
write a screenplay.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.110
This can be scrappy as acting
it out with a colleague

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.280
and documenting it on a paper or
creating an interactive Wizard

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.640
of Oz prototype.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.100
You tweak and play until you
are ready to start coding.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.160
And then, when you draw
out your initial version,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.980
keep it to high level,
where the boxes represent

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.200
an entire dialogs
of user's intent,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.350
but leave out the individual
wording you will want

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.480
to use in each interaction.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.720
In conversations,
there are no errors.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.590
When a problem
happens, imagine what

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.110
the users hear when your Actions
say, I don't understand you.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.890
This is one of the greatest
cause of users' frustration

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.860
and aversions to
voice interfaces.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.750
People get angry and
raise their voices

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.890
and repeat the same answer.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.310
We need to give people credit
for knowing how to speak.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.340
Just because they don't
understand a prompt or a choice

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.110
doesn't mean they don't
speak the language.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.270
So help them be successful.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.660
For example, rather
than asking, would you

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.510
like to hear about topic
A or B and expecting

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.540
them to say A or B,
ask them precisely,

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.960
which of these topics
do you prefer, A or B?

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.480
See, the first question is
both yes, no and either,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.110
or question.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.400
And remember what
happened along the way.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.080
Maintain context.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.020
The best way to course
correct in advance

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.030
while still maintaining
a natural, comfortable

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.060
conversation is to plan
of these occurrences

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.050
as if they were any other
turn in the conversation.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.690
In other words,
treat them as input

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.750
that didn't cause any error.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.290
