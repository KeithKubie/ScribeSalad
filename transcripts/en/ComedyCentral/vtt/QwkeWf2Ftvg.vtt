00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.621
(The Super Late Morning Show theme music)

00:00:02.621 --> 00:00:05.153
(turn table screech)
(Breaking News theme)

00:00:05.153 --> 00:00:06.293
- Breaking news man, we got breaking news.

00:00:06.293 --> 00:00:08.554
We're going live to our field
reporter, Rev Donaldson.

00:00:08.554 --> 00:00:11.173
(dramatic music)

00:00:11.173 --> 00:00:12.318
- Thank you Keith and Kenny.

00:00:12.318 --> 00:00:13.666
We are live on the scene here

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.487
where some information has surfaced,

00:00:15.487 --> 00:00:19.416
possibly saying that the
legendary rapper Tupac Shakur

00:00:19.416 --> 00:00:21.997
is indeed still alive.

00:00:21.997 --> 00:00:24.925
If you'll follow me right here camera man,

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:28.587
there's a Timberland
footprint at 11 and a half.

00:00:28.587 --> 00:00:31.337
The exact size Tupac Shakur wore.

00:00:32.557 --> 00:00:35.307
(dramatic music)

00:00:36.142 --> 00:00:37.929
- Pac's footprint?

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:39.298
- It's hard to say Keith or Kenny.

00:00:39.298 --> 00:00:42.524
These shoes are very
popular with the negroes.

00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:44.774
They love a good Timbaland.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.612
Tupac conspiracy theorists believe that

00:00:48.612 --> 00:00:51.609
if you yell out to
Tupac, he will call back.

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:52.692
Let's try it.

00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:54.490
West side!

00:00:55.753 --> 00:00:57.220
- [Someone] West side!

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.078
- [Tupac Audio] West side.

00:00:59.078 --> 00:01:01.782
- [Mystery Audio] West side.

00:01:01.782 --> 00:01:02.862
(computer noises)

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.811
- [Computer] Tupac identified.

00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:08.004
- Let's go.
(dramatic music)

00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:10.864
We might've just heard Tupac Shakur.

00:01:10.864 --> 00:01:11.697
Who knows?

00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:14.464
Oh my god!

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:20.364
Oh my god that was, was that Tupac?

00:01:20.364 --> 00:01:22.561
Was that him? Or was it
just another black guy?

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:24.794
Who can tell? They all look alike.

00:01:24.794 --> 00:01:26.035
I'll tell ya,

00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:27.327
big penises on those guys.

00:01:27.327 --> 00:01:28.470
Let's go back to the studio.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.781
(dramatic music)

00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:32.894
- Thanks Rev, that was

00:01:32.894 --> 00:01:35.313
incredibly racist but you're
the best in the business

00:01:35.313 --> 00:01:37.883
and he knows how to track Tupac
like the best of them so...

00:01:37.883 --> 00:01:40.550
(hip hop music)

00:01:54.626 --> 00:01:57.876
(high pitched buzzing)
