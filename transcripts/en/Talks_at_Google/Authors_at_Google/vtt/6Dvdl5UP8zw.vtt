CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Katty and I, my
co-author and I, were struck.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.860
We had written one book
before called "Womenomics,"

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.840
which was essentially a look
at women in the workplace.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.049
And I hope a lot of
you know this data,

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:18.340
because it's really compelling.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.530
But there's all this
data about the more women

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.970
there are at the
top of companies,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.060
the more money a company makes,
and just a really interesting

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.050
case for diversity that's
not based on doing things

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.310
because it's right.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.540
It's really just because
it makes business sense.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.830
So that's what we
were writing about.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.413
But we were doing
all these interviews

00:00:35.413 --> 00:00:38.080
with women who were incredibly
successful, probably

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.870
like a lot of you in this
room, and certainly looked

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.640
successful to us and confident.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.700
And they would say things
to us like, well, I'm

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.230
about to get a promotion but
I don't think I'm qualified.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.220
Or my bosses want
me to try this.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.390
I don't know that
I'm ready, or even

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.390
talk about feeling like an
imposter, which was something

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.540
we all are familiar with.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.750
But we were so struck by that.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.740
Because I think Katty and
I both have felt frequently

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.010
that we're not
confident, or failures.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.930
But this is crazy.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.290
These women are so successful.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.010
And so we started
digging into that

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.930
to see whether there
was data behind it.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.400
And essentially,
we found there is

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.310
a lot of data to support
the notion that there's

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.930
a confidence gap
between men and women,

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.000
especially at work, not as
much in our social lives

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.420
or in our family lives
or lives with friends.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.420
And we started to try
to look at why that is.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.980
I mean, one of the
best pieces of data

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.570
that I like is this corporate
poll that was done that showed

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.570
that women will apply
for a job or a promotion

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.880
when we feel we have--
what percentage would you

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.318
imagine of the qualifications?

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:52.090
Yeah, 100-- I heard 100.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.280
And I don't think
110 was an option.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.890
Because definitely,
we would want 110.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.580
And men will take the
risk at about 60%.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.444
And of course, what we found
over time is that attitude,

00:02:04.444 --> 00:02:06.610
it's not just about applying
for jobs or promotions.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.580
It's about is this report ready?

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.330
Am I going to participate
in this meeting?

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.190
Am I going to do this?

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.106
Am I going to do that?

00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:16.030
And women are constantly
judging themselves not quite

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.680
ready or not quite prepared.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.807
And in fact, men tend to
swing the opposite way.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:21.640
It's so interesting.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.400
Columbia University has
studied this proclivity

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.110
on the part of men to kind of be
overconfident or overconfident

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.560
about their performance in
taking a test, let's say.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.350
And they found, on average,
men are overconfident

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.674
or overestimate their
abilities by about 30%.

00:02:38.674 --> 00:02:40.090
But what's interesting
about that,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.030
too, is they call that
honest overconfidence.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.120
I think for a lot of years, I
thought, that's just bravado.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.250
These men are just faking it.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.510
They're not faking it.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.250
They really do have that--

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.460
I see that with my son.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.910
They have that ability to
assess themselves differently.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.400
And I think what we ultimately
found is that matters at work.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.760
Confidence actually matters
in terms of success.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.170
There's a professor who's been
studying this out at Berkeley--

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.510
confidence versus competence.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.220
And he's found
that in many cases,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.420
confidence trumps
competence in terms

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.430
of being valuable for
traditional success, which

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.290
we found sort of appalling.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.590
But we realized this is a
skill women need to build.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.590
SPEAKER: I think a lot
of us can relate to that.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.715
And we've actually done
some internal studies here.

00:03:31.715 --> 00:03:34.247
And I think maybe you
even wrote about this--

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:35.080
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Yes.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.640
SPEAKER: About this project
where-- and some of you

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.306
might be familiar
with this-- at Google,

00:03:38.306 --> 00:03:41.650
where women weren't
putting themselves forward

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.510
for promotions in our
engineering teams.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.470
And so somebody recognized that
women weren't getting promoted.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.480
So they started to
send out emails to say,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.670
put yourself forward.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.640
And once women were
getting nudged to, OK, I'm

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.530
going to try, then they
recognized that they

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.460
could put themselves forward.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.390
And the numbers shot up.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.570
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: That's amazing.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.640
SPEAKER: But they weren't seeing
women put themselves forward.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.100
I think we've come a long way
since that original study.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.070
But I think maybe we talked
about that a couple years ago.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.390
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: We did.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.880
No, I can't remember if
we put it in our book.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.507
Or certainly, I talk
about that a lot.

00:04:09.507 --> 00:04:10.090
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.770
But I think a lot of
us can relate to that.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.600
So as you started
to look into that,

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.487
then you wrote the
"Confidence Code."

00:04:16.487 --> 00:04:18.820
And then do you want to just
talk a little bit about how

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.740
that evolved and thinking
about people coming up

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.955
to you about their children?

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.710
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Well, so
we wrote the "Confidence

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.830
Code," which really
seemed to strike

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.090
a chord with a lot of women.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.150
And the other thing I
will say about confidence,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.980
just so we all
understand the formula--

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.040
because in the book for adults,
we got a little obsessive

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.980
about the science, the biology.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.130
Where does it come from?

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.838
How do we get it?

00:04:40.838 --> 00:04:43.520
Do men have a confidence
gene that women don't have?

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.380
Sort of all of these questions
about the origin questions.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.080
And men don't, in fact,
have a confidence gene

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.620
that we don't have,
which is nice to know.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.140
But confidence is
partly genetic, which

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.850
we thought was really weird.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.760
And we tested our genes for
the genes they know about

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.220
now to see whether we had them.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.180
We don't.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.720
Katty and I are
both basket cases

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.560
in terms of confidence genes.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.210
But it's only partly genetic.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.240
And the bulk of
our confidence, we

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.430
build throughout the
course of our lives.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.700
And this is so
important for women.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.990
So confidence isn't about
feeling good or feeling

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.140
that we're valuable or how
we feel about ourselves.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.080
Confidence heavily
involves action.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.160
So confidence is what turns
our thoughts into action.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.390
And that's important.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.890
Because I think
we often get stuck

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.590
in the thinking part of that.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.590
And we say, oh, I'm going
to think and over-think

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.290
that and not act.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.790
But what we also found is
the creation of confidence,

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.290
it's really a virtuous circle.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:54.200
You build more confidence when
you take that risk and you act.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.760
And maybe you fail.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.660
Maybe you struggle.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.118
Maybe you work
through the process,

00:05:58.118 --> 00:05:59.580
but you master something.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.730
That's the way you
build more confidence.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.120
So when women don't
act, they're not

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.350
stockpiling more confidence.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.980
So that, we thought,
was pretty critical.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.670
And what we realized is
happening with girls is--

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.300
and we got pretty obsessed also
with girls and young women.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.900
Because we're like, gosh,
they excel at school.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.890
They just beat the pants off
boys right now at school.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.540
It's really people
who are worried

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.020
about education are worrying
more about boys than girls.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:36.050
So why are young women
still not confident?

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.570
And what we realized is
happening-- and Carol Dweck,

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.490
who wrote the great
book, "Mindset"--

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.230
people here might be
familiar with it--

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.070
explained to us that if life
were one long grade school,

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.310
girls would rule
the world, right?

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.490
But it's not.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.760
And the standards
change appreciably

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.390
once we're out in
the real world.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.970
And so what happens with girls
is we become perfectionists.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.750
We are so good early on
because of the different ways

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.839
our brains work, our higher EQ
at pleasing people, coloring

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:08.630
within the lines,
getting everything right,

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.010
doing everything.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.710
And parents and
teachers encourage that.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.390
And by the time girls
are in high school

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.931
and middle school
today, I mean, it's

00:07:15.931 --> 00:07:19.190
worse than ever, I mean
full-blown, people-pleasing

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.720
perfectionists.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.510
And if you're a perfectionist,
what do you not want to do?

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.270
SPEAKER: Fail.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.770
CLAIRE SHIPMAN:
That's way too scary

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.537
to take risks if
you're a perfectionist.

00:07:29.537 --> 00:07:32.120
You want to stay in your lane,
do what you're already good at.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.290
And so boys still, from an
early age-- and forgive me.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.540
You'll see that this is
a positive as I'm talking

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.070
about you men in the room--

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.990
I mean, they fail
all over the place

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.670
typically from an early age.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.650
They just do it more naturally.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.390
And they learn it doesn't
matter that much, which

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.090
is a powerful lesson to learn.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.840
Girls aren't really
learning that as much.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.760
And then you hit the workplace.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.400
And that's what you
need to be able to do,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.570
is take risks and fail.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.670
It's almost as though somebody--

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.860
we educate girls in this system.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.360
And it's like, oh,
and by the way,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.060
we're going to require something
completely different of you

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.950
right now.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.550
And what we found-- and a
little bit of the data we had

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.840
was that the drop for
confidence for girls

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.980
seems to happen about puberty.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.130
And between that
and then what we

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.680
would hear from parents who
were talking to us a lot

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.950
as we would give speeches about,
yeah, this is all great for me.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.390
But what can I do
for my daughter?

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.620
You know, this is crazy.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.450
What's going on
with my daughter?

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.480
We just thought we wanted
to dive in and really

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.970
take a harder look at
what's happening with girls

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.662
and see if we could
just help a bit.

00:08:41.662 --> 00:08:44.120
SPEAKER: And are there some
practical things that all of us

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.250
can think about, who first
of all, who are parents

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.140
and how we conduct
ourselves at home

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.230
and how we react to things
that happen in our own lives?

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.632
Do you have some tips on that?

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:53.465
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Yes.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.580
So if you think about
what you most want

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.970
your daughters to do--

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.220
and it's hard to do.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.430
Because remember,
all of this pressure

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.320
about school and grades--

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.860
and it's all out there.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:14.150
But you do want your kids to
build resilience and confidence

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.950
while they're still
at home with you.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.880
And that necessarily involves
struggle and failure.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.820
So I think the most
important thing--

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.590
and it's actually
kind of liberating

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.550
as a parent, because you
can suddenly say, oh,

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.610
as your child is striking out
the fifth time in a row at bat

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:32.360
or whatever it is.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.800
And you think, oh, my god.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.280
This is horrible.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.700
And you have to
realize, actually,

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.260
if I can help him
through this, this

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.250
is going to be a
great life experience.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.940
So I would say the
overarching tip

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.940
is look for ways
you can encourage

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.090
your daughters to step
outside of their comfort zones

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.730
and do things they're
really not good at

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.620
and get comfortable
being uncomfortable.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.050
And that's going to be
different for every girl.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.660
I mean, my daughter
loves athletics.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.521
She's a tomboy.

00:10:00.521 --> 00:10:02.270
I thought when we
started working on this,

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.978
I thought, oh, well,
that won't be Della.

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:07.650
She'll be immune to this stuff
because she's kind of sporty.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.150
She's still a perfectionist.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.130
Oh, I'm never going to try
out for the debate team.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.060
I'm too scared.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.170
Or I don't want to stand
on the stage to do this.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:19.820
So you have to look
for opportunities

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.430
where you can say, try it.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.560
The result doesn't
matter, really kind of

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.847
make them feel they
have a safe environment.

00:10:26.847 --> 00:10:29.180
But look for areas where they
might be able to do things

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.100
where failure is OK.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.242
And they see that they
can work through it.

00:10:33.242 --> 00:10:34.700
SPEAKER: And do
you think about how

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.950
you might react to things
that happen in your work day

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.020
and talk about that?

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.750
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Well, so I
think for mothers especially,

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.450
the most important thing we
can do is be good role models.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.062
And I mean, especially
for all of you,

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:47.270
because it's too late for me.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.290
I screwed up.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.220
And it's like all over.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.330
But please-- it's
not too late for you.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:00.560
But we want a model
that we struggle too

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.250
and that we have failures.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.700
And we have things that
are hard to deal with.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.650
And have those
discussions with them

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.940
and say, oh, my
editor who's here--

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.260
I remember distinctly talking
to Della at one point, saying,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.952
oh, I got notes
back from my editor.

00:11:15.952 --> 00:11:17.660
I'm not going to want
to go through them.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.076
There are things
she doesn't like.

00:11:19.076 --> 00:11:21.510
Or I'm going to have to
really deal with this,

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.220
and then sort of having her
listen and talk through, well,

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:25.970
but that's OK.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:30.290
I think overall, she likes the
book, and some of these changes

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.400
are going to make sense.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.910
And I kind of open them
up to some of that stuff

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.830
that we deal with that's hard.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.830
I mean, it's not our natural
inclination to want to do that.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.000
But if they see that their
parent is trying all the time

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
to be perfect, then that's
really not great role modeling

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.500
for them.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.670
And I would also say--

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.300
so we did a lot of
polling for this book.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.820
Because we wanted more data.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.360
And we did find, in fact,
that girls experience,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.640
between the ages of eight and
14, a 30% drop in confidence,

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.300
really big.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.190
Up till age eight,
girls and boys

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.680
have the same
confidence measures.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.260
But the other thing we
found is that fathers

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.810
are better at recognizing
a lack of confidence

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.270
in their daughters
than mothers are.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.180
So I think dads can actually
play a really important role.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.640
Because this behavior does look
so weird to them typically,

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.335
right?

00:12:24.335 --> 00:12:26.543
It's like, what do you mean
you're scared to do this?

00:12:26.543 --> 00:12:28.160
It just doesn't make
sense, whereas I

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.100
think we don't like
it, but there's

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.660
part of us that understands it.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.243
Oh, yeah, I know why
you wouldn't want

00:12:34.243 --> 00:12:36.870
to get up on stage, totally.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.082
So I think fathers
can do a lot, too.

00:12:39.082 --> 00:12:40.290
SPEAKER: That's a good point.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.237
And then you also
looked at social media.

00:12:42.237 --> 00:12:43.070
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Yes.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.100
We did look at social media.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.440
You know, look, we tried
to be realistic about it.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.080
Because kids kind of live
on social media right now.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.600
And for girls--

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.710
I'm going to take
a step back and say

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.870
the other thing that
happens besides a confidence

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:00.795
drop for girls--

00:13:00.795 --> 00:13:01.670
and this is related--

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.470
is that at puberty,
this instinct

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:07.800
to ruminate or
over-think kicks in.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.580
And that is something that
we all really probably

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.280
experience as women,
where you get that review.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.010
And you think about the
one area of improvement

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:19.092
and not the rest of it,
which was great for two weeks

00:13:19.092 --> 00:13:20.050
straight, and you know?

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:20.800
SPEAKER: Or years.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.000
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Yeah,
or years, maybe, years--

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.130
as Jen pointed out, she
still remembers that trip,

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.950
that failure in Moscow.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:31.770
It's like right there,
front and center.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.057
But this starts from
girls at puberty.

00:13:34.057 --> 00:13:35.390
And I really was struck by that.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.400
Because I thought, oh, my gosh.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.810
What must that feel like?

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.450
Your brain is being hijacked
and you don't really

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.400
understand what's
happening and why you can't

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.220
stop thinking about something.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.480
Well, what social media
does, the psychologists

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.170
talked to us about, for girls is
that it just exacerbates that.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:52.985
So it's like
ruminating on steroids.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.070
15, 20 years ago,
you might have been

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.490
able to go home, have a fight
with a friend, get a bad grade,

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:02.600
whatever it is.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.420
And you're forced to put that
aside at least for a couple

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.470
of hours or overnight.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.210
That just doesn't
happen anymore.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.620
It just keeps going and going.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.780
And it's amplified.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:16.070
So our goal in the
book is to help

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.950
girls understand that,
understand that there are ways

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.800
you can put it down
that are realistic,

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.740
not just never use social media.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.640
Because it's just not something
that's going to happen.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.170
But I think also
just as importantly,

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.280
how do you use it
in a positive way?

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.910
Because there are
really powerful

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.950
ways for girls to use it.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:40.010
At this age, there's this
desire to connect, to find

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.720
people who are like them.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:48.860
Girls are very open at that
age to inspirational advice,

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.070
inspirational sayings,
seeing role models, people

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.680
they really admire and how
they think about things.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.890
So I think we tried to
offer a lot of suggestions

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.460
about how they can find
their tribe that way

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.872
and really focus on
that in a positive way.

00:15:03.872 --> 00:15:05.830
SPEAKER: And you did a
campaign with Instagram.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:06.788
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: We did.

00:15:06.788 --> 00:15:09.730
We did a great campaign
with Instagram called--

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.280
and now I'm going to blank.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.360
We did an amazing
campaign with Instagram,

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.670
which was girls showing their--

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:22.200
basically, it was basically
showing your confidence--

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.550
Capture Confidence.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:26.670
But show yourself
doing something

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.170
that makes you feel confident.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:34.110
Don't show yourself looking
photoshopped or perfect

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:35.940
or having the perfect
life for something

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.740
where you're going to
get a million likes.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.690
Show yourself doing something.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:41.680
So we have a big focus
on action in the book,

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.470
but that makes you
feel confident.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:47.190
And we just had a bunch of
incredible girls who helped us

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.610
with that who were very
out-of-the-box girls.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.760
And we had a great
reaction to it.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.020
SPEAKER: I'm curious.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.663
The timing of this book--

00:15:57.663 --> 00:16:00.540
oops-- I think with
Me Too movement.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.280
I'm just curious if
you have thoughts

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.200
on this whole good
girl, don't rock

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.671
the boat, the way a
lot of us were raised.

00:16:06.671 --> 00:16:08.796
And in light of what we're
seeing with Me Too, what

00:16:08.796 --> 00:16:09.750
have you thought about that?

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:10.583
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Yes.

00:16:10.583 --> 00:16:14.430
Well, Me Too was exploding as
we were finishing the book--

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.840
again, as our editor
here will remember.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:21.960
And we thought about, how do
we talk about this for eight

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.130
to 12-year-old girls?

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.890
Because it's not
straightforward.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.110
But it is true that I
think what we realized

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.200
is girls are absolutely
essential to creating

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.430
a speak-up culture.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.310
And I think one of
the biggest risks--

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:39.010
if we all agree that confidence
involves taking some risks--

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:42.630
one of the biggest risks
for them is speaking up

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.350
in a way that might mean
people don't like them,

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.480
or they're not pleasing the
person they want to please.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.860
And so we created a
manifesto in the book,

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.949
which really has to do with--

00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:57.240
my favorite part of it--
there are three or four bullet

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:57.900
points--

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.930
is it's not my job
to please people,

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:03.510
and I think for
girls to understand

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:07.050
that is not their primary
function, right, to constantly

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.930
be the person who's
going to be liked

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.819
or that adults are going
to think is wonder--

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:17.220
they need to learn a little
bit of bravery on that front,

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.190
if you will.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:23.829
And I think once they feel
confident about speaking up,

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:27.150
I think that will be a big
boost for the next generation

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.460
in the workplace.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.465
SPEAKER: We hope, yeah.

00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:31.390
Well, we definitely
want to take questions.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.120
So there is a mic there.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.010
If you guys could line
up, we'll do that.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:38.580
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: It will require
confidence to move to the mic

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.630
and ask that question.

00:17:44.457 --> 00:17:46.040
SPEAKER: So do you
have any other tips

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.884
in the book that come to
mind about language, or?

00:17:48.884 --> 00:17:51.050
Also, with social media,
just the whole idea of just

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:52.100
put down the phone
for a little while.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:52.440
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Right.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.480
SPEAKER: Things
like that, I think,

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.023
that just seem so obvious.

00:17:54.023 --> 00:17:54.590
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: We do.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:55.670
SPEAKER: Just to cool off.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.440
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: We sort
of have the 24-hour rule,

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.610
which is the cool-off rule.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:01.200
We have the kind of
you can write something

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.140
but don't send it right away.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.540
Wait a day before you send
it, which I still need

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.720
to actually employ sometimes.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.880
I think one of my favorite
rules really is to--

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.820
we call it--

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.690
I guess it's not really get
out of your comfort zone.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:24.560
I guess it's really the
rule of almost taking it,

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.650
giving yourself a time-out,
which is when you have

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.781
something scary happen to you
or you are processing a failure

00:18:30.781 --> 00:18:32.780
and you're starting to
ruminate and over-think--

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:37.190
and this is the same for
adults as well as kids--

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:40.490
you have to get your brain away
from that for a little bit.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.980
You literally can't
process anything

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:48.710
when your fear center or your
amygdala is on high alert.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.700
So we talk about
changing the channel.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.290
And essentially that means
watch a TV show, take a run,

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.990
eat some ice cream,
kind of let yourself

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.810
get to a different
place, read a book.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.630
And then you can get back
in and look at things.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.020
But I think especially
for girls to understand,

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:09.470
I have some control over
what's happening inside,

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:10.160
and here's how.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.190
So we have kind of a
series of steps like that

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.860
that I think will be pretty
clear for parents, too.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.850
SPEAKER: So helpful.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:17.750
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Yes?

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.125
AUDIENCE: I was
curious to know--

00:19:19.125 --> 00:19:22.850
you were talking about some data
and polling that you had done.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:25.580
I was wondering if there was
a difference in communities

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.360
of color, because there has
to be some disparities when--

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.010
especially with
parents not thinking

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.100
they're afforded the
privilege of making sure

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.200
that their kids make
mistakes that often.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:36.450
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Right.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.360
AUDIENCE: I was just curious
to see what that looked like.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.000
CLAIRE SHIPMAN:
You know, we did--

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.320
in the polling we
did with girls,

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:48.800
we did not see a big breakdown
in terms of race or ethnicity

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.740
in terms of girls' confidence.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.780
In the polling we did, we did a
confidence poll or a confidence

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.510
quiz after our adult book came
out, where women went online.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.590
And a lot of women went
online and took this quiz.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.860
And we found that
African American women

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.890
were more confident generally
than white women who are more

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.160
confident than Asian women.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.080
But the professors who
helped us with this

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.990
said to pursue that
and kind of dig

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:21.170
into why that is, we'd
need a larger sample size.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.740
And we'd want to do additional
polling, which we didn't do.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.060
But I do think there's no
question that if you look

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:35.570
at all of the data on something
called stereotype threat, when

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.360
you feel different--
so like you're one

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.510
of the only women on a board.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.260
You're one of the only
women at a meeting.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.770
You're one of the only
African American women in a--

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.350
there are degrees of
different you might feel.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.590
That really does
affect your confidence

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:52.730
and your performance.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:56.630
So I think the more
things you have

00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:02.300
in your life that make you feel
other from a larger population,

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.474
it is a real--

00:21:03.474 --> 00:21:05.390
and I think it's important
for girls and women

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.556
to understand that.

00:21:07.556 --> 00:21:10.140
It really does have an effect.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.500
So it's not all you.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.360
It's partly the society.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.260
And I think understanding
that also allows all of us

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.530
to give ourselves a
break to some extent.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:27.620
But we have a lot in the book
on girls who feel different

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.410
for a variety of reasons,
whether it's race,

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:33.750
whether it's their religion,
whether it's being transgender,

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.310
or whether it's--

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.910
because you're absolutely right.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.980
I think that's an
extra burden to trying

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.690
to be fully confident.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:46.000
And it's riskier
in a lot of ways.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.590
Yes?

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:47.350
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.000
I have a one-year-old
daughter, Rose.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.800
And Rose has two daddies.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.350
And you mentioned that
fathers have an important role

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:57.220
to play in kind of recognizing
a lack of confidence situation.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.130
But I also heard you say
that mothers kind of maybe

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:02.650
have more empathy or
more understanding of how

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:03.580
a girl might feel.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.620
And I was wondering,
other than surrounding her

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.020
with strong female
role models, do you

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.870
have any tips or
anecdotes about ways

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:14.260
to essentially bridge
that empathy gap?

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.390
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: You know--

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.230
and I should say,
and I usually say

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.970
this at the beginning
of every speech--

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:22.780
so we are all on a spectrum.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.620
So not every woman is going
to be more empathetic.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.810
Not every man is going
to be more narrow focus.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.150
So I talk in generalities.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.090
Because generally speaking,
those things are often true.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.880
But it doesn't mean that men
aren't going to be empathetic.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.310
I mean, there's really
interesting data also

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:47.950
that shows that men who
are the primary caregivers

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.940
and spend an enormous amount
of time around their children

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:56.290
actually do experience hormonal
changes and a real difference

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:59.270
in sort of the EQ factor.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.450
So I think a lot
of it probably has

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:05.110
to do with proximity,
to some extent.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:12.130
But I think that just helping
girls understand that they

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.120
can be heard is important.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.970
And I think, again, you're
right about the role models.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:25.670
Let them see people who
are like them but not so--

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.810
one psychologist said to us,
and this is why we, in the book,

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.780
we have some real girls at
the end of each chapter who

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.230
have done some amazing things.

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:36.670
But we specifically
chose not to focus

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:40.780
on a lot of girls like,
say, Malala or girls

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.220
who are just extraordinary but
who probably are going to seem

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.860
far away from what most girls,
the way they might think

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.560
about themselves, so I think
trying to find role models

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.450
who are accessible
for them and who

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:56.440
have done things
that are similar,

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.340
but it just seems
within reach somehow.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.787
But my sense is you're not going
to-- if you're paying attention

00:24:03.787 --> 00:24:05.620
to your daughter, I
don't think you're going

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.050
to have an empathy problem.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.994
I wouldn't worry about that.

00:24:09.994 --> 00:24:11.410
AUDIENCE: I'm
wondering if you can

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:15.520
talk a little bit about internal
versus external confidence.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.880
Because I know within myself
and my friend circles,

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.010
we definitely show
ourselves very differently

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:22.030
than how we're feeling.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:23.240
I just started working here.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.310
This is my second week.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:26.635
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:26.635 --> 00:24:28.135
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: So
that's confident.

00:24:28.135 --> 00:24:28.968
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:29.680
Thank you.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.510
The fake it till
you make it message

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:35.530
came to me from a lot of
different people, specifically

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:36.250
women.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:39.730
And I'm wondering why
we have to fake it

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:44.230
if we are here in this room
and feel like we don't fully

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:47.225
belong until we have
to fake that we belong.

00:24:47.225 --> 00:24:48.600
CLAIRE SHIPMAN:
You know, we have

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.180
a section in our
adult book on the does

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.440
fake it till you make it work?

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.220
And our conclusion
was maybe sometimes.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.740
But it's actually
not the best advice.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.920
So I will counter what you
have heard from other people.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.040
Because first of all,
women are saddled already

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.820
with constantly feeling like
we're frauds and imposters

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.460
and faking it, and so just
adding another layer on to that

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.380
and saying, OK, now I'm going
to be someone else again.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.890
But I think what
fake it till you

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:20.040
make it gets at is
that if you think back

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:25.770
to that formula for confidence,
often what needs to happen

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.800
is, is you have to
take that first risk.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.550
You have to just get some
experience under your belt.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.030
And how do you do that?

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.940
How do you get over that chasm?

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.720
And I think it's far better
to tell yourself to recognize

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.630
that you're afraid or
you're nervous to understand

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:44.550
that that's normal.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:47.550
It would actually
be odd not to be.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.980
So that's a completely
valid feeling.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.990
And then just tell yourself that
I'm just going to do it afraid.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:54.990
This is a phrase somebody
gave us, which is just

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:58.980
acknowledge you're afraid
but choose to act anyway.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.650
And I also think that--

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:05.440
I don't work here so I don't
fully know the culture.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.070
But what I've seen as
I speak in a variety

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.540
of different
corporate settings now

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:13.800
is it's so different than it
was even five years ago or 10

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.350
years ago.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:19.470
I think people are open to more
honest conversations about how

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:20.220
you're feeling.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.240
What are your struggles?

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:21.840
I'm nervous.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.530
I'm not.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:23.860
I've got my kids.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:24.840
I'm worried about this.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.630
I mean, I remember there was a
woman who was a mentor for me

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:31.050
at ABC who at one point said,
well, but part of the problem

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:34.950
is this other person, she
doesn't talk about her kids.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.817
And you maybe just
have to not do that.

00:26:36.817 --> 00:26:37.650
And I looked at her.

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.530
I said, I'm literally
incapable of doing that.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:41.410
I can't do that.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:44.830
I just kind of talk about
this stuff all the time.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:48.360
And I think we're past
that point where you have

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.640
to pretend to be something.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.270
I think it's all right to be
vulnerable, let people in.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.830
And you can still be extremely
competent and successful

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.720
and actually probably relate
to people a little bit better.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.540
SPEAKER: Yeah, be
more are authentic.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.100
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Yes.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.724
SPEAKER: We actually
did a presentation

00:27:03.724 --> 00:27:05.640
at TGIF a couple
of years ago, where

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.980
we talked about imposture
syndrome and the company.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.770
And something like 95% of
all Googlers experience it.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:13.170
So a lot of us are
feeling the same thing.

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:14.190
I don't belong here.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.376
And it's pretty common.

00:27:15.376 --> 00:27:16.292
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Right.

00:27:16.292 --> 00:27:16.410
Right.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:17.880
Well, especially I'm sure
at a company like Google,

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.860
where it's just got
this kind of name.

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.180
And you think,
wow, why am I here?

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.720
But I would say let
authenticity trump

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.670
the sort of feeling of trying
to be something you're not--

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:36.910
and congratulations on the job.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:38.597
Yes?

00:27:38.597 --> 00:27:39.430
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:43.270
I just want to comment on
just the previous question.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.161
I got a good lesson
from someone in my past

00:27:46.161 --> 00:27:48.452
when I was faced with a
difficult decision that kind of

00:27:48.452 --> 00:27:51.970
said and helped me try to
isolate the reasons why you're

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:53.460
not doing something.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.570
And if you're left
with fear, then that's

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:56.880
not a good enough reason.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.710
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Oh,
that's great, too.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.609
AUDIENCE: And I agree
with what was said here.

00:28:02.609 --> 00:28:04.150
You're in very good
company if you're

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:06.350
feeling that you don't belong.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.560
And you can feel pretty
safe about talking

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.976
to people about it.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:16.930
So a very common sentiment in
lectures like this and talks

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:20.110
about books like this
is we have, I think,

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:22.150
a fair amount of
young parents here.

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:25.390
And our main concern,
especially as parents of girls,

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:28.690
is how do we make the
next generation better?

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.940
Like you said, we're
already kind of screwed.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:35.590
We've suffered a lot of
society's influence, which

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:42.160
is, I think, the biggest factor
in confidence among women.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.320
And I wanted to ask--

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.140
so right now, my oldest daughter
is only three and a half.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.457
I feel like I have a fair
amount of influence on her.

00:28:49.457 --> 00:28:51.040
I know that once she
enters the school

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:55.690
system, the amount of
influence I have will go down.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.284
And I wanted to ask,
what's next for you?

00:28:58.284 --> 00:28:59.950
When are we going to
see the "Confidence

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:06.100
Code" for schools and the
"Confidence Code" for parents?

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.902
Do you have any thoughts
in that direction?

00:29:07.902 --> 00:29:09.610
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Well,
we're hoping that--

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:16.510
we are working on a
curriculum for schools

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:19.910
so that they could
use this book,

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:24.430
and for girls especially
in middle school.

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.800
For parents, I think you'll
find when you look at it,

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.790
it's really self-explanatory in
terms of following along with.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:33.190
Because it's very
much workbook-like.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.880
It's full of quizzes and tests.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.152
I was telling Jen that
some grown women have said,

00:29:38.152 --> 00:29:40.360
I actually like this book
better than your adult book

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.240
because it's got the lists.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.540
So I think we hope for parents,
it will be fairly easy.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:53.950
But it's really hard
to see your kids face

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.260
all these other influences.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:59.230
But again, I think you
have to, as a parent,

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:06.130
realize that the more you
can get out of the way

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:09.640
and let them experience
things and experience

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.630
problems and issues and
failures and encourage them

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.524
through that, the better
off they're going to be.

00:30:17.524 --> 00:30:18.940
SPEAKER: Sooner
rather than later,

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.314
because it's like you want
them to have them while you're

00:30:21.314 --> 00:30:22.540
around and you're there.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.560
You don't want to wait for
all of that stuff to happen.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.643
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Well, I
think that's a good point.

00:30:26.643 --> 00:30:28.990
The more you can
help your daughter

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.630
before she hits
middle school get

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:34.320
used to doing some failing--

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.990
I like to think of it that
you're going to inoculate her.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:41.560
Because I mean, like middle
school is really not fun.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.870
It's still not fun.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:44.770
It really isn't.

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:47.657
And you can't control what
friends are going to do

00:30:47.657 --> 00:30:49.490
and the way teachers
are going to treat you.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:55.150
And so the more you can do early
on to let her fail and build up

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:56.447
some resilience, it's great.

00:30:56.447 --> 00:30:58.780
And I mean, I will say the
other thing is-- and it's not

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.180
for everybody-- but there's
incredible data that

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:06.940
shows that athletics for
girls makes a huge difference.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.620
I mean, there's
almost a direct link

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.870
between the longer
a girl plays a sport

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:14.950
and the higher rank she
reaches in the workplace.

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:17.645
I, of course, did no sports.

00:31:17.645 --> 00:31:20.930
So it's like, oh, darn.

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:22.840
And I don't think it's
only about athletics.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.530
It's just that
athletics creates this--

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:31.600
it's really a ready-made
forum in which girls can lose

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.550
and fail over and over again.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:34.720
And they have no choice.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.820
They just have to get
out there and do it.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:41.590
And that might be also a debate
team or trying out for a play.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.350
It's just the
athletics are there.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.230
And you don't have to
think about it as much.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:47.063
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:47.063 --> 00:31:49.205
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: But thank
you for your question.

00:31:49.205 --> 00:31:50.830
AUDIENCE: So just a
little back story--

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:52.480
I was raised by a single mom.

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.750
And she worked in finance
pretty much my entire life.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:59.770
And she was often one of the
only women in a situation.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.210
And she's a very
confident woman.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.350
And in turn, I've been
raised to be very confident.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:06.790
But in then, I have definitely
in times been called a bitch.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:08.260
I've been called domineering.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.880
I've been told that I'm pushy.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.210
And how do you
basically teach girls

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:15.640
that it's OK to be
confident without in turn

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.974
receiving that kind of feedback?

00:32:16.974 --> 00:32:19.181
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: You know,
one thing I say, especially

00:32:19.181 --> 00:32:20.630
honestly to young women--

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.950
and I think with girls, it's
important to start early

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:25.070
with that conversation.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.660
But I think I really love
talking to young women today

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.400
because they're so
much more focused

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.500
on all of these issues
than I ever was.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.950
And they ask a lot of questions.

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.480
But there's also
still this sense of I

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.880
want to navigate
things perfectly.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.160
How can I avoid these issues?

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.480
So to some extent, you
won't totally avoid it.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.940
And I think what we as
women have to understand

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.250
is there have to be
a number of women

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:54.610
who are willing to be
labeled pushy or a bitch

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:57.400
or whatever it is so
that we can finally

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.660
broaden this box of
behavior that women

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.380
have been kind of confined in.

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.660
So I try to encourage
people to kind of gird

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.500
for that battle a little
bit and realize, OK, yeah,

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.694
this is bad for you.

00:33:11.694 --> 00:33:13.360
But it's really good
for everybody else,

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.110
what you're doing.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.680
But I do think, again,
this piece for girls,

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.840
if the earlier we can
help them understand

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.720
that they don't need
to worry about being

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.730
liked all of the time.

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:31.210
I mean, I remember a
therapist once told me.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:33.650
I was really worried
about some work issue.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.900
And I said, I'm worried I'm
going to seem really mean.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.358
And he's like,
Claire, I don't even

00:33:37.358 --> 00:33:41.220
know what you could
do in order to sound--

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:45.610
and I think for most
of us, the world

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:47.380
is not going to hate women.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:52.240
We're not in danger of heading
over to that dark side.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:57.160
So I think that the more we can
encourage girls to understand

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.890
they don't have to have
everybody pleased all the time,

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:02.510
it will become more normal.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:07.840
Your straight-forward,
I'm sure, ambitious,

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.480
leadership-like behavior will
be viewed that way instead of,

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.650
wow, she's pushy.

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:19.196
But thank you for doing that.

00:34:19.196 --> 00:34:21.070
AUDIENCE: So I have a
nine-year-old daughter.

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:23.050
And she's been exhibiting
a little bit more--

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:26.500
like less fear of doing
something at school that she

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.290
would fail at but fear
of physical things,

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:32.320
like an elevator or
like going over a bridge

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.330
or something like that.

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:34.960
And did you notice that?

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.090
Is that part of this
for young girls?

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:38.530
CLAIRE SHIPMAN:
You know, I think

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:43.330
what it tends to happen at
puberty is that there's this--

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:46.684
and forgive me for
doctors or scientists

00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:48.850
in the room, because I'm
really short-handing this--

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:52.630
but what happens with our brains
and with the influx of estrogen

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:56.800
is we're just even
so much more aware.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.450
There's this hyper
awareness that

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:01.720
happens of people's
expressions, what

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:06.530
we see around a room, what it
might feel like to realize,

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:09.610
oh, we're in the elevator.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:14.660
Puberty is really an
exceptional period that way.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.010
So it's not uncommon.

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:18.740
And I've heard other
people talk about that.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:23.380
And I think a lot of the
tips we have in the book

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.470
are heavily based on
cognitive behavioral therapy.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:30.970
Because essentially, the way
to get comfortable taking risks

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:35.470
is really to create different
thinking habits, habits

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:37.680
in the way we think essentially.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.350
And that's cognitive
behavioral therapy.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:41.710
And so a lot of
the steps in here

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:45.170
in terms of acclimating
yourself to risk-taking I think

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:47.040
would be really helpful.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.834
You sort of go
through this process.

00:35:48.834 --> 00:35:50.750
What's the worst thing
that's going to happen?

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:52.130
Then you do step two.

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:53.380
And then you do step three.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:56.620
And you can almost even
create a ladder of things.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.857
And it makes a difference.

00:35:58.857 --> 00:36:00.940
What's really helpful for
parents, by the way too,

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:05.920
is to have this
broad view over time

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.504
that your kids will not have.

00:36:07.504 --> 00:36:09.420
And actually, it's really
hard for me to have.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.470
I have barely any
memory anymore.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:14.470
But if you can
literally think back

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:17.860
and say, oh, do you
remember six months ago how

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.230
you were afraid to do X?

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:23.299
And look at what you've done
now and sometimes tie some

00:36:23.299 --> 00:36:24.340
of those things together.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.530
That's really, really powerful.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:27.597
Hi.

00:36:27.597 --> 00:36:28.930
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:29.800
So I'm curious.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.133
It seems that when we have a
lot of these conversations,

00:36:32.133 --> 00:36:34.084
we talk about how
to provide woman

00:36:34.084 --> 00:36:35.500
with traits that
are traditionally

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.240
more male or masculine.

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.880
And I'm wondering whether you
in the course of your research

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.630
saw the other side of
that, people talking

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.610
about tips for boys, for men.

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:45.849
And then generally,
it's my point of view,

00:36:45.849 --> 00:36:47.640
we're not having that
conversation as much.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.223
And you don't see
books on the shelves

00:36:49.223 --> 00:36:50.770
about that, and
why that is maybe,

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:53.061
and if you think we should
have that conversation, too.

00:36:53.061 --> 00:36:55.080
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: You
know, I do think--

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.950
honestly, especially
in the wake of Me Too--

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:59.654
I think we could
use a book for boys.

00:36:59.654 --> 00:37:01.570
I could use one instead
of having these really

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:05.350
awkward conversations with my
16-year-old son about wait,

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:08.270
well, do you think
you're going to kiss her?

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:10.690
Wait, and talk about all this.

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:11.330
I need a book.

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.840
But I think there
are two things.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:22.870
So ideally, we are not
saying in urging women

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:24.940
to think about whether
they're confident

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.970
or not, or girls,
be more like men.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:30.850
And so we try to be very
explicit about that actually

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:32.320
in both books.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:39.320
I think it's really important
for girls to feel as confident

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.510
as they are competent.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.690
So we got into this
issue with a scientist

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:48.124
who studies confidence in
rats at Cold Spring Harbor.

00:37:48.124 --> 00:37:50.290
I didn't know there were
confident and non-confident

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:50.790
rats.

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.574
But there are.

00:37:52.574 --> 00:37:54.990
Because we really wanted to
drill down on the idea of, OK,

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:57.470
what is the perfect amount
of confidence to have?

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:00.800
If we assume women tend to
underestimate their abilities,

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.590
men tend to overestimate,
what do you really want?

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:06.350
And he said ideally, to make
great decisions in life,

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:10.100
you want your confidence as in
line with your competence as

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:10.980
possible.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.970
Because that is useful.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:16.430
But actually, it's useful
to have a teeny bit more

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:20.460
confidence because that
pushes you to do things.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.940
That's the kind of
boost you get for doing.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:29.036
So I think confidence, the trick
for women and men and gender

00:38:29.036 --> 00:38:31.160
and everything, is that
confidence can be expressed

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.730
in a lot of different ways.

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:35.816
So we're not really talking
about "Mad Men" style behavior,

00:38:35.816 --> 00:38:37.940
like, oh, I'm going to be
the first one in the room

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:39.560
and the loudest one at
the meeting and the person

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.040
telling everybody what to do.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.730
And that doesn't have to be
your style of confidence.

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:46.760
That's not really
even confidence.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.200
That's just behavior.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.230
And it is behavior we've come
to accept as confident behavior.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.851
Because generally
speaking, that's

00:38:53.851 --> 00:38:55.850
the kind of behavior
exhibited by the people who

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:57.780
created the workplace.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.560
And so there is
something to the fact

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:05.390
that the workplace was
created with men in mind.

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:08.900
I think that the norms will
benefit from a big change.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.240
And I think that is
a conversation that

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.331
has to come from the top down.

00:39:14.331 --> 00:39:15.830
Because that's
really a conversation

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:17.840
about what does a
leader look like?

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.780
Are we really being inclusive
about everybody's leadership

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:21.400
qualities?

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.870
Are we recognizing that
leadership qualities--

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:27.210
women bring very different
skills to the table.

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:29.660
But we will never bring
those skills to the table

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:34.940
if we're not willing to
say, I deserve a promotion.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.870
So to me, that's not a
male or female asset.

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:42.080
That's actually just
I recognize that I'm

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.080
qualified and competent.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.600
But that was a
really long answer.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.067
The short answer is we
need more books on boys.

00:39:50.067 --> 00:39:51.650
And I think it would
be really useful.

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:56.400
Because I think boys
and EQ is critical.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.710
Boys need to kind of have
a lot more of those skills

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:02.240
that girls and women have.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.117
And I think everybody
would be happier.

00:40:04.117 --> 00:40:04.700
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.380
I think when you were talking
about bringing your whole self

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.730
to work and not being afraid
to talk about what's going on

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:10.760
with your family, I think that
those are some of the things

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.020
that everybody can learn from.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:12.853
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Yes.

00:40:12.853 --> 00:40:14.210
Yeah, exactly.

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:16.850
Speaking of boys and men, hello.

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:19.679
AUDIENCE: It was exactly what
I wanted to ask actually.

00:40:19.679 --> 00:40:20.720
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Oh, good.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.240
AUDIENCE: I have
a girl and a boy.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.850
And I think my girl will
definitely enjoy the book.

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:29.120
But I can't show it
to my boy, you know?

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.090
So yeah, if it at least was
called the "Confidence Code,"

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:34.680
maybe I could give it to him.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.180
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Right.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:35.680
Right.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:39.630
But is your boy-- do you feel
like he's confident or lacks

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:40.130
confidence?

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:41.421
AUDIENCE: In some areas, he is.

00:40:41.421 --> 00:40:43.963
But I see so many things where
he is afraid to take the risk.

00:40:43.963 --> 00:40:44.795
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Yes.

00:40:44.795 --> 00:40:46.805
AUDIENCE: And he could
benefit from it as well.

00:40:46.805 --> 00:40:47.120
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Yes.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.230
SPEAKER: Well, I think
you should read the book.

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:49.910
And it will definitely
help you with both genders.

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:51.320
Because I have one of each.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.920
And it was super helpful.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.109
CLAIRE SHIPMAN:
Yeah, it is useful.

00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:56.900
I mean, look, I've had
a lot of men come up

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.360
and say, look, we
all over-think.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.310
We're all scared of risks.

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:02.420
We feel this way, too.

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:05.210
And of course men feel this way.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:08.300
I think the biggest difference
is that men typically

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.850
don't go on to be
perfectionists,

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:15.950
who spent a lot of wasted time
on things when they could--

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:18.800
and also, I've had a couple men
say, you know, I get scared.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.580
I get nervous.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.450
I don't want to take the risk.

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:23.380
But I act anyway.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.550
But there's still this
propensity, this push

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:32.570
to act that men often have and
that then results in learning.

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:37.050
But I think, again, talk
to that woman right there--

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:41.762
I'm kidding-- for
a book for boys.

00:41:41.762 --> 00:41:42.470
Think about that.

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.067
Thank you.

00:41:44.067 --> 00:41:44.900
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.679
I have a seventh grader, a girl.

00:41:46.679 --> 00:41:48.470
And I think what you
said really resonated.

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:50.400
When she was young,
she was fearless.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.490
She ran for class president
and lost to a boy.

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:53.800
But she was gung-ho.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.410
But now, she's changed.

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:59.180
And I think she definitely--
maybe her peer group of girls

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.670
are really into looks,
really into beauty.

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:05.140
She's looking at the
mirror all the time,

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.470
looking for shopping stuff.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:08.050
So I feel like
her peer group now

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:11.420
is kind of influencing her
away from being fearless,

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.570
trying new things.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:14.750
And she's on the
phone all the time--

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:17.150
iPhone all the time, talking
to her friends, chatting.

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:19.160
So any tips about
how to steer her away

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.880
from a peer group of
other girls who maybe also

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.154
like not exhibiting competence
and just focusing on

00:42:25.154 --> 00:42:25.820
looks and so on?

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:26.150
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Yeah.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.050
You know, it's hard.

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:29.780
Because especially when
they get to be that age,

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.020
their friends matter to them so
much more than their parents.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.650
And almost everything
we say is suspect.

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:41.430
I mean, my 13-year-old
daughter is just really,

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:44.580
really difficult. She's not
going to be watching this,

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:45.440
is she?

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.740
This is going to be awful.

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:51.500
But I think that what
you can do as a parent is

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.520
talk a lot about the things
that are valuable, the fact

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.530
that it's OK to stand out.

00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:59.060
It's OK to be different.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:03.470
Look for people who might be
interesting role models for her

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:06.770
and who are exhibiting some of
this breaking out of the pack

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:11.030
behavior or focus less on--

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:13.121
we really try in the
book to get into this.

00:43:13.121 --> 00:43:14.870
Don't focus as much
on what you look like.

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:16.780
Focus on what you're doing.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.730
Judge yourself by
what you're doing.

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.140
And for girls, I think
that's very powerful.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.770
But for you as the
parent, you have

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:27.320
to find the right messenger.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.230
Because you're probably
not the right messenger.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:32.990
So you have to be
really subtle about it.

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:34.640
I mean, and maybe
the book is something

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.140
to use and talk about.

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:40.220
But maybe there are a lot
of great things on YouTube.

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:43.070
There are great sort of
inspirational channels

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:46.790
people have created that
talk a lot about failure

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.656
and being fearless for girls.

00:43:48.656 --> 00:43:50.530
The other thing that
you can really, I think,

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:52.340
get middle school
girls hooked on

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:56.930
is get them mad about something
and get them to kind of feel

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:59.900
this passion about something,
whether it's animal

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.840
welfare or the fact that
their favorite sporting goods

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.220
store doesn't stock women's
basketball shoes, which

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.730
got my daughter in a rage,
and then tie that to what

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:12.530
do you want to do about it.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:15.320
So that if you can find ways
where they get engaged--

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:20.360
and girls and women especially
have this drive often

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.530
to be focused on issues that
are bigger than themselves--

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:26.210
missions, causes.

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:29.030
And they can feel more
naturally confident diving

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:30.390
into that stuff.

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:32.330
So maybe look for
something like that you

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:34.630
can get her engaged in.

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:35.510
SPEAKER: I love that.

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:36.872
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Good luck.

00:44:36.872 --> 00:44:38.099
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:38.099 --> 00:44:38.640
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:43.420
I have a nine-year-old daughter
as well, and in some ways,

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:44.677
a total risk taker.

00:44:44.677 --> 00:44:46.760
I mean, she's the first
one to go off the zip line

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.990
and whatever.

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:50.659
She's super comfortable
with risk in that way.

00:44:50.659 --> 00:44:52.700
The piece that I find
really interesting, though,

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:54.680
sort of as a weird
paradox to me,

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:58.700
is she's very, very
uncomfortable with being

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.760
embarrassed in front of people.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.230
And so she does play a sport.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:04.190
She plays softball.

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:09.080
And just even last week, she
was destroyed because she didn't

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.820
get a hit the whole game.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.040
And I tried to do the, it's OK.

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.140
Even the best players,
even the pros don't--

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:18.200
I mean, all the
usual stuff, right?

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:24.130
So I guess my question is,
is there certain language

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:25.250
or certain ways to--

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:28.995
I mean, god forbid I try to
give the pep talk about failing.

00:45:28.995 --> 00:45:30.620
And you didn't fail
because you got up.

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:31.120
And you bat.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:32.364
And you tried and whatever.

00:45:32.364 --> 00:45:33.280
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Right.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:33.779
Right.

00:45:33.779 --> 00:45:34.730
Right.

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:35.340
AUDIENCE: It's not effective.

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.700
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: No, that it
really pisses them off, right?

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:37.910
AUDIENCE: Oh, dear god.

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:39.140
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: That's
never going to work.

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:40.681
AUDIENCE: It makes
it so much worse--

00:45:40.681 --> 00:45:42.470
I mean, total shut
down, no conversation,

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:44.787
to the point where
she wants to quit

00:45:44.787 --> 00:45:46.620
and doesn't want to
play again next weekend.

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:52.044
So I'm just wondering, is there
different language to use?

00:45:52.044 --> 00:45:53.210
Maybe it's a different time.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:54.140
Don't say it in the moment.

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:54.380
I don't know.

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:56.046
I'm just wondering,
what's the right way

00:45:56.046 --> 00:45:57.860
in to get a more
receptive person?

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.200
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: I'm not
the world's biggest expert

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.880
on sports conversations.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:05.540
I found it incredibly
painful with my kids.

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.310
I was like, oh, my god.

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.794
Because I felt like I
internalized everything

00:46:09.794 --> 00:46:10.460
they're feeling.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.350
And I feel it five
times more than they do.

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:16.280
So I'm not a great
passive parent.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:20.200
But what I see is that
with this or anything else,

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.700
you just have to
think about your job

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:28.500
as being as calm and unemotional
about it as possible.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.800
The more emotional they
are, the less you are.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.320
And it's really hard to do.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.520
And you almost have to
treat it like, yeah.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:41.870
Yeah, that must
not have felt good.

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:44.347
You know, you kind of don't
try to do the opposite.

00:46:44.347 --> 00:46:45.680
Oh, it will be better next time.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.600
But just say, yeah, I hear you.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.740
And in a lot of ways, what
we found talking to cognitive

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:56.240
therapists and people,
you cannot process.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.670
She has to go through--
when kids are upset,

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:01.360
they have to go through
that, I'm really upset.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:01.970
I'm grieving.

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:04.220
My fear center is firing.

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:07.880
And you need to think about,
how do I get her brain

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.320
to get out of that zone?

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:12.170
Because when it's out of
that zone later the next day,

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:13.610
she can then--

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:14.930
oh, look at this video.

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:17.930
And you can talk about
this other softball

00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:21.844
player who failed 100 times,
like a day or two later.

00:47:21.844 --> 00:47:23.510
But in that moment,
the best thing to do

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:27.080
is just don't you want to lie
in bed, get some ice cream?

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:27.940
Here's a book.

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:29.930
Well, here's a
movie, and just kind

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:34.210
of acknowledge it and try
to help her through it

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:35.267
and treat it like--

00:47:35.267 --> 00:47:37.600
I mean, the other thing I've
seen with dads a lot more--

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.890
because I'm not good at this.

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:41.930
But maybe there are
great sports moms, too.

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:44.800
It's like you take it in stride.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:49.300
It doesn't need to be
over-thought, which

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:53.120
again, really hard for me,
because I'm an over-thinker.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.320
But I feel you.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.780
And don't let her quit.

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:56.860
SPEAKER: You talked
about over-thinking.

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.300
But you also talked
about, in your book,

00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.174
about over-preparing.

00:47:59.174 --> 00:48:00.350
And you talked about women.

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:02.980
And I definitely observed
that when I was in TV,

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:06.340
that the women anchors
would over-prepare.

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:09.160
And the men-- and I did
research for both genders.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.132
And I see that in the
workplace here as well.

00:48:11.132 --> 00:48:13.090
I'm just wondering what
you saw in the research

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.132
about the over-preparing
and what that was about.

00:48:15.132 --> 00:48:16.839
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: You
know, over-preparing,

00:48:16.839 --> 00:48:18.340
I find I can really relate to.

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:22.120
Because being a perfectionist,
a people pleaser,

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:26.410
an over-preparer, I
realize now once we

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:29.290
started studying confidence,
what a waste of time

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:30.010
that has been.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:31.460
And I think that's what bugs me.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:35.050
It's not that I didn't have
a great job in journalism.

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:36.560
Or yes, I've written a book.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.300
But it's just more
like, wow, I could

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:42.250
have been doing even more.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:45.190
And I wouldn't have been quite
as stressed out about it.

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:47.260
And I actually found--

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.047
I had somebody go back.

00:48:49.047 --> 00:48:50.630
I don't know if I
told you this story.

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:53.050
But I was so curious about
the over-preparation,

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:56.080
because I spent a
couple years being

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.540
the only woman on the
political panel on George

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.640
Stephanopoulos's show.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.850
And I thought, god, I
think these guys are

00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:05.819
speaking a lot more than I am.

00:49:05.819 --> 00:49:07.360
And I always thought
that every week.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.740
I think they're going on longer.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.580
I feel like I'm just cutting.

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.860
But I wasn't sure.

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:14.930
We went back and measured
a year's worth of shows.

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:18.250
And I had talked 30% less.

00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:20.967
And I was constantly
over-prepared.

00:49:20.967 --> 00:49:23.050
You know, I would prepare
it this way and that way

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.840
and just make sure-- but then
I didn't want to stray off

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.744
of what I had prepared.

00:49:27.744 --> 00:49:28.660
I felt like, well, no.

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:29.750
I know these things.

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:32.440
But I'm not going to jump in
with an additional comment

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.570
because I might not be right.

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.819
And it's so limiting.

00:49:37.819 --> 00:49:40.110
SPEAKER: So did you do the
research after you were on--

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:41.770
were you still on the show
when you did the research?

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:42.190
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: No.

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:42.310
SPEAKER: OK.

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:43.720
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: I did it as
we were writing the book.

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.100
I got all the transcripts.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.950
And it was really
sort of surprising.

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:49.870
But Christine Lagarde
said that to us, too.

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:50.411
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:49:50.411 --> 00:49:52.570
CLAIRE SHIPMAN:
She said that she--

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:54.370
that was a kind of
shocking moment for us.

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:55.870
We had a great dinner with her.

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:57.419
She's an incredibly
confident woman.

00:49:57.419 --> 00:49:59.460
But she even said, I think
one of the ways I lack

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.110
confidence is I over-prepare.

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:03.040
I never want to be
caught off guard.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.830
I prepare upside
down and inside out.

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:08.150
And Angela Merkel and I have
talked about this a lot,

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:09.720
how we both over-prepare.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:10.600
And we're like, what?

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.100
SPEAKER: OK.

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:11.910
So we're in good company.

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:13.720
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Yeah,
we're in good company.

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.610
But it doesn't mean it's
a great use of our time.

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:16.985
SPEAKER: So have
you experimented

00:50:16.985 --> 00:50:19.360
with maybe just leaning back
a little and not doing that?

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.485
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Definitely.

00:50:20.485 --> 00:50:21.170
SPEAKER: OK.

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:23.402
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: I created
rules for myself about,

00:50:23.402 --> 00:50:25.360
when I was still doing
a lot more "Good Morning

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.111
America," which
pieces were just,

00:50:27.111 --> 00:50:29.110
OK, this piece, I'm going
to spend two hours on.

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:31.601
I would literally have
to give myself a limit.

00:50:31.601 --> 00:50:33.850
Because especially working
for "Good Morning America,"

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:37.090
I could potentially
work all night.

00:50:37.090 --> 00:50:39.070
I literally could work
all night on something

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:40.520
and often wanted to.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.000
But then I'd have my whole
team working all night.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.560
And people weren't that happy.

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.420
And I was really
tired the next day.

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.910
So I had to kind of
create little rules.

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:50.710
SPEAKER: We do that
a lot in our office.

00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:51.932
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Do you?

00:50:51.932 --> 00:50:53.890
SPEAKER: Yes, we could
all work here all night.

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:55.360
And you will never
finish all your work.

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.860
But at a certain
point, is it really

00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.790
worth it to keep doing that?

00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:00.350
So I think we-- oh,
we have one more.

00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:00.850
Yay.

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:01.150
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Oh, good.

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.540
SPEAKER: OK.

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:02.210
This will be our last question.

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:03.910
AUDIENCE: I was
like, might as well.

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:06.170
So this might not be
confidence for girls,

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:07.840
but I'm going to ask anyway.

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:11.230
So my mother raised me to
be very confident and more

00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:13.640
confident than she
was as a child.

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:17.200
So I was just wondering,
when you grow up that way

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:20.680
and then you start being hyper
aware of the lack of confidence

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:22.600
other women are
giving young girls,

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.230
or you were given yourself
after you reflected now

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:29.230
that you're older, how do you
go back and talk to the older

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:31.710
women about it and
their lack of confidence

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:35.050
and how they are perpetuating
that cycle, especially

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:36.790
your grandma or
your mom, and having

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:39.790
that conversation with older
women that were in your life

00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:43.000
without making them feel
like, oh, you messed me up

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.217
or anything like that,
without being disrespectful?

00:51:46.217 --> 00:51:47.800
And then also, the
second part to that

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.200
is seeing other young
girls in your family

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:53.740
being raised that way and
then trying to stop it

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:55.802
but not disrespecting
their parents also--

00:51:55.802 --> 00:51:57.510
so I guess it's like
a two-part question.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:59.130
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Yeah,
that is so tricky.

00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:00.171
Well, hand them the book.

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:04.930
So you don't have
to take the blame.

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:08.740
I think that's one
area, especially

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:09.700
with family members--

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:13.240
I say, don't worry
about being liked.

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.370
With family, I
think you still have

00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:16.840
to worry about being liked.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:19.120
Because you don't
want to create a rift.

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.550
But I think maybe
the way to do it

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:25.360
is to just talk about the new
research that's out there.

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:29.050
And it's so interesting that,
in fact, it's really important

00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:31.120
to encourage girls to fail.

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.630
Who knew?

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:33.620
And isn't this great?

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:37.880
And try to bring them
along and make them

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:40.310
see that it was their idea.

00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:44.540
Because I think it is
hard to revisit parenting.

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:46.760
I'm really dreading this
moment with my kids,

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.470
by the way, when
they come to me.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:50.400
And they're like,
what did you do to me?

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.060
SPEAKER: But we just have
to say we tried our best.

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:53.726
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Yeah,
we tried our best.

00:52:53.726 --> 00:52:56.990
But I think if you would start
it as a discussion about--

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:59.780
I mean, and that's one thing
we've been really focused

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:02.990
on in both of these
books, is that there's

00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:05.090
a lot of data about this.

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:07.280
We've focused on the
data and the science.

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.960
Because I think for
a lot of people--

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:10.730
although my daughter
is like, if I

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:12.884
hear you use the word
research one more time,

00:53:12.884 --> 00:53:13.800
I'm going to kill you.

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.850
Is this some of your
crazy research, Mom?

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:20.690
But most people will
understand that there's

00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:23.430
meaning to it if there's
some science behind it

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:24.420
and some data.

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.520
And I think that can
take the sting out of it.

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:30.027
It's not just judgment.

00:53:30.027 --> 00:53:30.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:32.480
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: But
great question, sure.

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:33.590
SPEAKER: Thank you
so much, Claire.

00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:33.860
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: My pleasure.

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:34.670
SPEAKER: I learned a lot.

00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:35.440
And the book is great.

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.350
I highly recommend it.

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:36.840
Thank you so much.

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:36.970
CLAIRE SHIPMAN: Thank you.

00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:37.469
My pleasure.

00:53:37.469 --> 00:53:40.780
[APPLAUSE]
