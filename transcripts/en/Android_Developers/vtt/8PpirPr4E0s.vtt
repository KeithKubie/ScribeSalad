00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.508
SPEAKER: You are
building a product

00:00:01.508 --> 00:00:03.080
and you know it's
going to be great.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.670
But how will you
get that product

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.450
into the hands of the right
users, in the right way,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.700
at the right time?

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.660
Marketing.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.700
But marketing is a
huge playing field.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.910
So how do you choose the right
strategies and the right tools?

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.030
And how do you know whether
your campaigns are succeeding?

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.800
If you do it right, this
should start long before you

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.300
prototype or code.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.130

why marketing is more

your messages to the masses.

both online and offline,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.300
