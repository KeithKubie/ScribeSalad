00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.790
Ah, Election Day, when Americans everywhere
cast their ballot for the next President of

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:05.970
the United States.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.120
Except, not really – Americans don't directly
vote for president.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.900
So, what's happening on election day then?

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.620
It's a bit complicated because of something
called the Electoral College.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.500
To keep things simple for now, think of the
Electoral College as a collection of the 538

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.300
votes that determine who the President of
the United States will be.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.720
Why 538?

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.660
Because that's the number of Senators 100
plus the number of Representatives, 438 in

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.660
Congress.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.350
Why are there 438 Representatives in Congress?

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.990
Stop asking so many question right now we're
trying to keep this simple:

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.070
These 538 votes in the Electoral College aren't
given to the citizens directly, but are instead

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.780
divided among the states.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.910
So how does the Electoral College give out
the votes?

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.480
Each state, no matter how populous or not,
gets three votes to start.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.870
The remaining votes are given out roughly
in proportion to the population of the state.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.070
The more people the state has, the more votes
it gets.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.399
Here is a map of the United States showing
the voting power each states has by making

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.910
one hexagon equal to one electoral college
vote for president.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.460
Because electoral votes mostly – though
not completely – scale with population it's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.790
also a map of where people live with a bonus
given to the smaller states to make them a

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.229
bit bigger than they would otherwise be.

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.510
In early November, when citizens go to the
polls they aren't voting for president directly

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.310
but they're really telling their state how
they want *it* to use its electoral votes.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.110
48 of the 50 states give all their electoral
college votes to the candidate who wins a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.959
majority in their state.

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:21.320
Take Florida, for example, which has 29 electoral
college votes.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.200
If a candidate wins a majority, no matter
how small that majority, he gets all the votes.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.109
So the path to the Whitehouse is clear: win
enough majorities in enough states to get

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.979
more than half of the Electoral college votes
and you get to sit at the big desk.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.429
That wasn't so complicated, you say.

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.819
Well, there were a few details left out:

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.149
The Electoral College loves states, but what
about the 11 million Americans who don't live

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.149
in a state?

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.759
What happens to their vote, and where are
these people hiding?

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.079
There are about 600,000 in the District of
Columbia an area set aside specifically *not*

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.209
to be a state so that the capital of the country
would be free of local politics.

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:53.560
For most of the United States' history people
living in the district didn't get to vote

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.679
for president.

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.490
Then in 1964 the constitution was amended
to give D.C. the same number of votes as the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.179
least populous state, Wyoming.

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:01.850
So the electoral college likes DC.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.249
But you know who it doesn't like?

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:04.389
The Territories.

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:08.099
The often forgotten Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S.
Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands,

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.459
get no votes from the electoral college because
they aren't states and they don't have a special

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.790
constitutional amendment to recognize them.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.439
Which is a bit odd considering they're part
of the United States and everyone who lives

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.790
there is a citizen so -- for most practical
purposes -- they're just like D.C.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.629
And 4.4 Million people live in the territories
-- that might not sound like a lot, but it's

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.489
than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont,
North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska &amp; Delaware.

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.489
Combined.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.340
But still, no votes from the Electoral College
do they get.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.269
The whole situation with territories is extra
strange when you consider the final group

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.349
of Americans who don't live in States, the
6.3 million Americans who live abroad.

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.239
If you're a United States citizen who moves
to a foreign country, you can usually send

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.360
a postal vote to the last state that you resided
in.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.650
But, if you move *within the United States*
to one of its territories, you lose your right

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.719
to vote for president for as long as you live
there – making these the only spots on the

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.459
whole earth where Americans are not allowed
to vote for president.

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.079
Actually, they're the only spots in the whole
Universe because American astronauts are allowed

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.909
to vote for space.

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.180
The last bit of electoral college complication
is the weirdest and has to do with the votes

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.180
themselves.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.610
The state of Florida -- and all the others
-- doesn't really give votes to a candidate,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.310
that's just a simplified way to think about
it, because the reality of the situation is...

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.310
odd.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.670
What citizens are voting for on election day
is a group of electors appointed by the political

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.739
parties who chose the president on the citizens'
behalf.

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.719
The number of votes that a state gets from
the Electoral College is actually the number

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:24.210
electors the state is allowed to send to a
collegiate meeting to vote on who the president

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.390
will be.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.430
What makes it odd is that while these electors
promise they will vote for president as their

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.349
state's citizens want them to, *they aren't
required to do so*.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.870
Electors are free to vote the way they want
. While this has never swung an election,

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.920
87 times in the past electors have voted against
the wishes of the very people who elected

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.920
them.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.689
Why set up this crazy system where a small
group of people essentially unknown to the

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.670
general public are the ones who really decide
on the president?

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.690
Because in the 1700s -- when the electoral
collage was designed -- the quickest way to

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.040
send a piece of information was to write it
on a piece of paper, hand it to a guy on a

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.780
horse, wish him 'godspeed, good sir' and hope
he didn't get killed by indians or die of

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.159
dysentery along the way.

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.590
Because information moved so slowly and because
the young country was so big, the idea was

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.090
to send all the electors to Washington where
they could have the most up-to-date information

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.269
to make decisions for the people back home
who wouldn't know the latest news.

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.560
Though now, when we carry information on beams
of light in fiber optic cables rather than

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.440
on the backs of herd animals this particular
aspect of the electoral college might seem

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.660
a little out of date.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.500
None the less, while most people think that
the election for president takes place in

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.430
early november it doesn't -- that's the election
that determines who the electors will be.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.620
The 538 electors who are chosen then meet
in early december and they cast the real votes

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.100
that determine who is the next president of
the United States.
