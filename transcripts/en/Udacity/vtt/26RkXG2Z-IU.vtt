00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.720
So I'm not seeing anything that says, you

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.900
know, create new workflow. So, what should I do?

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.430
&gt;&gt; So, the new rule button is actually

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.960
creating a new workflow. And what that means, when

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.540
it says new rule, is you're going to set up

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.620
a set of criteria that'll cause this to happen.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.500
&gt;&gt; Okay, a trigger basically.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.000
&gt;&gt; It's basically, there's another thing in Salesforce called a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.120
trigger, which is what I'm trying to steer away from.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.380
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.120
&gt;&gt; But. A trigger is just a workflow made

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.430
of code.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.820
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.450
&gt;&gt; So, what we're doing right is

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.960
we're creating a situation that will only fire

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.470
when a certain set of criteria is made. And that's why it's called a rule.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.080
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.440
&gt;&gt; And so in this case, let's say this

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.500
is going to be on the maintenance ticket object

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.910
because it's going to be when a maintenance ticket

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.520
is created. That's when we're going to fire this rule.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.120
&gt;&gt; So, Maintenance Ticket, Next. All right. So I guess I'll call the

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.040
rule Alert Technician.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.540
&gt;&gt; 'Kay.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.490
&gt;&gt; And I want to evaluate the rule when

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.780
the record is, what does this mean, evaluate the rule?

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.770
&gt;&gt; So, it's only going to run this rule When you,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.330
&gt;&gt; The rule means the work flow, the series of steps?

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.680
&gt;&gt; The work flow, exactly. So in this case, what we're going to

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.250
eventually do is send an email and a task to a technician. But

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.740
this is asking, when should we do that? Should we do that every

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.250
time a maintenance ticket is created? Every time it's created and every time

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.490
it's edited? Or, every time it's created

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.760
And it meets this rule criteria down there.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.350
&gt;&gt; It's edited but it's edited in a certain way.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.830
&gt;&gt; If it didn't meet the criteria first, and then

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.640
it meets this rule criteria after it's been edited, fire it.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.500
&gt;&gt; Gotcha, gotcha.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.420
&gt;&gt; So, in this case, I think we would want the last, the last of the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.700
three. Which is, every time it's created and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.230
if it's edited to then meet this Criteria.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.450
&gt;&gt; Like I wouldn't want to send an email. Or try to send an email

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.790
if the technician didn't have a valid email address or something like that.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.310
&gt;&gt; Alright, so I'm going to run the rules of following criteria are

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.690
met. So the technician has an email address. Is what I'm going for.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.580
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.280
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, I see maintenance ticket

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.930
technician, but I really want the email field.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.270
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.870
&gt;&gt; But I don't see that here. Is that, should I just click technician, or

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.540
what am I doing wrong?
