00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.215
FEMALE SPEAKER: Ladies and
gentlemen, Floyd Abrams.

00:00:03.215 --> 00:00:08.800
[CLAPPING]

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.390
FLOYD ABRAMS: Thank you.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.280
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.600
The special privilege really to
be here at Google, I want

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.130
you to know that I hear about
Google all the time in the

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.070
course of the work that I do.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.430
Mostly because when I teach
students at law school, and

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.810
when I talk with professors of
First Amendment law, one of

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.790
the first things they always
say is, well look, first

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.240
amendment's about the
government, and we have things

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.120
pretty well under
control there.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.910
The single most important
decision maker in the world

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.900
about freedom of speech
is Google.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.540
And Google's rules, and what
Google decides goes on or off,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.280
is center stage very often in
discussions at law schools and

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.260
in a variety of places you
wouldn't think so.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.560
The First Amendment, of course,
is, as part of the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.980
Bill of Rights, applies only
to the government.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.690
It's a limitation on the
government, it prevents the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.160
government from interfering in
a variety of ways, freedom of

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.870
speech, freedom of press,
freedom of religion, freedom

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.590
of assembly, et cetera.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.560
And I'd done a lot of
teaching about it.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.180
And my recent book tries to deal
with a lot of the events

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.530
and a lot of the conflict that
have arisen with respect to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.790
the First Amendment, really in
the last 40 and 50 years.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.150
Some of them recur.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.080
And Google's always around
the corner, by the way,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.030
when they do recur.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.010
One chapter in my book deals
with confidential sources of

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.480
journalists.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.000
I've been involved in a lot of
battles with the government

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.860
and private parties who have
sought to get court orders

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.840
requiring journalists
to reveal the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.680
identity of their sources.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.650
Journalists promise, as you
know, confidentiality, try to

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.330
keep those promises when they
make them, and they wind up in

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.210
court sometimes.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.270
And sometimes they don't.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.950
And that's been one of the big
issues of the last few weeks,

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.110
as you've read with respect to
the Associated Press case.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.800
The Department of Justice
in the course of a leak

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.460
investigation in which the
department was trying to find

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.970
out who in the government
provided certain information

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.400
about a terrorist attempt in
Yemen to bring down an

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.760
American airplane.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.150
The Associated Press
had received

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.890
information about that.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.070
And they behaved in a
particularly responsible way.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.150
They went to the government,
they went to the CIA, they

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.440
asked, would it do any real
harm if we published this?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.710
And the answer was, yes.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.490
We're in the middle of doing
what we're doing, someone

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.820
could be hurt.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.040
And so they didn't
publish anything.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.180
Until they learned that the
government was about to hold a

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.870
press conference the next day
announcing a great success in

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.170
preventing the terrorists
from bringing down

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.650
this American plane.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.700
AP went to press then, did its
story, and in the meantime, a

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.090
leak investigation had begun.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.430
Who told AP about this?

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.420
And the basic rules of the game
that the Department of

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.270
Justice is supposed to play
by are rules in which

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.270
the press goes last.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.920
They're supposed to take
lie detector tests.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.020
They're supposed to
interview people.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.590
They're supposed to do all the
things to try to avoid

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.950
conflict with the press until
it's absolutely necessary to

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.400
go to the journalists themselves
and either try to

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.450
get a court order to require
them to reveal their sources

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.130
or somehow work something out,
which would be to help them to

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.490
learn their sources.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.030
The only exception to the
obligation of the Department

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.300
of Justice in this area, the
only time when they are

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.950
allowed not to talk to the
journalists, not to talk to

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.310
the AP in this situation, is
if doing so would interfere

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.900
with the quote, integrity,
unquote of the

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.980
investigation itself.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.630
You know, would blow
the investigation.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.480
Would make it impossible for
them to find out for one

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.070
reason or another who leaked
the information.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.520
They did not tell the AP that
they were interested in their

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.230
telephone records.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.140
They went to the telephone
company and served a subpoena

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.150
on the telephone company,
saying, turn over to us the AP

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.560
records of 20 or so telephones
used by over 100 journalists

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.940
over a two month period.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.750
And the telephone companies
turned it over.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.480
And that's been the basis of a
great deal of controversy in

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.500
the last week really because
this is all very new stuff

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.180
that we're talking about.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.490
People, myself included, have
been critical of the

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.990
Department of Justice, basically
saying, we can't

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:54.280
imagine a scenario in which
telling the AP that you wanted

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.600
their phone records would have
interfered with the integrity

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.410
of your investigation, except
for one scenario.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.540
And that is that if you told
them, they would go to court,

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.790
which is true.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.340
They didn't go to court because
they didn't know that

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.240
anyone was interested in
their phone records.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.470
And it's true that if
they went to court,

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.096
months would pass.

00:06:22.096 --> 00:06:25.760
Now, that's not a very good
reason, certainly if you think

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.730
the First Amendment
is involved.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.790
If you think that journalists
have, or ought to have a

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.080
right, as a generality at least,
not to reveal their

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.090
confidential sources.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:43.150
And so the controversy about
that one is basically, did the

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.160
Department of Justice play by
the rules in going right to

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.280
the phone company instead of
going right to the Associated

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.650
Press in this area?

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:05.890
The other one, which is more
relevant maybe to Google, is

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.250
this subpoena that was served.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.020
A search warrant that
was served--

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.260
and again, we learned this
only three days ago--

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.530
on the chief Fox correspondent
in Washington in the course of

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.300
another leak investigation.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.020
That one about information about
North Korea and their

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.570
atomic capabilities and
facilities and the like.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.990
And in that one, the government
did, and we're not

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.860
sure of all the things they've
done, but a lot of things to

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.730
try to find out who the source
of that information was.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.240
And not having learned it or
not having learned it with

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.890
sufficient clarity, they
took the next step.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.560
They went to a court.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:56.080
There is a court, a secret
court, as it happens, which

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.910
deals with certain types of
highly sensitive national

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.760
security related matters.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:08.330
And they asked for the right to
serve a subpoena, really a

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.960
search warrant, on Google.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:18.150
They said, this journalist who
got this information about

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:25.710
North Korea, himself, is a
potential criminal because he

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.400
spoke to someone in the
executive branch of

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.860
government, he cajoled him, he
flattered him, he appealed to

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.679
his vanity.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.880
All these words are from
the application

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.570
for a search warrant.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.419
And he ultimately persuaded
him to provide information

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:47.570
that he wasn't allowed
to provide.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.620
Now most journalists would say,
what the journalist did

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.490
was almost a definition
of journalism.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:58.330
Cajoling and flattering and
appealing to egos of a

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.640
potential source.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:06.010
But in their application for a
search warrant, the government

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:12.260
said, that's a crime, a crime
under the Espionage Act of

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.590
releasing information, even
a non-government employee,

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.300
releasing certain type of very
sensitive information which

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.100
you had no right to release.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.450
That's a position
the government

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.810
had never taken before.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.340
That's big news to accuse a
journalist of violating the

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:37.780
Espionage Act for basically
acting like a journalist.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.080
And rightly, in my view, has
been the subject of a great

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.260
deal of attention and a great
deal of criticism of the

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.510
Department of Justice.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.640
The alternative offered by the
FBI agent, who wrote or signed

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.810
onto this affidavit, was, well,
if you didn't violate

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.050
the Espionage Act, at the least
you are an aider and

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.500
abettor, somebody who worked
with the guy in the executive

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.540
branch who provided information
he wasn't allowed

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.170
to provide.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.970
And that, too, is something
which the government had never

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.740
maintained.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.650
Historically, we've had a
situation where the press and

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.510
the governments have often been
in conflict, have too

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:30.470
often been in bed together, but
have worked out a sort of

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:35.950
general modus vivendi and worked
out a general, you do

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.610
your thing, we do our thing.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:43.050
A former Secretary of State
writing to a New York Times

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.060
columnist put it this way.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:50.050
He said, your job is to pry,
mine is to keep secret.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:54.580
And both sides have generally
understood that to that

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:59.030
extent, at least, there's an
inherent conflict in what the

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.930
government wants by way of
secrecy, and what the press

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:07.650
wants in the sense of getting
information that they can

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.360
release to the public.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.180
And generally, you know,
they've gotten

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.940
along pretty well.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.600
Some people think too well,
at least in the sense that

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.710
there's no doubt that Washington
is and has been for

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.390
years, you know, a
hot bed of leaks.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:31.990
The Department of Defense leaks
information when the

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:38.940
Secretary of Defense advocates
cutting back the budget.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.750
You know, where does The New
York Times, where does the

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:44.200
Washington Post, where do the
television stations get

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.860
information that the people
are really worried about

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.320
cutting out this
weapons system?

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.740
It's usually from leaks from
within the Pentagon.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.380
And we read lots of leaks all
the time from security

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.880
agencies, from the CIA,
from all over.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.270
Certainly from the
White House.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.290
And that's true in all
administrations.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:12.610
So what happened here is that
Google became involved as the

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:20.120
entity which received the papers
from the court, saying,

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:26.310
turn over the personal emails
of the journalist.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.260
And it did so.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.680
And that combination of events,
the Associated Press

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.650
issue and the Fox News
journalist issue, have been

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:44.650
one of the sort of three tough
events, in terms of the

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.100
presidency at least, that
we've seen in the

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.010
last week or two.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:58.320
The others being the Internal
Revenue Service matter and

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.360
depending on your view of the
matter, that which has been

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.000
coming out about events in
Benghazi, et cetera.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.200
And for those of us in this
area, the government walked

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.350
over a line that had been pretty
clear in the past in

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:21.690
accusing in so many words the
Fox journalist of having

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:28.170
committed a criminal act by
asking questions of someone

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:32.810
who, and I'm trying to be fair
now, who wasn't allowed to

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.620
answer them.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.195
But that's the way things
have generally been.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:47.020
In my book, I try to deal with
a lot of different subjects

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:54.010
which in one way or another
affect freedom of speech and

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.670
freedom of the press.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:14:01.740
And in a class I taught at Yale
Law School last year, we

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:06.240
devoted a few days to the
subject of privacy, personal

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:12.470
privacy, and of defamation,
libel, slander, saying

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:16.660
something about someone else
which is untrue, and for one

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.930
reason or another, unprotected
by the law.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:27.920
We asked a Yale law student to
come as a visitor, a speaker,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:33.390
a guest, to the class we
taught on this subject.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:41.670
The reason was that she had been
victimized by a website

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.660
which was anonymously run-- but
this all later came out--

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.920
by a law student at a different
law school who had

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:56.310
created a website basically by
reading another website in

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.530
which students in college were
talking about what law

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.010
school to go to.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.540
They all had anonymous names.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.846
But he basically tracked them.

00:15:06.846 --> 00:15:10.470
And he tracked attractive
women.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:15.280
There were pictures in, there
were Facebook-like pictures,

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.890
in the law schools
after you enter.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:21.130
So he would compare what people
were saying while they

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.070
were seniors in college about,
I have a choice between this

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.820
law school and that law school,
and I've done this and

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:31.190
that, and this is my history,
et cetera, with the pictures

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:36.780
that he saw in the books of
the great law school.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.260
And he would be able to
find some women--

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.990
he didn't know any of them--

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:46.630
to find some women who he could
be sure were the same

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.620
people that were talking in
college, who went to this and

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.320
that law school.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.890
And he put their picture in, and
he would make up stories

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:00.600
about them, terrible stories,
mostly sexual but

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.990
not limited to that.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:07.030
But just saying awful
things about them.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:11.440
And saying that, of course,
without anonymity, life being

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.940
as it is in this age.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:20.980
Well a few of the women were
law students at Yale.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.630
They got pro bono assistance
from some lawyers.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.070
They went to court.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:30.790
They got a court order requiring
disclosure of the

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:36.170
anonymous speaker, which
one can get in certain

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.940
circumstances, but
is not the rule.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:45.450
And we had her in class to talk
about her experience.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.230
And I think all of
us were really

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.120
surprised on a few levels.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.520
One, there were three of
us who were teaching.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.960
We're each about 10 years apart
in age, and then you

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.230
take another 20 years off
between the youngest person

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.110
and the student.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.370
And all of us that were teaching
were sort of struck

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:07.650
by the fact that we seemed
angrier than

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.400
anyone in the class.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.569
The students said, oh,
we know that website.

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:17.440
No one believes anything
on that website anyway.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.970
And she said, the victim, the
person we were especially, not

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:28.200
just sorry for her, but felt
had been terribly abused,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.940
said, well maybe I shouldn't
have sued.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.280
Maybe it wasn't a good idea.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.230
You know that just got
more publicity.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:38.810
But it's all about page
one of My Google.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:43.680
Said that, you know, someone
looks me up for a date,

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.710
someone likes me up for a
job, and there are these

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.890
charges on page one.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:54.970
If it only weren't page
one, she said.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:58.370
And so she said, I
needed an answer.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:04.190
I needed a court to say, in
effect, it's all untrue.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.500
And she's gotten that.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:15.570
But it's an example, I think,
of how, with new technology

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:21.420
and the like, we have new legal
problems and new first

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.980
amendment-like problems.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:31.850
Is anonymity protected
on websites?

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.650
Can the government, can a court,
which is part of the

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.220
government, can a court
issue an order?

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.140
Should a court issue an order?

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:46.000
When should a court issue an
order requiring the anonymity

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.740
to be breached?

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.040
I go back a long way
in this area.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.390
And one of the first cases I
worked on, which is discussed

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:03.830
in this book, was all the
way back in 1971,.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.500
And it was the Pentagon Papers
case, in which the US

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.530
government went to court to try
to get an order stopping

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.850
the New York Times from
publishing information it had

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:20.200
received about a secret study
that the Defense Department

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.240
had prepared about how we got
into the war in Vietnam.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.510
The Secretary of Defense, Robert
McNamara, had asked for

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:32.300
a study to be done answering
the question, why

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.920
were we in the war?

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.170
There were people that thought
maybe he should have read that

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.050
before we got into the war.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:43.120
But in any event, he asked
that it be prepared.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.690
The Defense Department brought
in a bunch of scholars and

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.000
other people to write it.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.110
It was just sort of a
devastating document.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.650
It was over 20 volumes.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.520
Devastating because it really
did show that starting way

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.880
back in the mid '40s, after the
end of World War II and

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:08.160
thereafter, that American
presence in Vietnam grew and

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:14.270
grew, and that the public was
not accurately told what our

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.200
involvement was, why we were
there, what we were doing, et

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.730
cetera, et cetera.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:25.130
In any event, one of
the authors decided

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:28.020
that the war was wrong.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.560
He thought it was a war crime.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.880
And he made available to the New
York Times almost all the

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:40.520
volumes that had been prepared
of what became known as the

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.190
Pentagon Papers.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.800
And the Times started writing
articles about it, and the

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.860
government under President Nixon
went to court seeking a

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:55.780
court order requiring the Times
to stop publishing this

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.900
material, which was labeled
top secret, which is the

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:06.210
highest level of secrecy in the
government, even though

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.420
not everything called top
secret really is.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.680
But that's another story.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:15.320
But in any event, that's the
highest level in theory of the

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.570
classification.

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:19.810
And we won the case.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.790
And it was a great victory.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.970
It would have been an
even greater defeat.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:30.020
The country really would be
different if we lost the case.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.300
But in any event,
we won the case.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:38.160
And it was a moment at the end
of the case that I often look

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:44.000
back on, particularly with
respect to WikiLeaks and their

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.620
behavior, of course,
much more recently.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.460
When the case was over in the
lower court, in the federal

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:56.680
district court, the federal
judge ruled in our favor.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.610
And he called me into his
office, his chambers, and he

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:04.250
called a senior partner of
mine inti his chambers.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:05.520
And he said something
like this.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.250
He said, you know, you've won
the case, at least with me.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.050
The Times can publish
what it wants.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.990
Now I want to talk to you
as a private citizen.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.000
I'm not a judge anymore.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.330
I'm finished with the case.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.870
There is some material in
there, in particular a

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:32.320
particular contingency plan for
what was called SEATO, the

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.060
Southeast Asia Treaty
Organization, the US and

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:40.880
various Asian countries in
alliance together, which I

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.930
really think the Times
shouldn't print.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.940
And it's this and
this and this.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.920
And I really wish-- and he
used the word "wish"--

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.580
I really wish you'd tell them
that that's what I think.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.520
I'm not entering an order.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.410
Again, I'm not a
judge anymore.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:00.180
I'm just telling you
what I think.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.190
And we said we would
tell them.

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.540
And we did.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:09.030
They had already decided not to
publish a lot of material

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.550
from that contingency plan.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:12.500
They took another look.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.920
They decided not to publish
some more of it, and to

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.830
publish some of what the judge
had identified because the

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:26.290
Times didn't think that it
threatened national security.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:28.830
And I've always thought, that's
the way the system's

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.720
supposed to work.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:35.850
Basically, the judge is giving
very, very wide birth to the

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:40.020
press, except in the most
extraordinary circumstance

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:46.310
where publication is very likely
to really harm national

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:51.820
security in a very real way and
imminently and as a result

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:57.490
of publication, not as a result
of anything else.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:00.050
And I thought, you know,
he behaved--

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.170
and I still think--

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:05.800
he behaved really well in ruling
in our favor at the

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.880
same time he had
these concerns.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.930
And I thought the Times
behaved well in taking

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:18.210
seriously what he said about
how he thought that this

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:23.100
particular material could do,
might do, some harm to

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.130
national security.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:32.880
I contrast that with the
WikiLeaks situation, where

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:39.410
WikiLeaks in my view has been
reckless in its decision

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:44.173
making about what documents to
release and what documents not

00:24:44.173 --> 00:24:46.730
to release.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:51.330
One example, WikiLeaks received
apparently from this

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:59.960
Private Manning who's now on
trial approximately 91,000

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.200
military reports of American
serviceman in Afghanistan.

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:08.570
WikiLeaks, at that time,
had already been under

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:12.370
considerable criticism for the
release of other information

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:18.770
of a variety of sorts and
withheld at least immediately

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:21.980
some thousands of them,
at least while they

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.680
read through them.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:29.250
But they released to the public
77,000 of the 91,000.

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:32.620
And the journalists asked Mr.
Assange at a press conference,

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:39.560
the head of WikiLeaks, have
you guys read the 77,000

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.610
reports that you're releasing?

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:47.280
And he said, well we've read
about 2,000 of them.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.220
The journalists said, how
can you release them?

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.230
And the answer was, we don't
have any reason to think that

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:56.490
they would harm national
security.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:01.070
Now my reaction to that is first
of all, this is not the

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.800
stuff of journalism we're
talking about.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.770
Journalists don't hand out
documents, they read them and

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:08.630
report on them.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.920
But that's not enough of an
answer because the First

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.350
Amendment doesn't protect
just journalists.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.993
If Julian Assange is what I
think of him as being, as sort

00:26:18.993 --> 00:26:22.340
of a political activist, that
doesn't mean he's not entitled

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.470
to First Amendment protection.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.970
He's just not the press
if I'm right.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:31.010
But whether he's the press, or
not, if he ever were charged,

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:37.000
if he came to the US and were
charged, he would have some

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.310
serious First Amendment
defenses, at least if the

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:45.920
documents did not do significant
harm or did not

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.030
significantly threaten national
security in one way

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.280
or another.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:27:00.270
That said, there's a difference
between what I

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.840
would call press responsibility
and what the

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.310
First Amendment protects.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.430
The First Amendment doesn't
require responsibility.

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:12.870
It doesn't require judges to
pass on what is responsible

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.430
journalism, or not.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:19.510
And it doesn't require judges
to agree, or not agree, with

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:24.560
publication or release of
document-like decisions.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:29.210
What it does do is to say, the
government's got to keep its

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:34.110
hands off, except in really
extraordinary circumstances.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.060
And that's especially true
when you're talking about

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.510
people who aren't in
the government.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.840
People who are in the government
have special

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.570
obligations.

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:46.540
And the Supreme Court has indeed
gone so far as to say

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:51.370
that even if there were no
contract, as there is, between

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:57.360
the CIA, say, and employees,
agents, of the CIA, and they

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.890
make them all sign a contract
promising not to disclose

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:04.720
things that they have
learned, et cetera.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.720
But even if that were not so,
the Supreme Court had said, we

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.740
would assume--

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.260
we would treat it as if there
were a contract because the

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:18.790
relationship, at least of the
CIA to the government, and the

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:24.410
role of the CIA, is such that
it is that important to have

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:28.810
that level of secrecy.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:35.000
So in all these areas, we see
the First Amendment is a

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.340
barrier, a great
barrier, hardly

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.440
ever a complete barrier.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.450
I mean the courts have always
left, and Congress has always

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:50.500
left, some sort of out in
situations of great national

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:56.550
peril or in other areas of law,
libel law, privacy law,

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.420
and the like.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:03.900
While those bodies of law we
lean over very strongly in the

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:08.520
direction of the press or of
speakers, of revealers, of

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.950
talkers and the like, while
all that is true, we still

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.170
have libel law in America.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.260
People still sue.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:20.840
Not so often, not as often as in
other democratic countries.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:25.740
I mean, we provide so much
protection for free speech

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.230
that a lot of the lawsuits which
are commonplace in other

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.850
democratic countries simply
don't happen here.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:36.730
I mean, in England, the Prime
Minister brings libel suits.

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:42.430
The Queen brings libel suits
when people say bad things

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:44.070
that they make up.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.330
I know you'll be shocked
to hear that the press

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.970
occasionally makes up stuff.

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:55.630
Not the people that I represent,
but others.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:58.700
But what's interesting to me
about that is that it leads to

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.950
sort of a different culture.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:04.600
The fact that it's so hard to
win a libel suit for a public

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:10.240
official in America puts us in
a situation where when a

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.060
candidate for office, say, is
accused of some sort of

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:18.330
misconduct, the press doesn't
go around and say, are you

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:20.180
suing for libel?

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.800
Or how can you let
that be said?

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.350
Why don't you sue?

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:27.130
In England, the candidate would
be expected to sue.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:30.270
In England, it would be assumed
if he didn't sue, it

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.210
must be true.

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:37.210
And that was just an unintended
consequence of the

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:43.850
difference in libel law that we
have in the two countries.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:49.240
One of the greatest First
Amendment contributions that

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:54.180
our Supreme Court has given us
is really to move us away from

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:59.830
English law, notwithstanding
that our law comes initially,

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.880
certainly, from English law.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:06.370
I mean, they are the mother
country in terms of American

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:12.500
law in most areas and in most
constitutional areas.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:16.850
But time and again, but starting
some years back, the

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:21.020
Supreme Court has said, the
purpose of the Bill of Rights,

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.390
the purpose of the First
Amendment, was to give

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:28.900
Americans far more protection
against the government than

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:34.770
exists anywhere else in the
world, including England.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:38.730
And so you have situations
where, let's say, a trial is

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:44.260
going on, a highly publicized
trial, Jody Arias.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.650
Anything you can see on
television or read about on a

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:50.160
regular basis.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.340
In England, the press is allowed
to report fairly and

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:58.180
accurately about what
happens in court.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:01.660
They're not allowed to report
on a confession until it's

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.390
introduced in court.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:09.150
They're not allowed to report
about a prior criminal record

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:12.990
of a defendant unless
and until it is

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.750
introduced in court.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:19.640
Here, what the press learns,
the press can publish.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:24.830
Here, if the press learns that
some defendant in some case

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:28.450
has confessed, it's published.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:29.940
Well how do we deal with it?

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.470
How do we assure a defendant
a fair trial?

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:36.310
We do a lot of more things than
they do over there, in

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:39.220
part because we have to,
but in part, for

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.060
other historical reasons.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.710
We do a lot more things
to assure a

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:46.180
defendant a fair trial.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.830
That's one of the reasons
our trials take so long.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:54.810
That's one of the reasons you
sometimes see people going

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:58.160
free who may have done terrible
things but because

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:02.410
the government has failed to
meet some technical sounding.

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:08.260
But nonetheless, significant
element of proof.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:14.420
And all that really began as far
back as 1941, in which the

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:20.350
Supreme Court had a case in
which there had been a strike.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.590
And this was right on the verge
of World War II, the

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:26.670
American World War
II, beginning.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:30.320
It was a big strike of the
Teamsters, the people who work

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.940
loading and unloading on boats
and ships, and the like, in

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.580
California.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:40.450
There was a court order for
them to go back to work.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.700
The union defied the order.

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:46.330
The head of the union was held
in contempt of court.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.120
And he was up for sentencing
in front of the judge.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:54.357
And the Los Angeles Times had an
editorial saying, send him

00:33:54.357 --> 00:33:56.580
to the jute mill.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.440
I'm not even sure what jute
means, but it's not a good

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.400
place to be sent.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:06.590
He said, the LA Times said in
the clearest terms, you ought

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:09.699
to be as severe as
you possibly can.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:16.400
This guy is interfering with
national defense, and you

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.760
really ought to crack
down on him.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:23.230
In England, then and now, that's
a contempt of court.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:28.570
The editor would go to jail in
England today for saying that

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:33.350
on the ground that interferes
with the processes of justice.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.989
When I was in college,
I agreed with that.

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:40.989
I wrote a whole thesis arguing
that we ought to move towards

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:43.650
the English system because
I thought it

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:46.719
made a sort of sense.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:51.570
I have since come to different
views after I started

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:55.460
practicing law and after
I started meeting some

00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:01.370
journalists and after I started
realizing some of the

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:05.530
benefits, and hopefully
understanding, at least, the

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:07.960
potential harm, of some
of the benefits of

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.510
living in a freer system.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:15.410
Basically, what our Supreme
Court said in that case in a

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:19.520
decision by purest chance,
decided the day after Pearl

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:25.970
Harbor, the court said something
like what I almost

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.030
quoted to you a few
minutes ago.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:33.740
Nothing is clearer about the
drafting of the American Bill

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.120
of Rights in the US
Constitution, the first 10

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:40.140
amendments, that it was designed
to provide American

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:44.550
citizens with far more
protection in all these areas

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.150
than exist elsewhere
in the world,

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:51.030
particularly in England.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:55.070
And unless publication, it
will be such a clear and

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:59.050
present danger to the
administration of justice.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:02.710
Unless a judge simply can't
function for one reason or

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:07.200
another, press is free to say
what they want, free to

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.330
criticize the judge, free to
lobby the judge, free to write

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:15.880
editorials, basically saying,
you know, you better send this

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:19.800
guy away as long as possible.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.700
Judges, Justice Hugo Black
wrote, are supposed to be

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.610
hardy in nature.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:28.620
They're supposed to be strong.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:33.280
And we will not allow, he
wrote, free speech to be

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:38.540
interfered with because of the
possibility that a judge will

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:44.440
be weak-kneed, timid, unwilling
to follow the law

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:51.000
because he or she is
being criticized.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.450
Let me offer you a final example
of one of the very

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:58.450
controversial subjects talked
about in my book.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:05.740
And it's a subject where my
views are not very popular

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:11.050
with most of my friends, most of
the people with whom I tend

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.610
to agree politically
and the like.

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:16.130
That's the case you've heard
about called the Citizens

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:17.795
United case.

00:37:17.795 --> 00:37:22.520
It was a decision of the Supreme
Court four or five

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:28.290
years ago now, which said that
it was unconstitutional that

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:32.390
it violated the First Amendment
for Congress to pass

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:39.080
a law saying that if any
corporate money was spent for

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:43.870
or against the election of a
candidate within 60 days of an

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:47.330
election, and the money was
spent to endorse or to

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:51.930
denounce the candidate,
that that was a crime.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:54.720
Purpose of the law was to try
to deal with the problem of

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.390
money in politics.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:59.090
Too much money, too few people,
too much power for

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:01.220
those people, and the like.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.700
Serious stuff.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:09.380
But raised a very significant
First Amendment issues.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:13.530
The conservative group called
Citizens United, which was

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:17.680
partially funded by
corporate grants--

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:21.060
mostly, not actually,
but partly--

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:24.530
did a movie, a documentary.

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:29.740
They said that then Senator
Hillary Clinton--

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.220
this was 2008--

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:35.430
then Senator Clinton was the
leading candidate for the

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:36.640
Democratic nomination.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.660
Of course, Senator Obama
was nominated.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.270
But at that time, it looked
as if Hillary

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:43.970
Clinton would be nominated.

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:49.210
It was an hour and a
half program, film.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:52.810
And it was all attack from
beginning to end.

00:38:52.810 --> 00:39:00.280
It was a screed, a primal
scream, not to

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.530
elect her as president.

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:09.820
And it was the desire of
this group to have

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.900
it on pay per view.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.470
Because it was within
60 days--

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:19.930
or 30 days of a primary, which
was another key point in the

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:23.550
statute-- within 30 days of
a primary, 30 days of a

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:28.150
political convention, or 60
days of the election, that

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.860
would not be allowed on
television, on cable, or on

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.510
satellite under the statute.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:38.900
The question was, was
that constitutional?

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:42.080
The Supreme Court divided
five to four.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:47.380
The five, it's the court's
most conservative members

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:48.300
wrote an opinion--

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:52.120
I was one of the two lawyers
in that case who are on the

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.330
side of Citizens United--

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:57.880
wrote an opinion saying,
the statute

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.930
violates the First Amendment.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.480
We're talking about speech
about an election.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.120
Were talking about who to
vote for for president.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.160
There is nothing more important
that we have free

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:12.030
speech about, and it doesn't
matter that the money comes

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:13.840
from a corporation.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.310
The court said, we've had case
after case involving

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:21.220
corporations, mostly ones that
own newspapers, broadcasters,

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:22.300
and the like.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.730
But not just those who've
engaged in speech.

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:28.300
We've said it was protected.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.710
And that can't be
overcome here.

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:38.270
Well it remains an extremely
unpopular opinion.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.830
President Obama denounced it
in his State of the Union

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:45.930
message the January after it
came out and has said more

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:49.970
recently that he's considering
supporting a constitutional

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.100
amendment to reverse it.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:58.770
The New York Times, Washington
Post, most of the leading

00:40:58.770 --> 00:40:59.590
newspapers--

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:03.110
in fact, I would say, really
almost all of them other than

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:05.820
ones that are decidedly
conservative, like the Wall

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:11.070
Street Journal, say, or a
National Review as a magazine.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:16.430
But the great balance of press
commentary has been extremely

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:21.510
hostile to the opinion that
basically on the ground, and a

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:26.060
perfectly understandable one,
that it allows corporations

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:29.910
perhaps to have too much power,
spend too much money,

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:35.400
have too much influence on what
happens in the country.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:39.880
My view is that that
is a danger.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.520
I don't think we ought
to deal with that

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:45.290
danger by limiting speech.

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:49.750
If we want to pass laws designed
to have a more

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:54.940
egalitarian, a more equal,
society, I think we can do it.

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:57.010
Congress is of no mind
to do it now.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.560
But I'm just saying, if they
wanted to do it, if they

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.850
wanted to raise taxes on
corporations, if they wanted

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:06.140
to have stronger antitrust laws,
if they wanted to do

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:11.770
economic things to deal with an
economic problem, my view

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:13.400
is, that's one thing.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.330
You could like them or not like
them as ideas, but they

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:18.050
have nothing to do with
the First Amendment.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:20.290
That Congress is free
to do those things.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:22.330
The states are free to
do those things.

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:24.760
We don't even have to
have corporations.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.740
Nothing in the Constitution
requiring the existence of

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:28.420
corporations.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:32.760
States allow corporations
to exist.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:40.040
But my view is that when you're
talking about speech,

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:44.920
about elections, in particular,
when you're

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.520
talking about political speech,
when you're talking

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.190
about who to vote for, that
that's the area in which

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:57.100
Congress ought to have the least
power, not the most.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:02.940
And that Congress ought to be
obliged to stay away from

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:10.390
areas such as this and from
passing statutes such as this.

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:15.510
That's a very controversial
position, but I did want to

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:16.960
set it forth.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.910
I wind up the book like this.

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:25.220
I say, is it too much to ask
that people who say they care

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:30.790
about the First Amendment,
everybody, that is, really

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:38.210
mean it when they say that
everybody ought to have a free

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:42.210
say about what they think?

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:46.030
Do we really mean it when one of
the great old Supreme Court

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:49.530
opinions, it says the First
Amendment means we protect the

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:52.170
speech that we hate.

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:54.930
And the question that I ask
throughout this book is, do we

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:55.760
really mean that?

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.520
Or are we really in almost the
same situation with the First

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:00.560
Amendment as we are with

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.150
everything else in our society?

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:04.260
You know, left ones,
left speech,

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:06.320
right ones, right speech.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:11.090
Everybody is willing to cut into
the speech of the others.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:17.940
And I sort of appeal to the
reader to support First

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:20.780
Amendment freedoms
across the board.

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:25.300
To support the ability to
people, basically, not just to

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:30.080
have freedom of thought, but the
freedom of expression in

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.520
the ways that the
First Amendment

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.120
most obviously protects.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:38.400
Freedom of speech, freedom
of the press, broadly

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:44.580
interpreted, and only limited
in very, very rare

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:46.560
circumstance.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.220
So that's what the
book is about.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.560
I'm glad to appear
before you today.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:56.376
I'll be glad to take any
questions or comments.

00:44:56.376 --> 00:45:01.700
[CLAPPING]

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:09.610
FLOYD ABRAMS: I should say
first, you have to agree with

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:10.080
me, though.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:10.932
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:10.932 --> 00:45:12.640
FLOYD ABRAMS: Right?

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:15.960
AUDIENCE: So I actually wanted
to ask you sort of a follow up

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:20.135
question about the
Yale law student.

00:45:20.135 --> 00:45:21.540
FLOYD ABRAMS: Yeah.

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:24.380
AUDIENCE: It's really less a
First Amendment question than

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:27.120
sort of just your views about
the privacy issue involved.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.180
Because I think sometimes these
issues get a little

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:30.670
muddled in people's minds.

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:33.650
So if we sort of walk the cat
back a little bit there and we

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:39.340
just take the situation where
the student's in college and

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:44.550
makes statements on some
website, although with a

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:48.750
anonymous name about, you know,
I'd rather go to Yale

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.390
than Harvard because I think
Harvard Law School stinks and

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:52.430
Yale's much better, right?

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:55.040
And then ultimately, she winds
up getting into Harvard

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.340
instead of Yale.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:00.530
And some, whether it's the
person on that website or

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:03.130
somebody else, tracks down
this public, although

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:07.330
anonymous, statement, and also
through non-criminal means,

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:10.810
determines that this person is
now a student at Harvard and

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:12.920
puts the two of those together
and publishes that

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:14.580
information.

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:16.440
I mean I don't think
there's a privacy

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.800
expectation there, right?

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.550
Because they put all that
information out there.

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:22.550
But I'm just curious as to
whether you agree, or not.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:23.730
FLOYD ABRAMS: No, I agree.

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.260
But there is a libel one if they
make up stuff about her.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah, right.

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:28.420
FLOYD ABRAMS: Which
is what they did.

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.620
No, but on a privacy basis,
I agree with you.

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:37.910
And look, one of the realities
these days, these years, and

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:42.260
well into the future so far as
we can see, is that people are

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:47.290
saying so much about themselves
online and

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:54.210
otherwise that willingly or not,
or thoughtfully or not,

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:55.570
they're giving up.

00:46:55.570 --> 00:47:00.960
They're choosing to give up,
in a sense, their privacy.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:05.980
I mean if you write something
down and send it out and don't

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:11.380
find some effective way of
concealing who you are, it's

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.860
your problem.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.060
AUDIENCE: And if I could just
ask one follow up question on

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:18.030
a different subject about the
question of leaks by the

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.510
government.

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:19.870
FLOYD ABRAMS: Yeah.

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:23.500
AUDIENCE: So you know, my sense
is that you agree that

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:26.160
it can't be stopped
at this point.

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:30.370
It's essentially become a policy
tool for whichever

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:34.060
administration is in power in
order to push the political

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.170
debate one way or the other,
or influence Congress, or

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:38.640
influence the public.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.620
But I wonder--

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:41.750
I'll speak for myself--

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:44.590
I feel like there's a really
corrosive effect there.

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:47.490
And the best example I can think
of is the lead up to the

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:51.900
Iraq War, where it turned out
that the administration was

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:56.610
feeding the New York Times
information and then quoting

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:59.680
the information that it had been
fed on the Sunday talk

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.730
shows in order to say, well
look, it was published in the

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:02.540
New York Times.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.190
This was true.

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:05.780
And so it seems like it's
one thing to say,

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:06.970
OK, we're going to--

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:09.490
any government, doesn't matter
whether it's Democratic or

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:11.390
Republican, it's one thing to
say we're going to leak

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:14.760
because we want to push public
policy one way or another.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:18.370
But it's something else then
to implicate the newspapers

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:21.690
directly as a sort of a
policy making tool.

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:24.510
And I just wonder what
you think about that.

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:28.390
FLOYD ABRAMS: I agree.

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:31.370
And as you said by way of
introduction, there's not a

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:34.130
legal comment, and your question
wasn't about the law.

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:43.782
The Iraqi situation is an
interesting one in some ways.

00:48:43.782 --> 00:48:48.210
I believe that the scientists
who were quoted in those New

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:51.760
York Times articles believed
what they were saying.

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:56.340
I also think I know that the
reporter who I represented who

00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:01.370
wrote those articles believed
but she was saying.

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:06.350
But the government certainly, we
know now, was engaged in a

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:13.640
campaign to gather public
support for the war that

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:17.510
included in the information
they provided were false

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:18.740
statements.

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:24.660
Not just proved to be false,
but known to be false.

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:28.710
And that is unacceptable
behavior.

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:32.940
And your example couldn't
be more on point.

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:35.270
They not only leaked the
information, then when it was

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:38.810
published they said, the New
York Times said, as if they

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:41.950
had nothing to do with
the information

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:44.450
getting to the Times.

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:48.900
And that sort of cynicism
it sounds like

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.540
the stuff of novels.

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.130
But that's what happened.

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:57.000
And what can you say other
than it's worthy of

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:57.910
condemnation.

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:00.770
We hope it doesn't happen, or
we hope if it does happen,

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:03.580
it's exposed.

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:05.390
Anyone else?

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:06.810
Yes.

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:08.570
Did I see a hand or I see--

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:09.820
yeah?

00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:18.130
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:18.570
FLOYD ABRAMS: Hello.

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:23.090
AUDIENCE: So from what I know,
the First Amendment protects

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:28.880
citizens against what citizens
say from interference by the

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.600
government.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:35.090
And I was wondering it still
allows interference by private

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:37.850
individuals and corporations?

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:40.220
So what do you think--

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.910
should something change there?

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:46.830
Should this be allowed or should
it become more strong

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:47.930
in favor of protecting?

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:50.080
Because it's not only the
government that can threaten

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:54.550
your speech.

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:58.710
Increasingly where you write
your comments, where you

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:01.900
create speech, is owned
not by the government.

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:05.250
It's like a platform
that is online.

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:09.650
Or like where you're employed,
the employer has some power

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:13.420
over what you can say, and
you can't control that.

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:18.630
Should the government have per
se a positive obligation to

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:22.990
ensure that the citizens have
freedom of expression up to a

00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:30.010
point and ensuring that other
entities do not interfere with

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:31.840
these rights?

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:34.850
FLOYD ABRAMS: That's a
very, very serious

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:37.400
and powerful question.

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.920
First, simply as a legal matter,
the answer is easier

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.660
than the policy question
that you're asking.

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:49.380
As a legal matter, the Bill of
Rights applies only to the

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:51.160
government.

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:55.370
It's even phrased, you know,
Congress shall make no law

00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:58.930
abridging the freedom of
speech or of the press.

00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:02.970
Congress has been expanded to
mean the President and the

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:05.670
states and the courts,
et cetera.

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:07.680
But it's all government
entities.

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.600
But your question's a
lot better and more

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.700
interesting than that.

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:17.440
There are countries that do
protect far more than we do.

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:22.110
A private speech against
private institutions,

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:25.990
corporations, employers.

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:33.960
We are basically a laissez faire
country in general in

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.764
that respect.

00:52:36.764 --> 00:52:39.920
You know, people can say what
they want, and other people

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:43.620
can hold them accountable, which
is to say they can get

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:46.300
fired for saying it.

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:48.620
They can be punished, so long
as it's not the government

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:52.380
doing it, for saying it.

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:57.580
And the question of whether,
putting aside the

00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:04.710
Constitution, whether we think
it's a good idea to, in

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:09.340
effect, import the government
into that situation by saying

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:13.440
to the government, why don't
you do something to ensure

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:19.280
that private speech shall not
be so subject to control or

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:24.860
sanctions or the like by large,
powerful, private

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:26.110
institutions?

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:32.630
My reaction is that I don't
think we should go in that

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:41.180
direction in part because I
don't trust the government to

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:46.150
be in effect the decision maker
or even to interfere for

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:50.350
the good purpose of protecting
more speech.

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:53.660
But it is a very real issue.

00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:57.300
And for a lot of people in a lot
of situations, it's much

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:00.430
more real than any of the fights
that I've been talking

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:04.440
about between the government
and the people or the

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:09.040
government and the press,
and the like.

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:13.010
One of my concerns
is that there has

00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:14.510
been a tendency abroad--

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:18.320
one of the things I think we've
learned as a country--

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:21.760
is that there really is a domino
effect, to use a bad

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.410
phrase from a different
generation, when you sort of

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:33.600
put the government into the role
of helper, assurer, of

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:37.920
free speech rights is that
there's a great tendency, and

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:41.650
there has been a great tendency
in abroad, to wind up

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:44.270
with the government
in the news room.

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:48.700
And the government as decision
maker, not just about keeping

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:52.620
people from keeping other people
from speaking, but in

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:54.360
other situations.

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.210
But that's just a very
short answer

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:59.045
to a very hard question.

00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:05.740
This is not a promise, and
there's no reason for you to

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:09.230
care about what I'm about to
say, but I do owe the Yale

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:11.890
University Press
one more book.

00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:15.930
And that is something that I've
thought of writing about.

00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:17.180
Yes.

00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:20.220
Oh, sorry.

00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:22.710
AUDIENCE: As technology
continues to develop, we're

00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:24.820
finding more and more
ways to communicate.

00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:30.530
We had landline phones and wire
tap regulations, cell

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:33.550
phones, cordless phones, and now
electronic communications,

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:36.800
text, texting, online email.

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.160
And these are all mechanisms
of person to person

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.390
communication.

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:43.840
Do you think that technology is
fundamentally changing the

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:47.930
way that we view and are
given these rights?

00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:51.890
And do you think that's the
right thing to happen?

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:54.120
FLOYD ABRAMS: I don't have any
doubt that technology is

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:59.380
changing the way we exercise
the rights, and therefore,

00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:04.420
changing our ability to engage
in those rights.

00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:13.630
Also as technology changes the
issues, we'll change, although

00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:18.290
have the same base sort of
characteristics and arguments

00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:21.690
about them, about what the
role of government is in

00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:26.980
assuring fairness, as per
the last question.

00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:29.015
Net neutrality comes up.

00:56:29.015 --> 00:56:36.890
I mean, other ideas are voiced
and placed on the public

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:45.310
agenda to try to deal with the
reality of new technology.

00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:51.630
I mean, one way it comes up is
simply one where the issue

00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:55.720
then becomes, is there any more
need for this regulation

00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:59.000
or that regulation at all since
there's so much speech

00:56:59.000 --> 00:56:59.750
in this area?

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:04.710
I did a case for Time Warner
Cable, which is on awaiting a

00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:09.190
decision now, about whether it
is still constitutional under

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:12.610
the First Amendment for Congress
to have required

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:17.670
cable companies to carry
networks, basically, that they

00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:19.190
don't want to carry.

00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:22.020
And one of the arguments we made
is, look, there's so much

00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:25.820
speech from so many sources
now, you've

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:28.420
got to let them go.

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:32.080
And if not now, later.

00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:38.580
So the changing forms of
technology affects everything.

00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.935
It affects privacy, we were
talking about earlier.

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:48.850
It is even leading to some very
interesting cases in the

00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:50.850
libel area, for example.

00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:56.910
One judge wrote an opinion
basically saying, online

00:57:56.910 --> 00:58:03.780
speech by its nature is not
taken as literally as the

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:07.330
speech in my book, you know,
with a hard cover on it and

00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:09.930
everything.

00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:11.270
People don't mean it.

00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:13.150
It's more casual.

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:22.250
It's not take to mean the
ultimate meanings of what one

00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:25.530
might view it if it appeared
in a different medium of

00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:28.060
communication.

00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:31.940
And I don't have any doubt that
we're going to need a lot

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:37.600
more decisions and a lot more
legal decisions as the

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.300
on-the-ground reality changes.

00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.330
And of course the laws
always behind.

00:58:42.330 --> 00:58:46.320
Technology's way ahead of
anything that the law can

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:51.060
handle, or predict or be
ready to deal with.

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:54.760
And by the time cases come up
to the court, sometimes the

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:57.920
technology has already changed
to such an extent that the

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:01.950
issue isn't even that
relevant anymore.

00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:08.760
But the thrust of your question
I agree with.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:12.390
And we're going to--

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:16.370
the pace of the change of
technology in this country is

00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:23.520
so great that it is very hard
for the law to keep pace with

00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:31.000
it in terms of even trying to
deal with it, and in a society

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.330
where, as I suggested earlier,
that Congress can't agree on

00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:38.700
almost anything anyway.

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:41.956
It means we'll be sort of even
more laissez faire, as it

00:59:41.956 --> 00:59:43.960
were, for better or worse.

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:48.620
There will be probably less
regulation for better or worse

00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:51.780
because no one's going to be
able to agree on anything on

00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:53.210
what to do about it.

00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:54.790
Yes.

00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:57.740
AUDIENCE: Is the Constitution
contain protections for a

00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:01.780
journalist who need to
misrepresent themselves while

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:04.510
uncovering facts that they
intend to publish, say, in a

01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:07.260
way that contravenes a contract
that they might sign

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.340
or something like that?

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.750
FLOYD ABRAMS: Well not
to breach a contract

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:13.570
that they sign, no.

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:25.650
But generally, a journalist who
suggests to someone that

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:30.120
the article is going to be good
for him is not held to

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:34.830
that in the courts.

01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:40.210
But there are situations in
which journalists promised

01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:42.230
something, and then the question
is, what should the

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:43.340
law do about it?

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:48.490
One really interesting case,
occurred in Minnesota 15,

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:50.980
maybe 20, years ago.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.390
Two candidates running for

01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:56.010
lieutenant governor of Minnesota.

01:00:56.010 --> 01:01:03.690
And one of them says to a
journalist, I know material

01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:07.980
about my opponent which I'm
ready to tell you if you

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:10.820
promise me confidentiality.

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:13.330
Really bad stuff.

01:01:13.330 --> 01:01:17.330
The journalist, a young
journalist, promised

01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:18.690
confidentiality.

01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:22.810
And he told the story of how his
opponent had been arrested

01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:28.760
as a teenager for shoplifting
in a Woolworth's store.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.660
Not much of a crime.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:35.900
She goes back to her office,
and she tells her boss,

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:39.690
editor, what she's found.

01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:41.370
The editor says, that's
no story.

01:01:41.370 --> 01:01:43.000
The story is, he's

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.720
leaking this crap [LAUGHTER]

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.370
FLOYD ABRAMS: So that's what
we're going to publish.

01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:53.900
And she said, but I promised
confidentiality to him.

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:58.010
And he said, no, no, if
the story here is--

01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:00.470
that's just sort of
stuff he's saying.

01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:01.450
So they published that.

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:05.320
The guy lost the election,
and he sued.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:11.500
And he said, I had a deal, a
contract-like situation with

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.750
the reporter.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.410
And so the question--

01:02:16.410 --> 01:02:20.440
the issue came up to
the Supreme Court.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:24.370
And the court said that it would
be constitutional, it

01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:28.810
would not violate the First
Amendment, for Minnesota to

01:02:28.810 --> 01:02:33.200
allow a recovery in that
case by the candidate.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:37.920
The press side had argued, we
were telling the truth.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.770
How can we be in trouble
by telling the truth?

01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:44.820
In libel law, you always win
if you tell the truth.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.230
And the answer was, well you
made an agreement, or at least

01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:52.200
that's what a jury found, that
you promised confidentiality,

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.460
and you have to keep
the promise.

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:55.880
Yes.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.470
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
all we have time for.

01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.960
FLOYD ABRAMS: Right.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.160
Thank you all very much.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.060
