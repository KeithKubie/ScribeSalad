So now that we've covered
reading content on piazza,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.080
what about posting content?

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.650
To post a new thread,
click New Post in the top left.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.350
At the top,
you'll select your Post Type.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.620
&gt;&gt; When you're posting a new topic,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.060
it's really helpful to select
the right kind of post.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.070
Are you asking a question that will have
one right answer, like a due date or

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.610
a clarification on directions?

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.310
The you probably want to use a Question.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.070
Are you just sharing something,
or asking for

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.230
something with multiple good answers,
like help solving a problem?

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.090
That's usually better suited for a Note.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.090
Or, if you want to ask a poll question,
you could always just choose Poll.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.010
&gt;&gt; Piazza lets you communicate
privately, as well.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.510
You can share your post
with the whole class,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.400
with only a group you're a member of,
or only with instructors.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.340
Next, select the folder
your posts will go into.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.870
A single post can go into
more than one folder.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.010
Then enter your title and post text.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.190
Depending on your class, you might be
able to choose to remain anonymous.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.840
All though not all
classes have this option.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.050
Then, click Post My Question and
your post will appear.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.570
Or, you can save it as
a draft to return to later.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.960
You'll see a list of your drafts
at the top of the topic lists

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.530
whenever you start to create a new post.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.180
But, for now,
I'll go ahead and post this.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.380
After posting,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.300
you can edit the post by clicking
the edit button in the bottom left.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.160
You can also access other options with
the actions menu in the top right.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.430
Only inspectors can delete post.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.680
But you can change the visibility
if you post by mistake.
