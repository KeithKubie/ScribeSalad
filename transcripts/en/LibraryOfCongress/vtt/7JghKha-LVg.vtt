»:  Welcome to story time at the
library of congress.  It is fun 

00:00:17.474 --> 00:00:19.501
to see them faces and new faces 
as well.  I am Leanne Potter and

00:00:19.502 --> 00:00:22.807
I direct the outreach at the 
library and many of you know 

00:00:22.808 --> 00:00:25.242
about a month and a half ago the
library entered in to an 

00:00:25.243 --> 00:00:29.515
exciting partnership with Dolly 
part and imagination Library.

00:00:32.768 --> 00:00:33.988
The imagination Library gusty 
wind Dolly part and came to the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.675
library, we were celebrating the
fact that her organization had 

00:00:38.676 --> 00:00:40.676
distributed its 100 

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:46.612
million book to children around 
this country and elsewhere.  We 

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.613
were so excited about it and the

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:52.281
library entered into a library 
with the 

00:00:54.152 --> 00:00:55.152
imagination Library through a 
series of six livestream story 

00:00:55.153 --> 00:01:00.057
times.  This is one of our 
livestream story times and why I

00:01:00.058 --> 00:01:02.906
am yelling at you is to remind 
you that this is being filmed.

00:01:05.953 --> 00:01:07.577
It is live on the Internet and 
we should all be very aware of 

00:01:07.578 --> 00:01:11.844
that.  If you don't want to be 
famous, now is your chance bail.

00:01:16.157 --> 00:01:18.616
And I am going to ask really 
nicely something important.  And

00:01:18.617 --> 00:01:20.449
our last storytime, we had a 
little signing going on and some

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.166
of you remember it was like it 
became a jungle gym and we 

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:28.604
really cannot let that happen.  
It makes our camera crew nervous

00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:31.246
and it makes me nervous and it 
makes us all a little nervous so

00:01:31.247 --> 00:01:35.306
if you could make sure the kids 
hang out on the floor, that 

00:01:35.307 --> 00:01:37.307
would be great and please fully 

00:01:38.357 --> 00:01:40.357
participate in storytime and 
enjoy.

00:01:41.424 --> 00:01:43.424
This morning are very special

the gingerbread man and the fire

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:52.250
truck and we will get to that in
just a minute, but the very 

00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:54.085
first thing we are going to do 
is watch a quick video 

00:01:54.086 --> 00:01:56.086
introduction 

00:01:57.555 --> 00:01:59.555

thank you.

00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:05.697

this very special storytime at 

00:02:05.698 --> 00:02:10.577
the library.  I love this.  , 
don't you??  It is so much time 

00:02:10.578 --> 00:02:12.578
to let our imaginations run 
wild.

00:02:16.617 --> 00:02:17.430
We are starting to be teamed up 
with, Ms. Dolly Parton 

00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:19.875
Imagination Library to introduce
you to some wonderful authors 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.920
who will share their stories 
with us.

00:02:25.798 --> 00:02:27.624
Dolly Parton's work through her 
Imagination Library is 

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:29.625
awe-inspiring and 

00:02:30.674 --> 00:02:32.701
she and our team have given away
over 100 million books to help 

00:02:32.702 --> 00:02:34.702

00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:38.189
young readers across the world. 
Here at the Library of Congress 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.683
we share that passion for 
developing young leaders and we 

00:02:43.684 --> 00:02:46.525
know that the best way to 
encourage people like you to 

00:02:46.526 --> 00:02:49.984
read is to make reading fun!  So
that is what we do.

Today we will warm up by singing

00:03:04.613 --> 00:03:06.847
songs, touching your toes, and 
then get comfortable and get 

00:03:06.848 --> 00:03:08.883
ready to hear a story!  Now 
let's get started!

00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:17.854
» LAURA MURRAY:  Welcome

00:03:17.855 --> 00:03:19.855
library of Congress.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.574
We are here in this beautiful

00:03:22.575 --> 00:03:30.115

the Library of Congress and here
we are 

00:03:37.644 --> 00:03:39.644

00:03:40.911 --> 00:03:43.764
Caroline and this is Laura 
Murray, the author of the 

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:48.851
gingerbread man.  So today we 
are going to start off with our 

00:03:48.852 --> 00:03:51.507
hello, song and we just need to 
learn a little bit of sign.

00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:57.233
So in salute for hello, and then
friends is at the index finger 

00:03:57.234 --> 00:03:59.234

00:04:04.585 --> 00:04:06.585

times.

00:04:09.314 --> 00:04:11.548
Hello, friends and then it is 
time -- touch or watch -- to say

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.199
hello!  Okay?  All right.  .  
Let’s go.

00:04:20.743 --> 00:04:22.743

(Applause)
Good job.  All right.

00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:33.901
Let's do our brains.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.070
Open, shut them, open, shut 
them, put 

00:04:48.934 --> 00:04:50.934
them in your lap, lap, lap.

00:04:55.394 --> 00:04:57.394
Close them,

00:04:58.733 --> 00:05:00.733
put them near your chin, Chin, 
open up 

00:05:05.497 --> 00:05:07.497
your little mouths -- let them 
in -- 

00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:10.565
open, shut them, open them, shut
them, 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.230
give a little clap, clap, clap.

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.669
Open them, shut them, open, shut
them.

00:05:18.947 --> 00:05:20.947
Put them in your lap, lap, lap.

00:05:24.638 --> 00:05:27.273
Creep them, call them, creep 
them, called them, right up to 

00:05:27.274 --> 00:05:29.274
your  chin, chin, chin.

00:05:32.764 --> 00:05:37.440
Open up your little mouths and 
do not let them in.  Yeah!  

00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:38.660
Yeah!
(Applause)

00:05:38.661 --> 00:05:43.333
All right.  So Laura, can you 
read us some of the gingerbread 

00:05:43.334 --> 00:05:49.430
man, loose on the fire truck?  
» LAURA MURRAY:  Thank you, so 

00:05:49.431 --> 00:05:54.528
much.  I am a very excited 
person to be here today.  My 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:56.529
name is Laura Murray and I am a 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:02.080
children's author and I also 
write the words to the stories. 

00:06:02.081 --> 00:06:06.364
And my stories are about a 
gingerbread man!  And there is a

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.601
series of them.  The one at that
we are going to read 

00:06:11.664 --> 00:06:13.700
today is the second in the 
series.  It is called, "The 

00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:15.701
gingerbread man, 

00:06:17.352 --> 00:06:20.197
loose on the fire truck" but 
before we read this, you might 

00:06:20.198 --> 00:06:22.623
want to know why there is a 
gingerbread man on the fire 

00:06:23.044 --> 00:06:26.310
truck?   And it starts with the 
very first book.

00:06:29.593 --> 00:06:31.593
So a gingerbread man is made by 
a 

00:06:32.688 --> 00:06:34.688
classroom full of kids and he 
gets to be part of their class!

00:06:37.784 --> 00:06:40.021
And since he is part of their 
class, then he gets to go on 

00:06:40.022 --> 00:06:42.022
field trips with them.

00:06:45.101 --> 00:06:48.352
So his first field trip is to 
the fire station!  So let's get 

00:06:48.353 --> 00:06:52.607
started!  Now I would like you 
to help me if you can.  Would 

00:06:52.608 --> 00:06:54.608
you like to know how?  Okay.

00:06:57.704 --> 00:06:59.704
We will read a story in this is 
our plan.

00:07:02.801 --> 00:07:05.651
When I say gingerbread, you say 
man!  So let's try it -- 

00:07:05.652 --> 00:07:07.274
gingerbread.
»:  Man.

00:07:07.275 --> 00:07:08.697
» LAURA MURRAY:  Gingerbread.
»:  Man.

00:07:08.698 --> 00:07:10.323
» LAURA MURRAY:  You guys got 
it.  Let's try it with the 

00:07:10.324 --> 00:07:13.160
title.  The gingerbread.
»:  Man.

00:07:16.216 --> 00:07:18.036
» LAURA MURRAY:  Loose on the 
fire chief -- fire truck by 

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:20.037
Laura Murray, that is 

00:07:21.298 --> 00:07:24.756
me because I wrote the words, 
illustrated by Michael Lowery.  

00:07:24.757 --> 00:07:28.225
He drew the what do you think?  
The pictures!  The pictures.  

00:07:28.226 --> 00:07:30.226
Okay.  So here we go.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.583
On a bright Monday morning, my 
teacher breezed in. Let's all 

00:07:35.584 --> 00:07:39.053
make a circle. It's time to 
begin. She winked and then 

00:07:39.054 --> 00:07:41.054
whispered, our field trip's 
today.

00:07:42.732 --> 00:07:44.732
The classroom erupted with 
shouts of, "Hooray!

00:07:45.747 --> 00:07:47.747
"

00:07:49.236 --> 00:07:52.498
Very good
 We're riding the bus to the big

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:53.923
fire station, to meet 
firefighters and Spot, their 

00:07:53.924 --> 00:07:55.924
Dalmatian.

00:07:57.391 --> 00:07:59.989
So Sophia leaned down and said, 
"You're coming too.  You're our 

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.990
gingerbread man -- we wouldn't 
leave you.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.536
Just jump in my backpack, I'll 
give you a ride. There's a 

00:08:08.537 --> 00:08:10.537
pocket for you over here on the 
side.

00:08:13.207 --> 00:08:17.881
The pocket was cozy. I peeked 
from the top. The bus drove 4 

00:08:17.882 --> 00:08:19.882
miles then came to a 

00:08:20.894 --> 00:08:22.972
stop In front of the building 
with shiny red 

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.030
doors stood two firefighters 
from Company 4.

00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:32.099
One had on gear for a quick 

00:08:33.766 --> 00:08:34.172
demonstration  and standing 
beside him was Spot, the 

00:08:34.173 --> 00:08:36.173
Dalmatian.

00:08:41.881 --> 00:08:43.881
That's right.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.170
And the firefighter has on 
goggles, a 

00:08:53.048 --> 00:08:55.391
helmet, and oxygen tank, a 
flashlight, an axe, gloves, and 

00:08:55.392 --> 00:09:01.112
boots.  And in Spot the dog!
 I was jostled and jiggled as 

00:09:01.113 --> 00:09:03.362
kids moved about. Then I fell 
from the pocket right on the 

00:09:03.363 --> 00:09:05.363
dog's snout!

00:09:08.275 --> 00:09:13.162
Is that a good place for a 
gingerbread man to be?  Ohno!

00:09:13.371 --> 00:09:17.840
 Spot sniffed at my face, taking
one sticky lick. I needed a 

00:09:17.841 --> 00:09:20.061
trick to get out of there quick!
He tossed me up high with his 

00:09:20.062 --> 00:09:22.062
mouth 

00:09:23.955 --> 00:09:24.569
open wide, but I flipped toward 
his tail and slid down like a 

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.570
slide.

00:09:34.154 --> 00:09:37.450
Weeee!
 My feet hit the ground. I took 

00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:39.291
off for the station. But right 
on my heels was that hungry 

00:09:39.292 --> 00:09:42.581
Dalmatian. I'll run and I'll 
dodge, as fast as I can. I'm not

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.582
a dog bone! I'm the gingerbread 
man!

00:09:47.262 --> 00:09:52.139
Very good
 The class didn't notice. They 

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:52.953
tried on black boots and 
helmets, and air tanks, and big 

00:09:52.954 --> 00:09:54.954
heavy suits.

00:09:57.452 --> 00:10:02.136
Do you see the gingerbread man 
there writing?  And who is 

00:10:02.137 --> 00:10:04.137
behind him?

00:10:05.197 --> 00:10:07.197
Spot the Dalmatian!  Oh, my 
goodness!

00:10:08.237 --> 00:10:11.102
I dashed to the fire truck, 
jumped in a seat. Whew! I was 

00:10:11.103 --> 00:10:13.103
almost a sweet doggy treat!.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.033
Wow!  He got away

00:10:21.942 --> 00:10:23.378
I hopped on the steering will, 
gave it a spin -- and yelled 

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:26.214
out, "Honk Honk!"  with a big 
cookie grin. The wheel spun past

00:10:26.215 --> 00:10:29.074
gauges and switches and knobs --
all kinds of buttons that do 

00:10:29.075 --> 00:10:31.075
different jobs.

00:10:34.158 --> 00:10:37.019
I'll vroom and I'll zoom, as 
fast as I can. I'll steer this 

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.020
big truck, I'm the gingerbread 
man!

00:10:42.741 --> 00:10:47.843
That is where I am going to 
pause for just a minute.  We are

00:10:47.844 --> 00:10:50.271
going to break the book up into 
two sections and we will do two 

00:10:50.272 --> 00:10:54.753
songs and then finish the book! 
All right!  Okay!  All right!

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:01.242
So we need to make a gingerbread
man!

00:11:07.598 --> 00:11:09.598
So we are going to go bake, 
bake, bake 

00:11:11.056 --> 00:11:14.106
a gingerbread -- add sugar and 
spice, and everything nice.  

00:11:14.107 --> 00:11:20.227
Look!  We made our friend.  
Okay.  One more time.  It is 

00:11:20.228 --> 00:11:22.228
going to be row your boat.

00:11:29.976 --> 00:11:31.976
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, 
bake, 

00:11:34.481 --> 00:11:36.314
bake, bake all day, bake a 
gingerbread, add spice and 

00:11:36.315 --> 00:11:39.174
everything nice, look!  We made 
a friend.  One more time.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.305
Bake, bake, bake all day, make a
gingerbread.  Add sugar and 

00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:50.779

We made a friend!  Yeah!  Good 

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.780
job!
(Applause)

00:11:53.624 --> 00:11:55.624
All right.

00:11:57.904 --> 00:12:01.577
Now a classic about a little boy
having an adventure.  We are 

00:12:01.578 --> 00:12:03.578
going to make a candle with one 

00:12:05.455 --> 00:12:06.882
finger and then the other is 
going to be Jack and he is going

00:12:06.883 --> 00:12:09.935
to go up to the candle and he is
going to jump over it.  Okay?

00:12:15.425 --> 00:12:19.083
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, 
Jack jump over the candlestick! 

00:12:19.084 --> 00:12:21.084
All right.  Go the other way.

00:12:24.368 --> 00:12:27.411
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, 
Jack jump over the candlestick! 

00:12:27.412 --> 00:12:29.412
Good job!
(Applause)

00:12:32.106 --> 00:12:34.106
Now the other half of our story.
Okay.

00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:39.064
Now let's see what happens with 
the gingerbread man.  Does he 

00:12:39.065 --> 00:12:43.160
get away from Spot?  How does he
help?  Okay?  

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.242
Then I heard someone whistle. 
Spot trotted away. So I jumped 

00:12:47.243 --> 00:12:49.243
through the window without a 
delay.

00:12:50.495 --> 00:12:54.784
I landed on a top of a big 
several silver bowl. Oh, no! I 

00:12:54.785 --> 00:12:56.785
cried out as I leapt for a pole.

00:13:03.929 --> 00:13:05.962
I shimmied right up and I sprang
from the top and then jumped on 

00:13:05.963 --> 00:13:10.452
a bed with a big belly flop.
Who does belly flops on their 

00:13:10.453 --> 00:13:12.453
bed?  Anybody?
(Laughter)

00:13:14.734 --> 00:13:16.161
There were several more bunks 
with their covers pulled tight 

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:18.162
for each firefighter who stayed 
through the night.

00:13:20.022 --> 00:13:22.022
I bounced on each bed on my way 
to the 

00:13:23.698 --> 00:13:25.698
door, then into a room with a 
bright checkered floor.

00:13:28.635 --> 00:13:32.903
Where is he going?
 I peeked around the corner and 

00:13:32.904 --> 00:13:34.766
smelled something yummy -- a 
grumbling sound rumbled up from 

00:13:34.767 --> 00:13:36.767
my tummy.

00:13:40.441 --> 00:13:41.053
I spotted a fireman filling up 
bowls with five-alarm chili and 

00:13:41.054 --> 00:13:43.054
buttery rolls.

00:13:45.329 --> 00:13:47.771
There he is, down Then all of a 
sudden I heard a loud noise.

00:13:48.375 --> 00:13:52.267
there
 Woooo! Fire! One shouted, "No 

00:13:52.268 --> 00:13:55.332
lunch for us, boys." They rushed
to the bunk room and slid down 

00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:57.333
the pole.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.220
I followed behind them then 
peered down the hole.

00:14:05.518 --> 00:14:07.518
Spot wasn't there -- a sure sign
of good luck.

00:14:08.801 --> 00:14:11.868
So I slipped down the pole and 
then jumped on the truck. I'll 

00:14:11.869 --> 00:14:14.916
ride to the rescue, as fast as I
can. I want to help, too! I'm 

00:14:14.917 --> 00:14:17.761
the gingerbread man! Weeeee!

00:14:21.452 --> 00:14:23.693
Can you do that?   Weeeee!

00:14:30.205 --> 00:14:32.445
went the sirens the lights 
flashed around. As I zoomed past

00:14:32.446 --> 00:14:34.446
my classmates below on the 
ground.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.180
We sped through the streets and 
I clung to the back. near 

00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:43.181
ladders and hoses piled up in a 
stack.

00:14:45.467 --> 00:14:48.317
There he is
 The engine pulled up, 

00:14:48.318 --> 00:14:50.556
firefighters jumped out. They 
rushed to the hydrant and opened

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:52.557
the spout.

00:14:54.416 --> 00:14:56.416
I spied a large house with a 
shed near the back.

00:14:58.887 --> 00:15:00.887
Smoke rose from its window, all 
sooty and black.

00:15:05.217 --> 00:15:07.657
I'll put out that fire, as fast 
as I can. I know I can help! I'm

00:15:07.658 --> 00:15:09.658
the gingerbread man!

00:15:11.922 --> 00:15:13.922
I grabbed the hose nozzle and 
gave it a pull.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.610
But that hose whipped and bumped
like a rodeo bull!.

00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:25.984
Because he is so small, is NT?
 The water wooshed out and it 

00:15:25.985 --> 00:15:28.220
doused the old shed. And the 
powerful spray shot the hat off 

00:15:28.221 --> 00:15:30.221
my head.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.771
He lost his hat! The chief ran 
up quickly and dove on the hose.

00:15:38.009 --> 00:15:40.009
She crawled her way up until we 
came nose to nose.

00:15:41.671 --> 00:15:43.671
"Looked everyone! It's a 
gingerbread man!

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.410
Now where did you come from," 
Said the Fire Chief Anne.

00:15:51.666 --> 00:15:53.666
"I came with the children to 
visit the station.

00:15:56.566 --> 00:15:58.566
But I almost got eaten by Spot, 
the Dalmatian.

00:16:00.444 --> 00:16:03.306
I had to escape from that hungry
crumb-snatcher, so I jumped on 

00:16:03.307 --> 00:16:05.307
the truck when I heard your 
dispatcher.

00:16:06.917 --> 00:16:08.917
" "Good thinking, smart cookie!

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.275
We're glad you hopped on. You 
wrestled that hose till the fire

00:16:13.276 --> 00:16:15.276
was gone.

00:16:16.298 --> 00:16:20.844
"
Did he help put out the fire?  

00:16:20.845 --> 00:16:23.696
Yes, he did
 We packed up the truck and 

00:16:23.697 --> 00:16:27.801
drove back to the station.
Can you drive back to the 

00:16:27.802 --> 00:16:31.268
station?  
 We pulled in the drive to a 

00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:33.269
standing ovation.

00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:37.331
Can you clap?
(Applause)

00:16:37.972 --> 00:16:40.617
That is what innovation means.
 Your gingerbread guy was a 

00:16:40.618 --> 00:16:42.649
brave little man! "He doused 
every flame," announced Fire 

00:16:44.674 --> 00:16:46.674
Chief Anne The children 
applauded and shouted, "Yeah!

00:16:47.681 --> 00:16:49.681
" They held me up high, yelling,
"You saved the day!

00:16:52.202 --> 00:16:54.202
"

00:16:59.363 --> 00:17:01.363
And in the firefighter said you 
are really a hero.

00:17:01.801 --> 00:17:04.447
You're part of our crew. But 
you're missing your hat so we 

00:17:04.448 --> 00:17:08.728
have one for you A shiny red 
helmet from Company 4! There are

00:17:08.729 --> 00:17:10.729
more for your classmates 

00:17:13.206 --> 00:17:14.855
stacked up by the door I tried 
on my helmet and shouted 

00:17:14.856 --> 00:17:16.856
"Woohoo!

00:17:20.554 --> 00:17:22.554
I'm a gingerbread man and a 
fireman too!

00:17:23.572 --> 00:17:25.572
"

00:17:31.392 --> 00:17:33.392
And that is the end.
(Applause)

00:17:38.961 --> 00:17:41.199
You guys did a great job finding
all of the man's and helping me 

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.859

00:18:04.839 --> 00:18:06.839
