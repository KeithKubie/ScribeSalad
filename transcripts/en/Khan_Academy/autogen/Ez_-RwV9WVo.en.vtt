00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
 . 

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.630
 Let's assume that I have point 3, -4 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.740
 Ie will be 1, 2, 3 and 4 down 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.530
 1, 2, 3, 4 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.910
 These are 3, -4 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.310
 I also have point 6.1 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.050
 If 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.510
 So 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.560
 6.1 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.750
 In the last offer, we found that we can use 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.530
 Pythagoras theory if we want to find 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.270
 The distance between these two points 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.000
 We draw a triangle here and realize that this 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.870
 Tendon 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.570
 In this presentation, I will try to find what is 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.980
 The focal point is located halfway between 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.170
 This cat and that point? 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.510
 If this distance, any line that 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.000
 Up between them 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.500
 Now what is the axial point exactly lies 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.520
 Half way between the two? 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.910
 What is the coordinates? 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.830
 It is a number, number 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.280
 And to do that - let me draw it even more here 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.590
 Because I think you will find it 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.255
 Very direct 

00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:08.050
 At first it looks like a difficult issue 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.620
 Let me use the space formula with some variables 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.490
 But you'll see, it's one of the simplest 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.210
 The things you will learn in algebra and geometry 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.430
 Let's assume that this is a triangle 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.020
 That is the triangle 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.830
 This is point 6.1 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.240
 The ones at the bottom are point 3, -4 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.310
 We are looking for a point to fall 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.840
 Between these two points 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.090
 What are its coordinates? 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.110
 Sounds tough at first, but it's easy when you think 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.360
 In terms of x and y coordinates 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.700
 How long will the x coordinate? 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.000
 This line shows that x = 6 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.530
 This is here - let me do it in a dark color-- 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.460
 This illustrates that x = 6 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.120
 This shows that x = 3 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.690
 How much will this x coordinate? 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.530
 Well, the x-coordinate will occur 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.660
 Between x coordinates 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.980
 This is x = 3, and this is x = 6 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.760
 It will be between them 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.830
 This distance will be equal to this distance 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.020
 The x coordinate will be located in the middle between 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.770
 3 and 6 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.800
 What we call the number that lies between 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.710
 The 3 and 6? 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.650
 It can be called a midpoint, or we can call it 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.540
 Average, or average, or whatever we like 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.180
 To call it 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.980
 We just want to know what is the rate of 3 and 6? 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.730
 And until we find this point, the point is halfway between 3 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.700
 And 6, we find this, 3 + 6/2 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.280
 Equal to 4.5 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.000
 If this is an x ​​coordinate, it is 4.5 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.050
 Let me draw this graphically 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.330
 1, 2, 3, 4.5 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.050
 As you can see, it lies between them 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.610
 This is an x ​​coordinate 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.440
 Now, with the same logic, the Y coordinate 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.740
 Will be in the middle between y = -4 and y 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.650
 = 1 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.520
 It will be between them 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.450
 This is x 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.810
 And y will be between y = 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.470
 -4 and y = 1 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.040
 If we take the rate 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.390
 1 + -4 / 2 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.040
 This equals 3 / 2- or can say 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.940
 1.5 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.630
 1.5 at the bottom 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.450
 Located right here 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.200
 So 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.260
 We take the x rate, and take the rate 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.370
 The y, or maybe you should say that the average is 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.150
 More specific 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.840
 Average of two points 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.320
 You will get the midpoint of these two points 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.840
 The point is quite midway between them 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.380
 It's the midpoint of the line that connects them 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.150
 If the coordinates are 4.5, -1.5 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.200
 Let us solve more of these examples 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.560
 These, in fact, you'll find 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.970
 Very direct 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.690
 But to review it, let me represent it graphically 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.660
 Let's assume I have point 4, -5 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.270
 If 1, 2, 3, 4 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.100
 Then down to 5 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.160
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.420
 If those are 4, -5 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.960
 I have point 8.2 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.100
 If 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.410
 8.2 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.149
 So what is the coordinates of the midpoint 

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.899
 These two points? 

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.600
 The point that lies between them? 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.970
 Well, take the x rate, and take the y rate 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.020
 If the midpoint is going to be - x values ​​are 8 and 4 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.260
 Will be 8 + 4/2 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.660
 And the y value will be - well, we have 2 and 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.510
 5 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.220
 We get 2 + -5 / 2 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.460
 how much? 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.750
 12/2 = 6, 2 - 5 = -3 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.280
 3/2 = -1.5 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.610
 If this is the midpoint 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.040
 Just take the x and y, or 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.660
 We find the average 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.820
 Let's do it, so make sure 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.220
 From it it looks like a midpoint 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.170
 6, -5 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.200
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.520
 1.5 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.520
 -1, -1.5 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.100
 Yes, looks good 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.020
 It seems to be located halfway between this point and 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.550
 That point 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.090
 Now that's all you need to remember 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.485
 X, or x, or x 

00:05:21.485 --> 00:05:22.840
 Which lies between these two 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.800
 And y rate 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.050
 Get to the midpoint 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.160
 What I will explain to you now is in the textbook 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.530
 If I have point x1 y1, then 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.250
 The point - in fact, I will write it in yellow 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.950
 It's always tired to change color - then 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.390
 I have point x2 y2, many books will give you something 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.900
 The formula is called the midpoint 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.820
 Again, I think it's naive to keep it 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.460
 But just remember, we take the rate 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.780
 We find the x that lies between them, and we find the y that lies between them 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.675
 If the formula is midpoint 

00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:57.080
 Midpoint Formula 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.880
 What is already said here is the midpoint - so perhaps we will say 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.410
 Midpoint x - Or maybe I'll call it that way 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.560
 I better labels 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.080
 Dot x and midpoint = y 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.170
 - This will give you the format x1 + x2 / 2 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.580
 Then y1 + y2 / 2 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.070
 It seems that you have to keep it 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.140
 But all you have to say, see 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.090
 This is a rate, or average 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.340
 These two numbers 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.040
 I gather them 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.050
 I gather them together and swear on 2, we gather these two 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.730
 With each other, we divide on 2 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.900
 So get a fair point 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.770
 That's all about the midpoint 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.800
 .
