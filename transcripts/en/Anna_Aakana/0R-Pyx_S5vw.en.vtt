00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.960
Small twist on a standard greeting

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.460
and direct enough to show interest but indirect enough

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.280
not to be condescending and misogynistic.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.980
Acknowledgement of your non-use of cat-calls or rude observations of my body to get my attention.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.780
Witty response to demonstrate personality independent of a relationship to a man.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.960
Response demonstrating an attitude of appreciation for a partner with independent activity.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.600
Pause of silence to decide whether or not to engage in conversation further with you while maintaining eye contact

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.300
to demonstrate confidence and non-intimidation.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.620
Sustained eye contact during silence to show that I, as a politically correct man of the 21st century,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.780
I'm ok with letting a woman make her own choices for herself.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.520
Permission to proceed via witty quip.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.080
Hearty laugh to demonstrate that I understand your wit.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.300
Bartender!

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.700
Ordering of a gender-neutral alcoholic drink and pausing briefly to see if the lady would have me order for her, or if she would rather

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.580
Drink order for myself, please Bartender

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.940
Delivery of drinks with overbearing compliment to the lady.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.420
And a panicked compliment to the gentleman masking sexism with question of my sexuality.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.080
Awkward exit.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.120
(Clink!)

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.540
Mm, inquiries about your current state of being with just enough upward inflexion

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.340
to communicate genuine interest, as opposed to filler conversation while imagining you naked.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.960
Body language opening to positively reinforce your genuine engagement.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.900
Comment on a minor detail of your response to demonstrate active listening.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.520
Rewarding your vulnerability by initiating a physical relationship by touching your elbow.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.860
Hah, self deprecating joke to demonstrate that I don't take myself too seriously.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.540
[Both]: Hearty laugh.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.840
Handing of my business card to shatter the lipstick on napkin stereotype.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.840
Taking of the business card and handing back my business card because you can call me first too if you want to.  It's 2015.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.020
Politically correct.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.780
Ah, politically correct.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.580
Hearty laugh.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.660
Laugh that's not quite as hearty.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.160
Hm?
