00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.550
So with that I'd just like to close and
say, one,

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.620
we talked about Epsilon photography.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.189
Sequence of images allowed
us to now capture more

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.650
additional representation that will
allow us to generate newer images.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.930
We basically said, let's look
at coded photography, that is,

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.180
within the same image captured, let's
put some sort of additional information

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.760
in there that could be done by
coded aperture or coded shutter and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.400
that allow us to create, for example,
two different types of images.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.340
We looked at coded aperture in detail.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.100
We looked at flutter-shutter,
which was called a shutter.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.840
And basically all of
them are examples of

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.290
how we can actually
do coded photography.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.270
Again, Epsilon photography,
coded photography,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.630
just kinds of similar things
in different ways, but

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.610
all aimed at generating novel
images on the camera by controlling

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.910
how the camera captures light from a
scene and in essence are major parts of

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.680
what we think computational photography
should be looking more and more at.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.740
You'll be learning more
about these things and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.770
other ways throughout the class with
some additional papers that I'm going to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.110
be pointing out to you.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.209
To finish, here is the paper that
actually gets into the whole concept of

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.530
Epsilon to coded photography,
then the paper that I talked about,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.720
coded apertures.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.260
This is the paper about
fluttered shutter cameras.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.240
Just if you're interested in the Lucy
Richardson deconvolution methods there's

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.410
a Wikipedia entry on
it that's pretty good.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.500
And again, for those of you interested
in learning more about the discrete

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.110
fourier transform and the sync functions
for different types of signals.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.840
There's an online book that has
a lot of in, information on it.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.090
But otherwise find your favorite
textbook on digital processing or

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.680
image processing,
they'll tell you how to do these things.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.110
Just again, I've also linked
the websites of the different

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.970
projects that I've talked
about in this class.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.410
I encourage you to look at them,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.190
there's a whole lot of
additional detail available
