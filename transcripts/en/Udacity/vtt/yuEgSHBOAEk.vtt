00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is actually both the first and the third

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
are likely to be significantly greater than 1/2. The second is not.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Assuming the keys have as many 0s and 1s

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
as the good key rotor should be designed to have,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
this is likely to be equal to 1/2.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
There is no reason to expect it to be greater

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
than 1/2 any more likely than it'd be less than 1/2.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We're XORing two consecutive key bits.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The other two are different from 1/2.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is what gives us the opportunity and what gave Bletchley Park the insight

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
needed to break the cipher.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
For the third one, this followed from the structure of the machine.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
When the S wheels advance this probability is about 1/2,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but when they don't advance ΔS is always 0.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This means the probability that ΔS is 0 is significantly greater than 1/2.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It turns out for the structure of the Lorenz machine it's about 0.73.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
To know that you'd have to look in more detail at the structure of the M wheels

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to know how frequently the S wheels advance.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When they don't advance we know the result is 0.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
When they do advance about half the time the result will be 0.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Getting the first one right required a little more linguistic insight.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The reason this is greater than 1/2 depends on subsequent message letters.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
If adjacent letters in the message are the same,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that ensures that ΔM is equal to 0.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It turns out that this is a property that many languages have.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You can see that English has it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We have repeated letters here. We also have some repeated letters in "wheels."

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It's more like that you would expect by just the normal letter distribution

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
for subsequent letters to be identical.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It turns out that this is a property of German that about 3.3% of digraphs,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
meaning two adjacent letters are the same letter.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
That means the probability that the messages are equal--

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
well, they could be equal for lots of other reasons,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
but this bias is towards being more likely to be zero than non-zero.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It turns out that that's 0.61 probability for German.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Both of these are numbers that you didn't have enough information to guess on your own.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You would need to have a analysis of German text to know

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
that this is the probability here,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and you would need a lot more details on the M wheels to be able to get that.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Don't feel bad if you didn't get this quiz correct,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
although the structure of the machine should have been enough to guess

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
that this is greater than 1/2,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and if you're familiar with German

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
or could guess that it has properties similar to English,

00:02:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
you might have been able to get this one as well.
