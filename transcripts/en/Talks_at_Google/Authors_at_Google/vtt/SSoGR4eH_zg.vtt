MALE SPEAKER: Really great
to welcome Chris to Google.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.350
So this is Christopher Jones.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.060
And he is an assistant professor
in the school of Philosophical

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.440
and Religious Studies at
Arizona State University.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.860
He received his BA from
Stanford and his Ph.D.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.765
from the University
of Pennsylvania.

00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:21.560
He holds a
postdoctoral fellowship

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.170
at Harvard and UC Berkeley.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.590
I think it's really exciting
to welcome Chris today,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.740
because as Google gets
increasingly involved

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.720
in funding and providing
alternative energy resources,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.050
and thinking deeply about
web and energy access

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.240
across the world, it's
important to understand

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.630
the market for
these technologies

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.731
as well as the
complications that we face.

00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:41.230
It's equally important
to understand

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.860
the history of energy if you
consider that Americans have

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.470
not always desired
new sources of energy,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.500
but rather a lot of work has
gone into creating demand

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.290
and teaching people
how to harness power

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.740
from different energy sources.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.335
So without further ado, help
me welcome Chris to Google.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:00.650
CHRISTOPHER F. JONES:
Well thank you.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.640
I really appreciate
everyone making it here.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.110
I know with the
World Cup on, there's

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.700
a lot of other distractions.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.500
But it's an honor to be here.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.360
It's great to be
back in the Bay Area.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.660
I've lived here nine years of
my life at different times.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.530
And so for me the Bay Area
feels a bit like a second home,

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.220
even as I am adjusting to
the new world of Arizona.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.800
Never been a
Southwesterner before,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.670
but I've found that's
an enjoyable place

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.150
to live as well.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.570
So I'm going to talk
to you about the book

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.540
that I wrote that's pretty
newly off the shelves.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.120
Came out in April.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.470
And in the talk today
I'm going to give you

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.250
a little sense of
what's in the book.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.440
And I also want to pull
out some of the arguments.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.500
I know that probably not
everyone here is a historian.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.525
So rather than going into
some of the full stories

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:49.150
about the past, I
want to pull out some

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.770
of the lessons about
energy transitions--

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.900
the dynamics of them that
are relevant to today.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.400
And at the end
I'll link that past

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.580
to the present a little bit.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.204
And I presume in some
of your questions

00:01:59.204 --> 00:02:04.140
we'll have a chance to talk
about that topic in more depth.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.060
So with that being
said, the book in itself

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.480
is what I think of as
very much being an origin

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.510
story of the roots of American
fossil fuel dependence.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.360
And in the book, the
time period of it

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.410
covers the period
of 1820 to 1930.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.530
This is a period where there's
a rising use of coal, oil,

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.690
and electricity in America.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.960
And I study it in the
mid-Atlantic region,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.260
which I'll say a
little bit more about.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.380
And also a key
aspect of the book

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.640
is the focus on the transport
infrastructure system.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.190
So the name "Route
to Power," routes

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.030
is referring to the transport
infrastructure systems,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.220
but also trying to pun
on the idea of the roots

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.030
and origins of this story.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.640
So this is a story very much
with a geographic component,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.250
not a geographic
component that's

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.410
here, but is very much linked
to the Eastern seaboard

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.060
and the mid-Atlantic region.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.220
And the reason I'm situating
the study in the mid-Atlantic

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.640
is this is the first
place that Americans

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.080
began to use fossil
fuel energy intensively.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.690
It was in Pennsylvania,
New York, New Jersey,

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.645
that Americans first started
harnessing these technologies

00:03:10.645 --> 00:03:12.790
and using them in
different ways.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.290
And in many ways, the patterns
that were developed there

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.440
helped spread to the
rest of the nation.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.620
So if we want to grapple
with really how, when,

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.970
where, and why Americans began
to use fossil fuel energy,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.790
the mid-Atlantic is
the place to look.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.020
The second big aspect of
this book that I'm looking at

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.870
is arguing that energy transport
infrastructure systems have

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.780
been an under-appreciated
driver of energy transitions.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.900
So in the book, I'm looking at
things like coal canals, oil

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.550
pipelines, and electricity
transmission wires.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.530
Not what we always think of
as the most sexy or glamorous

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.820
technologies, but
I argue they've

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.330
actually had a really
significant influence

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.040
in shaping the timing and the
contours of different energy

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.900
transitions.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.525
And so I'm going to
tell you a bit more

00:03:59.525 --> 00:04:01.720
about these technologies--
how they were built,

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.090
and why they were important.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.910
Now in one sense, this is
a book about three energy

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.460
transitions-- coal,
oil, and electricity.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.680
But I'm arguing
these actually also

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.960
could be thought of as
part of one big shift--

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.040
a shift from the organic to
the mineral energy regime.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.959
And if we want to think
really big and broadly

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.570
about energy history
and what matters,

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.956
myself and a number of
other energy historians

00:04:27.956 --> 00:04:30.080
have distinguished between
what could be considered

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.330
an organic energy regime
before this period of my study

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.340
starting, and a mineral energy
regime happening afterwards.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.920
And why this is
important is it's

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.670
at one level, a story about
different energy sources,

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.090
but it's also a story about
different possibilities

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.740
for economic growth.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.950
And so an organic
energy regime refers

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.020
to a world in which
energy is captured

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.070
through flows of solar energy.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.500
It's mainly captured
actually through food.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.940
Throughout world
history, food has

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.380
been the single most
important source of energy.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.270
It's either been
what people have

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.090
eaten to power
their own muscles,

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.940
or it's been what
people have fed

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.060
to animals to use
that animal labor.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.870
A number of people have
done studies to look at,

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.860
in fact, how much
energy comes from food.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.250
And in most societies
throughout world history

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.380
spend 98% percent or more.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.120
Things like wind
power, or falling water

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.220
have provided only
small amounts.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.210
So in an organic
energy regime, food

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.790
is really important
to how you get energy.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.160
Well, how do you get food?

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.860
Well you need to
land to grow food.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.490
And so a consequence of
the organic energy regime

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.510
is that the amount of
land you have actually

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.140
limits the amount of energy
that you can possibly have.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.620
And in densely populated
worlds, this actually

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.750
starts to produce
finite limits to growth.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.720
The use of fossil
fuels is important

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.600
not simply because it's a
new type of energy source,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.390
but because they shift this
relationship between land

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.820
and energy.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.390
Fossil fuels provide
essentially free energy

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.930
that's separate of land.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.270
And it allows the start of ever
increasing patterns of growth.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.090
And so the rise of an
industrial economy, big cities,

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.470
I argue throughout the book
is actually intimately linked

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.100
to changing energy practices.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.630
So these aren't just sort
of what energy source

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.270
you put in your stove
or that you use.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.400
These are social
choices that affect

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.620
large patterns of development.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.300
And we can think
about this, but if you

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.770
want to think about
world history,

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.050
this is actually the second
great energy transition.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.600
The first and
arguably, but actually

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.210
the most important things humans
ever did was to start to farm.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.670
The Neolithic Revolution
starting about 10,000 years ago

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.940
and the start of
settled agriculture

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.130
was hugely important.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.670
Before that, humans mostly
did hunting and gathering.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.440
Once you start to
farm, you can get

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.080
a lot more energy
per unit of land.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.110
This means for the first
time, dense enough populations

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.030
to form city starts to happen.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.690
Once you get cities, you start
to see the rise of writing.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.460
You start to see the
rise of legal systems

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.620
and a whole host of
things that people broadly

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.660
consider civilization.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.550
So if we want to think
about the rise of sort

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.280
of human settlements
and what we think,

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.430
it's actually linked to
an energy revolution.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.210
This book is really
about the second of them.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.730
The shift then from
farming to fossil fuels

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.410
as the main energy source is a
dramatic expansion in the size

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.480
that cities reach, in the
types of industrial economies

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.379
that developed, and the sort of
patterns of growth that emerge.

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:34.920
So if you want to
think a really big,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.669
and I like to think really big.

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:38.460
Part of what's nice
about being a historian

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.820
is you can look at
big changes over time.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.280
What I'm looking at in
this book is the second

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.162
of this really big set
of energy revolutions.

00:07:47.162 --> 00:07:49.370
And part of the point of
looking at it this way again

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.980
is to see energy
not just as sort of,

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.000
do you go from wood to coal?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.580
But how do energy
changes affect society?

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.550
And for the US, this is
sort of very much the shift

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:04.070
from being a kind of mercantile
outpost in the global economy

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.440
at the beginning of the period
to the industrial center.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.410
So this is obviously
a big story.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.140
So what am I adding
to it in particular?

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.270
Well I'm providing
a lot of detail

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.420
and identifying
points of contingency

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.920
and what people
have often described

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.420
as this very broad and sort
of clear set of changes.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.780
And so I do things in the book.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.990
I start quantifying the
capacities and the limitations

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.050
of different types
of energy sources.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.740
And I look at the overlap of
these different energy regimes.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.039
So I think if you have time to
start delving into the book,

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.859
you'll see yes, there's
this big pattern,

00:08:39.859 --> 00:08:42.400
but there's also a lot of really
interesting detail about how

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.114
it gets there.

00:08:43.114 --> 00:08:44.530
Lot of detail that
I unfortunately

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.030
won't have time to cover today.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:50.030
But you'll have access to
the book to look at it later.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.050
So I'm kind of offering
a new explanation

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.430
of why this ended up happening.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.600
So that's a bit of an
overview about what's

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.830
in the book itself.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.470
Let me try and extract
a few of the points

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.610
now and talk to you about
dynamics of energy transitions.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.420
I'm going to do three points.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.030
One about why transport
matters, a second about building

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:14.870
demand, and a third about energy
transitions and inequality.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.160
So the first point, the
biggest point for my book,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.291
transport matters.

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:18.790
OK.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:19.290
Heard it.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.480
You can go home now.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.100
No.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.240
Let's go into this a
little more about why

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.710
it ends up that
transport matters.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.230
And it matters at a couple
of different levels.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.980
There's of course the
most obvious thing to say,

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.060
which is that transport systems
are needed to move energy

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.930
from point A to point B. And
this is a reality of geography.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:41.850
So here's a map.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.810
Here we're looking
a Pennsylvania here.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.960
And I look at three
different supplies of energy.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.900
So this is the
anthracite coal region.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.870
This was the first source
of fossil fuel Americans

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.590
used intensively.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.670
Oil started in
Pennsylvania as well.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:01.280
Edwin Drake in 1859 strikes oil
in Titusville, Pennsylvania.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.020
And before we end up with
Texas and California being

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.770
the big oil states is
actually Pennsylvania.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.750
And I also look at
hydroelectricity

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.170
along the lower
Susquehanna River.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.900
What's common in all
three of these examples

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.120
is where these energy sources
are not where people live.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.330
And if you look at pretty much
all the major sources of energy

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.570
that are used around
the globe today,

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:28.170
in most cases where energy is
found is not where people live.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:33.250
So we can certainly say there's
a kind of obvious but perhaps

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.060
banal point, which is
that getting this energy

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.860
requires some type of
infrastructure from point A

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.580
to point B. Here's the paths
of the various canals built

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.950
in eastern Pennsylvania
connecting these coal

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.270
fields to the eastern
seaboard, particularly

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.150
to New York City
and Philadelphia.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.810
And this type of infrastructure
was really necessary,

00:10:55.810 --> 00:11:00.080
because moving energy without
infrastructure advantages

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.000
is extremely cost prohibitive.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.290
So for example, here's one
of the historical documents

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:08.950
I found.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.550
And this is obviously too
much to parse right away.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.420
The big point of this chart
is people doing calculations

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.270
in 1821, showing that
moving coal over land

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.440
costs huge amounts of money,
but that building canals would

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.250
drop the cost enormously.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.260
And they actually even
found it is cheaper

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.540
to import coal 3,000 miles from
Britain before the building

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.750
of canals than it was to ship
it 100 miles over the land.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.330
And so one of the things
to remember about energy

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.180
is it's used in huge amounts.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.680
And if we're talking about
coal, oil, or electricity,

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.220
we're talking about a
very bulky or heavy--

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.070
and in the case of electricity--
very ephemeral substance,

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.190
that you can't just move
it in the quantities needed

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:55.880
to be necessary without
investing in infrastructure.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.410
OK.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.970
So at one level, I
think anyone would

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.450
agree you need
infrastructure to move it.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.570
I don't think that's
particularly innovative here.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.360
So let me say a little more
about why I think actually

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.510
transport systems have been even
more important than typically

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.450
understood.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.720
Well one factor is that building
these infrastructure systems

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.180
actually at the time turned
out to be as challenging and as

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:22.060
expensive as building this
sort of technology needed

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.670
to get coal out of the ground,
or oil out of the ground,

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.600
or build electric generators.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.860
Turns out these
are fairly complex

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.390
technologies, which under
the conditions of the time

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.510
were incredibly
difficult to build.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:38.270
This is sledding pipes for
the world's first pipeline

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.940
that was built in 1879.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.630
This involved huge
amounts of physical labor,

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:48.220
but also manufacturing
capacity to build the pipes,

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.290
and to test these,
and to make them work.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:54.640
So at one level, building
these infrastructures

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.200
was actually quite a broad and
difficult set of challenges

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.080
that people had to face.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.530
They also had very high costs.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.920
And this high cost to them--
I'm going to return to

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.400
in the next section-- is
actually really important.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.970
What happens is people
start to experience

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.190
some costs in infrastructure.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.270
And those people who
build these systems

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.090
realize that we can't
just build these systems

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.490
and expect demand to occur.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.600
We need to drive
demand so that we

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.120
use these systems at
their maximum capacity.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.510
They have heavy
financial incentives.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.970
So when we start
looking at who's

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.200
encouraging the use
of new energy sources,

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.690
we actually see that
it's often the directors

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.760
of these infrastructure
projects,

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.810
because they put up so much
money in investing them.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.761
What does end up
happening, as I show

00:13:43.761 --> 00:13:45.760
in each of the case studies
throughout the book,

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.710
is once these infrastructures
are put in place,

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.679
it facilitates an enormous
expansion of energy flows.

00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:54.970
And so this is my attempt--
you remember in high school

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.120
textbooks, when you
saw sort of battle maps

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.310
with armies moving
around by arrows?

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.480
This is my attempt to do
the same thing with coal.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.600
And these arrows are
weighted by the amount

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.717
of coal being shipped.

00:14:05.717 --> 00:14:07.300
The point is, once
these systems start

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.810
to get built, enormous
quantities of coal

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.940
start flowing along them,
and oil and electricity

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.470
in the same way, to create
a major transfer of energy

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.050
from one place to another.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:19.790
OK.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.290
So this is part of the reason
why transport matters, and I'm

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.920
going to get at
it a little more.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.090
I want to do this
also by linking it

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.890
to a second real key feature
of energy transitions.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.950
And of course, this morning
I made a terrible mistake

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.600
in doing this.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.510
And I wrote that
demand drives supply,

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.160
which is what we expect.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.000
And it's actually the
entire opposite of this.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.360
What I found in energy
studies in all of these cases

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.980
is that people found
it was actually

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.920
quite easy to produce coal,
oil, or electricity in amounts

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.930
greater than people
would buy them.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.310
And so it was actually the
having of large amounts

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.580
of energy that encouraged
a whole bunch of people

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.910
to start looking and
creating new markets.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.010
The idea of the gushing
oil well captures

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.730
this idea, that you
could look for oil,

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.840
suddenly find it
in huge amounts,

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.130
and you had no one to
actually sell it to.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.200
So why is this case?

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.380
Well part of it is that new
energy sources for consumers

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.470
were considered expensive,
unreliable, and hard to use.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.970
Right?

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.020
Remember, if we talk about
1820, the first time coal

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:26.920
starts to be used.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.610
Or 1859 when Drake
first discovered oil,

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.860
or when Thomas Edison
invented electric light bulbs.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.189
It's not that people hadn't
been heating their homes,

00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:37.980
or that they didn't
have light before this.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.500
They did.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.410
They had options.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.120
They used candles,
they used wood.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.366
They had options.

00:15:43.366 --> 00:15:45.990
And so they had to be convinced
that their current way of doing

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.950
things didn't make
sense anymore.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.800
This of course,
this conversation

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.340
about convincing
people who are used

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.000
to doing things one way
is something, I'm sure,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.680
is quite familiar in this room.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.720
Another key factor is
that most energy systems

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.330
require consumers
to make investments

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.681
in secondary
technologies to use them.

00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:07.180
Right?

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.600
So you don't use
electricity directly.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.530
You plug devices into the
wall to use electricity.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.640
If you want to use coal,
you need a stove to do it.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.155
If you want to use
oil-- and part of what

00:16:21.155 --> 00:16:22.850
I'm saying oil is
lighting-- is actually

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.610
the first several
decades of oil's main use

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.270
was actually for
illumination, not for power.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:32.380
The first major product
for petroleum with kerosene

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.970
as kerosene lamps,
not the motors

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:39.670
or the automobiles
that we think of today.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.750
A third factor in
making these hard to use

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.330
was that people had to
develop new techniques.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:49.130
Actually using a kerosene lamp
requires filling the lamp.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.740
It requires tending the wick.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.820
It requires sort of knowing
how much air to let in.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.770
When you clean it.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.840
When you don't.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.980
And so the whole
point of this is

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.140
that for people to adopt
new energy sources,

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.839
there were a lot of techniques
they had to go through.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:08.329
In some cases this was
made much more challenging

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:12.701
by the actual material
characteristics of the energy

00:17:12.701 --> 00:17:13.200
sources.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.160
So anthracite coal-- for people
who are not coal experts-- when

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.030
I say anthracite, coal is
divided into several categories

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.040
based on how much carbon it has.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.450
Anthracite coal has
lots of carbon in it.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:30.820
Bituminous less, semi-bituminous
even less, and lignite lower.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.130
When you hear people
talking about brown coal,

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:37.030
it's the lignite
or semi-bituminous.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.240
What matters about
anthracite is,

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.270
high carbon content means it
burns very hot, very clean.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.020
But it's hard to light.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.850
You can't just sort of throw it
on a fire and have it ignite.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.780
You actually have to arrange a
fire in a very particular way.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:56.600
And so this challenge leads
several early Americans

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.000
of many associated
with the coal companies

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.310
to actually start trying to
convince people and teach them

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.050
how to use it.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.940
So here, one of
the sources I found

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.380
was a directory for servants.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.920
This is like, telling people
how do you clean brass knobs?

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.070
How do you get stains out
of your master's nice shirt?

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.180
How do you maintain a house?

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.010
And one of the key
things they added

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:23.290
was a long section on
how to actually light

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.230
a fire using anthracite.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:28.330
And one of the
quotations from it

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.010
is that very few
servants at first

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.450
understand the method of
kindling and continuing

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.390
a fire of Lehigh coal.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:35.880
Many will never learn.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.070
And many more from
erroneous instructions,

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.620
whilst they think
they understand it,

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.899
make but a bungling
piece of work of it.

00:18:42.899 --> 00:18:43.690
Capturing the idea.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.220
This is lighting a fire,
which we kind of think

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.660
is a really easy thing, but
actually is more complex.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:54.879
And so one of the aspects
of energy transitions

00:18:54.879 --> 00:18:56.420
in the past that we
forget to look at

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.810
is how challenging it was
for some of these new sources

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.340
to get adopted.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.490
But as I mentioned
briefly before

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.780
in the section on
transport technologies,

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.430
those who invested huge amounts
of money in building systems

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:16.270
to move transport couldn't
let sluggish market demand

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:19.430
let their infrastructure
investments go to waste.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.360
So paraphrasing the
Field of Dreams idea

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.380
of "if you build it, they will
come," for these boosters,

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.720
that was not the case at all.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.270
It was, if you build it,
you must make them come.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:33.390
You must actively take
the effort to do it.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.460
So Josiah White was the pioneer
of one of the first canals.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.306
I call him a booster
extraordinaire,

00:19:39.306 --> 00:19:40.680
because he did
sort of everything

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.400
he could to encourage the
use of anthracite coal.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.540
And what he did kind of
symbolizes and stands

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.450
in for what lots of
other people did.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.790
So he would write testimonials
to newspapers about how good

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.670
anthracite coal was.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:58.300
He would give promising
samples to companies that said,

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:02.482
we'll try using coal in our
blacksmith shop, for example.

00:20:02.482 --> 00:20:04.940
And he said, alright, if you
will make an experiment of it,

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.060
I'll give you a
certain amount free.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.980
And if you like it, then
you'll come back for it.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:15.380
Early drug pusher model for the
adoption of new energy sources.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:20.310
He actually-- and it's kind
of hard to know exactly how

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.240
well this went over
at home-- but he

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.540
insisted that his wife keep a
fire burning with anthracite

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.000
at all times in their home,
so that people could come over

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.740
and actually see it.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.950
So it's steps like
this-- kind of humble,

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.990
seem like sort of
small things-- but are

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.160
part of what many,
many people at the time

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.060
were doing to overcome
these great challenges.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.260
We can see it in oil.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.340
We can see it in
electricity as well.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.460
Here's a 1922 advertisement
from the Westinghouse

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.040
Company about an electric stove.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.050
And here's a picture
of the stove.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.480
What's interesting is this
is a woman in her sort

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.860
of nice, upper middle
class home, is speaking.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.160
And she's talking about how she
has an invisible servant that

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.720
saves me money, time, and work.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.760
It's dependable, it's capable,
and it requires no supervision.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.290
And it makes cooking a pleasure.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:14.110
And it gives us better food
than we've ever had before.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.550
Note she's saying that
while her own servant is

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.220
in the background here,
who clearly does require

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.140
supervision, clearly is
not dependable or capable,

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.710
and is sort of
making this contrast.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:29.560
But the point would be,
one could find thousands

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.830
of advertisements from this
period of convincing people

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.650
not just that this
was functional,

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.610
but this was part
of modern life.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.290
It was part of what
it meant to be better.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:44.950
And so this combination of
pushing demand and the fact

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.890
that transport boosters
were often driving this

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:49.792
leads me to
introduce in the book

00:21:49.792 --> 00:21:51.250
an idea that runs
through it, which

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.540
is the idea of landscapes
of intensification.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.860
And this is kind of how I
pull this idea together.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.710
And what I'm really
interested in

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:02.240
is how over time, this set
of positive feedback loops

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.780
develops between the
start of the fact

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.010
that energy is found in
rural and remote areas,

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.280
the fact that building these
canals, pipelines, and wires

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.190
is very expensive,
linked to the fact

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:20.080
that demand has to be
created, helped drive the fact

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.940
that owners of transport
systems are therefore

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:27.140
incentivized to be big
boosters to drive energy,

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.260
over time we do
see that consumers

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.530
start to increase their demand.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:35.030
And then there's one more
really key step here,

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.370
which is the fact that
infrastructure operates

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.320
with economies of
scale, quite often.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.020
And so canals, pipelines,
and wires are built,

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.620
but then they are frequently
expanded, they're widened,

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.610
they're deepened.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:52.430
And they begin to be able to
carry greater amounts of energy

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.840
at lower per unit cost.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.960
And so these expansion
of transport networks

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.460
play an important
role, because they

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.830
end up lowering the
prices to consumers, which

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.370
helps further drive
demand, and sustain

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.920
the logic of energy transitions.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.650
And so this set of features
kind of rolling on themselves

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.140
is, I think, part of what
helps explain not just

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.850
why the energy transitions
begin, but why they keep going.

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:20.450
And so it essentially
becomes a set

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.730
of what we can think about as
synergistic feedback loops.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:27.710
So in 1820, when the
first canal is opened,

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:31.030
the estimates are, they
cost about $5 per ton.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:36.810
And the price of coal is about
$8.40 for a wholesale ton.

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.310
By 1825, a couple more
canals are opened.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.160
The per unit prices go down.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.460
By 10 years later, canals are
being widened and deepened.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.520
And by 1850, the canals
have much bigger capacity.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.030
This ends up lowering
the shipment cost.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.740
And these savings
are pretty much

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.250
entirely passed onto consumers,
so that the price of coal

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.760
is constantly getting
lower and lower.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.510
And at the same time,
this is driving really

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:06.620
a quite remarkable set of
increases in the amount of coal

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.240
that's being shipped, such that
by the outbreak of the Civil

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.180
War, already 8
million tons of coal

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.340
are being shipped in this area,
which is a huge increase even

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.890
from the decade
before, let alone

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.100
the period a few decades before.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:26.040
So thinking about the fact
that demand has to be created,

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.350
that transport boosters do it,
and that these systems help

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:31.140
sustain this loop,
is why I think

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:35.200
about this idea of
landscapes of intensification

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.460
and how transport
starts to matter

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.660
at perhaps a less
initially obvious level.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.290
OK.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.590
A third point that
I want to bring up

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:47.630
is that energy transitions
tend to be unequal as well.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:51.500
And I'll give you a
couple examples of this,

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.897
and particularly how
transport systems shape this.

00:24:54.897 --> 00:24:57.230
And part of the reason I'll
mention this a little later,

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.610
there's an obviously
a great need

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.720
to push energy transitions
to renewable alternatives

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.550
in this country and
across the world.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:09.220
But as I'll show, there are
design decisions and choices

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.000
that affect who benefits
from this and who does not.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.420
And I think that though it's
important to act quickly,

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.990
we can also think about
questions of equality

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:19.760
to make it a more
egalitarian transition that

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.490
will benefit more people.

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:25.950
So here's a chart of how
many people have access

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.550
to electricity in 1933.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.470
And we can see
actually the US is

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:33.290
way below many of the
European nations in terms

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:36.330
of the percentage of the
population with access,

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.110
under 70%.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.460
So at one level, we can just
see throughout the history

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.780
of energy transition,
some people get access

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.650
to the cheap energy,
and some people do not.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.300
And I think this is probably
a familiar conversation here,

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.310
thinking about where globally
do people have access

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:55.790
to different types of internet
services, different types

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.530
of wireless networks, et cetera.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:01.550
A similar dynamic
is going on here.

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:04.570
There's also ways in which
transport infrastructure shapes

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:05.810
this very directly.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:08.050
And one of the things I
talk about in the book

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:10.660
is that the production
of energy very often

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.300
comes at tremendous
environmental cost.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.990
So this is 10 years
after the oil boom

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.950
starts in western Pennsylvania.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:21.430
And as a sort of symbol of
what the deforestation, mud

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:25.800
and derrick-filled
areas look like.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.970
What is significant,
I think, about this

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:34.840
is the fact that the consumers
of oil are not living here.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.680
So there is great
environmental harm,

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.090
but not at the places where
consumers end up living.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.910
And part of what's going
on, I'm arguing in the book,

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.030
is that the building
of transport systems

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:48.120
creates a physical
dissociation between those

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.870
who produce energy
and have to live

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.470
with the cost of
that production,

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.780
and those consumers who
use it and benefit from it.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.250
And there are, of
course, a wide range

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.205
of reasons we could think
about for why Americans

00:27:01.205 --> 00:27:02.580
throughout their
history have not

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.660
argued for strong
environmental laws

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.190
to protect areas where
energy is produced.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:08.840
But one thing I
want to argue is we

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.010
need to keep in mind
the fact that there

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:13.990
was very little incentive for
the people who are actually

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:17.760
using energy during this period
to demand the types of changes

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.260
that would protect these areas.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:21.640
And it's similar today.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.400
I mean, the eastern seaboard
gets plenty of its coal power

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.420
from coal mines
in West Virginia,

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.040
but people in Manhattan
aren't dealing

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.450
with mountaintop removal.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.300
And similarly, you
can find stories

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.130
very much in our own
current era where

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.960
energy is produced separately
from where it's used.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.600
It means that environmental
harms are concentrated

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.700
in places where users
are not located.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.750
There also are
material differences

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:55.580
in transport infrastructure
systems that help explain this.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.426
And so one of the features
of a canal-- and by the way,

00:27:58.426 --> 00:28:00.050
I should say, some
people get confused.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.670
A coal canal is not separate
from a regular canal.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.520
I should say, it's a
canal designed primarily

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.690
built to carry coal.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:10.220
And I refer to these as coal
canals, because over 80%

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.730
of their traffic was coal.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:17.180
But basically, canals are
sophisticated technologies,

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.000
but largely you can think about
them as big ditches or rivers

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.700
that you can go up and down.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.960
And there's no technological
obstacle to drawing off points

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.870
in between the sort of start
and the end of a canal.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.230
And one of the things we
see that happens in the coal

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.460
regions is actually
between where

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.530
coal is mined in
Philadelphia and New York

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.130
at the end of the
canals, there's

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:42.040
actually quite substantial
industrial buildup

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.440
along the canals.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.810
Lot of towns along them benefit,
develop quite profitable

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:50.510
industries, and the distribution
of benefits gets spread out.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:52.810
And this is partially
because on a canal,

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:56.740
you can pull over a boat at
any point and deliver coal.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.060
Pipelines-- and here's a picture
of a pipeline over here--

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:04.070
did not actually have places
where oil could be drawn off

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:06.240
in between the point
where it started

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.200
and the point where it ends.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.870
So if you live next
to a pipeline, that

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:13.160
didn't mean you're getting
cheaper access to oil,

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.490
it simply meant if the pipeline
burst-- and pipelines did

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:18.880
burst-- that your
property would be damaged,

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.330
but it wasn't going to give
you cheaper access to oil.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:28.750
So there can be very
specific design features

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:32.170
that shape whether
more people benefit.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.345
So now you may say,
alright, renewable energy.

00:29:34.345 --> 00:29:36.720
We're talking about electricity
transmission lines maybe.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.750
And electricity
transmission lines

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:42.400
can send energy multiple
places, but they

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.400
need transforming stations
to step power up and down.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.970
And often these transformers
are quite expensive.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:54.480
So if say, we build a giant wind
farm in the Great Plain area,

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.030
it's not guaranteed that
towns nearby will actually

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:59.770
get that energy, unless
some of the design decisions

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:01.520
are made to make that happen.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.630
So transport
systems can not only

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:06.890
shape where and when these
energy transitions happen,

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:13.270
but can also augment who
ends up benefiting from them.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.430
Alright.

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.400
I started doing
this a little bit

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.230
linking the past and
present in my talk,

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:22.020
but let me just mention three
quick points about this.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.870
And I imagine in our discussion,
we'll talk about it more.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:27.850
So one point in this study
for the present is, of course,

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:30.140
transport infrastructure
for renewable energy

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.820
would be a good idea.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.560
As many people note,
the places where

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.850
the sun shines the brightest--
and that's what this map is--

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.560
are not always the places
where population ends up

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.030
being clustered.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:44.180
And the same thing is certainly
true for where the wind ends up

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.210
blowing the hardest.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:50.630
That these are not the locations
where people end up living.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:54.160
So if we want to expand
renewable energy production,

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.020
some level of new
transmission infrastructure

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:01.000
will be necessary, and it's
important to think about.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.920
Google actually
has been involved

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.510
in a potentially
interesting project.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:06.975
I don't know who's heard
about the Atlantic--

00:31:06.975 --> 00:31:07.850
have you heard of it?

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:09.641
Who's heard of the
Atlantic Wind Connection

00:31:09.641 --> 00:31:11.000
that Google's involved in?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.500
OK.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.440
Only a couple people.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.850
Google is actually one
of the major sponsors

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:17.330
of this the idea
of a major-- this

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:24.540
is the Eastern seaboard between
Virginia and New Jersey.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:28.250
And Google, it's
proposed Google's got

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.980
about a 37% stake in the
project with a couple

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:35.360
other partners, a $5 billion
offshore transmission

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.670
line that would have
put offshore wind farms

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.570
and transmit this power
on the Eastern seaboard.

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:43.430
So that's actually an
interesting project

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:46.050
that hopefully will go through.

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.610
But some new types of
infrastructure like this

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:52.450
are absolutely going
to be necessary.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:55.620
A second point that I
look at is to realize

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.120
that energy transitions
take decades,

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.320
and they require boosters,
and they particularly

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.400
require boosters to be patient.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.070
So a couple lessons, I would
say, for renewable energy

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:08.320
advocates are first--
we need to remember

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.990
that these transitions require
active efforts to build demand,

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:15.050
to work with consumers, to
solve technical problems,

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:17.150
to promote alternative fuels.

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:20.360
And partly what I'm trying
to do in the book is also,

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.636
some people say, well if
renewable energy requires

00:32:24.636 --> 00:32:26.010
people to be
convinced, then it's

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.650
simply not as good as
coal, oil, and electricity.

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:29.540
And I would say no.

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.740
In fact, in their early stages,
coal, oil, and electricity

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.790
needed this absolutely as much.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:37.980
So the fact that for
renewable energy projects

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.580
this is necessary,
shouldn't be a surprise.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.210
I think it's also important
to set realistic expectations

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.830
for timelines.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.160
These transitions take decades.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.750
And in this sense it's a very
non-Silicon Valley project.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:50.250
Right?

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:54.340
This is not a place where
transitions and scales

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:57.430
of decades are often discussed.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:59.710
But I would argue the
computer industry is often

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:04.030
a bad analogy for the patterns
of energy transitions,

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:10.700
because disruption can happen,
but on a longer time scale.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.440
And so there's also a
really important aspect

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.370
of pursuing long term
strategies in this

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:20.740
that I think a look at
historical energy transitions

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:21.610
provides.

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:24.380
And part of why I mention this
is that at different times,

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.474
there's been huge hope
that renewables are just

00:33:26.474 --> 00:33:28.890
around the corner, or are about
to make that breakthrough.

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:30.556
And when they don't
seem to immediately,

00:33:30.556 --> 00:33:32.200
people get really discouraged.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.120
But if you look at
the history of energy,

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:39.110
you can find similar patterns
of delay with the fossil fuels.

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:42.150
And so it's not necessarily
that they are that incredibly

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:44.960
different in this capacity.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.960
And the final point I'll
mention is to just pay attention

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.790
to questions of equality.

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:51.680
And one way we can
do this is, again,

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.710
thinking about whether
production and consumption

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.660
happen in different places.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.120
So now, as I said
at the beginning,

00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.240
I've moved to Arizona.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.310
We have lots of deserts.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:02.830
There are plenty of
proposals to just cover them

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:05.690
all over with
different solar panels.

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:09.960
Here's an installation
in the Mojave Desert.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.650
It turns out deserts aren't
completely empty places.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.332
There are species
that live there.

00:34:14.332 --> 00:34:15.790
There are people
who live there who

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.360
find these landscapes
to be valuable.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.030
And one could make a
cost-benefit analysis

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:23.370
to say that the benefits
of the renewable energy

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.940
are really high, but what
this does is actually

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.739
risk recreating some of
the patterns of inequality

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:32.670
from older transport
infrastructure systems,

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.550
where those who live
where energy is produced

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:38.080
pay the costs, while those
who benefit live elsewhere.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.770
And a lot of people will
say, hey, why should we

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:44.540
cover over the Arizona
desert so that people in LA

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.880
can have air conditioning?

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.380
Right?

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:49.210
Shouldn't people in
LA be experiencing

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:51.760
some of the cost of
that energy production

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.940
and not just shifting
it on to other people?

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.030
And so this suggests to
me that actually there

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:00.190
are different models of
solar energy production.

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:02.530
There are the
utility scale farms.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:04.230
But there's also
a lot of potential

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.530
for rooftops or for
commercial solar development.

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:09.760
And there certainly is
an equality argument

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.860
to be made to say,
we should at least

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.190
be using rooftops
in urban areas where

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:17.340
this is being used before
moving on to deserts.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.660
I mean, maybe all of
LA gets plastered,

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.500
and we still need more energy.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.890
Then maybe there's
reasonable discussions

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:28.000
to be had about what areas
should be used to produce this.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.220
But until those types
of steps happen,

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:33.460
it's actually worth thinking
about why other regions should

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.480
be having their
landscapes transformed

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.550
to suit the benefits
of distance consumers.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.090
So these are some thoughts
on energy transitions

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:43.900
past and present.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.400
I appreciate you
being here, and I'm

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.983
happy to take some
questions about it.

00:35:52.166 --> 00:35:53.040
AUDIENCE: A question.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.410
Historically, was it
the same companies

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:59.930
who were doing production
and transport of the energy?

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:02.800
And how do you think that will
work with renewable energy?

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.300
CHRISTOPHER F.
JONES: Good question.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.640
So it depends on the industry
actually, and it's not similar

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.710
in this capacity.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:13.170
So in coal, different
companies mined.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.560
And then different
companies shipped.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.290
And then even different
companies sold.

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:21.100
So it was a different
division structure.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:27.080
In oil, different companies
transported from drilled--

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.300
and actually what
I didn't get into,

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.860
but this goes into
the book-- transport,

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:36.760
and these are the early
pipelines in 1884.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.800
These are mostly pipelines
built by John D. Rockefeller.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.610
And they are crucial to his
monopoly over the oil industry

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:45.400
at this time.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.100
So oil is first found in 1859.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.890
By 1879, John D.
Rockefeller controls

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:53.700
90% of the American
oil industry.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.320
He achieves this monopoly
position despite the fact

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.800
that his company
does not produce oil.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.580
What it does is it refines
the oil from crude oil

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:05.390
into the kerosene that
people are buying.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:08.460
And that's how he controls
how much gets to market.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.630
He also ends up
building pipelines

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:12.930
to control the
transport of it as well,

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.440
and control it at that stage.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.560
But he does not
vertically integrate.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:22.440
He does not choose to actually
own the production of oil

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.360
until a much later period.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.650
And then he never had
the same level of control

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:28.820
as he ends up doing.

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:33.340
In the case of electricity
that I'm looking at,

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.970
it usually is the case that
the same company ends up

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:37.240
owning the production.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:40.990
So actually there's shifts
between the industries

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.780
in terms of that dynamic.

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:47.700
I do know today,
there are companies

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:50.240
pursuing transmission
wires that are

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.870
separate from owning the
energy production facilities.

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:57.660
And so the two are not
necessarily always linked.

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.160
AUDIENCE: This isn't
energy exactly,

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.510
but as you're
going through this,

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:02.635
and as I was reading the
introduction to your book,

00:38:02.635 --> 00:38:04.790
it seemed there are an
awful lot of parallels

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:08.220
between the flow of energy
and the flow of communication,

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.790
because we have the
telegraph, and there

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:14.710
are more efficient methods of
communication than the internet

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:15.210
now.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:17.500
Do you have any comment
to make on that?

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.765
And I'd be interested to hear.

00:38:19.765 --> 00:38:21.640
CHRISTOPHER F. JONES:
They are a great topic.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.420
And in fact, when I began
this project-- I don't even

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.220
want to admit how
long ago it was-- I

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.600
was thinking about
technological transitions

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.830
is what I wanted to study.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:32.670
And the two topics that
stood out to me most

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.760
were these energy
transitions, but also

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.430
the communication
technology angle

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:41.580
of things, where you
can look at telegraph,

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:46.770
radio, telephone, other
types of networks going on.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:51.460
So I think there absolutely
are some parallel stories here.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:58.340
I would say, you
end up probably even

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.050
in some senses with a
little more monopoly, even

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:03.610
in the communication
infrastructure

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:07.410
sometimes than you do, even
with the energy infrastructures

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:09.990
that you have here.

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:16.050
But you also get similar
historical moments

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:18.020
that a lot of this
development occurs.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.270
The communication
sometimes proceeds

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:24.340
some of these technologies,
but telegraph is very linked

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.620
to the spread of the
railroad as well.

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:33.030
So in short, I guess I would
say you could definitely

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.360
make some really interesting
parallels, certainly

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.030
about the role of
infrastructure in it.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:41.100
And I think you would absolutely
find a lot of overlap.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:45.620
The industry conditions do end
up being a point of difference,

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:49.032
though, that I would
end up seeing on that.

00:39:49.032 --> 00:39:49.740
So good question.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.410
I'll think for a minute
whether I have something

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:52.890
more for you in just a second.

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.560
I'll move to the next perhaps.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.977
AUDIENCE: I didn't hear any
mention of government in this.

00:39:56.977 --> 00:39:58.059
CHRISTOPHER F. JONES: Yes.

00:39:58.059 --> 00:40:00.410
AUDIENCE: And specifically,
I'm thinking of my parents

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:03.280
growing up in the Midwest
before the Rural Electric

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.980
Administration.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.510
Could you talk about
government's role

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:10.910
and how you see that in
the past and going forward?

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:13.710
CHRISTOPHER F. JONES: There's a
really important shifting role

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:17.220
of government in this story
throughout the time period.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.625
And it affects each of these
stories in different ways.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.130
The Rural Electrification
Administration

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:28.280
becomes remarkably
important for spreading

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.260
American electrification
much further.

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:34.420
This happens in 1935, a
little after my story ends.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:38.090
It turns out state government is
more important to these stories

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:40.130
often than federal
government at the time.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:42.200
The spread of the
federal government

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.290
as having the policies
that influence

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:47.200
industrial development
really starts

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.550
to come more in the 20th century
than it does in the 19th.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:55.604
So what I argue is
that the state ends up

00:40:55.604 --> 00:40:57.520
playing a really important
role in structuring

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.530
what can be done.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:02.550
So what do state governments
do that make a difference?

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:04.547
Well, a., they give
corporate privileges.

00:41:04.547 --> 00:41:06.880
And this is something we don't
really think about today.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.230
If you want to start
a company, and you

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:11.400
want a corporate charter,
you fill out a few forms.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.650
You send a check somewhere.

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:14.110
And you get a corporate charter.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:16.510
In the 19th century,
every corporate charter

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.460
was voted on by the
state legislature

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.430
to determine if that corporate
charter would be given.

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:24.800
So in order to even get the
type of corporate charter

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.758
that would help you raise
the money to do this,

00:41:26.758 --> 00:41:30.380
you actually needed the
buy in of the state.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:32.700
There were several times
that states either did

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.370
or did not tax energy,
and that influenced

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:37.340
the rate of growth of it.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.640
Often, the States were
partners in helping

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.240
to drive energy demands.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:45.820
So Pennsylvania for
example, in response

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:49.340
to people advocating for how the
state could help these energy

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.980
industries, they gave
special corporate charters

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:56.070
to companies that would
make iron using the coal.

00:41:56.070 --> 00:42:01.150
And so they made it easier for
certain groups to play out.

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:04.610
This map of pipelines looks
this way a little bit.

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:06.756
The first pipeline here,
the Tidewater Pipeline

00:42:06.756 --> 00:42:08.630
was the world's first
long distance pipeline.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:10.520
It was not built by Rockefeller.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.340
It was built by a group of
independent oilmen hoping

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.470
to overturn his monopoly.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.280
They had tried and failed--
because Rockefeller

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.527
had a lot of control
in the government--

00:42:21.527 --> 00:42:23.360
to get what was called
a Free Pipeline bill.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.530
A bill that would give pipeline
companies eminent domain.

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:27.220
It never passed.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.970
What you don't see in
the map is that this

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.630
is going through the
Allegheny Mountains.

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:33.440
It's that area where
I showed the earlier

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.070
slide of people
slugging pipelines.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:38.070
They basically could
buy land breaks there,

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:39.930
because there wasn't much there.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:42.860
But no one else could obtain
those same land rights.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.210
So the reason why
Rockefeller was

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:46.860
able to build all
the other pipelines

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.160
was because he was
able to get laws

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.490
that helped him and not others.

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:57.540
So there's not one story of
how the states influenced

00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:58.690
these developments.

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:01.270
But I think of it in general,
the state was absolutely

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:04.480
setting the terms
of the development,

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.230
helping these things
in certain ways,

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:09.220
hindering these
efforts in other ways,

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:11.680
benefiting certain
groups and not others.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.530
But it generally was at
a state government level

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:16.860
during this time.

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.140
It was almost always on a
fairly ad hoc basis, not

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:23.620
part of any long
plan, but responding

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:28.020
to what seemed like crises
in any given moment.

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.090
So state plays a
very important role,

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:31.970
but one that is
hard to summarize,

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:35.080
because it showed up
in each of these cases

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.960
in quite different ways.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.550
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the booster approach,

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:42.020
and in the past, you
said that what was really

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:44.340
needed to catalyze the use
of these types of fuels

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.700
were the boosters.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.017
But back then there wasn't
this cost challenge,

00:43:48.017 --> 00:43:49.100
because it was affordable.

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.230
You just needed the
behavioral shift for people

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.950
to use that type of fuel.

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:55.760
In our age, where
renewable energy--

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.670
the barrier is the cost.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:59.600
What do the boosters
need to do-- things like,

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.610
I as a consumer
can't say, I only

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:04.670
want to fuel my house
based on renewable energy.

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:06.770
I don't want coal-fired
power plants.

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:10.710
What do the boosters need
to do to inspire shifts now?

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:12.710
CHRISTOPHER F. JONES:
Well one thing I would say

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:17.030
is, we shouldn't quite
overstate how amazing the cost

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.710
advantage was.

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:19.400
It wasn't always right
at the beginning.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.550
Part of the point
of-- it did eventually

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:25.800
become a significant
cost advantage--

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.990
but part of that required
paying off the infrastructure,

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:31.500
building enough so that you
got the economies of scale.

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:35.210
So one thing we should realize
is right away at the sort

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:39.590
original historical moment, it
wasn't absolutely overwhelming.

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:43.075
And also what partly was
another cost thing people had

00:44:43.075 --> 00:44:44.950
to overcome was people
had to actually invest

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:47.260
in a secondary technology.

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.770
So one thing I
would just say is,

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:53.540
let's not say that they had
on overwhelming cost advantage

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.420
from the very
beginning that makes

00:44:55.420 --> 00:45:00.360
it so different from
what's going on today.

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.160
What arguably was
actually the biggest thing

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.380
was unfamiliarity
with the technology.

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:06.470
How do you use it?

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:07.460
Do you trust it?

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:08.330
Is it safe?

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:09.394
Is it reliable?

00:45:09.394 --> 00:45:10.810
And this is actually
what you hear

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:12.580
about people with solar panels.

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.009
Like, is it going to
be reliable on my roof?

00:45:15.009 --> 00:45:16.550
If I put it on my
roof, is that gonna

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:18.040
give me roof problems
that do this.

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.630
Is the system going to crash?

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:23.450
You can find stories of
people putting in their solar,

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:25.170
it doesn't work as they expect.

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:27.324
And that turns off other people.

00:45:27.324 --> 00:45:28.740
And so I would
actually say, there

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:32.720
is the-- I mean it very much
is a consumer behavior story--

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.110
but a lot of this
is unglamorous work.

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:39.010
We remember names
from the oil industry

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:40.890
like John D. Rockefeller.

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:44.700
We don't know the names of the
people who went door to door

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.950
and showed people how
to use a kerosene lamp.

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:50.720
But this actually was
part of what happened.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.840
So I'd say one thing would
be to sort of celebrate

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.670
a little of the
mundane work of it.

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:58.700
That it's not simply Elon Musk,
whose technological insight

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:00.150
is going to transform this.

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.400
But it's actually going to
be some of those people who

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.320
are going door to
door convincing people

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.830
to make this happen.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:08.704
So that's a little bit
of a thought on it.

00:46:08.704 --> 00:46:10.620
AUDIENCE: With the
boosters that went into it,

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:13.772
it seems like there was a lot
of build up with companies that

00:46:13.772 --> 00:46:15.480
were providing these
services and things,

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.150
to build up marketing
departments,

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.760
or PR customer service branches.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.730
Did you see in
your research a lot

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:23.920
of the growth of that
in industry as well?

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:27.520
And was it happening sort
of alongside these changes?

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.020
CHRISTOPHER F.
JONES: Good question.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:29.520
Yeah.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.400
There is growth in
how this happens.

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.200
And it depends on
industry structure,

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.300
sort of back to the
earlier question.

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:40.960
So coal was sold by marketing
companies sometimes.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.670
And what advertising
looked like in that day

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:47.100
was actually often
a little newspaper.

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.990
Not the sort of things
we would consider

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:53.010
to be very sophisticated
or sexy advertisements,

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:56.570
but were actually how word
got around about this.

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:58.720
But there were also
demonstrations.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.600
Another aspect of this
is different parts

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.590
of society not associated with
the industry sometimes got

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:08.500
involved as well, because
they were boosters

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.770
for the state of Pennsylvania.

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:12.230
So in Philadelphia,
the Franklin Institute

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:15.990
was a group of mechanics,
scientists, artisans,

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:19.050
and they would actually do
experiments to figure out

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:20.980
the optimal way to
burn anthracite.

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:24.110
Or how to burn anthracite
in this different area.

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:26.036
And they were doing
this-- some of them

00:47:26.036 --> 00:47:27.660
were involved with
the coal companies--

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.890
but there actually was
a sort of civic minded,

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:33.060
if we can make
anthracite work, we're

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:37.360
going to be doing a good thing
for our state and our country's

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.220
development.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.272
So in this early
stage, actually, you

00:47:40.272 --> 00:47:41.980
do get a little bit
of corporate buildup.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.130
You actually have
other people ending up

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:45.910
being involved with it.

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:49.360
But certainly part of the
huge Standard Oil success

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.600
is marketing, a great
attention to building out

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.590
their marketing.

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:57.290
To some of the early
really careful gathering

00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:58.240
of statistics.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.940
So Standard Oil's one
the first companies

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:04.110
to create a real
statistical department

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:05.860
in the late 19th century.

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:08.590
And they start calculating
how much is being used.

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:11.680
How much market share
does our competitors have?

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.380
What's the price point
at which we can get this?

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:17.530
So one of the very early
companies to do this

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:19.000
is Standard Oil.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.900
The electric utilities
are where you really

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.950
see the start of what we would
consider more the modern PR.

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:25.610
Both with the
advertisements that they

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:28.840
do, the customer service areas.

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.560
One of the utilities that I
look at in Baltimore- they

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.610
open stores where they
demonstrate all the appliances

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:37.380
and how they
actually use things.

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.859
And these stores
are partially places

00:48:39.859 --> 00:48:41.400
where you can buy
things, but they're

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:44.910
very much places where you
can learn how to actually use

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:47.630
these new devices and see
them for the first time.

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:53.500
AUDIENCE: The graph on
electricity coverage in 1933

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:54.820
was intriguing.

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:56.730
With some western
European countries

00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:02.460
being 100%, what was
the role of government,

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:04.580
cohesiveness society,
size of the country,

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:08.210
why the huge change between
Denmark and Austria,

00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:10.449
for example?

00:49:10.449 --> 00:49:11.990
CHRISTOPHER F. JONES:
Policy matters.

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:14.870
It's a big aspect of this.

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:18.160
So in the early years
of electrification,

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.921
much more so than
we see right now,

00:49:19.921 --> 00:49:21.670
there was a huge
question as to whether it

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:24.890
was going to be public or
private managed utilities.

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:27.170
And even within the
US, lots of towns

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:30.630
have their own municipal
electric works.

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:33.960
And if you were
standing at 1910,

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:38.180
1915, it wasn't clear which
the direction was going to go.

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.300
Even more so in Europe.

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:43.420
So there's a lot more
publicly owned power

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:46.780
where both as sort
of policies, they

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:49.390
were required to serve
people, but there's also

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:53.040
sort of a democratically
accountable process for how

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.650
electrification
was going to go in.

00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:58.040
That they are simply not
with a private utility.

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:01.980
Obviously geography
matters a bit here.

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.790
Canada's right next to the US.

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:05.860
And people did point
out it's harder

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:10.650
to wire a sort of geographically
dispersed country.

00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:14.550
But as you know, within
concentrated countries

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:16.660
in Europe, there's
a big difference.

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.660
And so it's a
combination of policy,

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:25.400
and was it public or private
ownership of the plants

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:29.380
themselves which fed back into
the policies that governed it.

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:31.230
MALE SPEAKER: So thanks
so much for coming.

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:32.970
CHRISTOPHER F. JONES: Thank you.
