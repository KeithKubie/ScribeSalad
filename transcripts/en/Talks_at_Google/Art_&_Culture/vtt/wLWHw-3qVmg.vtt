[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.270
IMOGEN HEAP: Hi, guys, very
nice to be here on the stage,

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.190
happy to share whatever
you want to ask me,

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.800
and I actually spent a bit of
time up in the creative labs

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.850
one day and just saw
some amazing things.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.850
So if it's anyone in here
that I might have met,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.353
hello again because I saw
lots of kind of music,

00:00:22.353 --> 00:00:24.020
cool little music
apps they were making.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.080
And yeah, it was good.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.970
BEN ARTHUR: Nice.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.190
So folks here in the
audience might know you

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.590
from songs that were licensed
for the "OC," or Zach Braff's

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.890
"Garden State," or your
collaborations with Taylor

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.570
Swift, or Ariana
Grande, or they might

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.860
know about your performative
technology endeavor

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.830
in the Mi.Mu gloves.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.800
They might have heard
about Creative Passport.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.720
They might also have heard about
you doing the "Harry Potter

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.670
Cursed Child" soundtrack.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.560
All of these things
are out there

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.550
in the world, which seems
breathtaking in their scope.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.150
How do you think about yourself
when you introduce yourself

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.031
at the allegorical party?

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:05.239
How do you consider yourself?

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.575
What's your identity?

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:07.700
IMOGEN HEAP: I don't know.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.040
I just say, I enjoy
anything that kind of

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.440
is around the intersection
of music and tech.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.445
That's what I say.

00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:17.820
I don't go, like,
I'm a musician.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.530
I'm a producer.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.930
I'm a performer.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.520
I'm an engineer.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.728
Hello, I've won some Grammys.

00:01:20.728 --> 00:01:22.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.140
I just go, I'm into
music and tech.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.640
BEN ARTHUR: I'm
into music and tech.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.840
OK.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.290
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah,
that's what I say.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.920
BEN ARTHUR: So there's the
big umbrella that you--

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.030
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.988
BEN ARTHUR: --consider.

00:01:29.988 --> 00:01:32.270
One of the things that
I've heard you reference

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.230
a couple of times, and it
seems almost contradictory

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.820
to my image of you,
is only do what

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.530
you can see in the headlights.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.240
Can you talk about
what that means to you?

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.230
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah,
I would love to.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.500
Before the days of
Google search engine,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.090
we had a thing called Yahoo.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.180
And one day, I was in the
studio, and I was making--

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.062
BEN ARTHUR: We'll
bleep that out.

00:01:58.062 --> 00:01:58.770
IMOGEN HEAP: Why?

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.800
It is a nice story.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.920
And so I was there, kind
of going round and round

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.750
in circles trying
to finish this song.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.000
So I am in my studio.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.450
That's the first time
I recorded a studio--

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.080
recorded an album on my own, so
I was in the studio constantly,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.417
all by myself, for a year, and
so it does send you a bit mad.

00:02:18.417 --> 00:02:20.750
And because I didn't have an
A and R man, or anyone that

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.687
would come in and go,
oh, that's really good,

00:02:22.687 --> 00:02:24.520
or oh, you should turn
some more cowbell up,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.430
or whatever they say, I
was going round and round.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.890
And so I couldn't
finish his song,

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.340
so I went onto
the search engine,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.420
and I just said, how
do you write songs?

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.430
And I found this article
about this writer, novelist,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.170
who had written
this little blog,

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.320
and it said in it, only do what
you can see in the headlights.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.470
And what she meant
was, if in the song

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.140
you can see that there's a
hi-hat that needs fixing,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.270
or you're trying
to finish a lyric,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.620
and you can see the colors of
his eyes, then just do that.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.430
Just write that bit, and
just keep chipping away.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.970
And eventually, you will see
the full path ahead of you,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.790
and you'll see
all the landscape.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.510
But it's that kind, oh,
I've got so much to do.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.550
I've got so much to do,
and it's overwhelming,

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.150
and you can't breathe, and
then you just remember, well,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.410
do what you can see now.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.500
Just do that.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.470
Don't see, don't do all
that complicated stuff

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.270
that's far away.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.020
You know you have to
get to it eventually,

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.993
but you can't see it just
yet, so just do that.

00:03:25.993 --> 00:03:26.910
So that's what I mean.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.870
Yeah, and I use that a
lot in everything from,

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.030
like, how do I
look after my child

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.525
this morning when I've got
to get to this interview,

00:03:34.525 --> 00:03:35.150
and I've got--?

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.525
You know, I just
say, do what you

00:03:36.525 --> 00:03:39.400
see in the headlights, which
is make sure she has breakfast,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.300
and that's just, yeah,
it seems to be how I--

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.820
BEN ARTHUR: You are
supposed to feed them.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.770
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah, I hear--

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:44.345
BEN ARTHUR: I'm a father--

00:03:44.345 --> 00:03:44.600
IMOGEN HEAP: I do hear that.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.140
BEN ARTHUR: --so I know.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.160
IMOGEN HEAP: For six
months, I didn't feed her.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.000
BEN ARTHUR: Every meal--

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.515
you're not allowed
to skip even one.

00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:48.710
IMOGEN HEAP: No.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.980
No, it's true.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.970
BEN ARTHUR: It's
very strict rules.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.020
So one of the many things
that you've juggled

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.170
is the "Harry Potter
Cursed Child" soundtrack.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.610
We're going to see a quick video
introducing that album, which

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.570
has just been released.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.554
[MUSIC - IMOGEN HEAP, "GODRIC'S
 HOLLOW"]

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.910
IMOGEN HEAP: That is a bit of
the play, which is on Broadway,

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.590
which is wonderful.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.960
Yeah, for about four years
ago, I got a call from a friend

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.900
called Steven Hoggett, who
is a movement director,

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.830
and he used to have this group
called The Frantic Assembly.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.203
And when I released--
well, just after I released

00:05:05.203 --> 00:05:07.120
a song, an album, called
"Speak for Yourself,"

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.540
which is the same album that
I couldn't finish that song,

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.560
and I released it by
myself with my own label

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.530
and eventually
licensed it to Sony

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.650
because I couldn't do
with all the mail orders.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.120
But before that, I got this call
from this guy, Steven Hoggett

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.802
back then, like 20, 15
years ago, and he's like--

00:05:26.802 --> 00:05:28.260
are these annoying
you, by the way?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.927
[RATTLING SOUND]

00:05:28.927 --> 00:05:29.481
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:29.481 --> 00:05:30.720
Or should I take them off?

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.070
Are they present?

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.540
No?

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.910
Because they're
really annoying me.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.617
Anyway, so yeah, he was like,
I love this album "Speak

00:05:39.617 --> 00:05:40.200
for Yourself."

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.940
Could I-- I want to put it in
this play that I'm working on,

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.760
and there's going to be
people dancing around to it.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.390
And I was like, OK,
that sounds really good,

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.670
and I didn't ask
him for payment.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.253
And I was just like,
that sounds good.

00:05:49.253 --> 00:05:50.910
Yeah, OK, here you
go, and I tweaked

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.640
some things I made it a bit
longer, and that kind of stuff.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.490
And then it went into this
play, and it was really great,

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.140
and I loved it.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.310
It was the first time I'd
seen live dance to my music,

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.290
and I really enjoyed it, but
I didn't ask for payment.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.698
But if I had been signed to
a major label at the time,

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.323
they would've been
like, uh, yes, we're

00:06:06.323 --> 00:06:08.670
going to spend a whole year
discussing how much she

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.140
should get for
this, and then you

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.432
won't be able to use it anyway.

00:06:11.432 --> 00:06:13.590
Aha.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.740
So I basically-- yeah,
it was really great.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.850
And then we made friends,
and we kept in touch,

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.520
and then he did all
these amazing things.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.190
And then the next-- not the next
call, but a call four years ago

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.410
was him saying, hi, Imogen,
or Immy, as he calls me,

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.443
working on this play,
and I can't really

00:06:33.443 --> 00:06:34.860
tell you what it's
about, but they

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.125
love your music
and all this stuff

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:39.000
because I did all this
weird orchestral stuff

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.140
and a capella, strange
stuff for an accompaniment

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.900
for an old silent movie.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.820
And nobody ever gets to hear
that stuff, but he loves me,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.620
and he loves all
of my music, and he

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.310
knows it all really well.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.370
And so he was putting
all these random bits

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.550
in there, which hardly anyone's
heard, and it felt really good.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.350
And he was like, I
think they really just

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.330
want you to make the music.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.395
And I was like, who is it?

00:07:02.395 --> 00:07:04.020
And he said, I can't
tell you, but it's

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.213
about a boy with a scar.

00:07:05.213 --> 00:07:05.880
And I was like--

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.880
--OK, that's a bit
of a give away.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.432
And so I looked up online,
and I saw his name connected

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.890
to this creative
team who'd already

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.390
announced they're doing a play.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.700
And then I was like,
that's exciting.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.782
So then, yeah, I
met up with Sonia,

00:07:20.782 --> 00:07:24.370
who's-- she's the producer,
and they offered me the job.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.770
And yeah, life took a
very different turn.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.435
Yeah.

00:07:29.435 --> 00:07:31.560
BEN ARTHUR: What was your
relationship to the Harry

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.200
Potter universe before that?

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.220
IMOGEN HEAP: Thin,
quite distant.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.910
I really don't like
reading very much.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:41.910
I mean, that's not true.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.790
I like the information
that's in the book.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.680
I just don't like the process
of actually reading it,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.320
and I've never enjoyed that.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.110
My dad thinks that if
it wasn't down to him

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.840
kind of showing
me, going through,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.690
he thinks I'm
dyslexic, and maybe

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:05.700
because I really struggle
getting the words in my head.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.370
Maybe that's why I
like making my own.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:14.390
So anyway, so yeah, so that's
how it ended up in there, and--

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.310
BEN ARTHUR: Fascinating,
and if I can ask,

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:22.590
for those of us who were much,
much deeper into that universe,

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.200
can we fanboy and fangirl
out for a second and ask,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.000
did you hang out
with JK Rowling?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.890
Did she invite you
to her house, which

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.620
I assume is a magical
castle that you can only

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.919
access by a unicorn or a
magical boat or something?

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:39.080
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah, I did meet
the lady herself a few times.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.030
Yeah, she was on
set quite a lot,

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:46.828
and yeah, she's was
very nice to me.

00:08:46.828 --> 00:08:49.120
She says-- she actually, I
think, when I first met her,

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.550
she did this to me.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.300
And I was like--

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.720
no, she's very happy because
I discovered that they really

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.740
wanted somebody British,
a composer that's British

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.058
and that was a woman.

00:09:04.058 --> 00:09:05.850
BEN ARTHUR: So I was
never in the running--

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.683
IMOGEN HEAP: There's
not that many you can--

00:09:07.683 --> 00:09:09.630
BEN ARTHUR: --really at all.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.090
IMOGEN HEAP: I think also
with the help of Steven,

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.630
and the fact that the director
and him are best buddies,

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.840
it all it all helped.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.490
BEN ARTHUR: So can you tell
us about the creative process?

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.555
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah.

00:09:20.555 --> 00:09:23.100
BEN ARTHUR: Because as
I've heard you describe it,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.070
sort of it's a creative process
within a creative process

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.517
because they're working
on their own thing.

00:09:28.517 --> 00:09:29.850
IMOGEN HEAP: Is that your phone?

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.360
BEN ARTHUR: It's
really awful, isn't it.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.152
IMOGEN HEAP: Roger!

00:09:32.152 --> 00:09:33.670
BEN ARTHUR: Embarrassing.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.170
Ben.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.628
IMOGEN HEAP: Your
name's not Roger.

00:09:35.628 --> 00:09:36.814
Your name's Ben.

00:09:36.814 --> 00:09:37.640
Who's Roger?

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.460
I just-- somebody called Roger.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.440
BEN ARTHUR: You can
absolutely call me--

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:39.820
IMOGEN HEAP: It's
very confusing.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.380
BEN ARTHUR: --Roger, though.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.645
It's completely fine.

00:09:41.645 --> 00:09:43.720
IMOGEN HEAP: Oh
well, now we're even.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.450
You have your phone, and
I called the wrong name.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:51.170
So Ben, Ben Arthur,
your question was--

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.097
what was your question?

00:09:53.097 --> 00:09:54.430
Oh, the creative process, sorry.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.280
Yeah, so the
creative process was

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.500
they really liked a lot
of existing material,

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.710
but they needed it
adapted, but they had--

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.260
It's a five hour play, and
they wanted a lot of it

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.072
to be music underscored,
but they also--

00:10:08.072 --> 00:10:10.030
there's kind of three
different types of music.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.632
There's music that
they interact with,

00:10:11.632 --> 00:10:13.090
which is when
they're on the stage,

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.715
and they're moving
around to the music.

00:10:14.715 --> 00:10:17.200
There's the underscore, and
then there's scene changes,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.780
like a wall goes across, and
it's like-- (SINGING) Ha--

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.320
and things like that.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.003
And so the underscore
bit is quite a lot

00:10:27.003 --> 00:10:29.170
of existing material that
just kind of bumbling away

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.850
in the background
that's been adapted,

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.890
and stretched, and
added different things,

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.960
and lots of high
frequencies taken out

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.020
because it kind of gets
in the way of talking.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.270
So I learned a lot about
how to sculpt around

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:44.590
the vocal human voice area.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:50.710
And then a lot of, yeah,
drones, lots of vocal-- loads

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:51.580
of vocalizations.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.747
There's no lyrics, actually.

00:10:52.747 --> 00:10:54.363
There's only one bit
that has a lyric.

00:10:54.363 --> 00:10:56.530
BEN ARTHUR: Indeed, that's
from "Hide and and Seek."

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.730
IMOGEN HEAP: Of course.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.230
They had to put my
famous song in there.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.700
So that's the one song they
really wanted with a lyric,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.280
and I didn't want to--

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.240
it didn't feel right
to have me singing it,

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.198
and they did want to have
me singing it anyway,

00:11:09.198 --> 00:11:11.800
so I got my friend's
choir to sing it,

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.770
and then I kind of added
the vocal layers underneath

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.090
and made nice drones.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.440
But most of the time, it was
all about the transitions,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.080
and that was really, really fun.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.820
It really tested my
theory skills to,

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.290
like, how do I
get from that key?

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:29.530
How do I modulate from there to
there, and how do I, you know,

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:30.587
do this?

00:11:30.587 --> 00:11:32.170
So there's a lot of
existing material.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.560
And very luckily,
over the years I've

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:40.330
been quite vigilant into making
sure that all of the songs

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.120
have their stems, and they're
all documented, and kind of

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.270
filed quite nicely.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:48.160
So all of the songs from
"Speak for Yourself" up all

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.870
have drums, strings, vocals,
backup vocals, effects, blah,

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:55.200
blah, blah, weird sounds,
arpeggiated things, et cetera,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.248
et cetera.

00:11:56.248 --> 00:11:57.790
And then, so I was
lucky enough to be

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:00.123
able to pull that in, and
those ones that I hadn't done,

00:12:00.123 --> 00:12:02.770
I've got this awesome
assistant called Alexi,

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.280
and he was in my studio back
in Engla-- back in this village

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.080
where we live.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.870
And he would be kind of
getting those together and then

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.840
dropping them into Dropbox
into Ableton sessions,

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.300
where then I was seated in the
theater for about three months.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.160
And just with my little
computer and my little drive

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.370
and whatever, and
had my microphone,

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.440
and some little toys.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.590
And then I was just there
like that the whole time.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.340
And my only regret is
that I didn't really

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.430
get to talk it to anyone
other than, did you like that?

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.490
Or could you make that
a bit more like this?

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.000
Or could you make it a bit less?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.610
And yeah, so I didn't really get
to talk to the gang very much,

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.180
and I was literally there
from 10:00 in the morning

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.745
until 11:00 at night, and I
was always-- well, not always,

00:12:48.745 --> 00:12:50.120
but I was quite
a lot of the time

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:55.840
the last one in there saying
hi to the security guard.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.840
BEN ARTHUR: And you took all of
this music, something like 100

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.860
cues, and created an album?

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.610
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:04.900
BEN ARTHUR: Sort of
a cohesive album--

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.358
what was that
process like for you?

00:13:06.358 --> 00:13:07.942
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah,
so in the theater,

00:13:07.942 --> 00:13:09.400
it was really great
because there's

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:14.130
tons of inputs to kind of
react against and be like,

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.318
oh, that sound works
beautifully with the light.

00:13:16.318 --> 00:13:18.610
Oh, that sound goes beautifully
with the sound effects,

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.420
or ah, the pace of that person.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.307
So all of these are
kind of affirmations

00:13:22.307 --> 00:13:23.140
that that's working.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:23.765
That's working.

00:13:23.765 --> 00:13:25.810
Keep going, which you
don't get in the studio

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.360
when you're all by yourself.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.160
But at the same time, because
it's a big theater system,

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.758
and you don't hear a lot
of the detail in the mix,

00:13:33.758 --> 00:13:35.800
so it's kind of getting
away with murder in terms

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.060
of what I could mix in
the time that I had,

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.220
which is 2 and 1/2 hours of
music that, quite a lot of it

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.610
done also from scratch.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.820
And so when I finally took
that back into my studio,

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.940
it was like, oh my goodness.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.950
I've got so much work to do.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.870
There's a gazillion
pops, and clicks,

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.420
and all kinds of things
I had to draw out.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.210
And then just making
it sound lush,

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.310
and beautiful, and
layered, and giving it

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:04.190
the attention that I do to
my own records, but to--

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.980
well, it's a 78 minute album.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:10.190
It's like as much as I could
fit on a CD physically possible,

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.860
and it's 42 tracks.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.920
And so it goes into
four acts, and they're

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.650
like one long piece of music for
20 minutes, another long piece

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.330
of music for 20
minutes, but it's

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.640
going through 14 or
15 keys, so that's

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.850
where the kind of, how do you
get from this key to that key

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.040
into 3/4 from 7/8,
duh, duh, duh.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.950
But it's really fun, but
it's a lot of hard work.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:34.120
And I did most of it
standing up because I also

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.510
had a life at that time
in a flat in London,

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.000
and so there's a lot
of it just standing up.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.440
But that was quite
good for my posture.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.617
BEN ARTHUR: Excellent.

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:45.700
A personal recommendation.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.220
I've been listening to
the album for a while now.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.980
Walking through the city and
listening to that on headphones

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.732
gives you a very weird
magical layer of New York

00:14:54.732 --> 00:14:55.690
that-- very surprising.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:55.891
IMOGEN HEAP: Oh, that's

00:14:55.891 --> 00:14:56.440
BEN ARTHUR: Cool.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.110
Because you did a wonderful
job sort of making--

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.943
IMOGEN HEAP: Thanks.

00:14:58.943 --> 00:15:00.660
BEN ARTHUR: --that feel magical.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.410
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.020
BEN ARTHUR: --which.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.520
IMOGEN HEAP: There were certain
sounds that I always kind of

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.830
were drawn to.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:09.190
Kind of the other
kind of secret weapon

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.970
I had was I developed
with a company

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.810
called Soniccouture my own set
of virtual instruments of all

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:20.020
my favorite sounds in my studio
so that I could basically

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.400
take them on the road with me.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.780
So I could have my mbira.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.872
I could have my cello,
like harmonic stuff.

00:15:24.872 --> 00:15:26.080
I could have my cocktail kit.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.900
I could have my whirlies.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.560
BEN ARTHUR: Your
marxophone, I read.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.340
IMOGEN HEAP: My marxophone.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.000
BEN ARTHUR: Which is a--

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.510
IMOGEN HEAP: My [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.570
BEN ARTHUR: --sort of
socialist trumpet, I think.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:34.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.510
IMOGEN HEAP: No, it's
a bit like an autoharp,

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.810
but it has twangs on it.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.150
I don't know what
you're thinking of.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.810
So yeah, a marxophone.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:45.540
I see, right.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.140
I'm a bit slow today.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:52.200
Anyway, so cut that bit out.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.500
Yeah, so I have this--

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.410
we call it the box of tricks,
which is quite funny because it

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:00.220
ends up being a box of tricks
in a magical theater piece.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.900
And I used all of those
sounds to basically make

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.830
things sound like me, so I
would always use the marxophone,

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.330
and I'd use the "choir of mes."

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.910
I could play "choirs
of me" on my--

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.230
I had sampled my voice.

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.730
So if anyone wants to make a
song that sounds a bit like me,

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.397
you just find the box
of tricks and just

00:16:18.397 --> 00:16:21.140
go, la la, a bit of
marxophone, a bit of string,

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.115
bit of vocal harmony
things, and some--

00:16:24.115 --> 00:16:26.050
BEN ARTHUR: So speaking
of instruments,

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.720
I wanted to turn to
the Mi.Mu gloves.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.530
We've got a quick little video
to introduce you all to this

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.670
if you haven't seen it
before, and here she goes.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:39.590
[MUSIC - IMOGEN HEAP, "JUST FOR
 NOW"]

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.069
IMOGEN HEAP: OK, that was
really not a very good example

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.810
because--

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:25.089
BEN ARTHUR: Thank you.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:26.547
IMOGEN HEAP: What
happened before--

00:17:26.547 --> 00:17:28.580
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.530
I think it was my team who
some reason gave you that.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:36.010
But basically, yeah, what I'd
done previous to that is I'd

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.400
looped my voice by
catching my voice,

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.040
and then it would
create a loop, and then

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.510
I would catch another loop.

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.250
Well, I'd actually
put that aside,

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.960
and then I would
catch another loop,

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.150
and then I'd put
that aside, and then

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.025
I'd catch another loop,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:17:50.025 --> 00:17:55.030
And what I'm doing is I'm going,
posture, first up is record.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:59.555
And when I'm out of that
zone, it goes to play,

00:17:59.555 --> 00:18:01.180
or when it goes to
this zone, it plays.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.595
And then it continues to play.

00:18:02.595 --> 00:18:03.970
And then I can't
remember exactly

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.040
because that was
ages ago, but it's

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.810
something like when
I want to pull up

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:09.400
the volume of the
first loop, then

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.442
I would use my finger like
this, and I would just

00:18:11.442 --> 00:18:13.900
be like, up, down, up,
or just go straight up.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:20.332
It would be 120, 127 in MIDI
note, but like 100% loudness.

00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:21.790
And then if I wanted
to add reverb,

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.100
I just used my secret
finger posture,

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:29.650
which basically activates
the reverb fader,

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.170
or like the pop in my software.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.810
And it just says
from 0% to 100%.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.340
So if I was like, dong,
you just sound like now.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.896
But if I was over there,
it would be like dooong,

00:18:41.896 --> 00:18:44.710
as if I was in a massive cave.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.920
And then yeah, so I
would play bass lines,

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.540
or I might play twinkly sounds.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:54.720
Or it's just things that I
do anyway when I perform.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.278
Previously, you
kind of have to be

00:18:57.278 --> 00:18:59.820
kind of a little bit barricaded
by gear if you want to sample

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:04.270
stuff, or you're locked into the
physical nature of whatever box

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:08.170
you're using, and the
gloves are basically

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:09.610
controllers at your fingertips.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:14.230
And you can just be very
expressive to something

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.510
which is quite boring,
actually, in real life.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:20.010
It's just like, turn up a thing
to 100%, and it's like it,

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.330
eh, but you could do
that really expressively,

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.650
like yeah or
something like that.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:30.720
But this is much more like, oh,
she's making her voice bigger,

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.350
or she's catching
her voice, and now

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.753
she's moving it left
or right, or maybe even

00:19:34.753 --> 00:19:36.670
in surround, which I'm
doing on the tour, kind

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.310
of moving it around a 3D space.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:43.820
And then just kind of sampling
my voice, bringing in the coda,

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.870
harmonizers so I can
harmonize with my voice.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.710
Sometimes I integrate it
with an IR camera-- well,

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.780
they don't make them
anymore, but a connect,

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.893
and I would map the stage
into different zones

00:19:54.893 --> 00:19:56.560
so I could be like,
when I'm over there,

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:01.630
then make the drums more sparse.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.820
And when I'm back here,
make them more frenetic.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.840
Or when I'm over there,
switch my harmonizer to minor,

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.020
or when I'm over here.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.540
Or when I'm in the middle,
take out my harmonizer.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:15.310
So using the stage
spatially to effect

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:21.040
the kind of bigger parameters in
change in a system like Ableton

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.000
or [INAUDIBLE] whatever.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.840
So it's basically like a
mapping device, but how it feels

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.340
is you take on the physicality
of something which doesn't

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.430
have a physical representation.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:38.630
It's like a filter or
a bunch of effects.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.723
It doesn't have a thing.

00:20:40.723 --> 00:20:41.890
It's not like a bass guitar.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.840
It's like, ah,
that's a bass guitar.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.440
It's like a reverb, so
you become the reverb,

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.070
and you become the
mixing desk, and you

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:55.040
become the multiple voices or--

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.690
Yeah, the only downside that
I've discovered from it,

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.660
other than lots of
programming to kind of get it

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.280
so it feels really human, so
you're never even thinking

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.620
about, actually, I'm going
to bring in my reverb now.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.828
I'm going to sample my voice.

00:21:09.828 --> 00:21:11.870
It just becomes second nature.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.370
I'm going to record my voice,
going to make it a bit bigger.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.260
Now I'm going to add some har--

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:16.840
some delays.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.720
You kind of create a gestural
language the more and more you

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.790
use the system
because it, obviously,

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.410
has a bit of software between--
they're called Glover--

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.320
which you could also
add other inputs.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.110
So you don't have to use
the gloves with Glover.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.967
You can use--

00:21:29.967 --> 00:21:31.050
Yeah, you can use connect.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.050
You can use [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.360
You can use an iphone.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.860
You can use Leap Motion.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.890
You can use whatever,
other types of inputs.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:43.600
And then use them to move around
things in Ableton or whatever.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.610
So the gloves are
essentially just trying

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:49.780
to get away from
this limited space I

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.200
felt of trying to add
lots more gear to create

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.130
a fluidity or a kind of
spontaneity on the stage.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.560
BEN ARTHUR: Sure, and for
you, now that you've actually

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.110
developed these,
do you find when

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.600
you perform that
you're in them most

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.110
of the time, all of the time?

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.630
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah, I
wear them all the time--

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:08.020
BEN ARTHUR: All the time.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.460
IMOGEN HEAP: --on the stage
because why take them off?

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.950
They're quite pretty, and
they don't itch or anything.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:15.820
They basically have
eight bend sensors.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.250
They've got 1, 2, 2, 2, and 1.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.132
They have lights for
feedback, and you

00:22:20.132 --> 00:22:22.090
can program the lights
to do whatever you want.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.130
You might be like, turn
it red when I'm in record,

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.050
which you know it's in record,
but it's nice for the audience

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.175
to see, oh, it's in record.

00:22:27.175 --> 00:22:28.930
It's gone red.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.290
And then it's got a battery.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.910
It's got an IMU so that you
can get your positional data,

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:38.710
and it's got an accelerometer,
so you can be like, drum peaks.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:42.600
And I do air guitar as
well, which is really fun.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.322
And yeah, so that kind
of combination-- then

00:22:46.322 --> 00:22:48.280
you've got your axes, so
you've got your pitch.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.110
You've got yaw, and
you've got roll.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.210
And then you've got
different zones--

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:53.800
backwards, forwards, up, down.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.030
And the combination of that
leads to so many possibilities

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.030
because if you have a
keyboard, and you're like,

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.670
I'm going to play a
squidgy bass sound.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.500
So you might be like,
dum, dum, dum, dum.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.140
And you want it to go--
woo, woo, wow or something.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.473
You could do that with pressure.

00:23:06.473 --> 00:23:07.848
You could make it
slightly harder

00:23:07.848 --> 00:23:09.170
if you want it to go, wow.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:12.820
But if you want it to do
that and change the tone

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.640
or something around
it, you would

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.640
have to use your other hand,
which is then entirely consumed

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.248
by going wow.

00:23:20.248 --> 00:23:22.540
And you're suddenly just
playing a three note bass line

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.550
with a wow thing,
but you could just

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:28.320
be going, wow like that the
same, but just your whole hand,

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.180
and you could move
around the stage and do.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.525
Yeah, so it's not
good for everything.

00:23:33.525 --> 00:23:35.650
It's not good if you want
to play some Rachmaninoff

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.470
with your fingers, but
you do that on the piano

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.600
because that's what
the piano is for.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.960
It's really for all
of the unseen bits,

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.402
the bits that don't have
a voice or a physical.

00:23:46.402 --> 00:23:47.110
BEN ARTHUR: Nice.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:48.280
IMOGEN HEAP: But you
do get lost in it.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.330
That's the only thing.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:49.840
BEN ARTHUR: Interesting.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.798
IMOGEN HEAP: You just--

00:23:50.798 --> 00:23:53.530
I close my eyes all the
time, and I'm in the zone.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:54.820
I'm playing "Hide and Seek."

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.853
I'm layering my voice and
bringing in a harmonizer,

00:23:57.853 --> 00:23:59.520
and I'm like, god, I
finished this song.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.020
Did I actually look at anyone?

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.030
Because it's like
you're playing,

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:07.270
and it fills you because
I have inner ears as well.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.810
I like just to hear the
sound, and I'm just like--

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:14.440
You just get lost because
you don't touch anything

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.820
like a machine or whatever.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.830
It just kind of--

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.560
it becomes really
like a second skin.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.335
BEN ARTHUR: A
visceral experience.

00:24:21.335 --> 00:24:21.557
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah.

00:24:21.557 --> 00:24:22.055
BEN ARTHUR: Fascinating.

00:24:22.055 --> 00:24:23.620
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah,
It's really cool.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.490
BEN ARTHUR: And where in
the development process

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:28.760
are you right now?

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.210
Are you licensing it to someone?

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.460
Are you looking for
a funding partner?

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.546
Are you--

00:24:33.546 --> 00:24:35.004
IMOGEN HEAP: Why,
are you offering?

00:24:35.004 --> 00:24:36.635
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:36.635 --> 00:24:37.760
Well, funny you should ask.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.000
BEN ARTHUR: I was going to
wait till later, but OK.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.458
IMOGEN HEAP: No,
I'll tell you what

00:24:41.458 --> 00:24:43.800
we've been doing because
it has been quite hard.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.310
I'm not-- corporate
structures and all that stuff

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.680
is not my forte.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.940
So we have a team, and they've
grown over the eight years

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:56.650
since we started developing it
for my own personal fun time

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.300
use, which then became we did
some conferences, and things

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.950
like this, and one before.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:05.010
And over time, I've had loads
of interest, tons and tons

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.245
of emails that we set
up a company eventually

00:25:07.245 --> 00:25:10.350
because it's like, well,
maybe we should make them

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:13.560
instead of just for my
own personal enjoyment

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.660
or for my shows.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.160
And so we did start
to develop them,

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.580
but that's a huge curve to
have to make it something

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.790
that everyone can use,
software that's intuitive,

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:28.200
hardware that's robust,
and cheap enough

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.110
to make enough of them.

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:33.930
So we've made like 50
handmade pairs for people

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.720
over the years, and now
we are getting much closer

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.220
to releasing
something this year,

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.970
which just 100 pairs, but
they will be manufactured,

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.130
and it will be a lot down--

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:46.720
not that much down in cost,
but maybe in five years time.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.220
If enough people
buy Teslas, they'll

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.490
be like 2 quid next year.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:55.150
So you know, the early adopters
do pay the higher price,

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.680
but they get the benefit of
better service and whatever.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.740
BEN ARTHUR: Sure.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.290
IMOGEN HEAP: So yeah, this year
we're going to release them.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:02.950
We have released the MINI.MU.

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.700
If you have a small
child in your life,

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.910
you can make your own glove.

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:12.240
It's quite basic,
but it's still fun,

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.420
and you can build it
and code it yourself,

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.757
and it's called the MINI.MU.

00:26:15.757 --> 00:26:17.715
BEN ARTHUR: Yeah, I can't
wait to see a ballet.

00:26:17.715 --> 00:26:18.400
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah, your girl.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.190
BEN ARTHUR: Well, I do--

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.440
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.130
BEN ARTHUR: --have
a youngster who

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.600
might be interested
in such, but I

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.930
can't wait to see a ballet
where the dancers become

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:25.800
the musicians.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.820
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.278
BEN ARTHUR: So
whoever out there is

00:26:28.278 --> 00:26:30.150
doing that should
do that because it

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:32.970
seems built for a hybrid art.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:36.848
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah, you kind of--
because you use your whole body

00:26:36.848 --> 00:26:37.640
to move your hand--

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.600
you know, you don't just
be like-- he, he, he.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.850
You're like, dah dah.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.780
Even though you might
be just going like that,

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.440
you kind of want
to go like that.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.540
You know, it's like
I'm catching the sound.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.030
So forth for the dancer,
they use their whole bodies,

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.830
and you could--

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.620
I mean for fine detailed
sounds, they're great,

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:59.060
but you could equally
use an infrared camera

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:03.150
or a kind of an array to have
a play space with some dancers.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:04.650
But combined with
the gloves, you

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:07.920
could get a lot more
detailed and really amazing

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.140
timing like you don't
notice any latency at all.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.850
BEN ARTHUR: Neat.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.440
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah,
it's really fun.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:18.410
BEN ARTHUR: Well, speaking of
broad shifts in technology,

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.160
we wanted to talk about
Creative Passport.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:20.910
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.200
BEN ARTHUR: And we have a
brief snippet of a video.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.330
You can see the longer
full video on the YouTube,

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:32.090
but for the moment,
we'll show you this.

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:33.062
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:33.062 --> 00:27:35.520
- The Creative
Passport, an identity

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.430
in a searchable database
for music makers to upload

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.770
and share their
information, everything

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:44.280
you'd like to share about
you as a music maker verified

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.260
and in one place.

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.990
Map and empower the global
music making community

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:52.320
as you list and link to your
music and sound contributions.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.200
Add unique descriptive data
to your profile and individual

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.300
works to increase
discoverability

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.630
for brand partnerships, play
listing, syncs, collaborations,

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.330
live, or session bookings.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:06.490
At the same time, enabling
music services to innovate,

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.300
benefiting both us
and our audiences,

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.840
this is an identity that
belongs to and works for you,

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.630
while also connecting all
of your external existing

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.770
IDs in one place.

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.280
Imagine uploading your
biography only once

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.700
but updating simultaneously
across all services.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:24.630
Sounds good?

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.010
Who's going to build it?

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:29.390
You and I, we all are.

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:32.180
Step by step with music
makers and services,

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.430
in forums we host
all over the world,

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:36.510
on our ongoing
music and tech tour.

Let's bring this necessary
missing layer, a music maker

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:51.930
database, to life for the health
of our global music ecosystem.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:55.020
Because let's face it,
nobody else can do it for us.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.880
The Creative Passport by
music makers for everyone.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.860
[END PLAYBACK]

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.980
IMOGEN HEAP: There
we go, so join up.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.650
We don't really have
anything at the moment.

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.440
This is more like a kind of
call to action for musicians

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.660
to think about their
identity, think

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:14.680
about what that means, think
about ownership of data,

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.260
about getting organized
really, about having

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:22.630
a place in the world where you
can say, that is the digital

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:23.500
me.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.460
That's where I, as a
creative self, exists.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.770
Because you know
it's great to have

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.600
all these different
services, and they

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.640
have their own
identities for you,

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.085
or you maybe have a profile
on Twitter, and la, la,

00:29:36.085 --> 00:29:37.210
and all these other things.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.680
But where are you?

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.130
Like I feel very torn apart.

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:42.160
I feel very like a
big massive tentacle,

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.680
and the ocean's just--

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.380
I don't have a center like
you're speaking to my center

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.510
as a physical thing,
but I don't have that.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.250
And more and more as
we kind of progress

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:55.960
into developments in AI and
discoverability, incubation,

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.570
and I really believe
that the future of work

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.240
is going to be around
our unique selling points

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.770
about how we express who
we are in the digital space

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.960
so that our cells
are working 24/7

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:13.810
on our behalf in other words,
perhaps, with our ethos

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:15.590
interfacing with the world.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:18.530
And so when it
comes down to music,

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:20.950
how do we present ourselves?

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:23.080
We have a major problem
in the music industry

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:27.730
whereby the commercial
music industry didn't adopt

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:30.580
the technology of MP3
and didn't see Napster

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:35.620
as this incredible, amazing
opportunity to go, wow,

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:39.710
this is life changing for
musicians and the industry.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:42.190
Let's get on this and make
it something really great.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.815
And instead, they kind of went,
let's sweep it under the carpet

00:30:44.815 --> 00:30:46.567
and put people in jail.

00:30:46.567 --> 00:30:49.150
And really, just people wanted
to share music that they loved,

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.860
and so what happened
was that you

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.650
had a huge disassociation
from the music and the people

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:54.460
that made it.

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.410
Then it just never
managed to catch up,

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:58.970
and the music industry has
been trying to catch up,

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.120
and they're basically
firefighting every day

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.810
as people try to innovate
on this very crooked kind

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:08.570
of heavy, clunky industry.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.150
So there's thousands
of services,

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.250
and I've spoken to
hundreds of them, who

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:16.180
want to build new services
using existing music,

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.270
but to reach that point where
they have the permission

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.720
to do that to license the
music, it's just not viable.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.270
They have to raise so much
money with VC that it then

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.270
only leaves little, tiny scraps
for the musicians in the end

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:31.480
if any, and it's a
very lengthy process.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.300
And I just feel
more than ever we

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.510
have an opportunity with
new technologies where

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:40.900
we could create an
open database of works

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.660
that the whole world could
come around and create

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:48.010
this kind of Alexandria, this
library of content, whereby

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:51.040
all of the music services,
the labels, the publishers,

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.340
the collection societies, who
all have their own databases

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.370
at the moment, costing
them huge amounts of money,

00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:00.130
that they have to keep
updated and verified

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:01.460
and all that stuff.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:03.220
And they're all
incomplete, and they all

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.390
compete with one another.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:05.200
BEN ARTHUR: Right

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.900
IMOGEN HEAP: But
if that was just--

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.390
just get rid of that.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.260
We don't need to have multiple
versions of the same thing,

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.330
and all slightly different,
and all slightly bad.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.940
Let's just have-- let's
share into a space

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:23.230
and contribute to that alive
kind of world of music,

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:27.280
and data, and augment
what's already there

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.470
into something that can be
tuned in to by all the services

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:33.050
so they don't have to have
that weight on their back,

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:33.695
basically.

00:32:33.695 --> 00:32:35.320
BEN ARTHUR: Right,
so speaking of that,

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:41.770
you say on Mycelia that you
see this as a potential portal

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:42.910
for income.

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:46.780
Can you talk about how
blockchain relates to Creative

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:47.850
Passport or doesn't?

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:49.420
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah, sure.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:53.200
So for me, I've been in the
music industry 23 years.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.210
It's very, very
hard to know where

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:57.550
your money is at any one time.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:01.585
We spent about a year trying
to research just the income

00:33:01.585 --> 00:33:03.970
for one song, just
one song, and it's

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:06.880
taken a team of seven students
on and off for a year just

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.165
to try to get to the bottom
of where does it come from?

00:33:10.165 --> 00:33:11.290
What is that radio station?

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:12.540
What is that thing over there?

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.712
Why does that not
match up with that?

00:33:14.712 --> 00:33:16.420
And that's, for me,
with a team of people

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:18.720
going into the offices at
the PRS and the collection

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.220
societies.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.410
Could you explain this?

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:25.790
I don't really understand that,
and we're still only 5% there.

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:30.410
So it's an insane amount
of complication for--

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:36.862
which comes from the physical,
the old day 100 years ago.

00:33:36.862 --> 00:33:39.070
You know, how do we pay your
publisher when something

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:40.112
gets played on the radio?

00:33:40.112 --> 00:33:42.380
And it's much simpler.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.560
So the Creative
Passport is really just

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.340
about us putting our flag in the
sand, musicians at the moment,

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.950
verifying each other through
peer-to-peer verification,

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:52.480
like we have a QR code.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.540
You just shine your camera
on someone else's QR code,

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.860
and you go, OK, I
verify who you are.

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.980
And that is a thing that
then creates a trust network

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:04.290
around all the music makers
across the planet in time,

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.060
but we're not
ready for that yet.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.733
We're just doing
a very kind of--

00:34:07.733 --> 00:34:09.650
we're mainly just going
around the world doing

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:11.389
this tour, where I do concerts.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:12.110
I do workshops.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.370
I show off my gloves.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.560
I give con-- I do conferences.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.028
I do Q and A. I
do whatever I can.

00:34:18.028 --> 00:34:19.820
And we meet with music
makers and services,

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.040
and we talk about
this feature ecosystem

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.489
because essentially, if we
had this incredibly rich data

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:29.210
source linked to
the actual content,

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:31.280
linking out to all
of the musicians

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.739
who contributed to
those works, then

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:36.110
you can imagine all these
amazing possibilities

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:39.350
of discoveries, and connections,
and offerings of jobs,

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:39.922
and new--

00:34:39.922 --> 00:34:41.630
You know, somebody
wants to book somebody

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:43.699
a private concert
because they saw,

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:46.370
they heard something in
Spotify, or Google, or whatever,

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:47.210
YouTube.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.580
And they went oh, why,
I really, really liked

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.350
that person's work.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:53.719
I'm going to try and
book her, and maybe you

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:55.520
do it right from the song.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.950
And you link, or you say,
I love that trumpet player.

00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:59.550
I want to put that
trumpet player--

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:01.640
I want to put that
trumpet in my film,

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.730
and then they put
the trumpet player.

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:07.520
But if we don't have a
way to kind of go, here

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:11.090
I am, and here are my songs,
we don't have anything

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:11.780
to build from.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:13.820
We don't have a home.

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:17.810
BEN ARTHUR: Imagine you were
at a large, influential tech

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:26.310
company talking to some very
handsome and smart employees.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:28.610
How would you convince
them to support you,

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:30.740
and how could they
support Creative Passport?

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.490
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:36.980
I think-- we're not ready
for big integration yet.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:41.000
We need to go kind of and create
a groundswell among musicians

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.110
so they kind of own this space
because this is an autonomous

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:47.060
thing we need to do.

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:51.680
We need to convince music makers
to take charge of their data

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:55.880
and to really take their
digital self seriously.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.940
So at the moment, we are
talking with tons of services.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:03.158
We might have four or five, a
little handful by April or May

00:36:03.158 --> 00:36:04.700
when we come in the
tour around here,

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.700
and we do more, so to
bring on more music makers.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.530
But we're not ready for that.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:11.480
It's not like
Myspace or LinkedIn.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.320
It's not like-- it's not ready.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.980
It's just-- imagine
if you owned this.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:19.430
Imagine if you
owned your identity

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:21.350
and what could grow from that.

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:24.280
Because then if we reach
like 1,000 or 10,000,

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.360
what's going to be the
tipping point for someone,

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.710
a company, an organization
like Google, to go,

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.890
we're going to
integrate our YouTube

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:32.360
service with the
Creative Passport,

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.030
and that would be mega, but
we're not ready for that

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:37.970
yet because you don't have
an incentive enough just yet

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:41.240
because we would need to
have hundreds of thousands

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.220
before it's of interest.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:46.550
BEN ARTHUR: Right, so
you need musicians, maybe

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:49.063
some in the audience
and other people

00:36:49.063 --> 00:36:50.480
out there in the
YouTube audience,

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.090
to come and sort of be
a part of the community

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:55.910
and help shape that
so that you become

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:58.390
a large enough organization
so that you can more--

00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:59.390
IMOGEN HEAP: Pull some--

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:00.600
BEN ARTHUR: Yeah,
pull some weight.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:00.820
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.060
BEN ARTHUR: OK, fascinating.

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.923
IMOGEN HEAP: Because yeah,
we have representatives

00:37:04.923 --> 00:37:07.340
on our behalf, like labels,
and publishers, and collection

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:12.260
societies, but a lot of us
don't, like so many musicians,

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.930
don't have any way to get
even into any industry

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:16.580
because they might
be in Sudan, or they

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.413
might be in-- who knows
where they might be.

00:37:18.413 --> 00:37:20.600
They have no way to
get onto the ladder.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.340
And if we can try and
reach our handshake across,

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.870
or our Mexican wave across
the world, or whatever,

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:28.490
to these musicians,
then we're bringing them

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:31.242
into this truly global
community, music community,

00:37:31.242 --> 00:37:33.200
that then hopefully all
the services will start

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.820
to think, oh, well
that's actually

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:35.960
really interesting
because now we're

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.660
reaching into this market,
and this market, and this.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.710
You know, and that's
their incentive.

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:44.150
But for us, it's
how can we create

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:48.260
a beautiful, healthy,
living kind of ecosystem

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:52.400
from which these services
can grow kind of on our--

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.660
that makes sense for us.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.140
And then we're
truly sustainable,

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:59.420
and then we can have centuries
of wonderful, beautiful music

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:02.322
because the musicians
are supported.

00:38:02.322 --> 00:38:04.280
BEN ARTHUR: I think we
have a question for you.

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.480
AUDIENCE: I think Mycelia
is very interesting.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.330
I'm kind of curious.

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:15.986
So you obviously need the
three majors to be involved.

00:38:15.986 --> 00:38:16.880
IMOGEN HEAP: Not yet.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.760
AUDIENCE: You don't think so?

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.290
IMOGEN HEAP: No, I don't
think we need them.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:18.930
No.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:22.390
AUDIENCE: How does
Merlin feel about it?

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:26.050
IMOGEN HEAP: The thing is, it's
like it's outside of licensing.

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.280
This is about your
personal identity.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.700
It's my skill sets.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.870
It's my projects.

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.250
It's my interests.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:33.240
It's my philosophy.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.950
It's my biography.

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:38.340
It's things that aren't
actually, at this moment,

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.680
to do with my songs.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.530
They would link into a songs
database, which Mycelia isn't.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:45.270
Mycelia is like the
vision, the blue sky

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:47.580
imagination of the future,
but the Creative Passport

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.400
is a thing.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:52.883
It's like an app, a trust
anchor for other services

00:38:52.883 --> 00:38:55.425
to be able to go, oh, yeah, that
is Imogen Heap because she's

00:38:55.425 --> 00:38:56.842
got a Creative
Passport, and she's

00:38:56.842 --> 00:38:59.050
been verified by her
peers, blah, blah, blah.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:01.650
So if you wanted to
go and book a gig,

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:04.080
some promoter could
pretty much trust you

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.780
because you've been
verified by your peers,

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.430
and you have a good track
record, and that kind of thing.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.690
So at the moment,
where the record ind--

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:14.970
the majors are going
to get interested is

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:17.980
when this database
does start to emerge,

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:20.335
which it is starting to
emerge in places like Sweden.

00:39:20.335 --> 00:39:21.210
There's one in Malta.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:21.730
There's one--

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.313
And actually, here
there's going to be

00:39:23.313 --> 00:39:26.130
a new one around the
Music Modernization Act,

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.058
around the mechanicals,
how they're

00:39:28.058 --> 00:39:29.850
going to be paid to
the writers, and that's

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:32.460
something that just passed a
few months ago in Congress.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.620
So they have to build that
in the next two years,

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:38.580
and I'm going, hello,
IBM and Berkeley.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.640
How are you going to do that
without the music makers?

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.800
How are you going to
build that without us

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.878
being able to add to the
content that you have

00:39:46.878 --> 00:39:48.420
around your publishers
because that's

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.050
how they're going to build it.

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:52.200
They're going to combine the big
publishers together and create

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.110
another database, but it's
only going to be as good

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:59.440
as their combined
databases, and it won't--

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.800
The problem with that is
that, whether they're guilty

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.400
or they're not, the money that
comes in from the services

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.508
will then go to
this body, and then

00:40:08.508 --> 00:40:10.800
the money that can't be
distributed, because they don't

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.800
know the writers, because
they're too small fry,

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.970
and it's too much effort
for them to do it,

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:18.030
will just go back to the
writers that they do have.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:20.670
They do look after, after four
years or whatever the deal is.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:23.100
It's probably
something like that.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.100
It will get redistributed
back to the original writers

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.860
that they look after, so
the other writers are all

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.510
around the world,
and all the smaller

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:32.850
writers won't get that money.

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.760
And that's tiny amounts
to these other artists,

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.480
but to them it could be like
50 quid, or 100 quid, or 1,000

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:38.980
quid.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.060
So when they create that, we
want the Creative Passport

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:48.570
to be able to enable individual
musicians to be able to author

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:54.000
into and claim a way to kind of
point to this is how to pay me,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.610
or this is my
collection society.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:57.810
Well, this is actually
me, this missing bit here.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:59.770
So that we can tidy up
and do the job for them

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:03.910
that they can't afford to do
because it's tiny amounts.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.238
So the majors like the
record side of things,

00:41:06.238 --> 00:41:07.280
because they don't have--

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:12.170
yeah, ISRC, and your ISWC
are two codes that you have,

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:14.400
your recording and
your publishing.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:18.140
There is no shared database
of that, which is crazy.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.190
And so if this does
start to emerge,

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:21.690
that may be where
the majors start

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:25.230
to pile in their
recorded data, and that

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.600
might start to flourish and
become this big Alexandria.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.530
Who knows?

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.320
If we can kind of make--

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.070
if we can find a way
in for the musicians,

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.830
and it can grow
further, otherwise it

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:38.880
will just became become
another kind of clearinghouse,

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.880
kind of closed space, which
will have all this money put

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:46.880
into it by the public money, but
it won't be further reaching.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.818
It will just be another
closed database,

00:41:48.818 --> 00:41:49.860
and that will be a shame.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.420
BEN ARTHUR: So we're running
a little low on time.

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:51.900
IMOGEN HEAP: No.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.040
BEN ARTHUR: I'm
sorry to interrupt.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.210
IMOGEN HEAP: That didn't
answer your question, did it?

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:54.810
Kind of?

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:55.560
AUDIENCE: Sort of.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.490
I mean, it's such
a complicated--

00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:57.050
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah, it
is very complicated.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.690
AUDIENCE: --space that
it's kind of hard to--

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:59.140
IMOGEN HEAP: Which is
why we need to simplify,

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.330
and that's when they're
going to come on board

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:01.950
is when you're
like, when you say,

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:03.523
look, all that
kind of accounting

00:42:03.523 --> 00:42:05.940
stuff that you do, and all
that really annoying paperwork,

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.315
and that your just
like, oh, god,

00:42:07.315 --> 00:42:08.670
I wish I didn't have to do this.

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:10.950
When that disappears because
we have smart contracts,

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:12.257
and payments, and you know--

00:42:12.257 --> 00:42:13.840
AUDIENCE: What I'd
say to you, though,

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.570
is that that asymmetry
of information

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:17.340
is basically a
competitive advantage

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:20.475
for labels to be able to bargain
with people like Spotify.

00:42:20.475 --> 00:42:21.225
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah.

00:42:21.225 --> 00:42:24.030
AUDIENCE: And when you
have 70% or 80% of Spotify

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:26.220
as catalog coming
from majors, it

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.470
puts them in this
position where they

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:33.060
have to ingest major's data, and
this is where I'm sort of like,

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.500
don't you need the
majors onboard?

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.780
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah, so
that's a good example.

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.850
And the thing is
that if you look

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:43.080
at the long term, the majors,
they might hold licenses for--

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.833
I think a maximum of 35 years.

00:42:44.833 --> 00:42:45.750
AUDIENCE: I mean, 70--

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:48.620
I mean, the Beatles stuff is
about to come out of licensing,

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.000
and it was was
from the '50s, so--

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.210
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah,
but it's like if you

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:56.100
think of all the new
material, and most--

00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:02.220
the trend is big labels hold
large amounts of existing work,

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:05.940
and younger up-and-coming
artists, or people like myself,

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.850
own our own works, and
we have small holdings

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.080
around our own works.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.430
So how can we make
that really easy

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:14.680
so that people like Spotify
can deal with us directly?

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.380
AUDIENCE: So it's a
chicken and egg problem.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.650
IMOGEN HEAP: It is,
yeah, and we need

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.600
to be the chicken or the
egg, whichever way we

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.200
need to get on with it.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.050
We need to make the
first move, basically.

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:23.572
Yeah.

00:43:23.572 --> 00:43:24.280
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.270
BEN ARTHUR: We have
another question over here.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.227
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have a
completely different question.

00:43:28.227 --> 00:43:29.185
IMOGEN HEAP: Excellent.

00:43:29.185 --> 00:43:31.960
AUDIENCE: So I assume
writing and performing

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.340
wearing the gloves
kind of causes

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.292
you to make different creative
decisions than you would if you

00:43:36.292 --> 00:43:38.000
were just using a
regular MIDI controller

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.538
with standard encoders.

00:43:39.538 --> 00:43:41.080
Are there other
technologies that you

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.547
think should be utilized
more or really aren't kind

00:43:43.547 --> 00:43:45.880
of getting the attention that
they could that could have

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.922
that same potential to
change the way that people

00:43:47.922 --> 00:43:50.920
either write and perform
music or experience it?

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.615
IMOGEN HEAP: Hmm, thanks.

00:43:52.615 --> 00:43:56.470
Interesting question.

00:43:56.470 --> 00:44:01.490
I mean, how write
and perform music.

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:05.550
The way-- I really
enjoy the unknown.

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:07.922
Like, oh, there's something
over I haven't tried yet,

00:44:07.922 --> 00:44:09.630
or there's an input
there that I've never

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:12.630
had to deal with, like audience
heartbeat info, or something,

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:17.370
or like galvanic skin
response, or something.

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:20.490
Like, what would I do musically
if I knew the audience--

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.170
Actually, I'm trying
to develop a thing.

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:24.660
It may never happen because
lots of things don't happen,

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.370
but it's just a simple--

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:27.955
It's actually got
a terrible name.

00:44:27.955 --> 00:44:29.080
It's called the love glove.

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:31.897
I know.

00:44:31.897 --> 00:44:33.730
It's going to be made
out of shiny material.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:35.790
No, it's just a
way that I thought

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:37.950
it'd be nice for the
audience to be able to have,

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:39.990
like they could show their love.

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:43.980
Like, I love this bit, instead
of taking camera pictures,

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:47.280
or like clapping at the
end, that I could see,

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.040
oh, somebody really
likes that bit.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.660
You know, or oh, they
really, they've got a thing,

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:52.090
and just that
little eye contact.

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:56.800
And I think, when you get
those bits from the audience--

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.890
BEN ARTHUR: Isn't that
called a lighter, though?

00:44:58.890 --> 00:44:59.757
Just--

00:44:59.757 --> 00:45:01.090
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah, I suppose so.

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:02.130
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:03.450
BEN ARTHUR: It's really only
for the slow songs, though.

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:04.100
I don't know why.

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.400
IMOGEN HEAP: Yeah, it
might be something--

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:05.942
I don't know.

00:45:05.942 --> 00:45:08.640
I was thinking about, then
I could give back the love.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.650
And I could kind of
pump up the love,

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:11.920
and then they could get
more love in their hand.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.810
And then it would
kind of die down

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.518
if they used too much
of it all the time,

00:45:14.518 --> 00:45:17.010
so it doesn't get too annoying.

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:18.623
Anyway, I just--

00:45:18.623 --> 00:45:19.290
Yeah, it's true.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:20.540
They could just use a lighter.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.590
You just saved me
like 10,000 pounds.

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:23.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:25.020
I should bring you to my team.

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.170
BEN ARTHUR: I'll
Take a check or cash.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:31.210
Thank you so much for
spending time with us.

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:33.090
Thank you all for
hanging out with us

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:36.660
here at the Talks at Google,
and thanks for the team

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.653
for getting all this done.

00:45:38.653 --> 00:45:40.070
Ladies and gentlemen,
Imogen Heap.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:43.420
[APPLAUSE]
