PAIGE SCHOENING:
And first I'd like

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.120
to start from the very
beginning with you used to work

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.250
in Silicon Valley in robotics.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.960
How did you make
the switch to tea?

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.474
What was it about tea
that really grabbed you?

00:00:18.474 --> 00:00:20.390
NED HEAGERTY: Well, first
let me say thank you

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.010
for the opportunity to be here.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.100
I think as a tea
person, we're always

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.610
pleased to have the
opportunity to talk tea

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.760
with an American audience.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.050
It's an educative
process, if you will.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.350
So I'll try and make it
as interesting as possible

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.250
because certainly tea has
been an interesting, I would

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.050
call it, adventure for me.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.620
Well, like many people, I
had practical constraints

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.390
on my life--

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.830
children in college, a
home, [? food ?] to be,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.500
and all of that.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.440
I had become quite tired
of business as I knew it.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.130
And also a horrific commute
every day was weighing heavily

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.630
on me.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.000
So I made the decision that
I would find a new business.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.410
And a mutual friend
approached me and said,

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.490
there's this wonderful tea
company and a very interesting

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.330
man who's looking for
a partner or someone

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.550
to take over his business.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.400
And that was my introduction
to David Lee Hoffman,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.700
who was the founder
of Silk Road Teas.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.870
And I should give David a
moment here because it's

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.090
a very interesting story, as he
is arguably the first American

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.180
that traveled in
China extensively

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.780
long before the market
was really open for tea.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.360
It was actually
restricted to many areas.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.630
You could not travel in
China to these areas.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.720
And David took it upon
himself to do that

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.090
and single-handedly broke new
territory for the specialty tea

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.780
industry as we know it today.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.590
David left the United States
as a graduate student.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.950
He didn't finish his education.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.770
Frustrated, he left
the United States

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.420
and traveled the world for close
to 10 years, ending in Asia.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.670
And of course,
most of that time,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.670
like the rest of the
world, drank tea--

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.470
but was particularly taken
with the tea in China,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.990
and brought home tea of
course when he eventually

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.030
came back after
10 years of travel

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.880
without coming back
to the United States,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.440
and introduced some
friends to the Chinese tea.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.000
And in a classic sort of
business beginning, they said,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.790
wow, can you get
some of this for me?

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.330
And of course, the proverbial
light bulb goes off.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.840
He starts a tea company
and begins to import tea.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.310
And albeit, it was in very
small increments at that point.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.670
Again, like I said,
he actually could not

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.850
get into certain areas of China.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.370
It was not open
yet for commerce.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.040
And the tea industry
was quite protective

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.880
also in China, the government.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.860
PAIGE SCHOENING: Right.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.160
When he first went,
wasn't it kind of taboo

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.184
to buy direct from tea farms?

00:03:20.184 --> 00:03:21.100
NED HEAGERTY: Correct.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.600
Yeah.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.330
The government really liked to
channel that, as did the tea--

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.400
the nascent, the
beginning tea companies.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.240
As it was beginning, you're
seeing the very beginnings

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.377
of China beginning to
decentralize certainly

00:03:33.377 --> 00:03:34.085
the tea industry.

00:03:34.085 --> 00:03:39.020
It was totally, at one time,
run by the Chinese government.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.760
Certainly ownership of
the specialty tea farms

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.070
were largely owned by--

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.150
anyone that was
processing the tea--

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.200
the tea farmers were
quite alone and separate,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.930
but the processing of the
tea was being handled largely

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.560
by the government.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.710
So he had to go
into that territory.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.020
And David had the good fortune
to meet a couple of gentlemen

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.160
early on who had studied
tea in university

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.800
and were working
for large companies,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.740
but I think must have
had a bit of the hope

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.010
that they could get
into the US market

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.250
and so traveled with David into
these back areas to buy tea.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.320
They quickly understood
that it wasn't

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.580
going to be the kinds
of dollar volumes

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.400
I think that they had hoped.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.020
Their management
really asked them

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.350
to back off and
try and get David

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.940
to conform more to buying
in traditional channels.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.380
David didn't want to do that.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.570
And fortunately, a couple
of those individuals

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.010
decided that they would truncate
their current employment

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.210
and break out on their own and
sort of freelance, if you will,

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.460
or broker in the business.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.830
And those early on people,
like Mr. Song, today

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.260
is my partner in China.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.680
He's the person that handles
most of my business affairs

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.700
on China's side.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.410
And it underscores in
China, I think at the level

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.810
when you talk about
specialty teas,

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.460
that it's about relationships,
like so many things in Asia.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.090
Over time, you develop a
trust and an understanding

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.070
of what tea quality is or
what you're looking for.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.440
And you constantly
revisit that concept.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.240
But it's there, and it builds.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.950
And over time, you
begin to understand

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.020
what you're both
looking for and what

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.480
works for the relationship.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.882
And you can get some very
interesting tea as a result.

00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:40.840
PAIGE SCHOENING: Right.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.298
And what was it
like when you first

00:05:42.298 --> 00:05:46.170
traveled with him to China
to specifically buy tea?

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.180
And I'm curious
because I saw-- there's

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.520
a documentary "All in This
Tea" that kind of went

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.240
with him to buy tea in China.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.790
One of the shots was he
arrives in this village,

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.740
and people are just coming
up to him with bags of tea,

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.949
asking them to smell his tea.

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.156
Were you guys getting mobbed
like that when you first

00:06:03.156 --> 00:06:04.115
went to China with him?

00:06:04.115 --> 00:06:05.239
NED HEAGERTY: Yeah, you do.

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:07.410
You get a lot of offers,
a lot of freelance offers.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.370
It depends where
you are, of course.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:17.130
But I do remember the first
few trips to China with David.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.180
It was interesting because
I realized from this side,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.050
I looked at tea and I thought,
well, what a wonderful product.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.210
Even back-- this would be 2001,
2002 is when I'm first meeting

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.410
David--

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.830
I'm already looking
at tea and saying,

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.910
tea really has a great future.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.790
There's an aging
population here.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.280
There's the health benefits.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.870
There's certainly
a culture that's

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.730
looking for some diversity.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.110
People are appreciating
quality increasingly.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.670
So all the trends were there.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.970
But it still is here and there.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.530
And so my concern
was, how do I validate

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.720
that I can do what David did?

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.960
Is this a doable business model?

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.060
Because I'll qualify,
I'm a tea trader.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.690
I sell tea.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:10.620
That's my business.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.650
I'm not in the business
of the ceremony

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.070
or necessarily the
cultural side of it.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.220
I sell tea.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.050
But I recognize at the same
time that that's a relationship.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.820
It was my understanding of Asia
from prior business in Asia

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.160
that it was very much
based on relationships.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.860
So when we went to
China the first time,

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.890
we actually gathered
all of the key suppliers

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.740
that we could identify,
which was about eight people

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:46.860
from various provinces in China,
easily six different provinces.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.480
And we all gathered in the
city of Fuzhou along the coast

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.280
and spent a weekend together--
essentially just visiting,

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.590
and talking about tea, tasting
tea, taking hikes, eating food.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.390
And that was sort of--

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.450
that was my first introduction.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.050
And it's a cast of characters--

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:13.750
Mr. Song, Mr. [? Square, ?] Mr.
[? Chen Fin, ?] [? Chen Lu. ?]

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.560
So there's a group, and
that group's pretty much

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:22.020
remained intact with
some new players always.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:27.960
But that initial weekend
and then travel in China

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.930
was sort of--

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.169
it confirmed for me
that it would work,

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:37.500
that this was a way-- that
model that David had could work.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.140
It needed some work
on the business side.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.140
It needed to become a little
more practical, if you will,

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:48.210
a little more focused on what
markets exactly we could supply

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.580
and what we couldn't
do and refined.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.820
But the essential
model was there.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.400
Particularly that it
was specialty tea,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.180
high-grade teas, unusual
teas that I really

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:05.280
felt the US market was ready
for, was interested in.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.525
And I think over time
that's proven true.

00:09:08.525 --> 00:09:09.900
PAIGE SCHOENING:
And so you spent

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.930
a lot of time cultivating
these relationships.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.272
What's it like when you go now?

00:09:14.272 --> 00:09:15.480
What's it like to work with--

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.052
Mr. Song, correct?

00:09:17.052 --> 00:09:18.010
NED HEAGERTY: Mr. Song.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.150
PAIGE SCHOENING: So does he
set up places and times for you

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.100
to meet with folks?

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.060
Or if you could just
describe how that works.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.340
NED HEAGERTY:
Well, to an extent,

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:31.710
I think because we do
business in roughly six

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.490
to seven provinces we'll
draw from every year,

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:41.040
with emphasis on certain
provinces for a larger

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.800
share of our tea, of course--
but through our specialty teas,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.120
we'll go into a particular
province to secure.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:53.550
So generally speaking, the
way we approach it is we

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:58.020
believe that the best
teas are early spring

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.840
when the plant's fully alive.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.300
It's coming out of
the winter dormancy.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.630
And all of that
vibrant growth is

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.890
going up into the
leaf and bud, always

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:16.620
in that endless
pursuit of procreation.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.860
But that bud and those
first three leaves

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.070
are wonderful teas at
that time of the year.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.830
The flavors are very nuanced.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.550
They're vibrant.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.070
The leaves are
tender, everything.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.610
If you taste good
tea, that's the time.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.880
That's the best tea there is
in the world, in my opinion.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.810
So somewhere along the
line, like right now,

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.280
I'm beginning to
think about that.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.300
It's early March.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.250
Late March is when
the first teas

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.450
will start to come out in
a province like Fujian,

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.730
early whites and green teas.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:52.940
So we'll begin--

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.030
I'll, latter part of
March, travel to China,

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.300
try to get there before
the 1st of April.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.900
Hopefully if the
weather's been warm,

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.410
the first teas
will be coming out.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.710
We'll start seeing green teas.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:10.410
I'll meet Mr. Song in
Fuzhou, for example.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.160
And then we go into the
tea market and visit

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.280
with certain people in there
that we do business with.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.400
And I will usually have a
list or references of teas

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.340
that I've either bought prior
years that I really enjoyed

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.640
and that our customers
seemed to really enjoy

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.880
and some new things that
I might be curious for

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.290
and put that word out.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.780
And these men channel
sort of-- they're

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:42.060
our conduit, if you will,
to small farms in the area.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.230
Word goes out.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.030
And then over the
next week or so, we

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.890
begin to see samples come in.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.960
And we'll spend the day in
the tea market sampling tea.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.940
That would probably
be-- early on,

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.110
it'd be the Mao Feng green
teas and variations of that.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:04.890
There's just a raff of
varietals of Mao Feng now.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.800
If it grows on the north
slope, it's one taste and look.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.560
If it's on the south
slope, it's this.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.030
East and West, each one-- in
each soil, the elevation--

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.660
develops over time in a
farm a different taste, just

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.370
like wine.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.530
So we're in pursuit of that.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.602
And here's sort of our
wish list, if you will.

00:12:25.602 --> 00:12:26.310
And it'll go out.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:31.560
So Song and I will spend time
tasting basically all day--

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.670
from early in the day
until evening tasting tea.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:40.905
When we find a lot we like
that makes sense, fits,

00:12:40.905 --> 00:12:42.030
what would you like for it?

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.770
How much is there?

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:47.220
What can we do?

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.090
Song then steps in and sort of
handles everything from there.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:55.530
Once we've made the
purchase, procured the tea,

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.830
it will be shipped to a
warehouse where we repackage

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.780
it, get it into what we would
call high-grade packaging,

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.930
and vacuum seal it if
the leaf can handle that

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.115
or do a light vacuum, and put it
into a high-grade carton, stuff

00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:14.550
a container, and ship it here.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.770
And Song handles all that side.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:21.120
It's not easy to get tea
out of China necessarily,

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.000
particularly when you're
collecting from various areas.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.660
So he's extremely good at
that and has honed his skills.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.252
So I rely heavily
on him to do that.

00:13:31.252 --> 00:13:32.210
PAIGE SCHOENING: Right.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.350
And it sounds very complicated.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.350
And I'm curious to know
more about when you're

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.210
sitting there tasting teas.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.520
How many are you
tasting in a row?

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:45.050
And what notes are you looking
for in the different teas?

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.930
And are you thinking
about your customers' tea

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.280
preferences or your own?

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.470
Or how does that all work?

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.210
NED HEAGERTY: Yeah, that's a--

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:58.250
I think it's extremely important
to think about the customer.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.500
I've learned over time--

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.480
this'll be the 17th or 18th year
I've been to China to taste tea

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.290
and buy tea.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.530
One thing I've learned
in that time, what I like

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.210
may not be what
my customers like.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.180
So there's always that kind of--

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.510
that's the challenge
as a tea buyer.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.210
You need to find
the very best tea

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.490
that you can, but
at the same moment

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.380
be mindful of, what
would my customer--

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.090
would they follow me on this?

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:27.800
Would they recognize this tea?

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.190
Would they appreciate this
that I'm appreciating?

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.240
Because it can be
quite expensive.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:38.150
And I don't have a
secondary store to sell.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.820
If I can't sell it, it
stays in my warehouse

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.770
and becomes an issue.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.120
So you really do spend the day--

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.220
basically, it would be the
same set for tasting tea

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:56.270
as we'll use today, where
we set certain guidelines.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.360
The water in China will
always be filtered,

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.120
and that's important.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.200
They generally like to use water
right at boiling temperature.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.590
So even when we're tasting
high-grade greens and whites

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:14.330
and other teas, it is going
to be hit with very hot water.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.946
And some things are going
to probably be muted.

00:15:17.946 --> 00:15:19.320
There's ways to
work around that.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:19.820
And we do.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.550
If it's a particularly
interesting tea

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.250
and very expensive, I will
have them do an extra step

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.150
of cooling the water.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.530
But for the most
part, we'll sit down.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:30.770
We'll set rules.

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.120
Water's filtered.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.070
Water temperature's here.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:39.410
We're going to use two
grams for every five

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.450
to six ounces of water.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.670
We're going to steep
it two minutes.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.410
And those are the ground rules.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.780
So everything that comes
through during the day--

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.970
and literally what
happens is people

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.480
arrive, farmers will
arrive, and have tea

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.150
that they've just processed.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.950
And it's ready for market.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:01.520
Or it comes in via carrier,
or other tea shops,

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.270
or other farmers, and
cooperative representatives

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.790
come in and bring their samples.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:10.350
And we'll work through them.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:14.750
So we might taste anywhere
from 10 to 30 teas in a day,

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.620
doing the same process--
sitting at a table,

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:23.840
brewing, steeping the tea,
tasting it, and slurping it,

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.930
listening to it.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:35.630
And for me, each lot is noted
and then what taste profile

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.280
I gained from it.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.640
If there's a price,
what was the price?

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.360
All those attributes, so that
I have a long reference, pages

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.650
of notes, that I can reference
back and sometimes go back

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.640
the next day and say, I really
was interested in that lot

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.480
that we tasted yesterday.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.390
It was lot A or
whatever we labeled it.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.060
Is it still available?

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.120
But you work through those
teas and, in the course,

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.260
find the teas that
you like, inquire

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.950
as to quantity that's
available, pricing,

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.619
and see if you can
strike a deal for it.

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:16.990
And then word goes to that
farm and says, hold that lot.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:21.079
Silk Road Teas is
taking that lot.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:27.710
I think it's indicative of
China that there is just

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:32.840
a vast amount of tea that
comes out of the mountains--

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.730
particularly in an
area like Fuzhou

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.460
which, for many
years because it's

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.650
at the end of the
Min River there,

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:44.150
was an international port and
has a long history of tea.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.620
It just flows down
from the mountains,

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.930
and that's an ideal location--
high mountains in the area,

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.510
great amount of rainfall.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.100
It cools at night and
warms during the day.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.940
So tea really enjoys
that, and grows very well,

00:17:58.940 --> 00:17:59.930
and gets very lush.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.480
So it's a great spot to start.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.610
And then from there,
we work our way

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.310
to maybe the Wuyi
Mountains or sometimes

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:11.630
up to Fuding, a different area,
to procure different varietals

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.970
or to visit a farm we
haven't been to in a while

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.160
and see what's going on.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.092
And you end up with some
very interesting teas.

00:18:19.092 --> 00:18:20.050
PAIGE SCHOENING: I bet.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.160
And so when you're in these
different places, what

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.040
are the different
provinces known for?

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.720
Are there certain areas that
are known for certain teas?

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.640
NED HEAGERTY:
Yeah, very much so.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.880
Well, like Fujian,
for example, is widely

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.690
known for white and
green tea, and for what

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:41.298
I would call elegant black
teas-- such as golden monkey,

00:18:41.298 --> 00:18:46.450
a black Mao Feng, things of that
sort, really delicious teas.

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.249
The Wuyi blacks also.

00:18:49.249 --> 00:18:51.290
PAIGE SCHOENING: What do
you mean by elegant tea?

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.123
What's the difference
between an elegant tea

00:18:53.123 --> 00:18:54.710
and a non-elegant
tea, or black tea?

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:59.705
NED HEAGERTY: Well, I think
that there's different styles.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.870
From my perspective,
the Fujianese

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:13.340
like to make a black tea that
has really a wonderful mouth

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.080
taste and feel.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.480
But then what really
is impressive to me

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.420
is how it finishes
and lingers and what

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:27.230
you feel like in your upper
body as you finish tasting it.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:31.550
That sensation, there's an
elegance there between not only

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.650
is the leaf usually beautifully
shaped and quite small--

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.690
and the coloration is wonderful,
so there's some elegance coming

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.110
up out of that--

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.770
but then it makes me feel
that way as I taste it

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.100
and then as it finishes.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.740
Say, for example,
an Assam from India

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.160
tends to be much more
aggressive in the mouth.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.990
It's much stronger
in the taste feel.

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:56.570
They really like a lot of mouth.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:01.040
So as each culture develops
their taste profile,

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.150
it sort of plays out.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:07.900
And Yunnan of course in China,
the Yunnan province, that taste

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.820
comes-- it's a
different varietal.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:15.200
And the flavor that they
look for is different also

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.010
and the finish.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.650
Although, again, I
think the Chinese--

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.830
for me, it's just
a characteristic

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.350
that I carry in
mind that I think

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.140
of when I think of
China is the finish,

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.960
and how you feel as you
drink tea with people,

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.283
and then as you feel
after you've consumed.

00:20:34.283 --> 00:20:35.550
Yeah.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:39.780
PAIGE SCHOENING: Now I want to
go back to the spring harvest

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.090
because I'm very curious.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.400
Is that-- are all tea buyers
around the world going

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.140
to China in the spring, or is it
just the specialty tea buyers?

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.810
Or are people buying
tea throughout the year?

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:54.630
Is this just the
special time of year?

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.830
NED HEAGERTY: Well, it's
changed a little bit over time.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:02.450
That's one of the notable
differences in the buying

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:05.291
pattern for the US.

00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:10.250
It used to be-- well, I should
qualify in the specialty tea

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:13.700
segment, which is
what we compete in

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:19.050
or offer teas in, that
those teas come out.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.860
And if you don't procure
them, then they're gone.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:26.390
So you're on an
annual buy basis.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.110
That tea comes up,
comes into the market,

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:35.330
or is available in the
specialty tea area.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.150
And then it's sold,
and it's gone.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:42.020
What happens is that's the
specialty tea, and that's

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:48.290
very characteristic I believe
of the traditional Chinese tea

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:53.660
culture, or tea market, tea
business in that it has always

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.830
been many, many small farms.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.560
And then each province
having special teas.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.040
And there's a real
sense in China

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.482
like if you're in
Zhejiang province, maybe

00:22:06.482 --> 00:22:08.690
you don't need to go to
Fujian because we have really

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.840
great green tea and white tea.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.800
And why would you go over there?

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.540
You have it here.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.690
But for a tea trader like
myself, or a tea purveyor,

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.360
you want to get the
best of each one.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.110
So that necessitates
travel to cull those out.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:28.760
But if you're not in that
specialty segment and not

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:32.210
buying smaller lots, which
is what we do-- we buy lots,

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.280
and we try and preserve them--

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.220
when you get into the larger
tea market, the export

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.640
market that's more controlled
by larger companies

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.100
and brokerage and
things of that sort,

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.640
you need to take various lots
and blend them and create

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.490
what's called a standard.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:53.960
Until China became a
free market economically,

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.730
everything in the tea business
was run by a standard.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:04.200
So if you wanted
Keemun 1110, every year

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.660
it would be exactly the same.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.810
And that tea in particular is
still pretty much the same.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.231
But all of the teas
had a standard,

00:23:11.231 --> 00:23:12.230
and you bought to those.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.420
But to maintain a
standard necessarily

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.480
meant you took varying
lots and combined

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:22.820
them to create an
appearance and taste that

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.450
fit that standard that the
export market expected.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:28.820
And so that still holds true.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.490
And in that case, you
can buy tea sequentially

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.330
across the year.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:37.250
It could get difficult
because sometimes those teas--

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:41.090
if China's domestic market turns
on to that tea for some reason,

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:46.310
that's instant, huge
competition for that tea.

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.530
You suddenly can get the
word that, I'm sorry,

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.830
but no, that tea's
gone for this year.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.570
And it would've
been the last thing

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.636
you'd expect because it's from
a large factory maybe in Yunnan.

00:23:57.636 --> 00:23:59.510
And it's a black, and
it's always been there.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:03.440
But China's starting
to drink black tea.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.900
It gets absorbed.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.310
So there is that--

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:16.590
it's becoming different
on the supply side.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:20.600
But you've had a little
bit in the specialty market

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.320
where we still have to
buy that tea and commit.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.240
And that's where I think it's
beneficial for the small farm

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.490
because they know we're
there, and we'll buy that tea.

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:41.540
But I think that
for the US market

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.050
has been primarily driven
by blended teas and more

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:46.880
standard teas.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.060
And most US tea
companies operate

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.840
from some sort of relationship
with a tea company

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.890
in China, a tea factory,
or a broker of some kind.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.520
So their universe
of teas is going

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.620
to be necessarily defined.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.780
And here are your
options for the year,

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.790
and you pick one of them.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.250
We, of course, have
said, well, we'd

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.760
like to have a wider option.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.660
But you have to put
that time commitment in,

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:18.300
and that means travel for a
few weeks in China at least.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.132
Yeah.

00:25:19.132 --> 00:25:20.007
PAIGE SCHOENING: Wow.

00:25:20.007 --> 00:25:22.700
And speaking of American
and Chinese markets,

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.590
how has the tea industry
changed or evolved

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:29.780
since you've been in it?

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.770
NED HEAGERTY: Well, I think
that certainly there's

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:40.440
pressure on China's side always
to respond to the market.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:46.520
So for specialty teas have
become increasingly popular

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.430
in domestic market China.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.410
Young Chinese, for example,
unlike their parents--

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.800
their parents always
drank green tea--

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.720
increasingly drink
white tea and black tea.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.330
So the prices of white
tea and black tea

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.940
have changed dramatically
in the last few years.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.530
And you just see more pressure.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:16.640
I think also you see it
for high-grade green teas.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.500
You might have seen many lots
and wonderful lots of something

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.730
made from a Mei Zhan
varietal in Fujian province.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.830
You don't see so
much of that anymore

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:33.050
just because the pricing for
export has become very high,

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.920
so it becomes impractical
to sell it outside of China.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.680
But the domestic market
is also there to buy it.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.210
And they can get--

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.950
as per capita incomes
rise in China,

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.330
there is a robust market
to buy that and consume it.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:51.230
And I think you're just seeing
an awakening on China's side,

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.130
just like we have to food.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:55.620
It sort of trails.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:59.600
As incomes rise and
education levels rise,

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.700
people look for better
food, better clothes,

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.872
better electronics.

00:27:02.872 --> 00:27:03.830
They want those things.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:10.250
So tea meets that same
criteria or change.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:11.540
So pricing changes.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.890
Availability changes.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.150
And then you also--

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:20.390
as we become more stringent
or more strict, if you will--

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:24.090
and I realize it's
all for the better--

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:28.650
with organic and EU
standards and just

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:32.460
FDA regulations for
this side, there's

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.350
a little bit on China's
side, why would we

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.290
bother to battle that out?

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:40.860
We can sell it China side for
pretty much the same price,

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.660
if not even sometimes
a better price.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.020
So you're getting a
little bit of that hedging

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.970
also in the specialty
tea markets.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.880
So some companies a
little less interested

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.450
in doing business in the
US over the last few years.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.395
So I thought today we'd
try some specialty teas.

00:27:58.395 --> 00:28:04.230
And we'll go through
quickly just a survey.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.940
You probably know
there's arguably--

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.800
or there are six
varieties of tea in China.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.200
We're only going to discuss
five because there's

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.370
a little bit of overlap.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:15.450
There's white.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:20.900
There's green, oolong, black,
Pu-erh, and yellow tea.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.690
And yellow's probably the least
known in the United States.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:27.930
And that's generally
because it's

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:33.480
very similar to a
green tea, but it

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.120
does have an extra
steam in the process

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.330
to heighten its sweetness.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:45.410
But I think that's a small
enough differential there

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.290
that we're not going
to touch on that today.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:50.130
So I'd like to start
you with what I think

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.660
is indicative of our company.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.360
It's called Drum
Mountain White Cloud.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.190
This is a white tea.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:00.570
And white teas-- why don't you,
if you'd like, just [SNIFFS]..

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:03.900
I should tell you,
when you buy tea,

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.690
there's three things that
you want to do with tea.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.190
First, of course,
you look at it.

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.650
And you say, well, does
this even look interesting?

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:12.870
Would I want to consume this?

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.060
And let's assume that you do.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.460
Then you want to see
what the aroma's like.

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.220
And with tea, hopefully without
getting too much up your nose,

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:25.024
you do a [SNIFFS] just
a quick sniff like that.

00:29:25.024 --> 00:29:26.940
And it should hit you,
and it should tell you.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.090
And that's the second test.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.300
Does it smell-- is
the aroma something

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.250
that I think I'd like to taste?

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:36.120
And if it passes those two
steps, you're on your way.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.830
And you do what I'm doing here.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:43.620
You do the infusion,
and steep the tea,

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:48.480
and see in fact if it does
taste, according to you,

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.150
to be something that you'd
like to drink or buy.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:58.290
So Drum Mountain White Cloud
is from Fujian province

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:01.020
on the coast, very
near Fuzhou, which

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.570
I mentioned earlier
is our point of entry

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:06.250
generally to the tea
harvest in China.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.730
And Drum Mountain
White Cloud grows

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.990
on a mountain called Guo Shan.

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.300
Its origination
was Buddhist monks.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:20.550
They cultivated it,
one, to assist them

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:23.460
with the caffeine in meditation.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.060
But then it quickly
became apparent

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:30.570
that it was quite popular
and had commercial value.

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:35.510
So they began to
market it and sell it.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:40.170
And so it's become quite
a popular tea actually,

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:44.480
probably more so on
China's side than US side.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.270
No, we're ready.

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:46.710
PAIGE SCHOENING: To pour.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:48.626
NED HEAGERTY: I think
we could pour those off.

00:30:48.626 --> 00:30:50.880
Yeah, thank you.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:55.200
So white tea is the
least oxidized, arguably

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.640
the most natural of teas.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:07.530
It essentially gets plucked,
sorted, cleaned, if you will.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:11.490
And then it's
dried, essentially.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:14.320
So it's very natural, as you
can see by the leaf structure.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.070
There's no shaping to it.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:23.070
It comes straight across, pretty
much as it came off the plant.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:25.260
And the silver is unopened bud.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:30.660
I think it's important
at this point

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:36.480
to articulate another thing
about why these teas taste

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.150
the way they taste and why
it's so important to buy

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:42.280
the early pluck teas.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.410
Tea plants are what you
call apical dominant.

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:50.700
So in other words,
you have a stem

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.490
that grows up in the
spring and shoots up.

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:56.940
And that's going to have
a bud at the top, a leaf,

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.140
and another leaf.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.790
So you get that classic--

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.470
that's called a fine pluck.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:05.970
That either one leaf and a
bud, two leaves and a bud, even

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:09.500
down sometimes to three
leaves and a bud, and up

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.640
is called the fine pluck.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.610
For high-end
specialty teas, you're

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:15.990
not going any lower than that.

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:17.920
How does that taste?

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.750
Is it good?

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:26.270
It should be sweet side
and nice, soft mouthfeel.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:30.440
But apical dominance--
so the plant--

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.450
in other words, larger
leaves down below

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.930
are left on the tea
bush to photosynthesize

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:37.340
to send energy up.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.150
And of course, the roots
are gathering all they can

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.230
of the nutrients in the soils.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:50.120
Everything's going upward to
get to procreation, if you will.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.850
But you want to pluck
that before that bud opens

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:53.600
to a flower.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.030
The flower is not
used for drinking tea,

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.020
generally speaking.

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.820
Some people drink
them, but mostly they

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:03.350
press that flower to
cull an oil which is used

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:06.380
in processing of tea leaves.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:11.105
For example, with Dragon Well,
in the wok to create an oil,

00:33:11.105 --> 00:33:14.450
the tea flower has
an oil that they

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:19.160
use to help lubricate
that leaf on the wok.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:26.400
So white tea is generally
one of the first teas

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.380
up certainly in the spring.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:33.614
And primarily in Fujian
province is where these--

00:33:33.614 --> 00:33:39.840
this particular tea is near
Fuzhou, Ghu Shan mountain.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.740
But then another
famous area is Fuding.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:47.820
And Fuding is more known for the
Silver Needle Yinzhen and White

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:53.580
Peony, which we also have
here but have opted not--

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.940
but we won't taste today.

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:56.770
But I did want to
mention one other.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.620
This is called White Empress.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.590
And this gets back a little
bit to that earlier notation

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:04.650
about Chinese tea culture
and the small farm.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:08.670
So this is made to white tea.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:11.280
It's a Mei Zhan varietal,
which I mentioned earlier.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.679
And we'll see a
thread here where

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.900
it starts with this white tea.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.480
But it's also been made to a
green tea, which we're going

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.310
to taste, called Wild Green.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.210
And then it ends up
also as a black tea.

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.270
So the farmer's
taken the same bud

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:29.070
and leaves and created three
different styles of tea.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:32.610
And that's I think highly
indicative of the Chinese tea

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:36.929
culture, where you don't have
the large monoculture like you

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:38.610
do in India broad.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:39.870
You do in the Darjeelings.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:43.110
You have quite a bit of this
customization, if you will.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.449
But generally, there's
a cloning going on.

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:49.440
And the factories get very large
and create large, large lots.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.739
China still is very much
driven by the smaller,

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:55.409
specialty aspects, or tastes.

00:34:55.409 --> 00:35:01.050
So we're going to
taste Wild Green, which

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:07.800
is also a local green
tea, Fujian province.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:12.170
This one is also grown
very close to Fuzhou.

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:13.220
I'm sorry.

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.300
This is a handmade green.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.900
As I mentioned earlier, it's
made from a varietal called

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.110
the Mei Zhan.

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:26.370
M-E-I Z-H-A-N is one spelling.

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:28.500
And I will admit in
China, these things

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:32.730
tend to be spelled
very often differently

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.530
and articulated differently.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:38.040
Again, that's a little bit
of the localization of tea.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:44.820
But in this case, this tea
is made on a small farm

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.040
by a gentleman by
the name of Mr. Wen.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.890
And I think Mr. Wen deserves
a little bit of notation

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:52.230
here because Mr.
Wen for many years

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.540
was our supplier
of Jasmine Pearls.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.050
He's an excellent
person with jasmine.

00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:02.550
The scenting is very
difficult to do well.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:06.090
Wen now is retired and
has a small tea farm.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:10.380
And every year, he invites
us out to taste tea.

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.850
And he will create--

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:13.410
he did White Empress.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:14.970
He's done the Wild Green.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:16.920
And he's done the
Black Fragrance.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.500
Those are all made from,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.170
the same pluck, if you will.

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:25.454
But he's made three different
styles of tea from them.

00:36:25.454 --> 00:36:26.620
And they're very high-grade.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:30.690
They're great tasting and
I think very indicative

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.160
of tea culture.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.940
So I'm honored that
he thinks of us,

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.750
and brings us out, and
allows us to taste tea.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:41.360
And they're always delicious.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.380
He makes very small lots.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:47.100
We buy enough to supply
hopefully our customer base.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.720
We don't wholesale these teas.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.140
These are made for our
individual customers, our tea

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.600
lovers if you will.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.790
I think we'll try that, yeah.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:58.680
I should note here
also as we go,

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.380
I realize I'm passing a
bit of information here.

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:08.490
But this is a traditional
Chinese tea service table.

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:12.690
And in China, it's
very typical I

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:16.500
think, generally
speaking, to brew

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:22.860
your tea in the gaiwan, which
is a long, long service tea

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:30.090
vehicle, if you will, and
then to decant to the service

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:33.090
pitcher at the moment where
you like the taste of the tea.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:36.316
So it doesn't continue to steep.

00:37:36.316 --> 00:37:39.340
The gaiwan is great
because, again,

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.350
when you're buying tea,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:42.340
you're going to look at it.

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:43.381
You're going to smell it.

00:37:43.381 --> 00:37:45.030
And then you're
going to brew it.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.310
And then it's going to
be you've poured off,

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:49.230
and you're now
going to taste it.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:54.480
And herein is where you get
from the lid, there's the aroma.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.130
That tells me--

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:59.040
I've got a glimpse
now of what this tea--

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.860
the aroma of the tea and
a little foreshadowing,

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:05.160
if you will, of the
taste profile of the tea.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.350
Plus, I'm now seeing the leaf--

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:12.210
in this case, a very
strong leaf, deep green.

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:16.110
This is a classic example
of a steamed green tea

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:17.240
from Fujian province.

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:24.970
What do you think?

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:26.017
Reasonable?

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:33.440
OK.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:47.170
So five or six varieties of tea.

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:51.200
So we have the white,
which is minimal.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.820
It's pretty much just
natural as it's plucked.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.620
You have green, which
is kept green by doing

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:03.550
a primary or preliminary--
primary's what it's usually

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:07.742
called-- firing to stop
the oxidization process.

00:39:07.742 --> 00:39:09.700
And then you're making
your decision from there

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.710
about the chemical
side of it, how

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:17.800
you're going to process the tea
to make the flavors that you

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.790
want inherent in it.

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:21.160
But it's important to
stop the oxidization

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:27.560
process at that point, and
shape it, and then fire it.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:32.320
It holds it as a green tea and
locks in the flavors and aromas

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.730
that you have decided that
you want your tea to hold.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:43.930
So midway between a white
tea and, say, a Pu-erh

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:51.670
or a black tea is oolong
tea, which is semi-oxidized.

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:56.980
It's by far the most
complex of Chinese teas

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:03.850
and by far the most
arduous in the manufacture.

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:07.180
Anywhere from eight
to, say, 18 steps

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:11.500
may be required to
make the tea, depending

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.880
on what the tea maker
wants as an end product,

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:20.010
and/or the flavors that
they're looking for,

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:21.415
the traditions in the area.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:30.370
There are generally
two oolongs in China.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:32.050
There are two styles of oolong.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:35.710
There's the Tieguanyin, which
is what we're tasting here,

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:41.080
which is principally
Fujian province.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.620
And then there is
the Dan Cong style,

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.620
which is higher
mountain and higher fire

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.790
and is from Guangdong province.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:55.210
In both cases, they
are prize teas in China

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:59.300
and are considered to be
the most complex in flavor.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:06.180
Another-- by rattling these
leaves also you get a little--

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.702
again, you're building to
see what this taste has.

00:41:09.702 --> 00:41:11.410
And what I've done
there is I've given it

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:16.905
a preliminary wash, which is
done to awaken the tea leaves.

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:25.960
This tea, I think it's probably
in the neighborhood of about

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.410
18 steps, considerate
of all things,

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:32.860
to make this tea to the
rolled format it is,

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.280
which is what-- if you
look at it closely,

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.970
it somewhat looks
like a golf club.

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:40.570
It usually has a little stem
off of it and a rolled ball.

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:45.580
So mindful of all of that
process it's been through,

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.740
you want to give
it a quick rinse

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.800
to begin the process of
unbundling that leaf,

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.860
unfurling that leaf, and letting
its flavors and aromas cut

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.780
loose.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.260
Do we have some
hot water for this?

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.360
We need a nice--

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.810
I would recommend
with oolong tea

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:09.850
that we use a boiling water.

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:13.810
You need it to really
wake this tea up

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:19.180
and get those leaves opened.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:24.460
It's generally held that the
first steep is for aroma.

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.760
And the second,
third, but arguably,

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.040
typically for a very high-grade
like this, a low oxidized

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.340
Tieguanyin style,
it's going to be

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:37.510
in the third or the fourth
steep that the aromas

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:40.840
and flavors really start
to come out of the leaf.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.100
It takes about that long.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:48.400
And then I would typically
steep up to seven times

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.800
before the leaf is spent.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.810
These are going to be
quite large leaves.

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:03.270
Tieguanyin comes out later
than the greens and white teas.

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:08.760
So you have the areas, the more
inner areas of Fujian, active,

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.860
and there's lots of
green teas and white teas

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.910
and some black teas coming out.

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:18.030
And then about four to six weeks
later on the coast of Fujian,

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:19.890
the good oolongs
start to arrive.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:22.940
There is-- one class
of the Tieguanyin

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:24.900
is called Huangjin Gui.

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.050
Many people market
it as a jade oolong.

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:29.790
It's a very much
smaller varietal.

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.490
It does come out
early in the spring.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:35.970
But for the most part, these
higher-grade Tieguanyins,

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:41.325
low-oxidized, come up a
little later in the harvest.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:49.140
This is a low-oxidized
Tieguanyin.

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:57.290
China has traditionally liked a
more oxidized, medium oxidized

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:58.810
Tieguanyin, which is--

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:02.340
you hear it more
marketed as Iron Goddess.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:09.030
And it's more brownside as
they let it oxidize a bit more.

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:14.280
These teas, I think arguably
it was the influence

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.350
of Taiwan moving--

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:20.080
Taiwan has always had the Li
Shan and other high mountain

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.560
Tieguanyin-style oolongs.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.380
Theirs have always
been low-oxidized.

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.080
The world market was so
appreciative of that,

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.710
China's side mainland
started to really amp up

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:34.560
its production of
those years ago

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.540
to compete and get
some exposure as well,

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:42.430
gain some of that market.

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:44.100
So you saw a little
bit of movement

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:47.880
away from the medium
oxidized Tieguanyins.

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:59.920
This, that we won't taste
but I can certainly show you,

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.950
is Plum.

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:02.700
This is the Dan Cong style--

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.910
as you can see,
diametrically different.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.210
It's a long leaf.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:10.250
It's called Plum
Fragrance not because it's

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:12.020
been infused with anything.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.250
There's nothing added to it.

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:15.000
It's just reminiscent of it.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.680
The varietal reminds
people of plum.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.170
It's very aromatic.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:25.370
It's quite toasty,
almondy almost, in flavor.

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:29.060
And again, it's a
very high fire tea

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:32.735
that takes quite a
while to open and taste.

00:45:35.117 --> 00:45:37.700
PAIGE SCHOENING: Ned, we talked
a little bit about it earlier.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:41.030
But how do these
teas get their names?

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:42.770
NED HEAGERTY: That's always--

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:46.730
some are traditional, go
back to the beginning.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:52.340
In some cases, locals
will name a tea.

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:56.420
In some cases, we have
applied names to them.

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:59.390
Drunken Concubine, of
course that's a name

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:02.210
we put to the Tieguanyin
for the US consumer.

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:06.200
We think it sort of makes it
more inviting, if you will.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:10.910
It opens the door, if
you will, to this tea.

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:16.130
I can imagine trying to sell
Tian Mu Qing Ding in a grocery

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:20.740
store in Ohio
could be difficult.

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.570
It could be difficult
in San Francisco.

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:27.650
Heavenly Blue Peak,
on the other hand,

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:32.240
evokes some ahh,
something ethereal,

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.300
something a little more relaxed
and adventuresome, if you will.

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:39.710
So we're respectful of
that and mostly wanting

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:44.596
to get good tea into
people, into their lives.

00:46:44.596 --> 00:46:46.220
I think one thing I
wanted to mention--

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:52.160
your asking that has reminded me
that one of the processes that

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:58.430
I think you use when you
buy tea and drink tea--

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:00.710
our minds have a
great ability when

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:04.530
we've tasted something really
good to recognize that.

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:06.950
And so when you're
buying tea, when

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:09.170
you know a taste
that you've liked,

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:14.835
and you're in the situation of
sampling tea or tasting tea,

00:47:14.835 --> 00:47:15.710
you have that moment.

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:19.250
If you concentrate, you'll
pull back up that taste.

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:20.180
There it is.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.700
And then you know
that's good tea.

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:26.030
And I know from my side,
that's incredibly important

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:29.182
because in a marketplace
environment trying to buy tea,

00:47:29.182 --> 00:47:30.890
there's usually a lot
of things going on,

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:32.220
a lot of pressure to buy.

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.310
Let's make a deal.

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:37.190
And somehow or other, you've
got to pull up that resource

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.790
and remind.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:40.550
But I've always been
impressed with our ability

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:42.410
to remember things we like.

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:44.930
And I think you apply that
in the process of buying tea,

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:47.944
and you will succeed.

00:47:47.944 --> 00:47:50.330
AUDIENCE: I have a
question for you.

00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:52.589
You mentioned that
the plum scent was not

00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:53.380
infused with plums.

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:55.220
But one of the
things that I've seen

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.380
is a lot of oolongs are
one of the ones that

00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:05.590
are more flavored, like the
[INAUDIBLE] or the ginseng.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:09.992
Do you do any of the
flavored oolongs?

00:48:09.992 --> 00:48:10.700
NED HEAGERTY: No.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.960
I mean we don't.

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:15.440
We've never ventured
into the flavored market.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.360
As close as we come--

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:20.520
but I like to respond
to the opportunity.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:24.860
And I have noticed, for
example, an interest

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:30.260
in white chrysanthemum being put
into a low-oxidized Tieguanyin.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:31.730
That makes a wonderful taste.

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:36.020
Well, joining those two
naturals to create something,

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:36.980
yes, we do that.

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:38.570
We will blend.

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:40.430
But the additive market is--

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:43.760
I don't think we're
going to go there.

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.960
That's respectful
again of that--

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.580
I look at if the--

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.820
if we've done our
job, we've found

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.670
somebody who has taken a
tremendous amount of time

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:57.380
to cultivate and
manufacture a flavor.

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.330
And we go to China,
and we taste those.

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:00.740
And we say, this is good flavor.

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.270
This should come home.

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:03.750
And I want to--

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:07.160
as we say in Silk Road
Teas, we want to get out

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.450
of the way of the tea.

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:10.520
Let the tea come
through to the customer,

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:14.300
and they'll recognize.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:17.780
So are we doing a second
steep on the Tieguanyin?

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.770
That's great.

00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:22.550
I think I'm going to push us
because I know you guys want

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:24.650
to get back to work.

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:25.550
Right?

00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:27.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:32.180
NED HEAGERTY: This
is Black Fragrance.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:38.360
On that theme again of China,
and respectful of the specialty

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:42.140
tea market and its individuality
and the small farm,

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:45.140
again, Mr. Wen in
his resourcefulness

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:51.170
made White Empress, Wild
Green, and Black Fragrance.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:54.940
Same varietal, and
this tea is now black.

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:56.190
So it's fully oxidized.

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:58.290
Essentially, what he's
done is he's plucked it.

00:49:58.290 --> 00:49:59.580
He's sorted it.

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.170
He's withered it.

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:04.650
He's then let it oxidize.

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:06.540
And then he's shaped it.

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:07.710
And then he's fired it.

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:08.740
But now it's black.

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.680
It's fully oxidized.

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:16.170
And the leaf has been
shaped to a certain extent.

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:19.000
And there's a little bit
of mix of bud in there,

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:25.200
but generally speaking just
high-grade top of the leaf

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:29.440
or the stem, bud,
and top two leaves.

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:30.124
Thank you.

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:44.240
Now you'll notice that I
am not measuring this out,

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.160
other than visually.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.950
And that's purposeful
in the sense

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:54.440
that I really like to
try and demystify tea.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:58.970
I'm very respectful of making
the best possible cup you can.

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:00.800
But I also don't
like to see people

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.190
agonize too much over
how much tea I'm using.

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:07.610
It's an exploration.

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:12.320
As I mentioned earlier, when
we're buying tea, we tend to--

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:16.250
if you would, there's
for the aroma.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:19.400
You go through your process,
and you taste the teas

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.580
that you like.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.500
And then as you
get to know a tea,

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:26.950
you begin to realize, I like it
at about this amount of time,

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:28.390
about this amount of leaf.

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:31.060
And you get that visual set up.

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.040
And that's the
exploration of tea

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:38.200
is finding that spot that's
your sweet spot that you enjoy.

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.660
And it's very easy.

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:45.550
So what I'm trying to do there
is somewhere around 3 grams.

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:47.470
That's a 7-ounce gaiwan.

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:50.590
Around 3 grams, but I'm
just doing it visually.

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:53.350
And I'm going to keep
the steep time probably

00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:55.630
about a minute and
a half on this tea

00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:57.700
because it is quite strong.

00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:00.850
And I think at that
moment, my sense

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:05.000
is with tea that you're getting
the full flavor profile,

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.670
if you will.

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:10.270
Teas-- at that time,
there will be notes

00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:13.690
that the tea maker
has left in the leaf

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:17.050
or accentuated in the leaf.

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:19.990
And those notes open early on.

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:24.070
The longer you steep a tea,
the more compacted the flavors

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:25.090
become.

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:28.540
Stronger flavors begin to
overwhelm lesser flavors.

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:32.890
So I recommend with
high-grade, specialty teas,

00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:37.210
you keep your steep times
down so you get the range.

00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:40.180
But of course, if you
like a lot of flavor

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:44.190
in the morning and a little
more punch, let it go.

00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:45.460
But you ascertain that.

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:48.730
But relax about the quantities.

00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:51.160
And you'll know when
you've put too much tea in.

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:55.120
I do it often, even in
these types of situations,

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.019
where I taste it, and
it's not the taste

00:52:57.019 --> 00:52:58.060
I was hoping to give you.

00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:01.930
But I think this will succeed.

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:08.232
So with the gaiwan, you can
encourage it like this also

00:53:08.232 --> 00:53:09.940
to speed up in its process.

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:16.744
I think we can taste this.

00:53:16.744 --> 00:53:17.660
It smells pretty good.

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:27.620
So fully-oxidized black
tea, of course, should--

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:31.100
if you like, that's a
very enjoyable aroma--

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:35.060
should be this kind of coppery
to red, which indicates

00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.920
oxidization.

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:39.900
If it was a Yunnan red,
it would be bright red.

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.590
But this Mei Zhan
varietal, that's

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:44.660
the coppery sort
of reddish color

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:48.230
that it comes to
when it's steeped.

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:53.440
I think in this process,
the leaf is slow growing.

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:55.470
And so the processing
of the leaf

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:58.920
is actually quite delicate.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.780
A little bit too
much temperature,

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:05.370
and it knocks its nice, sweet,
multi flavors into a bakey note

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:06.970
pretty quickly.

00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:09.890
It's a fine line that the
tea maker has to maintain.

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.205
PAIGE SCHOENING: Thank you.

00:54:28.205 --> 00:54:29.220
Yeah.

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:30.428
This is all really excellent.

00:54:30.428 --> 00:54:32.740
Does anyone have
any other questions?

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:35.402
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you have

00:54:35.402 --> 00:54:37.488
an opinion on
where Europe stands

00:54:37.488 --> 00:54:40.586
compared to the US in
appreciating green tea.

00:54:40.586 --> 00:54:42.420
Do you see lots of traders--

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:44.343
I mean, traders from Europe--

00:54:44.343 --> 00:54:48.071
competing for the same
specialty teas that you buy?

00:54:48.071 --> 00:54:48.862
NED HEAGERTY: Yeah.

00:54:48.862 --> 00:54:49.880
The Europeans--

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:49.970
PAIGE SCHOENING: Go ahead.

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:51.580
Let me repeat the
question real quick.

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:56.450
He was asking about kind of
how tea is in Europe, right?

00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:59.412
AUDIENCE: Well, if it's the
same level of interest or more--

00:54:59.412 --> 00:55:00.370
PAIGE SCHOENING: Right.

00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:03.320
So if there's the same level
of interest in tea in Europe

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:05.100
as there is in other places.

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:05.891
NED HEAGERTY: Yeah.

00:55:05.891 --> 00:55:09.090
I would venture, if it
was a race of some kind,

00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:11.900
that Europe's a little
bit ahead of us.

00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:17.210
I think certainly the
Germans and the Dutch

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:22.190
made early entry into China.

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:23.780
And they have great teas, yeah.

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:31.020
There is a high level of
interest in specialty teas.

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.820
Europe, though, is a
little bit like the US--

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:36.340
a lot of blends, frankly.

00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:39.920
People have really taken
blending to another level.

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:43.270
And I think what we're seeing
is a little bit of that's

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:46.210
been sort of the tea model,
if you will, blended tea.

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:49.682
Everyone thinks,
this is really great.

00:55:49.682 --> 00:55:51.640
We're seeing a little
bit of unbundling of that

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.740
and getting back
more to something

00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:57.430
like this-- single origin,
nothing done to it.

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:58.570
Enjoy it as it is.

00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:04.540
But Europeans definitely
I think appreciate tea,

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:07.310
have it more ingrained
in their culture.

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:11.260
So yeah, we're young
at tea, frankly,

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:14.590
in this country-- the Northeast
United States pretty active,

00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:16.480
Southeast United States.

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.440
Out here, we're very active
in the greater Bay Area.

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:24.870
But it falls off precipitously
also in other areas.

00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:28.942
But the specialty tea market
is growing dramatically

00:56:28.942 --> 00:56:30.025
also in the United States.

00:56:32.409 --> 00:56:33.950
PAIGE SCHOENING: So
the question was,

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:36.130
we drink a lot of
coffee in this office.

00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:40.930
How do we encourage maybe
more people to drink tea?

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:44.740
NED HEAGERTY: There's a
few good reasons for that.

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:48.310
I think coffee's
sort of ingrained

00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:50.710
for that startup in the morning.

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:52.780
I don't see us getting
around that other

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:57.220
than maybe a Pu-erh tea because
you can brew it very strong.

00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.860
It looks like an espresso--

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:02.380
deep rich color, full-bodied.

00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:04.390
And it makes you feel good.

00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:09.740
I think the key for people
working during the day,

00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:16.360
particularly who are in offices,
is that the caffeination in tea

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:19.350
mostly activates in
the mind, in the brain,

00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:23.010
the hippocampus areas,
areas like that.

00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:25.490
And you don't need
your body that much.

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:27.610
In fact, you'd like to
kind of hold it in reserve.

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:32.200
And so tea is very good at
stimulating mental activity.

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.900
It takes about seven hours
for the caffeine in tea

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:36.340
to work through.

00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:38.770
But I think the
model that I promote

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:42.100
is, we're going to be a
coffee culture in the morning.

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:42.690
Great.

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:46.120
But once you're here, and you're
settled down, and you're good,

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:49.690
you're working, oolong
tea or other teas

00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:55.780
are very much more refreshing
and stimulating for the mind.

00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.740
They also go better with food.

00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:02.430
It's not so obstructive of
food, much less acidity.

00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:04.300
And you've got health
benefits, of course.

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:05.950
You can always
market to the health.

00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:08.410
But I think for
practicality's sake,

00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:10.960
if people get in the
rhythm of a little coffee

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.540
and then maybe
transition a little tea

00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:15.260
or maybe a little
mix of the two--

00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:18.130
but tea can really
be very beneficial

00:58:18.130 --> 00:58:23.500
just in allowing you to
think clearly and not

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.380
have to wear your body
out at the same time.

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.191
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:58:31.191 --> 00:58:32.190
NED HEAGERTY: Thank you.

00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:33.280
PAIGE SCHOENING:
Thank you so much.

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.020
I really appreciate
having you, so thank you.

00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:35.520
NED HEAGERTY: Thank you.

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:36.510
Thank you for coming.

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:37.490
I appreciate it.

00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:40.240
[APPLAUSE]
