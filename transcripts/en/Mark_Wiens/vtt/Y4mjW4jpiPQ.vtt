00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.880
- Hey everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.713
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.713 --> 00:00:04.390
I'm in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and today

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.700
for lunch we're going to a restaurant

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.070
that specializes in a dish
called Masak Lemak Cili Padi,

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.770
which is a Malaysian
coconut milk spicy curry,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.810
but this is not your average version.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.580
They make it with smoked ducked,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.700
and so they have this entire rack

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.820
of just slow, smoking ducks.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.653
They chop it up.

00:00:22.653 --> 00:00:23.860
They make it into a curry.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.210
It looks absolutely
sensationally incredible.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.010
And, we're on our way there now.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.720
I cannot wait to show
lunch, and all the food

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.333
with you in this video right now.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.250
(upbeat pop music)

00:00:40.104 --> 00:00:40.937
(door clanks)

00:00:40.937 --> 00:00:43.264
(upbeat pop music)

00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:45.830
About 25 kilometers south of the center

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.417
of Kuala Lumpur, in an area called Kajang.

00:00:48.417 --> 00:00:50.840
Actually, it's a separate
city called Kajang.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.460
When I was coming on
this trip to Malaysia,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.860
I reached out on social media

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.420
to people in Malaysia,
asking where to eat.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.930
And, let me just find it on my phone,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.040
but Muhammad, he wrote a comment saying,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.410
Mark, do visit Itik Salai Mastar,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.640
which is for smoked duck,
in Sungai Ramal, Kajang.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.500
The taste is beyond imagination.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.780
You will be planning to stay

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.870
in Malaysia once you tried it.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.810
The food looks unbelievably good,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.700
and wait 'til you see
they're just racked display,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.985
their grill loaded with ducks.

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:22.902
(upbeat pop music)

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.050
That was about a 30 minute drive.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.070
We got here a little bit early,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.950
about 30 minutes before they open,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.270
and you can already smell the aroma,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.440
and see the smoke coming from the ducks,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.450
but it looks like people are
already starting to come early.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.019
There are a couple guys on
motorbikes just waiting.

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:45.360
(grill sizzling)

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.193
Whoa.

00:01:46.193 --> 00:01:47.380
(chef speaks in foreign language).

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.541
Is it (speaks in foreign language)?

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:52.089
(Mark and chef speaking
in foreign language)

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.922
This is unbelievable.

00:01:52.922 --> 00:01:54.270
Let me show you the grill situation.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300
So, the smoked ducks, which
is what they're really famous

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.000
for, are just hanging up along here.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.310
You can just hear them hissing
and the juices dripping,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.950
but the entire grill is
just completely loaded.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.860
These look like massive steaks.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.500
There's catfish, there's chicken,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.350
and what's also very interesting,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.540
unique, about this restaurant,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.610
is that they are burning
all coconut shells.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.010
I just see he's just
tossing some in right now.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.704
Ah, okay, it's all coconut shells.

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:21.537
(motorbike roars)

00:02:25.337 --> 00:02:26.530
(coconuts clank)

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.284
(fan whirls)

00:02:28.284 --> 00:02:29.512
Cold catfish.

00:02:29.512 --> 00:02:30.580
- Catfish.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.858
- Here's your order.

00:02:31.858 --> 00:02:33.624
(crowd laughs)

00:02:33.624 --> 00:02:35.110
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.032
- [Mark] Cool.

00:02:36.032 --> 00:02:38.710
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.031
(knife clattering)

00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:42.650
Whoa.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.493
Chop an entire duck just in
one swift, hard knife chop.

00:02:47.493 --> 00:02:50.410
(knife clattering)

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.380
What's unique about this
place is, first of all,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.780
they have smoked duck,
which is not that common

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.180
to find, but next they
only burn coconut shells,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.510
not even the husks, but
it's the coconut shells.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.760
So, they toss that into the
fire, which is an indirect heat.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.510
They have the fan blowing on the flames,

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.420
so that burns the coconut
shells, blows the smoke

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.780
into the grill, which then the
smoke comes up onto the beef,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.910
onto the duck, onto the
chicken, onto the catfish.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.620
So, they have a number of
different meats, but really,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.940
I think everybody comes here
for the duck, and then, well,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.010
everything else as well.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.320
We're gonna try to order
everything that they have.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.570
They're so friendly to us.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.280
All the ducks and the
meat is smoking back here,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.320
but then on this side of the kitchen

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.810
is where they're doing more
of the other dishes there.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.530
It looks like some of the smoked duck,

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.520
which they are making into curries.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.930
She's mixing in the coconut milk.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.030
You can smell the aroma
of the curry paste,

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.460
the spices, the lemongrass.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.340
That just is blooming which spice

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.921
and flavor and that smokey duck.

00:03:52.921 --> 00:03:54.935
(coconut milk burbles)

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:55.826
- [Woman Chef] Yeah.

00:03:55.826 --> 00:03:57.036
- [Mark] Wow, coconut milk.

00:03:57.036 --> 00:03:57.869
- Yes.

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:59.090
(coconut milk burbles)

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.078
- [Woman Chef] Yeah.

00:04:00.078 --> 00:04:01.269
- [Mark] Wow.

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.764
(light pop music)

00:04:02.764 --> 00:04:05.630
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.533
- That's the name of the
restaurant, Itik Salal

00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:08.366
- [Mark And Chef] Masthar.

00:04:08.366 --> 00:04:12.074
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:12.074 --> 00:04:13.603
(upbeat pop music)

00:04:13.603 --> 00:04:15.205
(Mark laughs)

00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:19.599
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:20.432
(Mark laughs)

00:04:20.432 --> 00:04:21.826
This is the spot.

00:04:21.826 --> 00:04:23.556
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:26.310
(knife clanking)

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.120
(speaking in foreign language)
(upbeat pop music)

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.953
- [Boy In Apron] Me, me too.

00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:31.893
- [Mark] I got you, I got you.

00:04:31.893 --> 00:04:33.610
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.019
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:36.750
(upbeat pop music)

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.176
I got you, you are on, you are on.

00:04:38.176 --> 00:04:40.002
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:40.002 --> 00:04:41.324
- I know you.

00:04:41.324 --> 00:04:42.157
I see you on YouTube.

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:43.168
- [Mark] Hey, what's up man?

00:04:43.168 --> 00:04:48.168
(soup sizzling)
(upbeat pop music)

00:04:51.118 --> 00:04:55.340
(soup sizzling)
(upbeat pop music fades)

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.673
(crowd bustling)

00:04:57.673 --> 00:05:00.260
Yeah, I am extremely glad that
we got here 30 minutes early,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.800
because we got to meet the owners

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.950
of the restaurant, just
hang out, talk with them.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.530
They're so friendly, they're so welcoming

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.610
and then just to see them
finishing up the process.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.590
So, I mean, they're still
working on the ducks.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.690
They're still chopping up the ducks.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.910
They're still preparing
everything for the rush.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.260
And, I think it's still probably 10

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.840
or 15 minutes before they open,

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.280
and already there's like
20 or 30 people here,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.740
just waiting, waiting for them to open,

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.710
so it's coming very soon.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.220
The aromas are almost too good,
yeah, too good to imagine.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.857
The aromas are almost too unbearable.

00:05:32.857 --> 00:05:34.902
I can't wait for 10 minutes.

00:05:34.902 --> 00:05:36.375
You come here often?

00:05:36.375 --> 00:05:38.247
- [Customer] Least once a month.

00:05:38.247 --> 00:05:40.010
- The takeaway's over on that side,

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.610
but if you eat-in, eat here,
then they bring the curries

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.180
and they bring the smoked duck over here,

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.580
and then you just order here

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.060
and they dish it out for you,
and then you find a seat.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.556
Sort of like food court style.

00:05:53.556 --> 00:05:58.556
(crowd bustling)
(upbeat pop music)

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.300
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.240
This station is for the
rice and some cucumbers,

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.690
and then there's another station

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.690
with the smoked catfish
and the vegetables.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.336
First, I think get some rice.

00:06:09.336 --> 00:06:10.169
(crowd bustling)

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.002
Okay, we'll garnish you up.

00:06:11.002 --> 00:06:11.920
(crowd bustling)

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.355
Thank you.
- [Waiter] Alright.

00:06:13.355 --> 00:06:18.355
(crowd bustling)
(upbeat pop music)

00:06:20.261 --> 00:06:21.627
- [Mark] Can we take three on here?

00:06:21.627 --> 00:06:22.511
(speaks in foreign language)

00:06:22.511 --> 00:06:25.428
(upbeat pop music)

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.270
'Kay, then you come over
to the vegetables station,

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.420
vegetable garnishing station.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.180
It's like a whole garden
full of vegetables.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.000
There's okra, there's banana blossom,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.700
there's a bunch of leafy vegetable,

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.220
there's winged bean, there is jengkol,

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.450
which is one of my favorite
things in the world.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.840
So, you just kind of grab a plate

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.977
of mixed vegetable to your liking.

00:06:44.977 --> 00:06:47.894
(upbeat pop music)

00:06:49.148 --> 00:06:50.273
- [Waiter] Okay, total is.

00:06:50.273 --> 00:06:51.170
- [Man] Okay.
(Mark laughs)

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.640
(upbeat pop music)

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.130
- Okay, we are sitting down.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.430
We got all the food.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.200
Unbelievably spectacular.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.313
We got,

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.000
I think we did actually get
everything that they offer.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.070
Plus, we got the fried chicken,

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.340
but that's gonna be for
Mika, who's taking a nap,

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.560
right down here.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.130
So you can see that, yeah,
they smoked out the duck,

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.630
then he just chops it up,

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.450
then they mix it into the coconut milk,

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.300
and the curry paste, the Cili Padi,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.830
and this just looks sensational.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.455
Again, I'm gonna go for that drumstick.

00:07:20.455 --> 00:07:21.288
(child speaks in foreign language)

00:07:21.288 --> 00:07:23.423
And first thing to do,
put this under the rice.

00:07:23.423 --> 00:07:25.060
Aw.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.570
Whoa, you can see how that
just looks unbelievable.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.660
Alright, oh, it's so hot,
and warm, and oh, the skin,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.810
the smokiness, you can
just see how, just, oh wow,

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:36.820
even the Kaffir lime, you can see

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.283
the Kaffir lime leaves in there as well.

00:07:38.283 --> 00:07:41.033
(crowd bustling)

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.063
Wow.

00:07:49.063 --> 00:07:51.370
(crowd bustling)

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.680
Okay, there's like layers of flavor,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.570
and layers of paste that
you get on your tongue.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.260
Oh, and it's still coming.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.770
Finally, you taste the
chili heat at the end.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.603
- [Male With Glasses] Oh yeah, for sure.

00:07:59.603 --> 00:08:01.690
- [Mark] Oh, that is unbelievable.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.820
The duck is so smokey, and it almost has,

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.740
like, it's not dry at all.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.740
It has this amazing,
like a dark meat texture,

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.560
dark poultry texture to it,
but just embedded with smoke.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.010
Then, you got the, you know what happens,

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.100
is because there's so
much coconut milk in it,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.480
that panes down the spice after,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.270
so at the beginning, it's more milky,

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:29.270
and then after that milkiness,
the coconut milkiness fades,

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.650
then you taste the undertone
of the lemongrass, the chilis.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:33.730
- Oh, what's up man?

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.066
- Thank you very much.

00:08:35.066 --> 00:08:36.620
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.723
Thank you very much, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

00:08:39.723 --> 00:08:41.320
This food is incredible.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.300
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.350
- [Mark] Yeah, sure.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.130
- Like, the creaminess and that spiciness

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.063
are right behind it.

00:08:46.063 --> 00:08:47.790
It's so nice, oh my.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.753
- [Mark] Oh yeah, and
then the herbs in here,

00:08:49.753 --> 00:08:52.200
and the Kaffir lime leaves as well.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.540
It's just, that smokiness.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.410
Scale up close-up, look
at that dick though.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.710
You can see the redness.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.760
It's kind of covered up by the curry,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.140
but look at the redness of
that smokiness of that duck.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.890
(crowd bustling)

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:06.823
- Oh, wow.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.333
Yeah, that skin,

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.950
that skin it will just
blow your taste buds.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.390
The complexity of flavor
with that smokiness,

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.349
and that chili, and that
curry base, unbelievable.

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:20.790
So, this is the same smoked
beef, those giant steaks

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.200
that we saw in a coconut milk,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.220
and I'm not sure if it's exactly

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.640
the same blend of spices,
but we will find out.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.340
I'm gonna try to mix it
over onto the other side

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.026
of the, my plate of rice.

00:09:31.026 --> 00:09:33.776
(crowd bustling)

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.055
All right, goin' for
a slice of that steak.

00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:43.055
(upbeat pop music)
(crowd bustling)

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.820
I think they are the same,

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.630
but the beef even has more of a roasted

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.476
Yeah, that is a roasted
[Man In Glasses] Smokey.

00:09:51.476 --> 00:09:54.140
liver good, that's just like, mm.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.270
And the chili kind of like,

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.670
it kind of comes at the end of your bite.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.290
It's mind-blowingly good.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.550
It's the sweetness that
comes from the coconut milk,

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.560
the lemongrass, the black pepper in there.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.650
- Yeah, there's like a
jerky black pepper flavor,

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:13.650
it's so smokey, like crisp,
it smells amazing too.

00:10:13.939 --> 00:10:14.772
Whoa.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.620
- And the beef is actually so lean.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.620
The duck has some
fattiness to it, the skin,

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.853
and the beef it's just completely lean,

00:10:24.853 --> 00:10:29.310
just absorbing all of that
flavor, and just mm, wow.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.370
Unbelievably good.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.640
That's just like, you can understand

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.290
why there're so many people here,

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.540
why people were here before.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.522
Oh, look at that takeaway line.

00:10:38.522 --> 00:10:40.910
(upbeat pop music)

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.570
Okay, I also got the catfish,

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.653
and again this guy is completely smoked.

00:10:44.653 --> 00:10:48.140
Look at just how oily
and fleshy that meat is.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.200
I'm gonna take some of the,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.330
(crowd bustling)

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.420
I can just taste that catfish first.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.520
Be careful of the little
bones, but look at that.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.721
Look at that, that's beautiful.

00:10:56.721 --> 00:11:00.002
(upbeat pop music)

00:11:00.002 --> 00:11:02.050
Kaffir is just one of those things that,

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.870
it's simple, but just the texture of it,

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.853
is what makes it good, and
when you add smoke to it,

00:11:07.853 --> 00:11:11.080
that just enhances it, but
I gotta try that sambal

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.911
at the next bite, and then
put this onto my rice.

00:11:12.911 --> 00:11:16.210
(upbeat pop music)

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.880
You do taste the green chilies in there.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.820
A little bit spicy, it's very garlicky,

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.320
and then it has like a sweet tinge

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.556
to it at the end of your bite.

00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:23.963
(crowd bustling)

00:11:23.963 --> 00:11:27.487
Just everything is incredibly delicious.

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:29.920
You could not choose a favorite here.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.950
You have to order everything,

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.900
and they all compliment each other.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.163
They all go together.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.930
It's time to try some
of the garnishing herbs.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.240
And, I'm not totally
sure what this one is,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.440
but it seems like everybody
who comes here gets

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.543
a couple stocks of this herb.

00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:51.933
Mm, it's a little lemony at the beginning,

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:58.010
but then it goes to a
completely green herb taste

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.690
as you keep on chewing.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.210
It's really good, kind of like mild.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.270
When they dish you your plate of rice,

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.070
they also give you a little bit of fried,

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.712
possibly salted, fish.

00:12:05.712 --> 00:12:07.711
(crowd bustling)

00:12:07.711 --> 00:12:08.970
Mm, whoa.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.460
Yeah, it's extremely salty,
and very smokey again.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.320
Yeah, and you're gonna want
to eat that very sparingly,

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.330
it's very salty.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.150
That's a very salty preserved fish.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.820
We almost forgot, it was
hiding beneath the winged bean,

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.060
but this is the jengkol,

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.203
which it looks to be lightly steamed,

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.110
or you can also call
it a giant stink bean.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.490
I'm gonna dip this into
the another sambal,

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:30.977
like a tomato onion sambal.

00:12:30.977 --> 00:12:33.644
(crowd bustles)

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.353
Yeah, yeah, that's cooked.

00:12:38.044 --> 00:12:42.420
It also has a gummy starchy texture to it,

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.253
and then that sambal

00:12:43.253 --> 00:12:47.240
is more like a sweet tomato
oniony salsa, almost.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.980
Everything is so good, but
I think I have to give it up

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.470
for their signature dish, the
dish that's on their name,

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:55.793
the dish that they're famous for.

00:12:55.793 --> 00:12:57.570
I think that one is the ultimate,

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.960
so I'm gonna circle around back
to the second bowl of that.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.471
Some little duck nuggets,
get that onto the rice.

00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:05.388
(upbeat pop music)

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.210
There's a leaf that you can
see chopped up within the dish.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.110
At first, I thought it was pandan.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.642
I don't think it pandan.

00:13:13.642 --> 00:13:14.892
I just take it.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:17.760
Oh, wow.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.550
Okay, that leaf is actually
providing a lot of flavor.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.290
It has a peppery taste to it,

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.950
and a lemony taste all at the same time.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.373
That is actually one of
the main flavoring of it,

00:13:26.373 --> 00:13:30.290
you can tell from tasting
that how it really contributes

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.116
to the overall flavor of that dish.

00:13:32.116 --> 00:13:35.033
(upbeat pop music)

00:13:37.706 --> 00:13:39.400
That is just remarkable flavor.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.120
It's just unbelievable.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:46.120
(crowd bustling)
(upbeat pop music)

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.714
It's almost like lemony and celery're,

00:13:51.714 --> 00:13:54.140
celery're, like celery.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.600
I just guarantee that once
you taste this curry sauce,

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.600
either the beef or the duck, either one,

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.540
you're gonna wanna just
drown your rice in it.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.090
You're gonna soak your rice.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.360
You're gonna just want to absorb

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.490
and fill your mouth

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.080
with as much of that curry sauce

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.840
as you possibly can, maximize each bite.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.500
(upbeat pop music)

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.160
I think that the curry is the same.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.220
It's just that the meats
are totally different,

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.520
and they even like provide

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.510
a different compound

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.930
chemical taste balance,

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.030
of each dish,

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.350
because the one with beef, you
can see it's more like thick

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.710
with the coconut milk and less oily,

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.080
whereas the one with duck,
you can see a layer of oil,

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.340
which I think comes from the skin.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.350
I don't know, they're both smokey,

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.494
but in different ways as well.

00:14:41.494 --> 00:14:45.206
Just the meats drastically
change the flavor of the curry.

00:14:45.206 --> 00:14:49.240
(crowd bustling)
(upbeat pop music)

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.300
That meal went down way too easily.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.450
This is really one of those meals

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.880
where it's not an exaggeration
to say you shed some tears

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.760
when you see an empty plate.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.190
It really is heartbreaking to see

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.020
an empty plate here, an empty bowl.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:02.853
Yeah, so I wasn't sure

00:15:02.853 --> 00:15:04.970
if this was a completely appropriate move,

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.170
but I did look around and other
people were doing the same,

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.320
dipping their spoon and just taking

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.222
a whole spoon of the sauce,
so I think it's appropriate.

00:15:13.222 --> 00:15:15.805
(upbeat music)

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.250
Wow.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.254
Okay, it's a little bit salty
when you eat it that way.

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.314
- Yeah, that's pretty salty.

00:15:22.314 --> 00:15:24.317
- (Mark laughs) But it's so good,

00:15:24.317 --> 00:15:25.830
and there's so much smoke in there

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:26.663
(crowd bustling)

00:15:26.663 --> 00:15:29.529
that will just blow your taste buds.

00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:31.500
And, that's just gonna,
that is gonna be the bite

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.720
that just stays on my tongue
for the rest of the day,

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.112
and in my mind forever.

00:15:36.112 --> 00:15:37.808
- [Man In Glasses] Oh, yeah (laughs).

00:15:37.808 --> 00:15:39.376
(woman sings in foreign language)

00:15:39.376 --> 00:15:41.626
(Mark laughs)

00:15:41.626 --> 00:15:42.786
- [Mark] Yes.

00:15:42.786 --> 00:15:43.854
(metal clanking)

00:15:43.854 --> 00:15:45.510
- [Chef] He he he he he.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.588

00:15:46.588 --> 00:15:47.566
(upbeat pop music)

00:15:47.566 --> 00:15:48.399
(Mark speaks in foreign language)

00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:49.574
(upbeat pop music)

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:50.647
- [Woman] Yeah.

00:15:50.647 --> 00:15:51.480
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.313
- Thank you

00:15:52.313 --> 00:15:53.760
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.180
- [Mark] That was an incredible meal.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.530
Everything was good.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:01.840
That was like a flavor blend of spices,

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.830
the coconut, the smokey
duck that your tongue

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.280
will never forget.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.430
And, you can see this place now.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:11.200
The takeaway line is just
stretching like around the corner,

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:16.140
the entire eating section
table seating is just packed.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.570
But yeah, people come here
to enjoy the good food,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.820
and they're so friendly, they're so nice.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.820
The owners, they have a recipe

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:27.460
that will just ultimately
satisfy your taste buds,

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.530
and this was an amazing place.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.050
I wanna say a huge thank you to everyone

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.550
to who recommended this
restaurant, especially Muhammad,

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.150
saying that this is a meal

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.500
that would make me wanna stay in Malaysia.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.520
That is, that was
completely 100% accurate.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.310
After a meal like, you are
gonna want to stay in Malaysia.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.830
If you had a flight like the same day,

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:44.870
if I had a flight the same day,

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.450
I would no doubt, without
even thinking about it,

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.040
I would cancel my flight, or probably

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.090
just miss my flight
without even knowing it.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.120
When you're in Kayall,
it's definitely worth

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.270
it to make the trip
slightly south of the city,

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:02.080
to come here to eat the, yeah,
the food is incredibly good.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.260
