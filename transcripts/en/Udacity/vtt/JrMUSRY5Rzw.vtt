You've now got the most important
skills that you need to

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.030
build responsive websites,
so congratulations.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.740
You've got a good understanding
of what responsive means,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.610
you know how to use flex box
to lay out your designs, and

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.230
you've got several
common design patterns.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.440
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and I think you're ready
to take your skills to the next level.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.410
In this lesson, you're going to learn
about some of the other things that

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.470
are important to responsive design,
like images, tables, and typography.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.790
Each of these sections could
be their own course and

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.780
in fact, some of them are.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.090
&gt;&gt; That sounds great.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.330
Let's go ahead and get started.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.830
&gt;&gt; Sweet.
