Adriene: Hi I'm Adriene Hill, welcome back
to Crash Course Economics. As you may remember

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.370
from our first video, economics can be divided
into two parts: microeconomics and macroeconomics.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.299
Since macroeconomics is the one that's most
often in the news, that's where we're gonna

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.979
start. We'll get to microeconomics, which
is also super important in future episodes,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.460
but what is macroeconomics again?

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.590
Mr. Clifford: (monotone) It's the study of
economic aggregates revealed through national

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.980
income accounting, which is then-

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.920
Adriene: Okay okay, when you explain it like
that it sounds boring but it is not boring!

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.020
Macro is about booms and busts, will you get a job
when you graduate, should the government cut taxes?

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.640
Mr. Clifford: In theory, lowering marginal
tax rates would actually increase-

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.030
Adriene: No no no! Remember, the goal of learning
economics is to become a better decision maker,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.770
and part of that is learning how the whole economy
works. So let's learn about the whole economy.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:02.480
[Theme Music]

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.000
So, macroeconomics is the study of the entire
economy. Macroeconomists study the big stuff,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.590
like economic output, unemployment, inflation,
interest rates, and government policies.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.680
Now when it comes to fields of study, macroeconomics
is a relatively new subject. It wasn't until

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.460
the Great Depression in the 1930's that economists
fully appreciated the need for a systematic way to

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.660
measure the overall economy, and that we might need
theories to guide policies and fix potential problems.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.730
A hundred years ago there was no comprehensive
data on economic activity, so there was no

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.100
macroeconomics. Today, economic data is plentiful,
but that doesn't mean that economists agree

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.009
about where the economy is, where it's going,
or what should be done to help. Macroeconomists

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.169
make predictions based on data, theoretical models and
historical trends, but in the end they're just predictions.

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:56.020
If you ask three economists the same question,
you're likely to get three different answers,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.630
but how, you ask, can the dismal "science"
be so subjective? Well, economics is not a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.210
traditional science because it is nearly impossible
to control all the different variables. Like

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.260
all the social sciences, economics is studying people,
and it turns out that sometimes people are unpredictable.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.420
Stan Muller: I challenge all of you to a tournament
of champions in Flappy Bird!

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.950
Adriene: Who saw that coming?

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.490
That doesn't mean that economics is all guesswork.
For example, right now in early 2015, the

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.420
economy of Greece is, well it's not, it's
not good. But how can we tell, and is it gonna

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.140
get better? Is it gonna get worse? What should
be done about it?

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.260
These are all questions that macroeconomists
try to answer, but for this video, we're gonna

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.390
focus on the question "How can we tell?"

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.989
Mr. Clifford: Well in general, policy makers
have three economic goals: they want to keep

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.129
the economy growing over time, they want to
limit unemployment, and they want to keep

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.020
prices stable. Now for the most part when
these three things happen, the citizens are

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.629
happy, politicians get reelected, and economists
get raises.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.989
There are three specific measurements that
economists analyze to see if a country is

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.060
achieving each goal. They're the Gross Domestic
Product, unemployment rate, and the inflation rate.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.660
The most important measure of an economy is
Gross Domestic Product or GDP. GDP is the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.660
value of all final goods and services
produced within a country's border in a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.620
specific period of time, usually a year.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.040
Now there are some details worth mentioning.
GDP doesn't include every transaction that's

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.500
in the economy. For example, if you buy a
used domestic car, it doesn't count towards

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.879
GDP because nothing new was produced. Now
that same logic applies to buying financial

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.950
assets like stocks, or when one company buys
another company, for example when Google bought

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.140
YouTube. Those don't count towards GDP because
no new good or service was produced.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.150
Also, GDP often doesn't include illegal activity,
since drug dealers don't usually report their

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.849
sales to the government, or non-traditional
economic activity like household production.

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.209
For example, if a plumber charges someone
$100 to fix their hot water heater, that counts

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.830
towards GDP, when he fixes his own water heater,
that doesn't count towards GDP.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.500
Here's a list of countries organized by GDP.
Notice that GDP is measured in dollars, not

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.050
in the raw number of things produced. If we
analyzed just the raw number, then a country

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.349
that produced five million thumbtacks would
look like they're doing just as well as a

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.510
country that produced five million cars, but
there's also a problem with using the dollar

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.879
value of stuff produced: it's inflation.

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.250
If two countries produce the same amount of
cars, but one has higher prices, then that

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.980
country's going to have a higher nominal GDP,
or GDP not adjusted for inflation. To get

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.950
a more accurate idea of the health of the
economy, economists look at Real GDP, which

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.099
is GDP adjusted for inflation. Just what "adjusted
for inflation" means is really important,

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.629
but too big of a topic to discuss right now.
We'll get to it.

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:23.589
Adriene: So what does the Real GDP in Greece
tell us about its economy? In 2013, the Greek

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:29.669
Real GDP was around 242 billion dollars, but
that number doesn't really mean anything until

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.410
you compare it to previous years.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:39.440
In 2012, it was 250 billion dollars, in 2011,
it was 288 billion, and in 2010 it was 300

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.969
billion. In fact, starting in 2008, Greece
has had six years of decreasing GDP, and the

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:51.300
data reveals that this recession is just as
deep and prolonged as the Great Depression

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.500
in the United States in the 1930's.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.339
Now, I just used the term recession, which
a lot of people use incorrectly. A recession

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:03.719
is not just when the economy's bad, officially
it's when two successive quarters or six months

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:08.979
show a decrease in Real GDP. Even though the
economy in Greece is still struggling, it

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:15.180
climbed out of its recession in 2014, experiencing
a slight increase in GDP.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.659
A depression, on the other hand, doesn't have
a technical definition, but it's a severe

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:24.550
recession, when the economy's really really
bad. It's worth noting though that GDP can

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.039
be a little problematic. I mean not all countries
measure GDP in the same way, and in recent

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:34.409
years some European Union countries have started
experimenting with counting underground markets,

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.930
like the sex trade and drug trade as part
of the total.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.270
In fact, GDP isn't even that old an idea.
According to Robert Froyen, during the Great

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.029
Depression, economic decisions were made "on
the basis of such sketchy data as stock price

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:51.050
indices, freight car loadings, and incomplete
indices of industrial production. The fact

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.860
was that comprehensive measures of national
income and output did not exist at the time.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.050
The depression, and with it the growing role
of government in the economy, emphasized the

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.590
need for such measures and led to the development
of a comprehensive set of national income accounts."

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.419
So GDP was invented to account for national
income, and it may not necessarily provide

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:15.020
a complete picture of a country's economy,
but for the moment it's what we've got.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.569
So that's economic growth, or at least one
way to look at economic growth. now, for the

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:25.529
next big issue for macroeconomists: unemployment.
Anyway, the major goal of unemployment policy

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:30.860
is to limit unemployment, and that's measured
by - you guessed it - the unemployment rate.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.840
In Greece, unemployment is over 25%.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.119
Mr Clifford: The unemployment rate is calculated
by taking the number of people that are unemployed

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:40.869
and dividing by the number of people in the
labor force, times 100. Now this percentage

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:44.629
represents the number of people that are actively
looking for a job but just can't find one.

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:48.740
First, the labor force only includes people
that are of legal working age and working

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.559
or actively looking for work, so little kids
don't count and neither do people who aren't

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:56.199
able to work or who just choose not to work.
So what about someone who's been looking for

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.689
a job but just gives up? Well, they're no
longer part of the labor force, and they're

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:02.649
no longer considered unemployed. These are
called discouraged workers.

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:06.409
The unemployment rate also doesn't take into
account people that are underemployed. A worker

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:10.749
with a five hour a week part time job is considered
fully employed even if they're looking for a better

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:15.319
job. In both of these cases, the official  unemployment
rate underestimates the problems in the labor market.

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:19.849
A common misconception is that the goal is
to have 0% unemployment, but it turns out

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:23.900
there's types of unemployment that'll exist even
when the economy's going strong. Economists would

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.260
point out that there's three types of unemployment,
or three reasons why people would be unemployed.

00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:31.680
First is frictional unemployment. This is
when people are temporarily unemployed or

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:35.249
between jobs. So if you quit your job and
look for a new one, or if you're just entering

00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:36.969
the labor force, then you're frictionally
unemployed.

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:40.229
The second is called structural unemployment.
Workers are out of work because there's no

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:44.139
demand for that specific type of labor. This
would be like a VCR repair person, but it

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:47.349
also includes technological unemployment,
where workers are replaced by machines.

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:51.110
Now both frictional and structural unemployment
will always exist; the goal is not to have

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.889
0% unemployment. I mean, 0% is not even possible.
We're always going to have people between

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:56.779
jobs or people fired because machines do it
better.

00:07:56.779 --> 00:08:01.110
So the goal is to have no cyclical unemployment.
This is unemployment due to a recession. It's

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.449
when people stop buying stuff, so businesses
lay off their workers and since workers have

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:07.899
lower incomes, they stop buying stuff which
means more people lose their jobs.

00:08:07.899 --> 00:08:11.349
An economy is considered to be at full employment
when there's only frictional and structural

00:08:11.349 --> 00:08:14.809
unemployment. This is called the natural rate
of unemployment. This natural rate differs

00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:18.220
slightly between countries, in the United States
it's usually between 4 to 6 percent unemployment.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.899
Now as you might expect the GDP growth rate
and the unemployment rate are inversely related.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.659
That means that when GDP is rising, the unemployment
rate is falling, when GDP is falling, the unemployment rate is rising.

00:08:27.659 --> 00:08:31.159
Adriene: And that's exactly what happened
in the United States during the Great Depression.

00:08:31.159 --> 00:08:36.889
in the 1930's, droughts, bank failures, and
counterproductive policies caused GDP to fall,

00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:39.789
and unemployment peaked at 25 percent.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:44.139
Let's move on to the third economic goal:
stable prices. While I might like the idea

00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:48.649
of the stuff I buy getting cheaper across
the board, falling prices are not really a

00:08:48.649 --> 00:08:53.240
good thing. Average prices in Greece have
fallen about two percent recently, and during

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:59.040
the 1930's, the inflation rate in the US was
negative ten percent, but how can cheaper

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.980
stuff be bad for the economy?

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.699
Mr. Clifford: Well the goal is to keep prices
stable, mainly to avoid rapid inflation, or

00:09:04.699 --> 00:09:09.069
rising prices, but we also want to avoid excessive
deflation which is falling prices. Inflation

00:09:09.069 --> 00:09:12.730
is measured by tracking the prices of a set
amount of commonly purchased items, or what

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:17.589
economists call a market basket. The inflation rate is
the percent change in the price of that basket over time.

00:09:17.589 --> 00:09:20.560
Too much inflation is bad because it decreases
the purchasing power of money; it means you

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.980
can buy less stuff with the same amount of
money, which has all sorts of negative effects

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.610
on the economy. Business costs increase as
workers demand higher wages and interest rates

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.850
increase, so it's harder to buy loans, so
people buy less cars and houses.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.860
Deflation on the other hand, seems like it
would be a good thing but most economists

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.980
see falling prices as a bad thing. Falling
prices actually discourage people from spending

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.190
since they might expect prices to fall more
in the future. Less spending in the economy

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.420
means GDP is gonna decrease and unemployment's
gonna increase, and that just becomes a vicious

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.509
cycle. So severe recessions are often accompanied
by deflation because the demand for goods

00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:53.440
and services falls, but when the economy starts
to improve again, we often see an increase in prices.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.660
Adriene: Throughout history, economies have
expanded and contracted. It's called the business

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.269
cycle. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:09:59.269 --> 00:10:04.170
If we imagine the economy as a car, then GDP,
employment and inflation are the gauges. A

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.899
car can cruise along at 65 miles per hour
without overheating. Safe cruising speed is

00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:13.430
like full employment; unemployment is low,
prices are stable and people are happy.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.240
But if we drive that car too fast for too
long, it'll overheat, and in the economy,

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.209
significant spending increases GDP causing
an expansion. Unemployment falls and factories

00:10:22.209 --> 00:10:26.180
start producing at full capacity to keep up
with demand. Since the amount of products

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:31.029
that can be produced is limited, people start
to outbid each other, resulting in inflation.

00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:36.000
Eventually, production costs increase as workers
demand higher wages and the economy starts

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.899
to slow down. Businesses lay off a few workers,
those unemployed workers spend less causing

00:10:40.899 --> 00:10:46.079
the businesses that produce the good that they
would otherwise be buying to lay off more workers.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.680
This is a contraction, the economy is going
to slow. Eventually things stabilize, production

00:10:51.689 --> 00:10:56.449
costs fall since resources are sitting idle,
and the economy starts to expand again. This

00:10:56.449 --> 00:10:59.819
process of booms and busts is called the business
cycle.

00:10:59.819 --> 00:11:04.220
To understand why these fluctuations might
occur, let's take this car analogy just a

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.430
little further and look at the engine. Much
like the four cylinder engine that powers

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.810
the Volkswagen of growth, an economy has four
components that make up GDP. Each represents

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:18.170
a different group that can purchase things
in the economy. They're consumer spending,

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.740
business spending which is called investment,
government spending, and net exports which

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.399
is basically spending by other countries.

00:11:25.399 --> 00:11:30.639
If any one of these components loses power,
the economy will slow down, but not all of

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:35.430
them are created equal. Most economies rely
heavily on consumer spending. For example,

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:40.939
in the US, consumers account for about 70%
of GDP, but other countries might rely more

00:11:40.939 --> 00:11:47.099
heavily on exports. The point is, changes in these four
components change the speed of the economy.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.360
Thanks Thought Bubble. So when I'm driving
my car on the highway, I use cruise control

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.350
to regulate my speed. So why don't we have
cruise control for the economy? Well many

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:59.220
economists think that the government should
play a role in speeding up or slowing down

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:04.209
the economy. For example, when there's a recession,
the government can increase spending or cut

00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:07.259
taxes so consumers have more money to spend.

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:11.639
Proponents of this policy argue that it would
get the economy back to full employment, but

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:17.120
it has its drawback: debt, which some economists
hate while others argue isn't very much of

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.740
a drawback at all. Stupid economic policy,
always resisting simplistic explanations.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.040
We're gonna save the debate over how to fix
the economy for future videos, but for now

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.760
it's important for you to have a general understanding
of how the economy works and how it's measured.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.760
After all, whether you're driving a Namco
in Greece, a Kia in Korea or a Ford in the

00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:41.629
US, your livelihood and your future will be
shaped by what happens in the economy. So

00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:45.319
wear your seat belt. By which I mean try to
save a little once in a while, OK?

00:12:45.319 --> 00:12:49.600
So we've really just touched on these three
major indicators of economic health, and while

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.920
they can be useful in providing a broad overview
of a nation's economy, reality is, as usual,

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.660
a little more nuanced than that.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.230
Mr. Clifford: Next week, we're gonna go under
the hood and look at the greasy, dirty details

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:04.160
of how economists calculate growth, and tune
up thee economy, and rev up their economic

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.699
engines and drive around the drag racing tr--

00:13:06.699 --> 00:13:10.519
Adriene: OK, I think that's enough with the cars,
Thanks for watching, we'll see you next week.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.199
