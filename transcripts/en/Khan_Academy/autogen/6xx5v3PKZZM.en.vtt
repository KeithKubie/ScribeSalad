00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.760
 In this video we will talk about the size of the cells 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.320
 and in particular how small they can be, 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.800
 and what factors they determine 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.420
 how big they can be. 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.180
 Here are some photos of cells. 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.720
 Here's a picture of Pseudomonas bacteria. 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.220
 Each of these pill-like things 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.440
 is a bacterial cell. 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.840
 And to have an idea of ​​what scale it is, the width of this pill 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.040
 is about one micrometer. 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.220
 So that's about one micrometer here, 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.840
 which is equivalent to one millionth of a meter. 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.780
 Or one thousandth of a millimeter - 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.980
 Choose what helps you imagine it better. 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.960
 The length of this cell is about 5 micrometers. 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.940
 This is approximately 5 micrometers. 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.740
 Here I have pictures of cells from the human body - 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.592
 red blood cells. 

00:00:51.592 --> 00:00:56.213
 They have a diameter of about 7 micrometers. 

00:00:56.213 --> 00:00:58.930
 Both white blood cells are of similar magnitude. 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.625
 Let's look at something else. 

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.690
 Here we can see a human sperm that will penetrate at any moment 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.638
 in a human egg. Human eggs 

00:01:06.638 --> 00:01:09.680
 are one of the largest cells, 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.999
 especially among the spherical cells. 

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:16.112
 This cell has a diameter 

00:01:16.112 --> 00:01:20.988
 in the order of 100 micrometers. 

00:01:20.988 --> 00:01:23.054
 It's very cool, that 

00:01:23.054 --> 00:01:25.306
 all these pictures are on the same scale 

00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:28.998
 so you can compare them to size. 

00:01:28.998 --> 00:01:31.622
 The first question we have to ask is how small a cell can be. 

00:01:31.622 --> 00:01:33.689
 He thought: the cage is a living organism 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.384
 and it's actually quite complicated. 

00:01:35.384 --> 00:01:38.007
 She must have information, she has her DNA, she must be capable 

00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:41.351
 to divide - has all these metabolic mechanisms. 

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:46.273
 I recently read that the smallest cells observed, 

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:49.036
 and why not the smallest cells at all, 

00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:51.869
 although in the future perhaps even smaller cells will be found, 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.934
 are about a few hundred nanometers in size. 

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:58.695
 Do not forget that the width of this pill is 1000 nanometers, 

00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:01.644
 so several hundred nanometers would look like this. 

00:02:01.644 --> 00:02:05.870
 300 nanometers - this is the size of the smallest cells, 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.194
 known to science at the time, 

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:08.749
 which are bacterial cells, 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:10.978
 found at the University of California, Berkeley. 

00:02:10.978 --> 00:02:16.783
 We think their size is pretty close to the lower limit, 

00:02:16.783 --> 00:02:18.803
 because, remember, we have to keep 

00:02:18.803 --> 00:02:22.216
 all genetic information and cellular mechanisms. 

00:02:22.216 --> 00:02:25.954
 All this is complicated and it would be harder for the cell to be smaller 

00:02:25.954 --> 00:02:28.392
 But how big could it be? 

00:02:28.392 --> 00:02:31.573
 One of the factors determining the maximum cell size, 

00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:34.476
 among other factors, 

00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:37.239
 is the ratio between volume and area. 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.045
 Why is the ratio between volume and area important? 

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:44.623
 Because the surface of the cell connects it 

00:02:44.623 --> 00:02:47.502
 with what is around it. 

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:51.170
 The surface is responsible for the intake of substances and the separation of waste products, 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.373
 so each unit of the area has to process 

00:02:55.373 --> 00:02:58.020
 incoming and outgoing substances 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.481
 for a certain volume of the cell. 

00:03:00.481 --> 00:03:03.755
 As we will see later, with the growth of the cell 

00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:06.193
 its volume and area do not grow evenly - the volume grows 

00:03:06.193 --> 00:03:08.051
 faster than the cell area. 

00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:11.023
 The larger the cage, each unit area 

00:03:11.023 --> 00:03:13.182
 must process substances 

00:03:13.182 --> 00:03:14.575
 for more and more volume. 

00:03:14.575 --> 00:03:17.408
 At one point, he can not cope with this task - he can not take up nutrients 

00:03:17.408 --> 00:03:20.496
 and to get rid of unnecessary products quickly enough. 

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:22.423
 And to imagine it even better, 

00:03:22.423 --> 00:03:24.257
 let's think about this from a mathematical point of view. 

00:03:24.257 --> 00:03:28.692
 Let's imagine that this is a sphere here ... 

00:03:28.692 --> 00:03:31.479
 wait for me to draw it a bit three-dimensional. 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:38.258
 If its radius is r, its volume will be (4/3) πr³. 

00:03:38.258 --> 00:03:46.246
 Its area will be equal to 4πr². 

00:03:46.246 --> 00:03:49.032
 Let's now calculate the ratio between volume and area, 

00:03:49.032 --> 00:03:50.216
 because that's what we really care about. 

00:03:50.216 --> 00:03:54.140
 The area will be in yellow, so the ratio between 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:09.651
 volume and area will be equal to (4/3) πr³ on (4/3) πr³. 

00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:11.787
 Fortunately, we can easily simplify the liver. 

00:04:11.787 --> 00:04:14.921
 4 divided by 4 lines 1, divided by π makes 1, 

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.893
 r³ divided by r² will be simply r, 

00:04:17.893 --> 00:04:22.560
 and so we get r / 3. 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.766
 If we look at the units of measurement, we are actually talking about 

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:27.343
 cubic unit volume or cubic unit volume 

00:04:27.343 --> 00:04:31.662
 on square units. 

00:04:31.662 --> 00:04:33.822
 Which makes r / 3. 

00:04:33.822 --> 00:04:36.701
 We will use this to see what is happening, 

00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:40.160
 when the cell increases its size multiple times. 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.618
 For a simpler, let's focus on this white blood cell 

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:47.126
 and to facilitate the bills, let us assume, 

00:04:47.126 --> 00:04:53.302
 that its radius is 3 micrometers. 

00:04:53.302 --> 00:04:56.251
 I'll use a different color to make it clearer, 3 micrometers. 

00:04:56.251 --> 00:04:59.827
 In this case, the ratio between the volume and the area of ​​the cell 

00:04:59.827 --> 00:05:05.237
 will be 3 micrometres divided by 3, 

00:05:05.237 --> 00:05:12.528
 which, of course, 

00:05:12.528 --> 00:05:14.849
 makes 1 micrometer. 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.264
 Unit of 1 micrometre for area volume 

00:05:17.264 --> 00:05:18.774
 it does not make much sense. 

00:05:18.774 --> 00:05:25.461
 An equivalent unit would be 1 cubic micrometer 

00:05:25.461 --> 00:05:29.895
 per square micrometer because we divide the volume of the area 

00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:32.101
 and it is clear that if we cut the units 

00:05:32.101 --> 00:05:33.936
 and we make a large-scale analysis, 

00:05:33.936 --> 00:05:35.259
 this micrometer will remain. 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.743
 This helps us to imagine it even better, 

00:05:37.743 --> 00:05:41.226
 because it means that every square micrometer 

00:05:41.226 --> 00:05:44.547
 has to deal with a cubic micrometer cell volume. 

00:05:44.547 --> 00:05:47.519
 So the square micrometer for this cell 

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:50.514
 will be about that size 

00:05:50.514 --> 00:05:53.532
 and will have to process 

00:05:53.532 --> 00:05:57.363
 an average of one cubic meter of volume. 

00:05:57.363 --> 00:05:59.662
 It seems acceptable 

00:05:59.662 --> 00:06:01.357
 and indeed this is acceptable for cell size. 

00:06:01.357 --> 00:06:06.233
 But what would happen if we increased its size 1000 times, 

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:08.625
 increasing the radius of the cell 1000 times? 

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:11.272
 Obviously, the scale is not the same as for the previous cell, 

00:06:11.272 --> 00:06:14.592
 but let's say we find some new organism or think of it, 

00:06:14.592 --> 00:06:19.352
 whose cellular radius, instead of being 3 micrometres, 

00:06:19.352 --> 00:06:25.180
 (this was 3 micrometers here) would be 3000 millionth of a meter. 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.734
 Keep in mind that this is not a huge amount from a human point of view, 

00:06:27.734 --> 00:06:30.590
 but is equal to 3 millimeters. 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.539
 It could be seen with the naked eye, as the human eye 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:35.953
 can distinguish between objects up to one tenth of a millimeter, 

00:06:35.953 --> 00:06:37.834
 making 100 micrometers. 

00:06:37.834 --> 00:06:41.828
 This is approximately 1/10 of a millimeter. 

00:06:41.828 --> 00:06:43.732
 Under favorable conditions, you can hardly see a human egg. 

00:06:43.732 --> 00:06:46.681
 This cell here 

00:06:46.681 --> 00:06:49.258
 we would not have thought it too big, but let's see what's going on 

00:06:49.258 --> 00:06:53.159
 with the ratio between volume and area. 

00:06:53.159 --> 00:07:01.866
 3000 microns divided by 3 

00:07:01.866 --> 00:07:04.652
 makes 1000 micrometers, 

00:07:04.652 --> 00:07:11.223
 or 1000 cubic micrometers per square micrometer. 

00:07:11.223 --> 00:07:14.079
 That is, every square micrometer 

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:17.074
 must process a cubic micrometer volume. 

00:07:17.074 --> 00:07:22.066
 Now, however, we have not one, but 1000 cubic micrometers, 

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:25.642
 that is, a much larger volume. 

00:07:25.642 --> 00:07:27.523
 The cell will fall apart because it will not be able to 

00:07:27.523 --> 00:07:30.425
 to exchange gases, nutrients and waste products 

00:07:30.425 --> 00:07:33.815
 fast enough to function. 

00:07:33.815 --> 00:07:38.134
 So the volume-area ratio 

00:07:38.134 --> 00:07:40.734
 is extremely important for cells. 

00:07:40.734 --> 00:07:42.987
 is extremely important for cells. 

00:07:42.987 --> 00:07:45.448
 When the cell grows, 

00:07:45.448 --> 00:07:50.161
 the ratio between volume and area or mass is interesting, 

00:07:50.161 --> 00:07:51.624
 very many ratios are interesting 

00:07:51.624 --> 00:07:52.785
 and this is just one of them. 

00:07:52.785 --> 00:07:55.618
 The other factor that matters 

00:07:55.618 --> 00:07:57.847
 when increasing the size of the cell, are the long distances, 

00:07:57.847 --> 00:07:59.612
 through which substances are transferred. 

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:02.978
 This could also slow down the processes in the cage. 

00:08:02.978 --> 00:08:05.045
 But the relationship between volume and area is the reason why, 

00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:06.600
 which is why they rarely meet 

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.805
 very large spherical cells. 

00:08:09.805 --> 00:08:11.616
 I emphasize the spherical cells, 

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:15.354
 because there are very long cells, 

00:08:15.354 --> 00:08:17.165
 such as nerve cells. 

00:08:17.165 --> 00:08:19.719
 They manage to compensate for their large size through various adjustment mechanisms. 

00:08:19.719 --> 00:08:23.179
 One of them is just to be extremely thin and long, 

00:08:23.179 --> 00:08:25.872
 so this is one of the mechanisms that allows them 

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:28.357
 to make the most of their area. 

00:08:28.357 --> 00:08:32.118
 This is a nervous cell. 

00:08:32.118 --> 00:08:34.185
 Another such mechanism 

00:08:34.185 --> 00:08:35.949
 is the presence of appendices, 

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:38.225
 which have the same function. 

00:08:38.225 --> 00:08:41.568
 In short, not all cells are spherical 

00:08:41.568 --> 00:08:43.728
 and have other adaptation mechanisms, 

00:08:43.728 --> 00:08:45.237
 thanks to which they can use the maximum potential of their area. 

00:08:45.237 --> 00:08:47.419
 There are various such mechanisms, but the representation of the cell 

00:08:47.419 --> 00:08:49.927
 in the form of a sphere is not strange 

00:08:49.927 --> 00:08:52.388
 and this is the reason why no cells are found 

00:08:52.388 --> 00:08:54.496
 much larger than a human egg.
