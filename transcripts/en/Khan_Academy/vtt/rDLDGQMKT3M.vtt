00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.540
Welcome to the presentation
on i and imaginary numbers.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.200
So let me just start
out with a definition.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.340
i is equal to the square
root of negative 1.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.790
Or to view it another way,
you could say that i squared

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.030
is equal to negative 1.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.260
Now why is this special?

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.440
Well, we knew or we've learned
that any number when you

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.680
square it is equal to a
positive number, right?

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.820
If I had negative 1
times negative 1, that

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.460
equals positive 1.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.150
You don't have to write the
positive every time but that

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.780
equal positive 1 and so
does 1 times 1, that

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.570
equals positive 1.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.260
So if we think about the square
root of a number, so far all

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.080
we've learned is taking the
square roots of positive

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.880
numbers, and that makes sense
to us because the notion of a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.790
square root of a negative
number didn't really

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.860
exist until now.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.960
So what we've done is we've set
this definition that the number

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.760
i, and i isn't a variable,
it's an actual number.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.440
It's value is equal to the
square root of negative 1.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.160
Now I won't go into all of the
philosophical musings about

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.570
whether i, as a number i, or
any imaginary numbers

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.780
actually exist.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.500
Maybe I'll make another
presentation on that.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.390
But they exist enough to
be very useful to many

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.530
engineers and physicists.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.240
So I'll leave you with that,
and I'll also just hint at --

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.400
well, I won't go into the
whole e to the i pi

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.170
equals negative 1.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.360
But that blows my mind,
but I won't go into that.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.030
And when you think about
whether i really exists, you

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.900
should also think about whether
anything really exists.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.820
So, I've diversed for too long,
so let's get back to what I was

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.750
saying before. i is equal to
the square root of

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.030
negative 1, and i squared
equals negative 1.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.800
So let's think about the
implications of this.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.730
If I were to say -- well, i to
the first power, just like

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.580
anything else, is equal
to itself, right?

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.920
i squared, I've already said
using this definition, i

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.910
squared is equal to negative 1.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.750
i to the third power, well
that would just equal i

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.890
squared times i, right?

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.560
And i squared is negative 1, so
it would be negative 1 times i.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.380
And that just
equals negative i.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:39.330
And i to the fourth would
equal i to the third times i.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.580
I'm just using my
exponent rules here.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.430
Well i to the third is negative
i times i, right? i to the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.460
third is negative i, and
then we just kept that i.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.910
Well what's negative i times i?

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.780
Well that's the same thing
as negative 1 times

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.660
i times i, right?

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.690
And what's i times i?

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.020
Well, the definition.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.330
i times i, i squared, is
equal to negative 1.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.710
So that equals negative 1 times
negative 1, which equals 1.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:13.880
Interesting.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.260
Let me clean this
up a little bit.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.620
Actually let me start with
i to the zero power.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.750
i to the zero power, well we
know anything to the zero

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.690
power is equal to 1.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.250
So we'll keep that --
that still equals 1.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.490
i to the first power
is equal to i.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.470
i squared by definition
is equal to negative 1.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.710
i to the third power, I just
showed you, is equal to

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.780
negative i, and that makes
sense because that's

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.160
just i squared times i.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.930
And i to the fourth
power equaled 1 again.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.500
If I did i to the fifth power,
well that's just equal to i to

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.110
the fourth power
times i, right?

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.320
I'll write that down, i
to the fourth times i.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.260
i to the fourth is
equal to 1, right?

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.770
This is equal to 1, so 1
times i is equal to i.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.760
Do you see a pattern here?

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.010
i to the zero power equals 1.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.240
i to the negative
1 power equals i.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.340
i squared is equal
to negative 1.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.350
i to the third power
equals negative i.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.510
i the fourth equals 1 again.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.740
So i to the fourth equals i to
zero, and i to the one power

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.280
is equal to i to the fifth.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.640
I think you'll find out that i
to the zero, and you could try

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.410
this out if you don't believe
me, i to the zero is equal to i

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.645
to the fourth, which equals i
to the eighth, which equals i

00:04:55.645 --> 00:04:57.250
to the twelfth, I think
you see the pattern.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.950
Any multiple of 4 equals 1.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:11.610
And i to the first equals i to
the fifth, equals i to the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.900
ninth equals i to the
thirteenth, equals i.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.915
So that's i to any power
that is a multiple

00:05:20.915 --> 00:05:23.110
of 4 plus 1, right?

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.740
Because 5 is equal to 4 plus
1, nine is equal to 8 plus 1.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.790
And we could do a similar
pattern. i squared is equal to

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.500
i to the sixth, equals i to
the tenth, and so on, and

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.190
that equals negative 1.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.792
And finally i to the third is
equal to i to the seventh,

00:05:43.792 --> 00:05:50.990
which equals i to the eleventh,
and so on, equals negative i.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.060
So why is this useful?

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.190
We see a pattern.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.300
It's a cycle of four.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.940
In this pattern, if we
look at this, we can use

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.420
this to determine what
i to any power is.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:06.460
So if I were to ask you what i
to the hundredth power is,

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.860
well, you could just work it
out, you could say, well that's

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.810
just equal to i times i to the
ninety-ninth and

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:11.500
so far so down.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.390
But if we use the cycle,
we see that hundred is

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.490
a multiple of 4, right?

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.680
4 times 25 is 100.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.640
So i to the hundredth will
fall into this category,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.310
this first one.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.570
It's a multiple of 4.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.000
So we know that i to the
hundredth power is equal to 1.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.230
Similarly, if I said i to the
hundred and one power, that's

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.820
going to equal i, right?

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.650
Because that equals 100 plus 1.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.500
So it puts you into
this category.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.920
Equal to a multiple of 4, 100
is a multiple of 4, and 101

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.440
is a multiple of 4 plus 1.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.330
i to the hundred and second
power, similarly would

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.120
equal negative 1.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.640
i to the hundred and third
power would equal negative i.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.100
I hope you understand what I'm
doing here, and all I did is I

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.670
defined i as the square root of
negative 1, and then I

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.560
kept multiplying i to
figure out a pattern.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.270
I said i to the zero equals 1,
i to the first equals i, i

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.170
squared equals negative 1, i to
the third equals negative i,

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.080
and i to the fourth
equals 1 again.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.980
And the pattern
repeated itself.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.570
And then I used that pattern to
be able to figure out i to any

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.150
power, even it's a
very high number.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.600
So a very simple way to think
about it is if I had i to the

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.670
three hundred and twenty three.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:38.300
What I do is I say if I
were to divide 4 into 323,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.930
what's the remainder?

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.770
Well, I know 4 goes
into 320, right?

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.320
4 times 80 is 320.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:56.180
So I know that when I divide 4
into 323, so 4 goes into 323 80

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.940
times with a remainder
of 3, right?

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.560
And the remainder is
what we care about.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.370
And this number is actually
called a modulus.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.440
Maybe I'll do another module on
modulus -- it's very important

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.040
actually in computer
programming.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.580
But since we know that when you
divide this exponent by 4 the

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.630
remainder is 3, we can say that
this is the same thing as i to

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.490
the third, which we've
learned is negative i.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.410
Similarly, if I said i to
the five hundred and second

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:27.220
power, well I know 500 is
divisible by 4, right?

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.520
4 times 125 is 500.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.910
So the remainder is 2 if
I were divide it by 4.

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:36.410
So I could say that this is
the same thing as i squared.

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:41.350
And i squared we learned by
definition is negative 1.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:46.150
If I were to ask you i
to the thirty-seven?

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:51.510
We know 36 was divisible by
4, so the remainder is 1.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.670
So it would be i to the
1, which equals i.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.270
Hopefully that gives you an
indication of what i is.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.970
It might have been confusing
the first time because we're

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.940
dealing with a number that's
"imaginary," and I'm teaching

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.960
the cycle property of it.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.710
What you might want to do is
review the video again, but

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.990
then after that you could just
try the module on i, which

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.930
essentially just keeps working
you through this

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.070
type of problem.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.150
I hope you have fun.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.450
Bye.
