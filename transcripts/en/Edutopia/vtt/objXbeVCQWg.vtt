00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:01.853
- Good morning, Karen.

00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:03.803
Good morning, Angel.

00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:16.004
(teenagers talking over each other)

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.500
- There's areas of the brain
that track the human face

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.000
and other areas that track just eyes,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.100
or track just the voice,
or track the smile,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.560
track the disposition
of your face and body,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.530
so that we're exquisitely attuned to the

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.900
attitude of the human being
that you're interacting with.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.530
We know that we start this way.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.550
When you look at the studies
on very young human babies,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.400
even newborns, newborns are
captivated by the human face.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.640
And newborns at birth have the ability

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.799
to imitate the facial
postures of another person.

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:56.550
So they open their mouths
when you open your mouth

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.050
and they stick out their tongue

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.623
when you stick out your tongue.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.430
Eye gaze looks as though it's one

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.830
of the most critical features
of our social brains.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.910
Without realizing it,
we do a lot of looking

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.670
at what the other person's eyes are doing.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.260
If you look at the kids who are very good

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.840
at following the gaze of another person,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.020
their language skills
speed much more quickly

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.000
to a higher level than the children

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.130
who are not following eye gaze.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.410
So, the ability to track eye gaze

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.090
and the tendency to do so
boosts learning tremendously.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.780
So why should teachers care
about this information?

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.730
There's a learning opportunity here.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.340
You can create a moment of real synergy

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.720
that creates better learning for all,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.630
when children are put
together in small groups

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.580
so that they have the opportunity

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.710
to track the information
that attracts others.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.727
Building classrooms and
class attitudes that say,

00:01:55.727 --> 00:01:57.017
"We're going to do this together.

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:59.287
"We're going to work in pairs or in groups

00:01:59.287 --> 00:02:01.740
"and we're going to solve
problems collaboratively,"

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.770
means that you're allowing
this face-to-face interaction

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.370
to thrive, to let the
brains of the children

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.060
implicitly learn from the signals

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.720
that are automatically there

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.420
when we interact with one another.
