00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.360
Technology has done a lot of great things
for humanity, and has succeeded in making

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.400
the world feel a little more connected.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.060
But some people argue that the use of CGI
on the silver screen has gotten out of control.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.980
Luckily for them, there are filmmakers out
there who still insist on doing things the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.189
old fashioned way.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.340
These are 10 Amazing Movie Effects Created
Without Computers.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.780
Terminator 2: Judgement Day
Of all the big screen cybernetic organisms,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.710
Arnold Schwarzenegger’s T-800 is probably
the most iconic.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.100
Known commonly as a Terminator, the machine
has been terrorizing audiences since 1984.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.250
And while there are technically a bunch of
films in the franchise, 1991’s Terminator

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.289
2: Judgement Day is the absolute best.

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.430
A lot of the effects were created using a
combination of CGI and manual efforts on-set,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.800
but one of the movie’s best gags actually
ended up on the cutting room floor.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.610
During a scene where Sarah (Linda Hamilton)
and John (Edward Furlong) are resetting the

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.490
Terminator’s CPU, director James Cameron
utilized clever camera placement, a body double,

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.220
and Linda Hamilton’s twin sister to create
the illusion that the procedure was all happening

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.570
in a mirror.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.500
Apollo 13
Okay seriously.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.740
Tom Hanks gets to do all the fun stuff.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.150
And after years of paying his Hollywood dues,
we think he’s earned it.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.090
One of the actor’s most iconic roles in
Apollo 13 is no exception.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.080
After their craft is damaged, the astronauts
onboard try desperately to get safely back

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.080
to earth.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.229
NASA plays a large part in the film, but it
turns out they were also instrumental behind

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.280
the scenes, too.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.640
To get the zero-gravity environment just right,
the association lent the production a plane.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.780
Flying in parabolic arcs, anyone onboard experienced
intervals of real weightlessness, and they

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.240
didn’t even have to leave the atmosphere.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.390
Casino Royale
Casino Royale introduced the world to a shiny

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.390
new Bond.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.390
Daniel Craig had a well-tailored tuxedo to
fill, and he did it in a big way.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.320
Of course with every new Bond movie comes
a host of new toys for the character to destroy.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.500
While some of the situations are wildly exaggerated,
there is one moment that is 100% authentic.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.470
It wouldn’t be a Bond movie if the character
didn’t destroy his brand new car, and Casino

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.299
Royale is no different.

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.200
Rather than using CGI to simulate a crash,
a real driver was behind the wheel during

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.639
a scene when the Aston Martin flips multiple
times.

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:32.510
The team even used an air cannon to help the
vehicle flip a few extra times.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.390
The Dark Knight
This may be Christopher Nolan’s first appearance

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.000
on this list, but it won’t be his last.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.200
The director has been applauded for his practical
filmmaking methods, and seems to be deterred

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.450
by nothing.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.220
No stunt is impossible.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.139
So when it came time for Batman to chase the
Joker through the streets of Gotham, the team

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.070
wrapped up the sequence with a big finish.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.390
That semi-flip you just saw?

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.980
100% real.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.840
Stunt driver Jim Wilkey flipped the vehicle
in the middle of a real street, surrounded

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.780
by real buildings.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.680
At it’s height, the trailer was over fifty
feet in the air.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.459
And thankfully, they only had to do it once.

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.010
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
After making his mark as a funnyman, Jim Carrey

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.840
picked up a few serious roles and showed the
world he wasn’t just a one trick pony.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.830
So if you’re expecting his usual comedic
flavor, then the movie Eternal Sunshine of

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.889
the Spotless Mind is not for you.

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.130
The movie toys with the notion of memory.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.720
And one sequence chronicles how it feels to
have one dream quickly transition into another.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.769
While a scene like this almost begs for the
use of CGI, director Michael Gondry rejected

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:35.769
the idea.

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.389
What was happening off-screen was almost as
interesting as what was on it.

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.650
Because both Carrey and co-star Kate Winslet
were running from set to set, and trying to

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.739
beat the camera.

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:44.739
Old school!

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.010
2001: A Space Odyssey
Stanley Kubrick is one of the most celebrated

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.229
and subversive filmmakers of all time.

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:55.199
His movies may be divisive, but there’s
no denying how visually stunning they are.

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.380
From A Clockwork Orange to The Shining, the
director has left a permanent mark on cinema.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.710
But when film school students get together
to talk shop, they always come back to 2001:

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.949
A Space Odyssey.

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:09.760
A movie that was revolutionary for its time,
Odyssey utilized several techniques that wouldn’t

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.290
be fully developed until years later.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.610
And Kubrick noticed that rotating the set
around a fixed camera created a pretty cool

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:17.610
effect.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.609
One that was used over and over after the
movie’s release.

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.790
Inception
Christopher Nolan is back.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.580
And this time, he’s breaking one of the
earth’s oldest laws: gravity.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.370
Each dream world has it’s own beautiful
aesthetic.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.100
But when the drop kicks in on level two, everything
in the environment becomes weightless.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.150
Audiences watch as Joseph Gordon Levitt scrambles
to secure the team, and gets in a pretty cool

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.030
fight along the way.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.280
Filmmakers built the entire set encased in
a grouping of eight rings, which rotated as

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.540
the camera stayed fixed.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.881
“But wait!” we hear you cry, “didn’t
Kubrick do the exact same thing in 2001: A

00:04:49.881 --> 00:04:50.881
Space Odyssey?”

00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:54.630
The answer is yes, but Kubrick didn’t make
it look THIS good.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.020
Jurassic Park
In the earlier half of his career, Steven

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.090
Spielberg had a thing for animatronics.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.750
It’s becoming increasingly rare to see mechanical
creatures on set.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.510
They can stop functioning, break, and cause
a collective migraine for everyone involved.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.480
Case in point: Jurassic Park’s tyrannosaurus
rex.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.960
The dinosaur was made by Stan Winston’s
studio, and was fully mechanical.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.710
You don’t have to be a mechanic to understand
that rain plus robot equals disaster.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.010
As a result, the giant dino would randomly
turn itself on and roar at the crew.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.570
Which, understandably, scared the shit out
of anyone nearby.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.060
The Lord of the Rings
Perspective is an interesting thing.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.930
And is the reason a skilled filmmaker like
Peter Jackson can manipulate your eyes into

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.570
believing adults are hobbit-sized.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.610
While the films give audiences a lot to look
at, the biggest trick is right in front of

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.920
your face.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.940
Using specially engineered set pieces and
clever camera placement, the director created

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.090
the illusion that the Hobbits are physically
smaller than everyone else.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.190
If that seems like a lot of unnecessary work,
consider that using CGI to shrink the actors

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.430
in every frame would be even more tedious.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.860
The Dark Knight Rises
You know what?

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.860
Christopher Nolan is a modern filmmaker with
old school sensibilities, and we can’t help

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.090
it if he’s responsible for multiple legendary
non-CG stunts, okay?

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.580
In the final film in his Batman trilogy, big
bad Bane executes a heist that results in

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.800
a plane dropping from the sky.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.800
After hearing what we’ve already told you,
you might not be surprised to find out that

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.700
Nolan really did make a plane drop from the
sky.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.400
On top of that, he did it quickly.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.820
And a shot that was supposed to take five
days was delivered in two.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.150
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.260

effects?
