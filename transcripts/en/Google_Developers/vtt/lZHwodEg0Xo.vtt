RELLY BRANDMAN: Hey developers.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.460
I bet you're looking for ways
to increase your visibility

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.770
to users and break that
million download mark.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.720
My name is Relly.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.350
I'm a product manager on
Play's Search &amp; Discovery team

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.070
and I'm here to help.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.890
Visibility and
discoverability are

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.870
important for apps to reach
their users on Google Play.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.680
For the average
app, search makes up

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.490
the majority of installs.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.620
As an app developer,
when a user searches

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.360
for something that's
like your app,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.400
you want them to
find your content.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.640
Optimizing this process
means understanding

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.299
what type of searches
users are doing and making

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.700
sure that data for your app
supports these searches.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.080
There are generally two types
of searches that users do.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.950
The first type is
for users who know

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.550
exactly what
they're looking for.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.580
For example, those
who will do a search

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.960
based on the title of your app.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.980
And titles are not
just about branding.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.300
It is important to be
as clear as possible

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.260
in the title to communicate
what the app is about.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.300
Is your app about internet
radio, travel planning,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.700
podcasting?

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.100
Making this clear in the title
will capture the attention

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.930
of interested users,
making your apps stand out

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.410
in a sea of competitors.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.010
The second type
of search is done

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.610
by users who are not sure
exactly what they want

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.520
and search by keywords like the
features that are looking for.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.830
For example, I
like puzzle games.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.400
And well, I also like goblins.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.150
Once you've gotten
the attention of users

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.020
and they've clicked
on your app, it's

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.910
all about your store listing.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.540
Your app's description
should clearly

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.780
tell users what your app does
and why it matters to them.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.310
Once that's done, you can
brag about how successful

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.490
your app is, what awards
you've won, and so on.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.160
But as the saying
goes, a picture

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.750
is worth a thousand words.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.780
There will be users out
there who judge apps

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.340
by the quality of their
screenshots and videos.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.470
As such, a high quality app
will strive for high quality

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.600
screenshots and videos that
users can scan through.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.260
The more you can communicate
what the experience is like,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.147
the more likely it is that
users will download your app.

00:01:56.147 --> 00:01:58.480
Keep in mind that you don't
have to do all the work when

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.740
it comes to search.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.270
Google Play is constantly
collecting statistics

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.740
about installs, uninstalls,
install retention,

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.150
and engagement.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.449
Apps that are successful
at all these metrics

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.340
are more likely to be highly
ranked in search results.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.180
So the most important
thing you can do

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.700
is to create the best
experience for your users

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.190
no matter what your app does.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.970
We all know those days that
you haven't had enough coffee

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.360
and you don't know exactly
what you're looking for.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.170
Sometimes it's great to just
sit, browse through the store

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.000
without typing any searches,
and look for new awesome apps.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.680
There are generally
two types of browsing.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.320
The first is scanning
through the apps homepage

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.310
and the second is
through top charts.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.020
When users open the Play store
and click on the apps option,

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.520
they're taken to what we
call the apps home page.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.800
This page contains the
top charts as well as

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.603
the categories users
can look through,

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:53.600
for example, new and updated
apps, lifestyle apps,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.820
and learning tools.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.630
And the cool thing is this page
is personalized to each user.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.000
The homepage browse
experience let's Google Play

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.720
offer new and interesting
apps to every user

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.940
no matter what
they're interested in.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.730
And of course, there
are the top charts.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.660
These lists, like Top Paid,
Top Free, and Top Grossing,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.920
are common ways for
both new and returning

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.850
users to gain a
quick understanding

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.870
of the most popular apps.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.610
You may be wondering
how your app can

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.440
get onto one of
these top charts.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.360
Like any search or
discovery system,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.180
we're constantly
tuning our algorithm

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.160
to provide the best
experience for users.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.830
Top Paid, Top Free,
and Top Grossing

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.310
target new users or people
who just got a new device.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.080
They're looking for the
best and most popular apps

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.970
as recommendations for
how to get started.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.300
Top New Paid and Top New Free
target what's new and popular.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.150
For that reason,
we limit it to apps

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.220
that have been
published recently.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.270
Finally, the Trending
list highlights

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.340
apps that are moving faster than
we predicted in a recent day

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.690
moving window.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.110
This list helps users find
what's really hot right now.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.570
You've made an amazing app.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.200
And now you know
more about what you

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.620
can do to maximize your
discoverability on Google Play.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.130
To learn more, read our
developer guidelines

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.120
on developer.android.com.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.360
Now go and break that
million user mark.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.630
And thanks for watching.
