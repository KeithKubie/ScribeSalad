SAL BARRIGA: Hi, I'm Sal.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.200
Today, we're going to solve
Problem 8 of the Final Exam of

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.380
2009 for 3.091.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.280
The problem reads as follows.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.720
The phospholipid--

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.070
the chemical formula
is right here--

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.430
is added to hexane--

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.180
which is C6H14, which
is a hydrocarbon--

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.850
in sufficient quantities to
enable interaction between

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.770
phospholipid molecules.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.810
Draw a cartoon depicting one
possible molecular arrangement

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.910
that results.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.420
You may stylize your parts of
the phospholipid molecule with

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.040
the squiggly line-- which
is shown in the exam--

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.650
for a hydrocarbon chain.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.390
So if we look at our molecule
here, the first thing that we

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.210
want to understand is what
the structure is.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.780
And as you can see, the molecule
has a nonpolar

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.160
component and it has
a polar component.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:23.000
So for the problem, it will be
good to isolate the two with

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:36.160
different colors, and then we'll
stylize them such that

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.850
the nonpolar part is the zigzag
line and the polar

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.660
component is the red circle.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.940
So we want to go ahead and draw
the arrangement together

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.280
when it's added to hexane.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.930
So the easiest thing to do
is to draw a picture.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.200
So we come over here
to the right.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.280
And this is part a.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.140
I'm going to draw a beaker
with hexane.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.510
And I know that as soon as I
look at my chemical formula

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.370
for hexane--

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.530
which is C6H14 and is
a hydrocarbon--

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.820
I know that it's nonpolar.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.070
So I know from my knowledge of
3.091, when chemical bonding,

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.890
that like dissolves like.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.080
So the molecules that are polar
are going to want to

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.300
stick together, and molecules
that are nonpolar are going to

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.390
want to stick together.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.960
So by looking at my
phospholipid, I

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.360
already know that--

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.320
the problem tells me that--

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.410
I'm adding a sufficient amount
such that the molecules can

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.850
interact with each other.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.580
So the only thing that comes to
mind for me that will be a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.140
possible arrangement,
would be that--

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.110
in the hexane, which is
nonpolar, and if we have a

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.290
distribution of these
phospholipid molecules--

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:06.480
then one possible arrangement
will be that you have a bunch

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.130
of your polar heads interacting
together with the

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.130
hydrocarbon components out here

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.340
interacting with the hexane.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.040
Because the hydrocarbon
component again is nonpolar.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.250
The hexane is nonpolar.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.500
So those want to interact
with each other.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.600
But the polar component,
which are the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.850
heads for the molecule--

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.410
the phospholipid
as a molecule--

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.680
are going to go ahead and
interact with each other.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.530
And pretty much if you were to
write this down on the exam,

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.920
you would get full points
for part a.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.740
Now we'll move on to part b.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.180
Part b says, to the beaker
described in part a, an equal

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.410
volume of liquid ammonia--

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.070
NH3--

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.400
is added.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.840
The mixture of hexane-NH3--

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.770
or ammonia containing
the phospholipid--

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.800
is now subjected to vigorous
agitation for several minutes

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.050
and then allowed
to equilibrate.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.850
Draw a schematic representation
depicting one

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.440
possible molecular arrangement
that results.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.180
The values of density are 0.65
grams per centimeter cubed for

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.820
hexane and 0.6 grams
per centimeter

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.660
cubed for liquid ammonia.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.290
Assume that hexane and liquid
ammonia are mutually

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.360
immiscible.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.070
So there's a lot of

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.960
information within the paragraph.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.720
And the first thing that it
gives us is the densities

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.470
between the two components.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.770
It tells us they're immiscible,
so immiscibility

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.735
means that they're
not going to mix.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.650
The question that you want to
answer now is, which layer is

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.490
going to be at the top?

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.850
Which layer is going to
be at the bottom?

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.470
Well, the more dense layer
should be at the bottom, and

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.560
the more dense happens
to be hexane.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.950
So if I go ahead and draw my
beaker again for part b, and

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.950
then I mix my components.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.780
And now I have two components
that are separated by an

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.420
immiscible boundary.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:14.320
And I know that the density of
hexane is given by 0.65 grams

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.420
per centimeter cubed.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.480
And the density of
liquid ammonia--

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.400
which is NH3--

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:30.270
is given as 0.60 grams
per centimeter cubed.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.670
So I know that the hexane is
going to be down here, so I'll

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.710
go ahead and label this C6H14.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.550
And I'll label this as NH3.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.960
So one important thing to
know is, what is the

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.790
structure of ammonia?

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.990
Well, we know that
ammonia happens

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.370
to be a polar molecule.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.870
And its structure is simply
given by-- you have a central

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:01.280
nitrogen atom, and you have
three hydrogens and a lone

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.980
pair of electrons-- and the lone
pair of electrons is what

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.670
gives the ammonia
the structure.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:11.240
Hence, you have a polar dipole
moment on your molecule.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.230
The fact that this is polar
means that it's going to

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.810
interact with the polar head of
your phospholipid molecule.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.230
And we already know we have
hexane plus your phospholipid.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.280
Well, if in our arrangement with
the absence of ammonia

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.990
the heads group together because
that was the only

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.270
polar component in the mixture,
then over here I

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.150
should expect the heads to
rearrange themselves such that

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.290
they are in contact
with the ammonia.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.220
So one possible arrangement for
the system would be that I

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.510
would have my polar part of my
molecule interacting with the

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.390
ammonia, and the hydrocarbon
chain interacting--

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.080
which is the nonpolar
component-- interacting with

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.390
the nonpolar mixture.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:03.420
So if you were to draw this
schematic, then you would get

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.520
full points on the
exam as well.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.080
So that's again, like
dissolves like.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.830
And if you fully understand
the nature of secondary

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.060
bonding, then this problem
shouldn't be that difficult to

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.840
go through.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.680
Now there's a final part to this
problem, which is part c.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.990
And part c says, to the beaker
described in part b, a small

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.180
amount of iodine--

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.040
I2--

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.750
is added to the mixture, and
then subjected to vigorous

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.290
agitation for several minutes,
and then allowed to

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.560
equilibrate.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.000
Explain what you expect
to observe.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.970
Again, we're going on this whole
issue of like dissolves

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:50.340
like, or that polar molecules
want to be with polar

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.380
molecules because they should
be miscible together.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:59.510
And we are given that now
we're going to add I2--

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.300
iodine.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.620
Well, iodine is a linear
molecule that's nonpolar.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.340
There are no other atoms that
are bonded to it that can give

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.930
any polarity.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:14.670
So if I was to go ahead and draw
this diagram, the first

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.380
thing that comes to my mind is
that the iodine should mix

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.560
with the hexane, because
essentially it's a nonpolar

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.690
component mixing with another
nonpolar component.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:31.250
So if I draw my diagram, I'm
going to go ahead and draw the

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.500
two immiscible regions.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.230
And one question that a lot of
students have is, how do you

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.110
know that the iodine
is not going to be

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.310
on top of the ammonia?

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.470
Well, iodine is pretty dense.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:47.720
It's actually more dense than
these two molecules over here.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.350
So the fact that it's more
dense, I know it's going to

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.060
want to sit at the bottom
where the other nonpolar

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.290
molecule is at.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:59.850
So I would argue that down here
we would have hexane--

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.070
C6H14--

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.230
mixed with iodine.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.310
Over here, we will still
have our ammonia.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:16.800
And then our polar heads
would still be--

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.400
the polar part of the
phospholipid molecule will be

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.970
in contact or bonding
with the ammonia.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:29.580
And the nonpolar tail would be
with the nonpolar components

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.060
which are hexane and iodine.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.790
So if you did this on the exam,
you get full points.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:40.650
And being able to fully
understand secondary bonding

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.490
will help you solve
this problem in no

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.340
less than 10 minutes.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.140
So that's it.
