00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.015
- [Voiceover] The geometric
sequence A sub I is defined

00:00:04.015 --> 00:00:06.924
by the formula and so they
tell us that the Ith term is

00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:09.100
going to be equal to three
times negative one fourth

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.515
to the I minus one power.

00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:13.060
So given that, what is A sub five,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.885
the fifth term in the sequence?

00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:16.484
So pause the video and try to figure out

00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:18.951
what is A subscript five?

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.889
Alright, well, we can
just use this formula.

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:23.744
A...

00:00:23.744 --> 00:00:26.339
A sub five is going to be...

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.835
is everywhere I see an
I or a place with a five

00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:32.843
is going to be equal to three
times negative one fourth

00:00:32.843 --> 00:00:36.233
to the five minus one power.

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:40.751
Well that's equal to three
times negative one fourth

00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:43.052
to the fourth power.

00:00:43.992 --> 00:00:46.321
Well that's going to be equal to...

00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:48.559
lets see, we're raising
it to an even power

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.254
so it's going to give us a positive value

00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:52.076
since we're gonna be
multiplying the negative

00:00:52.076 --> 00:00:54.655
an even number of times so
it's gonna be a positive value

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:57.322
so it's gonna be three times...

00:00:57.322 --> 00:00:59.309
let's see, one to the one fourth is-

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.665
oh, one to the fourth power is just one,

00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:03.841
and then four to the fourth power...

00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:05.898
let's see, four squared is 16,

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:08.190
so four squared times four
squared is four to the fourth

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.198
so it's 16 times 16 is 256.

00:01:11.198 --> 00:01:12.587
256.

00:01:12.587 --> 00:01:14.966
And once again I know
it's going to be positive

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:18.490
because I'm multiplying a
negative times itself four times,

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.495
or I'm multiplying four
negatives together,

00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:22.638
so that's going to give
me a positive value.

00:01:22.638 --> 00:01:24.622
So I get three

00:01:24.622 --> 00:01:27.262
over 256.

00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:29.897
And we're done.

00:01:29.897 --> 00:01:32.394
That's the fifth term in our sequence.

00:01:32.394 --> 00:01:35.257
Positive three over 256.
