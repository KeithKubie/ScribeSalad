I want to take a few minutes of your
 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.800
I want to take a few minutes of your
time to tell you about some of the new

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810
time to tell you about some of the new
 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.150
time to tell you about some of the new
things that we're doing in the chrome

dev tools specifically focused on mobile

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849
dev tools specifically focused on mobile
 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.089
dev tools specifically focused on mobile
but to do that I really want to take

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099
but to do that I really want to take
 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.830
but to do that I really want to take
back the clock like two years back

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840
back the clock like two years back
 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.890
back the clock like two years back
before Rho debugging two years ago like

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900
before Rho debugging two years ago like
 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.910
before Rho debugging two years ago like
developing for mobile with something

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920
developing for mobile with something
 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.890
developing for mobile with something
along the lines of okay let's view it on

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900
along the lines of okay let's view it on
 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.779
along the lines of okay let's view it on
desktop and then I'll come over and I'll

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789
desktop and then I'll come over and I'll
 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.210
desktop and then I'll come over and I'll
kind of drag the window yeah okay and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220
kind of drag the window yeah okay and
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.830
kind of drag the window yeah okay and
then you know I'll pick up my device and

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840
then you know I'll pick up my device and
 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.130
then you know I'll pick up my device and
I'll type it in there okay I need to

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140
I'll type it in there okay I need to
 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.349
I'll type it in there okay I need to
make a change I'll come back here and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359
make a change I'll come back here and
 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.749
make a change I'll come back here and
that is like it's a very slow iteration

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759
that is like it's a very slow iteration
 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.030
that is like it's a very slow iteration
cycle and that just slows you down and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040
cycle and that just slows you down and
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.410
cycle and that just slows you down and
and makes it much harder to create

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
and makes it much harder to create
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.450
and makes it much harder to create
compelling content so even thinking

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460
compelling content so even thinking
 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.830
compelling content so even thinking
about this and we want to make that much

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
about this and we want to make that much
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.910
about this and we want to make that much
better we don't want this iteration

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920
better we don't want this iteration
 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.130
better we don't want this iteration
cycles to be really fast we want it to

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140
cycles to be really fast we want it to
 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.860
cycles to be really fast we want it to
be it's easy to debug and develop for

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870
be it's easy to debug and develop for
 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.340
be it's easy to debug and develop for
mobile as it is on desktop and so I'm

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
mobile as it is on desktop and so I'm
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.510
mobile as it is on desktop and so I'm
gonna talk about three things today

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520
gonna talk about three things today
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.170
gonna talk about three things today
first up remote debugging talk about the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
first up remote debugging talk about the
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.760
first up remote debugging talk about the
browser on the device the real

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770
browser on the device the real
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.319
browser on the device the real
experience over there and then talk

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
experience over there and then talk
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.400
experience over there and then talk
about bringing some of those mobile

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410
about bringing some of those mobile
 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.470
about bringing some of those mobile
characteristics onto the desktop and

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
characteristics onto the desktop and
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240
characteristics onto the desktop and
then kind of bring it all into a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250
then kind of bring it all into a
 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.680
then kind of bring it all into a
development workflow and making it fast

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690
development workflow and making it fast
 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.130
development workflow and making it fast
and fluid so first step remote debugging

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
and fluid so first step remote debugging
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.460

have the dev tools cool so I'm just
going to you know this is the actual dev

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300
going to you know this is the actual dev
 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.060
going to you know this is the actual dev
tools it's working it's cool it's

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070
tools it's working it's cool it's
 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.300

kind of see can you see yeah okay
 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.850
kind of see can you see yeah okay
probably not but I'd love to be able to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860
probably not but I'd love to be able to
 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.590
probably not but I'd love to be able to
show you this and in fact you know when

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600
show you this and in fact you know when
 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.510
show you this and in fact you know when
we think about kind of remote debugging

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520
we think about kind of remote debugging
 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.720
we think about kind of remote debugging
it's a lot of I have my dev tools here

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730
it's a lot of I have my dev tools here
 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.280
it's a lot of I have my dev tools here
and then I might have a dice down here

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290
and then I might have a dice down here
 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.230
and then I might have a dice down here
and it's a lot of switching back and

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240
and it's a lot of switching back and
 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.240
and it's a lot of switching back and
forth and we thought that there's

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250
forth and we thought that there's
 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.370
forth and we thought that there's
probably a better way to bring what

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380
probably a better way to bring what
 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.650
probably a better way to bring what
you're looking at down here and have it

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660
you're looking at down here and have it
 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.720
you're looking at down here and have it
visible on the screen where your tools

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730
visible on the screen where your tools
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.300
visible on the screen where your tools
are so we have right here this little

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310
are so we have right here this little
 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.460
are so we have right here this little
icon and this is a new feature that

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470
icon and this is a new feature that
 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.020
icon and this is a new feature that
we're unveiling today and it's called

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030
we're unveiling today and it's called
 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.540
we're unveiling today and it's called
screencast and we're able to bring the

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550
screencast and we're able to bring the
 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:16.190
screencast and we're able to bring the
screen onto the device right here

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200
 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.240
so this is really cool all right so

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250
so this is really cool all right so
 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.340
so this is really cool all right so

through on on mobile browsers it's now

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:31.650
through on on mobile browsers it's now
 

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.380
through on on mobile browsers it's now
going through all of that in the

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:33.390
going through all of that in the
 

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.940
going through all of that in the
emulation feature inside the chrome dev

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:34.950
emulation feature inside the chrome dev
 

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.870
emulation feature inside the chrome dev
tools I took a look at a few more other

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880
tools I took a look at a few more other
 

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.520
tools I took a look at a few more other
sites this is me with the Nexus S

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:42.530
sites this is me with the Nexus S
 

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.030
sites this is me with the Nexus S
emulating the Boston Globe and I

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040
emulating the Boston Globe and I
 

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.040
emulating the Boston Globe and I
have an old Nexus S so I just brought

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.050
have an old Nexus S so I just brought
 

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.440
have an old Nexus S so I just brought
that up looking looking pretty sharp

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:49.450
that up looking looking pretty sharp
 

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.090
that up looking looking pretty sharp

again we're looking very close now so

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:58.950
again we're looking very close now so
 

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.230
again we're looking very close now so
that's the thing is that we really think

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:01.240
that's the thing is that we really think
 

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.300
that's the thing is that we really think
that having the ability to emulate many

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:03.310
that having the ability to emulate many
 

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.100
that having the ability to emulate many
of the characteristics of these mobile

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:05.110
of the characteristics of these mobile
 

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.250
of the characteristics of these mobile
devices saves you a lot of time and so

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:08.260
devices saves you a lot of time and so
 

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.750
devices saves you a lot of time and so
you don't have always have to go down to

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760
you don't have always have to go down to
 

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.560
you don't have always have to go down to
your actual devices one more thing this

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:13.570
your actual devices one more thing this
 

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.050
your actual devices one more thing this
is kind of an interesting situation this

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:16.060
is kind of an interesting situation this
 

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.600
is kind of an interesting situation this
is the chromium bug tracker as you can

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:18.610
is the chromium bug tracker as you can
 

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:23.940
is the chromium bug tracker as you can
see and when I resize it kind of you

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:23.950
see and when I resize it kind of you
 

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.340
see and when I resize it kind of you
know it just kind of sticks there but

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:26.350
know it just kind of sticks there but
 

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.700
know it just kind of sticks there but
interestingly he spent a lot of time in

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:29.710
interestingly he spent a lot of time in
 

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.950
interestingly he spent a lot of time in
your browser and you've experienced kind

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:31.960
your browser and you've experienced kind
 

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.650
your browser and you've experienced kind
of death pop pages especially with fixed

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:34.660
of death pop pages especially with fixed

doing a shift pinch right here you'll

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:39.370
doing a shift pinch right here you'll
 

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.670
doing a shift pinch right here you'll
notice this kind of a thing happens this

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680
notice this kind of a thing happens this
 

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.350
notice this kind of a thing happens this
is the behavior that you cannot really

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360
is the behavior that you cannot really
 

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.170
is the behavior that you cannot really
emulate normally just by resizing the

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:46.180
emulate normally just by resizing the
 

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.040
emulate normally just by resizing the
window and because we have a viewport

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:50.050
window and because we have a viewport
 

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.910
window and because we have a viewport
emulation inside of this feature we can

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920
emulation inside of this feature we can
 

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.120
emulation inside of this feature we can
really mimic the behavior that you get

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:57.130
really mimic the behavior that you get
 

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.840
really mimic the behavior that you get
on a phone so mobile emulation captures

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:00.850

many people have probably seen a site

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480
many people have probably seen a site

so I'm going to turn go into dev tools
turn on emulation just give it a quick

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:03.910
turn on emulation just give it a quick
 

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:11.250
turn on emulation just give it a quick
refresh and this is looking a lot more

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:11.260

into the map and my touch move events
 

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.530
into the map and my touch move events
are behaving just like I would expect

alright so the mobile emulation they can

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:27.730
alright so the mobile emulation they can
 

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.190
alright so the mobile emulation they can
do a lot of things I'm Emily the

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:29.200
do a lot of things I'm Emily the
 

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.600

that you would get on many devices and
 

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.310
that you would get on many devices and
have it right here on desktop it also

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320
have it right here on desktop it also
 

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.010
