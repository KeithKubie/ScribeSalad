00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:01.850
- [Voiceover] We're asked
to apply the distributive

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.648
property to factor out the
greatest common factor,

00:00:04.648 --> 00:00:07.504
and we have 35 plus 50 is equal to,

00:00:07.504 --> 00:00:10.162
so let me get my scratch pad out.

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:15.162
So we have 35 plus 50 is equal to,

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:20.204
now what is the greatest
common factor of 35 and 50.

00:00:20.204 --> 00:00:22.549
So what's the largest whole number that's

00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:24.883
divisible into both of these.

00:00:24.883 --> 00:00:27.518
Well I could write 35 as, let's see,

00:00:27.518 --> 00:00:31.024
I could write that as five times seven,

00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:34.390
and I could write 50 as five times ten,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.384
and so we see five is the
greatest common factor.

00:00:38.384 --> 00:00:41.066
Seven and ten don't have
any factors in common.

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.062
So I could rewrite this,

00:00:43.062 --> 00:00:48.062
I could write 35 as
equal to five times seven

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.102
and I could rewrite 50 as equal to,

00:00:54.102 --> 00:00:55.681
get another color here,

00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:58.642
I could rewrite 50 as five times ten,

00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:01.892
and of course, I'm adding them,

00:01:01.892 --> 00:01:03.958
so I have plus right over here.

00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.560
If I want, I could put parentheses,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.197
but order of operations would make me do

00:01:07.197 --> 00:01:09.380
the multiplication first, anyway.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.433
But now I want to factor out
that greatest common factor.

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:16.502
I want to factor out the five.

00:01:16.635 --> 00:01:18.377
So what I'm really doing right over here

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:21.395
is I'm unwinding the
distributive property.

00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:24.611
So if I factor out a five,
this is going to be equal to,

00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:28.895
this is going to be equal to
let's factor out the five.

00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:32.772
Five times, so you do 35 divided by five,

00:01:32.772 --> 00:01:34.130
you're just left with the seven.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.475
You're just left with the seven over here.

00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:38.228
So you're just left with the seven

00:01:38.228 --> 00:01:39.830
after you've factored out the five,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.588
and over here, you're
just left with the ten.

00:01:42.628 --> 00:01:47.628
So five, or seven plus ten,

00:01:49.837 --> 00:01:50.534
and we're done.

00:01:50.534 --> 00:01:55.534
35 plus 50 is equal to
five times seven plus ten.

00:01:55.677 --> 00:01:59.217
So let me now go and type that in.

00:01:59.217 --> 00:02:04.217
So this is the same thing as five,

00:02:05.846 --> 00:02:10.791
five times seven plus ten.

00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:11.987
And you know you've factored out

00:02:11.987 --> 00:02:13.612
the greatest common factor because

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:16.735
seven and ten don't have any
factors in common anymore.

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:18.546
They're called relatively prime.

00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:21.530
They have no factors in
common other than one.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.467
So we could now check that.

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:27.666
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:30.074
Apply the distributive
property to factor out

00:02:30.074 --> 00:02:31.386
the greatest common factor.

00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:34.114
So let's see if we can just do
this one a little bit faster.

00:02:34.114 --> 00:02:36.552
So let's see, the largest
number it's divisible,

00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:41.097
in both 75 and 20, I don't
know, let me try five.

00:02:41.207 --> 00:02:46.207
So if I say five times,
so 75 divided by five,

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.192
let's see is going to
be, it's going to be 15.

00:02:50.192 --> 00:02:51.388
Is that right?

00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:55.950
Yeah, cause five times ten
is 50, five times five is 25.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.866
Yeah, so it's 15, and I got that 15

00:02:57.866 --> 00:03:00.025
by dividing 75 by five.

00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:05.025
So 15 plus, and then 20
divided by five would be,

00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:09.022
20 divided by five would be four.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.729
15 plus four.

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:12.110
Let's see, did I do this right?

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.780
15 and four don't have
any factors in common,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.684
and if I were to apply the
distributive property here,

00:03:16.684 --> 00:03:19.308
I'd have five times 15 is 75.

00:03:19.308 --> 00:03:22.210
Five times four is 20.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.650
Yeah, I'm feeling good about that.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.374
We got it right.
