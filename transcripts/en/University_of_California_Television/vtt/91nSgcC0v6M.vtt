00:00:05.513 --> 00:00:08.513
(light piano music)

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.490
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.923
Bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.230
Long the master of fire,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.713
tools, and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.913
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.893
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.303
we empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.040
We shape the future

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.693
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.473
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.970
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.713
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:20.907 --> 00:01:24.324
(light electronic music)

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.683
- So I have something
that predates the stone.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.623
These are palm nuts.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.800
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.720
I'm pleased to be here to speak
to you at this CARTA event,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.763
and I thank Dr. White and Dr.
Churchland for the invitation.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.643
Like you,

00:01:52.643 --> 00:01:54.700
I'm passionately interested
in the human mind

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.060
and human behavior,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.210
and my particular interests are in

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.350
what humans share with other species

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.883
and how they are different.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.440
Understanding humans as
members of the natural world

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.943
is critical to understanding
human origins and our future.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.720
Let's start with how
humans use hand tools.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.980
Now, humans use hand tools like these now.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.290
And how our ancestors used
them in the deep past.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.920
We can see some continuities.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.940
We can use chopper cores too,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.120
even though we might not
be able to manufacture

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.360
a chopper core like this
one without practice.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.760
What about nonhuman primates?

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.530
Jane Goodall gave compelling reports

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.040
of wild chimpanzees fishing
for termites with grass stems.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.297
Prompting Louis Leakey's famous quote,

00:02:40.297 --> 00:02:44.177
"Now we must redefine tool, redefine man,

00:02:44.177 --> 00:02:46.267
"or accept chimpanzees as humans."

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.100
But the idea that scientists
in the mid-20th century

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.580
were unaware of nonhuman primates

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.760
naturally using tools is inaccurate.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.340
Darwin, citing a report
published more than 100 years

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.870
before Jane Goodall's report,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.810
mentioned wild chimpanzees
cracking nuts with stones

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.350
in his book The Descent of Man.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.450
Goodall's discovery should
not have come as a surprise,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.720
even if earlier reports of
chimpanzees cracking nuts

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.380
with stones had been forgotten.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.450
Because psychologists
had studied chimpanzees

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.510
and capuchin monkeys spontaneously
using objects as tools

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.930
in captive settings for decades.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.330
Wolfgang Kohler and Yerkes
studied captive apes,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.913
and Heinrich Kluver
studied capuchin monkeys.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.610
Studies with captive
nonhuman primates using tools

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.410
have continued since then,

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.330
and we've learned much from them.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.840
I'm going to focus, however,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.830
on what we know about

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.380
nonhuman primates' behavior
in natural settings,

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.113
in keeping with the
situations of human ancestors.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.460
And contemporary humans,

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.700
whose behavior and brains
we're hoping to understand.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.700
I'm going to focus on those
species that have been found

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.070
to use hand tools regularly
in their daily lives,

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.930
as humans did and do.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.180
So what can we learn from

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.890
nonhuman primates' use of hand tools

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.290
that helps us understand human origins

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.520
and our contemporary minds and behavior?

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.260
First we can learn what is shared.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.350
And we can deduce what is not shared,

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.630
and then we can work to
explain the differences.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.520
So let's start with the forms of tooling

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.783
that we find in nonhuman primates.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.990
And I use the word tooling to mean

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.693
using an object as a tool.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.500
Four genera of nonhuman primates
regularly use hand tools,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.930
and in each genus,

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.430
one species has been most
studied in this regard.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.713
And I'm going to focus on those species.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.510
Two species are apes, two are monkeys,

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.940
two are Asian, one African,
one South American.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.950
Thus they come from across the regions

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.510
in which nonhuman primates live.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.960
They most frequently use hand
tools to hammer, puncture,

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.193
scrape, probe, rake,
and in a few other ways.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.230
In these forms of tooling,

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.570
nonhuman primates perform simple actions.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.490
They produce a change in a
substrate or a fixed object

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.280
with one object, a stick or a stone.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.530
Here a chimpanzee punctures the soil

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.073
to get at an underground termite nest.

00:05:25.073 --> 00:05:28.470
A macaque hammers an oyster with stone,

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.950
and a capuchin monkey is
scraping the sand away

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.530
from a tuber in the ground.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.170
They use a hand tool to
alter one loose object.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.660
To pound a loose gastropod,

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.990
in this case by a macaque.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.610
Or a chimpanzee or capuchin
monkey cracking nuts.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.720
They generate novel combinations
of actions with objects,

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.100
some of which plausibly could
lead to achieving their goal,

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.780
but often they don't.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.920
This young monkey stacked
a nut on a small stone,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.450
on a larger piece of stone,

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.660
and then prepared to strike
it with his third stone.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.003
And that didn't work.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.190
They use simple toolkits.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.810
That is, they use two or
more items in a sequence

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.730
for different subgoals.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.260
On the left, a chimpanzee
uses a stout branch

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.220
to break into a bee's nest.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.160
And then on the right,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.103
she uses a smaller branch
to dip for honey and larvae.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.070
They select and transport materials,

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.100
taken as evidence of planning.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.090
That was a capuchin monkey

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.733
transporting a stone bipedally
several meters to an anvil.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.210
Here we see, I think I have to
click again, another monkey.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.100
He's selecting a heavier stone,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.580
which in this case is the smaller one.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.230
He taps and handles both stones

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.900
before selecting the heavier
stone to carry to the anvil.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.883
This is Elisabetta Visalberghi
narrating in Italian.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.130
The lighter one, although larger,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.360
was too light to be an effective hammer.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.293
We manufactured the stones
for that experiment.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.510
They modify materials and
manufacture tools by subtraction.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.630
Breaking sticks from branches

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.690
and twigs from sticks, for example.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.630
Here we see a chimpanzee
fishing for termites

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.230
using a stem that she
collected from a plant

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.080
like those shown on the left.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.270
Which she then modified by chewing on it

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.090
to have a brush tip.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.370
The lower right image shows

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.073
how the brush tip helps
to collect the termites.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.140
They use skilled movements

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.060
to achieve a good mechanical
effect with the tool.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.150
By skill, I mean achieving the goal

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.740
with minimal effort and
maximal effectiveness.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.950
This capuchin monkey can crack nuts

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.870
far more skillfully than I
can using the same stone,

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.083
and I can tell you I've tried many times.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.290
He does it in three strikes,

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.530
and he was cracking a nut like this.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.500
The monkey weighs 3 1/2 kilos.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.573
This is a big stone, or a big
nut for a monkey that size.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.830
They learned to use
stone tools with others

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.980
and from artifacts left by others.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.410
In other words, they have
technical traditions.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.533
They learn these skills
over a very lengthy period.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:22.960
Chimpanzees learn to crack nuts

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.740
over about a three-year period,

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.270
progressing from actions with one object

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.190
to combining objects, and then percussing,

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.390
and finally cracking nuts

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.730
when they're about three years old.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.760
Burmese macaques learn to harvest oysters

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.000
and crack loose gastropods
in a similar timeframe,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.800
with somewhat different
order of appearance

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.193
of the elements compared to chimpanzees.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.010
Bearded capuchins similarly
begin handling objects

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.080
soon after birth,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.640
but do not begin to place
an object on a surface

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.000
and then work on it with another object

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.810
until they're around two years old.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.640
And they begin to crack nuts

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.580
some months or even years after that.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.413
All in all,

00:09:01.413 --> 00:09:02.530
the developmental timelines

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.050
are quite similar across these species.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.120
Orangutans may develop their
tool-using skills more slowly,

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.980
but we really don't have

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.920
good ontogenetic data on this point yet.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.870
These primates, like
humans, forage extractively.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:16.703
That is,

00:09:16.703 --> 00:09:19.750
they collect food that is
hidden in wood or soil,

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.600
or protected by tough shells or rinds,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.920
or by thorns or irritating latex,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.700
some way they're defended.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.020
We see on the right a capuchin monkey

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.470
extracting a plant underground
storage organ from the soil.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:33.780
He's not using a tool for that,

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.813
he's digging in the sand with his hands.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.710
They use tools to process
abundant, high-quality foods.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.430
Here we see palm nuts eaten by
capuchin monkeys on the left.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.990
Coula nuts, also called African walnuts,

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.250
eaten by chimpanzees in the center.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.190
And a diverse array of gastropods

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.390
and marine organisms
cracked by the macaques.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.950
These are all abundant foods,

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.353
they're nutritious high-quality foods.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.350
They all spend a lot
of time on the ground,

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.020
and forage on the ground,
except for orangutans.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.040
And this is an interesting point,

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.990
and one that Meulman and van
Schaik have commented on.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.490
And if you're looking for a book about

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:13.790
tool use in nonhuman primates,

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.210
this is actually about not just primates,

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.880
but it's called Tool Use in Animals,

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.550
edited by Sanz, Call, and Boesch.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.450
It's a good book if you're
interested in this topic.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.563
The shared features I have mentioned.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.313
And some others that I list here.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:34.070
Bimanual actions,

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.600
complementary bimanual actions,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.870
modulating movements,

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.380
hierarchical organization
of action sequence,

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.950
preparatory movements
with a tool before use,

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.823
and others that I don't
have time to talk about.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.350
These are all things that reveal

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.740
shared perceptual, motor, cognitive,

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.250
and social foundations
for tooling in primates.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.070
And yet,

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.530
nonhuman primates do not use tools

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.630
as shown in these pictures

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.383
that are very common actions for humans.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.140
They don't do it spontaneously,

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.040
and to my knowledge they don't
do it with training either.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.970
Why not?

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.480
They don't seem to be limited

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.520
by gross sensory or motor characteristics.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.540
Here we see a drawing of a chimpanzee

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.030
delicately and dexterously
handling a plant stem

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.190
and holding a rigid stick.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.613
These were drawings taken from video.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.040
Instead, they differ from
humans in more subtle ways.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.840
Humans perceive spatial relations

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.040
between objects differently.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.200
For example, from two years of age,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.950
we can align the axes
of objects and surfaces

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.900
to each other accurately and easily,

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.583
as when you insert a key into a keyhole.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.983
And nonhuman primates do
not, as far as we now know.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.290
Nonhuman primates align points.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:58.890
They can align a probe to a
hole, that's a point alignment.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:02.140
But they don't align axes to each other.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.665
So here we see a bar, a cross,
and a kind of tomahawk shape.

00:12:06.665 --> 00:12:09.860
And a corresponding cutout in the tray.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.760
And two-year-old children can
put in the bar and the cross,

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.160
and three- and four-year-old children

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.540
can manage that tomahawk shape.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.900
And nonhuman primates with a lot of effort

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.510
can get the bar in,

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.050
and they actually can get them all in

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.720
if you just give them long enough.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.160
But they don't just pick it up, rotate it,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.040
position it, and place it in.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.790
They do it by smearing the
thing around on the surface,

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.300
and eventually they get it in.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.963
It's a very different strategy.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.900
Nonhuman primates move
one object at a time,

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.190
managing a few degrees of freedom.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.460
Humans manage two objects concurrently,

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.660
and sometimes more, as when knitting.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.023
I think knitting is an
underappreciated skill.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.550
In sum,

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:58.500
humans can coordinate movements
in space more precisely,

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.070
especially movements organized

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.260
with respect to the
target object or objects,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.850
than nonhuman primates.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.050
Humans can manage a
greater number of relations

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.593
between objects concurrently
than nonhuman primates.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.060
Humans also have more
elaborate social cognition,

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.350
and this plays out in many ways.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:20.120
Without teaching, and without
intentional scaffolding,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.740
nonhuman primates learn
their technical skills

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.253
less efficiently than do humans.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.670
Turning to the question that
Drs. White and Churchland

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.560
asked us to address,

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.150
how did the use of tools contribute

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.790
to the origins of our species,
brains, and cognition?

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.460
I would say as a primatologist

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.130
that I want to turn the question around.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.380
I want to know,

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.970
what features of ancestral hominids

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.060
and their ecological and
their social circumstances

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.830
set the stage for humans to expand

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.250
into a specialized foraging niche

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.733
that increasingly relied on using tools?

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.550
My suggestion is that natural selection

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.270
for perceptual and behavioral attributes

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.790
associated with extractive foraging,

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.980
particularly the perception and management

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.970
of spatial relations among objects

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.410
and the precise control of the movements

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.780
of the body-plus-object system,

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.560
slowly but eventually
enabled ancestral humans

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.680
to expand into a
specialized foraging niche

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.680
that relied on using tools.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.590
Humans are obligate tool users.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:32.313
No nonhuman primate is
an obligate tool user.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.300
In other words,

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.750
I suggest that the key evolutionary shifts

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.550
that got humans started down this path

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.800
were perceptual and action components

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.430
associated with handling and
moving objects during foraging.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.770
These shifts enable humans to use tools

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:54.403
far more flexibly than
can nonhuman primates.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.250
Of course other aspects of human biology

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.840
that are associated with
tool use were co-evolving.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.240
Including morphology, social cognition,

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.953
attentional control, memory
strategies, and so on.

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.820
So our next speaker is going to tell us

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.210
something more about how these features

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.690
played out in human evolution.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.550
I want to take just a few moments,

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.320
the remaining time that I have,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.200
to tell you a bit more about
the work that I do in Brazil,

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.620
and the monkeys that I think
are so interesting to study.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.560
And I do this work collaboratively

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.290
with Patricia Izar and
Elisabetta Visalberghi,

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:34.690
who are shown in that photo.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.320
These monkeys collect palm nuts.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.330
They take them to anvils
and they use stone hammers

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.310
to crack them at those anvils.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.020
You've seen a few clips
of what these monkeys do.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:51.020
This one shows a female
positioning the nut very carefully,

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.200
and working on that stone.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.890
And this is completely characteristic.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:01.560
What she's doing looks,
it's not chaotic or random.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.550
There's actually quite
a bit of method there.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.370
In the end she arrives at the nut

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.090
in a very stable position on the anvil,

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.000
and then she whacks it,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.520
even though it does
sometimes fly off the anvil.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.983
That's just one of the
hazards of the occupation.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.583
Very slow-motion.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:26.840
There's really beauty in that action.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.383
I think these monkeys
are Hercules with a tail.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.860
Capuchins have all the characteristics

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.010
we associate with tool use in primates.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.470
They're quite terrestrial,

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.330
they use bipedal stance occasionally

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.110
on the ground to look around,

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.040
they transport things bipedally.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.700
They're extractive foragers,

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.550
they percuss objects during foraging

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.470
even when they're not using tools.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.650
They're tolerant to
young monkeys near them

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:54.790
while they're foraging.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.880
They're generally social cohesive.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.210
Their habitat has features

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.920
that make the monkeys' nut-cracking likely

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.630
and of use to them.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.630
Nuts and anvil sites are abundant,

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:05.840
the hammer stones are not.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.940
Those are the restricted resources.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.520
The nuts and the larvae
that they often contain

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.020
are both preferred and nutritious.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.060
And they're available all year long.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.050
So it makes a lot of sense

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.450
if you're a capuchin
monkey living in this area

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.940
to crack nuts.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:21.940
Thank you very much.

00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:25.041
(applause)

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.213
(soft electronic music)
