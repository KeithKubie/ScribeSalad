this is a very interesting question this

smell is you might say and there's some

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.040

that if he takes four odors let's say

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849
that if he takes four odors let's say
 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.370
that if he takes four odors let's say
four fairly common odors that you would

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380
four fairly common odors that you would
 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.200

one after another puts them under your

nose you say oh that's banana that's

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630

lavender whatever the four are and then

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720
lavender whatever the four are and then
 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.360

he blends them together in ways and he

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370
he blends them together in ways and he
 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.980
he blends them together in ways and he
doesn't tell you what he so he puts two

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:40.990
doesn't tell you what he so he puts two
 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.420
doesn't tell you what he so he puts two
of them together and puts it under your

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430
of them together and puts it under your
 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.250
of them together and puts it under your
nose and you can identify quite easily

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260
nose and you can identify quite easily
 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.720

which two he's put in in any random way

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
which two he's put in in any random way
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.280
which two he's put in in any random way
then he puts three of them together and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290
then he puts three of them together and
 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.530
then he puts three of them together and
it becomes much more difficult to figure

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540
it becomes much more difficult to figure
 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.750
it becomes much more difficult to figure
out which three of the four are in there

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760
out which three of the four are in there
 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.940
out which three of the four are in there
and by the time he puts four in there

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950
and by the time he puts four in there
 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.890
and by the time he puts four in there
there's no way you know so actually the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900
there's no way you know so actually the
 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.540
there's no way you know so actually the
experiments done with six so you know

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550
experiments done with six so you know
 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.010
experiments done with six so you know
otherwise you'd know it was just the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020
otherwise you'd know it was just the
 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.920
otherwise you'd know it was just the
four so that once you hit three or four

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930
four so that once you hit three or four
 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.889

odors in a blend you have a great deal

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899
odors in a blend you have a great deal
 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.890

what are the things that made up that

what are the things that made up that
now essentially new perception of a

now essentially new perception of a
 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.870
now essentially new perception of a
particular odor of the blend and that's

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880
particular odor of the blend and that's
 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.090
particular odor of the blend and that's
true not only as it turns out for
