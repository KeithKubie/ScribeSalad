00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:02.279
- [Voiceover] What I
wanna do in this video

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:04.265
is think about how different populations

00:00:04.265 --> 00:00:06.298
that share the same ecosystem can interact

00:00:06.298 --> 00:00:08.238
with each other and actually provide

00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:10.124
a feedback loop on each other.

00:00:10.124 --> 00:00:11.529
And there's many cases of this,

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.663
but the most cited general example

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:15.517
is the case when one population

00:00:15.517 --> 00:00:18.028
wants to eat another population.

00:00:18.028 --> 00:00:21.192
And so you have the predator population

00:00:21.192 --> 00:00:23.987
that likes to eat the prey.

00:00:23.987 --> 00:00:27.770
So you have the predator
and prey interactions.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.513
I'm doing the prey in I guess
a somewhat bloody color,

00:00:29.513 --> 00:00:31.758
I guess 'cause, well,
they're going to be eaten.

00:00:31.758 --> 00:00:33.610
So let's just think about how these

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.267
populations could interact.

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:37.615
Let me draw a little chart
here that you're probably

00:00:37.615 --> 00:00:39.328
familiar with by now where we show

00:00:39.328 --> 00:00:42.336
how a population can change over time.

00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:44.938
So the time, the horizontal axis is time.

00:00:44.938 --> 00:00:47.605
The vertical axis is population.

00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:50.262
Population.

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:53.598
And so let's just, in our starting point,

00:00:53.598 --> 00:00:56.848
let's say that our prey is starting out

00:00:58.262 --> 00:01:00.405
at a relatively high point.

00:01:00.405 --> 00:01:02.174
Let's say we're right there in time,

00:01:02.174 --> 00:01:03.958
and let's say for whatever reason,

00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.476
our predator population is relatively low.

00:01:07.476 --> 00:01:09.817
So what do we think is
going to happen here?

00:01:09.817 --> 00:01:12.689
Well, at this point, with
a low density of predators,

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.254
it's gonna be much easier
for them for find a meal,

00:01:15.254 --> 00:01:18.011
and it's gonna be much easier
for the prey to get caught.

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.753
So since it's more easy,
it's easier for the predators

00:01:20.753 --> 00:01:23.071
to find a meal, you can
imagine their population

00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:25.603
starting to increase.

00:01:25.603 --> 00:01:26.747
But what's going to happen is

00:01:26.747 --> 00:01:28.204
their population is increasing.

00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:30.205
Well, it's gonna be more
likely that they're gonna,

00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:32.308
they prey is gonna get caught.

00:01:32.308 --> 00:01:34.163
There's gonna be more
of their hunters around,

00:01:34.163 --> 00:01:35.351
more of their predators around.

00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:39.046
So that population is
going to start decreasing

00:01:39.046 --> 00:01:42.399
all the way to a point
where if the population

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.211
of the prey gets low enough, the predators

00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:45.921
are gonna have, they're gonna start having

00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:49.363
trouble finding food again,
and so that their population

00:01:49.363 --> 00:01:51.985
might start to decrease,
and as their population

00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:53.971
decreases, what's gonna
happen to the prey?

00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:56.467
Well, then, there's gonna
be less predators around,

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:59.161
so they might be able to, their population

00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:00.798
might start to increase.

00:02:00.798 --> 00:02:02.717
And so I think you see what's happening.

00:02:02.717 --> 00:02:05.962
The predator and prey,
they can kind of form

00:02:05.962 --> 00:02:08.529
this cyclic interaction with each other.

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:10.010
And what I've just drawn,
this is often known

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.260
as the predator-prey cycle.

00:02:13.562 --> 00:02:16.098
And I just reasoned through
that you can imagine

00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:17.591
a world where you can
have the cycle between

00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:19.694
predator and prey populations.

00:02:19.694 --> 00:02:22.231
But you can also run computer simulations

00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:24.627
that will show this,
and even observational

00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:27.188
data out in the field also shows this.

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:29.771
One of the often cited examples

00:02:30.946 --> 00:02:35.113
is interactions between,
between the snowshoe hare,

00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:41.093
which would be the prey in this situation,

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:45.565
and the Canadian lynx,
which would be the predator,

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:48.148
the predator in this situation.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.837
And you see a very similar
cycle to what I just drew,

00:02:52.837 --> 00:02:54.264
kind of just reasoning through it,

00:02:54.264 --> 00:02:56.499
and this, right here, is actual data.

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:58.759
You see the passage of time here,

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:00.553
and this is a long passage of time.

00:03:00.553 --> 00:03:02.298
We're starting in the early 1800's

00:03:02.298 --> 00:03:06.549
going all the way to the early-mid 1900's.

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.720
So it's roughly 100 years
of data that we're showing,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.157
and in the vertical axis,
you have thousands of animals

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:13.127
and we're plotting both the population

00:03:13.127 --> 00:03:16.679
of snowshoe hares and Canadian lynx

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:19.253
in a certain area on this chart.

00:03:19.253 --> 00:03:22.586
And as you see, when the prey population

00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:26.437
is high, when the prey population,

00:03:27.503 --> 00:03:29.754
sorry, when the predator
population is high,

00:03:29.754 --> 00:03:32.337
when we have a lot of
the Canadian lynx around,

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:35.587
that we see a lower, a lower population

00:03:37.705 --> 00:03:40.596
of the prey, of the hare.

00:03:40.596 --> 00:03:44.085
But then as, since you
have a low population

00:03:44.085 --> 00:03:46.476
of the food in this situation,

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:49.682
the predator population
starts to decrease.

00:03:49.682 --> 00:03:51.148
So let me draw an arrow here.

00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:53.625
The predator population starts to decrease

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:56.493
and, let me do that same blue color.

00:03:56.493 --> 00:03:59.538
And so the predator population decreases,

00:03:59.538 --> 00:04:01.816
and as that predator population decreases,

00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:04.540
well then the prey population increases

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.327
'cause there's less folks
around to hunt them.

00:04:08.327 --> 00:04:10.520
So the prey population increases,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.144
and you see that the other way around.

00:04:12.144 --> 00:04:15.170
When the prey population
is really is, well maybe

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.952
we'll show it right over
here, and this is real data.

00:04:16.952 --> 00:04:18.870
That's why it's not always super clean.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.901
But when the prey population
is really, really high

00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:26.831
and the predator population
is relatively low,

00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:29.412
well, then, the predators
say, "Hey, it's really

00:04:29.412 --> 00:04:31.559
"easy for us to find meals right now."

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:33.166
That's kind of that
starting point in that,

00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:34.879
when I was just reasoning through it.

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.430
And so their population starts to.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.545
Oh, oops, what did I do?

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:39.628
There, there.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.268
Let me make sure.

00:04:42.268 --> 00:04:45.363
So their population starts to increase,

00:04:45.363 --> 00:04:48.044
and as the predator population increases,

00:04:48.044 --> 00:04:51.760
well the prey population,
the prey population

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.510
is going to decrease.

00:04:54.465 --> 00:04:57.673
So this is real data
showing the snowshoe hare,

00:04:57.673 --> 00:05:00.585
the prey, and the Canadian
lynx, the predator,

00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:03.309
on over many, many decades to show

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:05.392
this predator-prey cycle.
