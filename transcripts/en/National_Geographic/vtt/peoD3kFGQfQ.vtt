00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:01.800
[music playing]

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:12.467
NARRATOR: Of the 429 men who
died on the battleship "USS

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:16.066
Oklahoma," only
35 were identified

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:19.800
in the years immediately
following the attack.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.967
The rest were buried in
graves marked "Unknown."

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:28.433
But almost 75 years later,
one of these unknown men

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:29.600
was given a name.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.934
FAYE HOPKINS BOORE: My
brother's the oldest

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:47.867
so he got the phone call.

00:00:47.867 --> 00:00:53.066
And he called me and couldn't
get words out, couldn't speak.

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.767
And I knew it was
something important.

00:00:55.767 --> 00:00:58.500
And I thought something
happened to somebody.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.767
I said, just spit it
out, just tell me.

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:04.233
And then he said, Uncle
Ed's been identified.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.800
NARRATOR: There is no statute of
limitations on honoring anyone

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.900
who died for their country.

00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:24.834
The oil that shrouded Pearl
Harbor after the attack

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:29.066
became crucial in
identifying unknown remains.

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:32.533
CAPT. EDWARD REEDY: The fuel
oil has acted as a preservative

00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:33.834
for the DNA in these bones.

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:37.266
And we've been able to
get very high-quality DNA

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:39.400
from these skeletal
remains, which has

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.767
actually worked in our favor.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:45.633
If we have the right
family reference samples,

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:49.033
we can successfully
identify all of the unknowns

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:50.533
that we currently
have recovered.

00:01:56.033 --> 00:02:00.667
People often ask, is the unknown
soldier a thing of the past.

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:03.533
And the answer to that is yes.

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:06.800
I think it's important to
account for an individual,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.133
to bring that individual
home, and to give them a name.

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:15.700
It's one of my moral
and ethical imperatives

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.200
that no one should be
buried without a name.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.300
NARRATOR: On October
15, 2016, Faye Hopkins

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.266
Boore was finally
able to lay her uncle

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:30.967
to rest in his hometown.
