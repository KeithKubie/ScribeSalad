00:00:05.698 --> 00:00:09.365
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.862
- Good afternoon to everyone.

00:00:32.862 --> 00:00:37.634
My name is Dylan Riley and
I'm a Professor of Sociology

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:40.933
in the Department of
Sociology here at Berkeley

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:45.100
and a member of the Bernard
Moses Lectureship committee.

00:00:47.493 --> 00:00:49.937
We are of course enormously
pleased and excited

00:00:49.937 --> 00:00:52.336
to present Arlie Hochschild,
this year's speaker

00:00:52.336 --> 00:00:56.503
at the Bernard Moses Memorial
Lecture series this afternoon

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.624
and before presenting Professor Hochschild

00:01:03.624 --> 00:01:06.063
I'm just gonna describe a little bit

00:01:06.063 --> 00:01:09.044
about what this lecture series is about.

00:01:09.044 --> 00:01:12.461
It's part of the obligation of the quest.

00:01:13.978 --> 00:01:16.798
But he's a very interesting person so.

00:01:16.798 --> 00:01:19.158
In 1937 a University
of California president

00:01:19.158 --> 00:01:21.604
Robert Gordon Sproul, Sproul Plaza,

00:01:21.604 --> 00:01:24.093
and the UC Board of Regents established

00:01:24.093 --> 00:01:26.164
the Bernard Moses Memorial Lectureship

00:01:26.164 --> 00:01:28.888
in the Social Sciences.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:31.408
The Lectureship honors the
memory of Bernard Moses

00:01:31.408 --> 00:01:32.912
who was a professor of history

00:01:32.912 --> 00:01:34.983
and political science at Berkeley.

00:01:34.983 --> 00:01:37.299
He was a kind of universal intellectual.

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.466
He wrote books ranging from
studies of constitutionalism

00:01:43.714 --> 00:01:46.405
in Latin America to Swiss democracy

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:50.572
to the rise of the German
empire in the late 19th Century

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:54.631
and he was a professor at the University

00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:57.548
from 1875 to 1911 and then Emeritus

00:01:58.412 --> 00:02:01.245
from 1911 until 1930 when he died.

00:02:02.924 --> 00:02:05.936
Under worldwide reputation
for his various contributions

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:08.293
and really in a way for establishing

00:02:08.293 --> 00:02:13.289
the tradition of comparative
politics at Berkeley.

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:17.112
The lecture series has
featured in the recent past

00:02:17.112 --> 00:02:20.772
such eminent speakers as Herma Hill Kay,

00:02:20.772 --> 00:02:23.820
Nicholas Riasanovsky, George Lakoff,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.357
Kenneth Stampp, Carolyn Merchant,

00:02:27.357 --> 00:02:29.440
Jean Lave, Emmanuel Saez,

00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:34.458
Mary Ann Mason and Sociology's
very own Ann Swidler.

00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:39.925
But now I'd like to turn to our speaker

00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:44.073
for this afternoon,
Professor Arlie Hochschild.

00:02:44.073 --> 00:02:45.904
Professor Hochschild is a distinguished,

00:02:45.904 --> 00:02:49.121
really eminent American sociologist.

00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:51.648
Her most recent work that
she's gonna be speaking

00:02:51.648 --> 00:02:55.677
about today explores the
experiences, beliefs,

00:02:55.677 --> 00:02:58.763
and deep story of the American right,

00:02:58.763 --> 00:03:01.037
obviously a very timely matter

00:03:01.037 --> 00:03:03.477
and this is encapsulated in her book

00:03:03.477 --> 00:03:05.595
Strangers in Their Own Land:

00:03:05.595 --> 00:03:09.800
Anger and Mourning on the American Right.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.136
This text was based on
five years of research

00:03:13.136 --> 00:03:15.765
in Louisiana's oil and petrochemical belt.

00:03:15.765 --> 00:03:20.692
So if you go out into the
delta of the Mississippi River

00:03:20.692 --> 00:03:24.064
this is where these things are located

00:03:24.064 --> 00:03:28.008
where she interviewed
Tea Party enthusiasts.

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:30.163
The book was a New York Times' best-seller

00:03:30.163 --> 00:03:34.330
and it was a finalist as well
for the National Book Award.

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:40.078
This latest book sort of
culminates an incredibly

00:03:40.078 --> 00:03:43.411
impressive career with such great titles

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.396
as The Time Bind, The Second Shift,

00:03:47.396 --> 00:03:51.299
The Managed Heart, So How's
the Family and Other Essays,

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.549
The Outsource Itself, and Global Women.

00:03:56.347 --> 00:04:01.019
Her publications has been
translated into 16 languages

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.025
and she has contributed to
efforts in global feminist

00:04:04.025 --> 00:04:06.459
community programs and
she has also written

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.626
a children's story entitled
Colleen the Question Girl.

00:04:13.448 --> 00:04:17.074
I'd like to just say a couple of words

00:04:17.074 --> 00:04:20.657
about Professor Hochschild
as a sociologist

00:04:22.284 --> 00:04:24.480
before turning the floor over to her.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.057
I would say that really kind of as a group

00:04:27.057 --> 00:04:31.083
sociologists are generally
characterized by two traits.

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:33.609
One is that they're terrible writers

00:04:33.609 --> 00:04:36.209
and the other is that they
have a kind of a penchant

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:40.073
for inventing totally
unnecessary terminology

00:04:40.073 --> 00:04:42.073
to describe the obvious.

00:04:43.126 --> 00:04:44.712
What I think is really admirable

00:04:44.712 --> 00:04:48.285
about Professor Hochschild's
work is it's complete break

00:04:48.285 --> 00:04:52.143
with both of these
traditions in the discipline.

00:04:52.143 --> 00:04:56.136
As anyone who's looked
at this most recent book

00:04:56.136 --> 00:04:57.845
or any of her work knows

00:04:57.845 --> 00:05:00.489
she's a great prose writer.

00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:02.822
Very rare in our discipline.

00:05:04.073 --> 00:05:07.508
And second, the concepts
that she brings to bear

00:05:07.508 --> 00:05:11.425
on her analyses, emotional
labor, second shift,

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:16.028
deep story, not only
encapsulate and reveal

00:05:18.433 --> 00:05:20.795
underlying elements of social reality

00:05:20.795 --> 00:05:22.341
that we wouldn't have seen before,

00:05:22.341 --> 00:05:24.334
they are often in fact reincorporated

00:05:24.334 --> 00:05:27.588
into our social imagination in a way

00:05:27.588 --> 00:05:30.187
that's really only comparable
to the great sociologist

00:05:30.187 --> 00:05:34.614
Robert Merton with his concept
such as self-fulfilling

00:05:34.614 --> 00:05:36.197
prophesy and so on.

00:05:37.984 --> 00:05:41.397
So really an unusual scholar
and a truly great sociologist

00:05:41.397 --> 00:05:45.014
and it's really my pleasure to welcome

00:05:45.014 --> 00:05:46.640
Professor Arlie Hochschild

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.796
to the Moses Lecture
series this afternoon.

00:05:48.796 --> 00:05:51.963
(audience applauding)

00:05:56.107 --> 00:05:57.107
- Thank you.

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:03.985
Well what a great pleasure to be here.

00:06:03.985 --> 00:06:08.152
You know actually I House
was the very first building

00:06:09.555 --> 00:06:12.138
I stepped into almost trembling

00:06:14.712 --> 00:06:19.509
as a first year graduate
student here at Berkeley

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:22.592
and I stayed here for my first month.

00:06:23.942 --> 00:06:28.109
I actually even have a small
box that says I House on it

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.893
which contained all my
worldly possessions.

00:06:34.274 --> 00:06:35.857
So here I am again.

00:06:40.205 --> 00:06:43.053
So what I thought I'd try and do today

00:06:43.053 --> 00:06:46.220
is first take you with me on a journey

00:06:47.903 --> 00:06:49.903
that I've returned from,

00:06:52.051 --> 00:06:55.134
tell you the question I went in with,

00:06:56.603 --> 00:06:59.270
but the findings I came out with

00:07:00.502 --> 00:07:04.669
and then share with you some
of the responses I've had

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:10.666
to The Second Shift and then deal with

00:07:14.172 --> 00:07:17.179
kind of one of the fundamental
questions that I think

00:07:17.179 --> 00:07:19.846
the book raises of the efficacy,

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.807
the wisdom, the capacity
to reach over the growing

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.473
partisan divide in this country today.

00:07:33.473 --> 00:07:34.655
Can we do it?

00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:36.735
Is it worth doing?

00:07:36.735 --> 00:07:40.902
What happens and what would
be the result of that?

00:07:41.737 --> 00:07:45.737
So let me begin by saying
that I started in 2011

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:54.646
realizing that I, Berkeley,
now my home all these years,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.230
I was living in a
political and moral bubble.

00:08:01.796 --> 00:08:04.046
It was a geographic bubble.

00:08:05.225 --> 00:08:08.643
You know from this book The Big Sort

00:08:08.643 --> 00:08:11.893
that when people move it's increasingly

00:08:12.991 --> 00:08:16.908
not for better, cheaper
housing and better jobs

00:08:18.567 --> 00:08:22.400
but for compatibility,
cultural and political.

00:08:26.611 --> 00:08:28.976
And I also found myself in a media bubble.

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:32.059
I read The New York Times religiously

00:08:34.468 --> 00:08:38.450
and an electronic bubble
the way all of us are

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.907
our computers give us back
to ourselves as you know

00:08:42.907 --> 00:08:46.240
algorithmically and I didn't know anyone

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:51.493
that would be suspicious say of a word

00:08:51.493 --> 00:08:55.395
like international here,
International House,

00:08:55.395 --> 00:08:58.006
or would think that
Berkeley and things public,

00:08:58.006 --> 00:09:01.306
public universities and parks were suspect

00:09:01.306 --> 00:09:03.496
and that even the government itself

00:09:03.496 --> 00:09:06.582
was more a problem than solution.

00:09:06.582 --> 00:09:08.210
I didn't know anyone like that

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.467
and turned out I wasn't alone.

00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:15.634
A recent Pew study showed that
nearly half, 47% of people

00:09:17.642 --> 00:09:20.529
who planned to vote for Hillary Clinton

00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:24.696
didn't have any close friends
who were Trump supporters

00:09:26.948 --> 00:09:31.907
and same number say that
if a friend supported Trump

00:09:31.907 --> 00:09:35.407
it would put a strain on their friendship.

00:09:40.654 --> 00:09:44.737
So in fact democrats turn
out to be substantially

00:09:46.424 --> 00:09:49.507
less able to countenance
friends who support

00:09:49.507 --> 00:09:52.155
the quote wrong candidates.

00:09:52.155 --> 00:09:55.367
Just 13% of republicans
say a friend's support

00:09:55.367 --> 00:09:59.534
of Hillary Clinton would
strain their relationship.

00:10:01.865 --> 00:10:03.895
So many reasons for that imbalance

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:07.728
but I was in some strange
way kind of relieved

00:10:09.826 --> 00:10:12.076
okay I wasn't the only one.

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:15.462
So I decided you know what?

00:10:16.548 --> 00:10:21.466
I'm gonna try and find a
bubble that's as far right

00:10:21.466 --> 00:10:25.483
as the sociology department
at Berkeley, California

00:10:25.483 --> 00:10:29.188
in the blue state of California is left.

00:10:29.188 --> 00:10:30.572
I thought well where would that be?

00:10:30.572 --> 00:10:34.473
That would be in the south
where we know the right

00:10:34.473 --> 00:10:37.362
has risen the fastest and strongest.

00:10:37.362 --> 00:10:38.792
But where in the south?

00:10:38.792 --> 00:10:41.449
Well how about the super south?

00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:44.503
And I discovered that 2012
looking at the proportion

00:10:44.503 --> 00:10:47.503
of whites who voted for Barack Obama

00:10:48.894 --> 00:10:52.772
in the whole region of
the south, 13 states,

00:10:52.772 --> 00:10:57.118
it was a third but in
Louisiana it was 14%.

00:10:57.118 --> 00:11:00.701
So I thought perfect,
okay, let's go there.

00:11:01.723 --> 00:11:03.890
And let's within Louisiana

00:11:08.665 --> 00:11:12.832
there is a region where
the petrochemical industry

00:11:13.668 --> 00:11:17.249
is concentrated and as luck would have it

00:11:17.249 --> 00:11:21.232
I had one contact who was through a former

00:11:21.232 --> 00:11:24.289
graduate student of mine in sociology.

00:11:24.289 --> 00:11:28.151
His mother-in-law lived in
a town called Lake Charles

00:11:28.151 --> 00:11:32.249
so I started there not thinking
that this would be more

00:11:32.249 --> 00:11:36.166
than a taster of just
seeing what it felt like,

00:11:38.839 --> 00:11:41.339
wasn't sure it was a book yet.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:47.363
And I brought with me The Paradox.

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:51.426
How many have read the book?

00:11:51.426 --> 00:11:53.542
Cause I don't wanna repeat too much.

00:11:53.542 --> 00:11:54.709
Okay, alright.

00:11:56.103 --> 00:11:57.186
Good I asked.

00:11:58.627 --> 00:12:02.127
The Paradox was the red state paradox

00:12:02.127 --> 00:12:05.877
that how could it be
that the poorest states,

00:12:06.878 --> 00:12:10.878
the states with the worst
schools and hospitals,

00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:16.526
the most road accidents,
the lowest life expectancy,

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:22.037
worst health, most pollution,
are also the states

00:12:22.037 --> 00:12:24.717
that receive more money
from the federal government

00:12:24.717 --> 00:12:28.986
in aid than they give to it in tax dollars

00:12:28.986 --> 00:12:31.819
and revile the federal government?

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:37.187
That was the red state
paradox and Louisiana

00:12:37.187 --> 00:12:39.058
was an exaggerated version of that.

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:41.979
Second poorest state,
44% of its state budget

00:12:41.979 --> 00:12:46.146
came from the federal
government and super tea party

00:12:47.957 --> 00:12:52.124
very right wing and in the
end extremely enthusiastic

00:12:53.932 --> 00:12:55.515
about Donald Trump.

00:12:59.747 --> 00:13:02.799
I also discovered that as
I kind of sniffed the air

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:06.414
around Lake Charles and
went over the I-10 bridge

00:13:06.414 --> 00:13:10.081
to West Lake, this is
in southwest Louisiana

00:13:13.658 --> 00:13:16.097
and petrochemical plants all around

00:13:16.097 --> 00:13:20.366
my eyes would begin to
sting and the sky was

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:24.533
like it is today and there was
people all had bottled water.

00:13:26.221 --> 00:13:28.941
So I thought wait a minute.

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:30.649
Something is talking to me.

00:13:30.649 --> 00:13:34.063
Maybe the environment is
what I should look at,

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:37.517
this pollution, because
people in Louisiana

00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:40.848
that I came to know were
adamantly against regulating

00:13:40.848 --> 00:13:44.229
any kind of industry
including the polluters.

00:13:44.229 --> 00:13:46.856
So they were living in one
of the most polluted spots

00:13:46.856 --> 00:13:51.099
in the entire world and
they're opposed to pollution.

00:13:51.099 --> 00:13:52.600
I thought this is my keyhole issue.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.600
Let me just look at that
and get to know people.

00:13:57.443 --> 00:14:01.026
Well five years later,
50 interviews later,

00:14:02.318 --> 00:14:05.401
over 4,000 pages of transcript later,

00:14:09.677 --> 00:14:12.611
I came to realize that the
question I had come with

00:14:12.611 --> 00:14:14.280
was my question.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.066
People would respond to
it by saying yeah, yeah,

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:21.014
we know about the red state paradox.

00:14:21.014 --> 00:14:23.252
It's an embarrassment to us.

00:14:23.252 --> 00:14:24.835
They knew about it.

00:14:25.822 --> 00:14:27.405
They lived with it.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.103
But they set it aside.

00:14:31.197 --> 00:14:32.783
Knowledgeable about it,
so it wasn't a question

00:14:32.783 --> 00:14:34.328
of not knowing.

00:14:34.328 --> 00:14:38.495
It was a question of its
not being the main point.

00:14:39.434 --> 00:14:41.101
So I thought well if

00:14:42.422 --> 00:14:44.492
that's one thing I learned.

00:14:44.492 --> 00:14:49.190
The low importance
attributed to this question.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.440
But as I got to know people

00:14:55.357 --> 00:14:57.940
I began to realize that values,

00:15:02.345 --> 00:15:05.345
the way values expressed themselves,

00:15:07.291 --> 00:15:11.458
the way values value is by
making a story feel true

00:15:14.365 --> 00:15:18.306
and the way circumstances
really imprint themselves

00:15:18.306 --> 00:15:22.473
is again the way it makes people
believe a story to be true.

00:15:29.445 --> 00:15:33.230
So I made up a story that
I thought fit everything

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.480
I was hearing over that period of time.

00:15:39.931 --> 00:15:42.014
And what is a deep story?

00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:48.044
Deep story is a story that feels true.

00:15:50.122 --> 00:15:54.067
It's described by the objective
correlative of feelings

00:15:54.067 --> 00:15:58.234
that is it's what all the
details you believe to be true

00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:02.970
that account for why
you feel what you feel.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.069
You feel mourning.

00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:05.453
You feel lost.

00:16:05.453 --> 00:16:07.200
You feel envy.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.450
You feel anger.

00:16:12.112 --> 00:16:14.695
And those are told in the story

00:16:15.643 --> 00:16:18.560
which to refresh you goes like this

00:16:19.588 --> 00:16:23.755
and by the way all of us
have underneath our political

00:16:26.168 --> 00:16:27.918
beliefs a deep story.

00:16:28.771 --> 00:16:32.503
You're waiting in line
and your feel are pointed

00:16:32.503 --> 00:16:35.670
toward the top of a hill as in a dream

00:16:37.222 --> 00:16:41.139
tells itself by metaphor
and you see at the top

00:16:42.098 --> 00:16:46.265
the American dream and you
don't see anything behind it

00:16:48.206 --> 00:16:50.645
that's causing changes in it.

00:16:50.645 --> 00:16:52.926
You just see the distance
between you and it.

00:16:52.926 --> 00:16:55.282
You're not looking
behind you in line either

00:16:55.282 --> 00:16:58.124
and the line hasn't moved.

00:16:58.124 --> 00:17:00.730
People hadn't had a raise in two decades

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:01.955
and they were tired.

00:17:01.955 --> 00:17:03.790
They were in their fifties and sixties.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:04.790
This was it.

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:08.191
Life was narrowing down.

00:17:10.707 --> 00:17:14.160
And then they notice
someone cutting ahead.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.229
Well who's that?

00:17:16.229 --> 00:17:19.378
Well that would be blacks
finally through federally

00:17:19.378 --> 00:17:23.400
mandated affirmative action
plans given access to jobs

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.908
that have historically
been reserved for whites

00:17:26.908 --> 00:17:29.789
and even worse, women
who now through federally

00:17:29.789 --> 00:17:33.956
mandated affirmative action
are finally given jobs

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.859
that have historically
been reserved for men.

00:17:38.859 --> 00:17:40.109
I'm an example.

00:17:41.871 --> 00:17:45.447
So these line cutters and then
we would have undocumented

00:17:45.447 --> 00:17:49.614
workers and even for them
the oil-soaked brown pelican,

00:17:52.521 --> 00:17:56.688
Louisiana's state bird,
seems to be cutting in line.

00:17:57.881 --> 00:18:01.297
People told me time and time again.

00:18:01.297 --> 00:18:04.146
Oh those liberal environmentalists

00:18:04.146 --> 00:18:06.479
put animals ahead of people.

00:18:07.964 --> 00:18:08.797
Animists.

00:18:12.351 --> 00:18:15.233
And then another moment of
the right wing deep story

00:18:15.233 --> 00:18:19.768
looks like Barack Obama
who should be the impartial

00:18:19.768 --> 00:18:22.794
supervisor of this line, this country,

00:18:22.794 --> 00:18:25.721
seems to be waving to the line cutter.

00:18:25.721 --> 00:18:27.721
Oh he's their president.

00:18:29.014 --> 00:18:30.967
He doesn't see us.

00:18:30.967 --> 00:18:33.242
In fact isn't he a line cutter?

00:18:33.242 --> 00:18:37.873
And here was a little paranoid
streak that would kick in.

00:18:37.873 --> 00:18:40.759
Oh, how did his mother, poor woman,

00:18:40.759 --> 00:18:44.926
not a woman of, not wealthy,
afford a Harvard education?

00:18:47.195 --> 00:18:48.945
A Columbia education?

00:18:50.615 --> 00:18:52.323
Something fishy.

00:18:52.323 --> 00:18:53.740
Something rigged.

00:18:55.172 --> 00:18:57.125
Would come after that observation.

00:18:57.125 --> 00:19:00.703
No such thing as scholarships
for brilliant students.

00:19:00.703 --> 00:19:01.953
So it's rigged.

00:19:03.022 --> 00:19:06.855
So another moment of the
right wing deep story

00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:11.766
someone from the coast,
maybe from Berkeley,

00:19:14.074 --> 00:19:18.241
maybe a woman, would get up
and was way ahead in line

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:25.702
and turn back and say
oh, you to the person

00:19:27.685 --> 00:19:31.102
waiting in line who's been there forever,

00:19:33.654 --> 00:19:37.237
you homophobic, racist,
sexist, fat redneck

00:19:41.744 --> 00:19:43.616
and that was the word,
redneck, that you could

00:19:43.616 --> 00:19:46.783
almost see it was a tipping point term

00:19:48.209 --> 00:19:50.843
of I've been dissociated.

00:19:50.843 --> 00:19:52.926
I have been non-personed.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.881
I am a stranger in my own land.

00:19:55.881 --> 00:19:58.202
I've worked this hard,
working hard and so on,

00:19:58.202 --> 00:20:00.276
serving the American dream.

00:20:00.276 --> 00:20:02.943
Redneck kind of cast them adrift

00:20:04.879 --> 00:20:06.869
and of course the
environment wasn't theirs.

00:20:06.869 --> 00:20:09.145
They didn't feel like
the culture was theirs.

00:20:09.145 --> 00:20:11.728
They didn't feel like religion,

00:20:13.536 --> 00:20:15.012
they were highly religious

00:20:15.012 --> 00:20:17.845
and they felt growth of secularism

00:20:19.777 --> 00:20:23.944
and as whites they saw the
country changing its complexion

00:20:25.915 --> 00:20:29.003
and they felt that even the
bayou they looked out on

00:20:29.003 --> 00:20:32.091
they couldn't swim in, they
couldn't eat the fish from.

00:20:32.091 --> 00:20:34.563
It wasn't theirs either.

00:20:34.563 --> 00:20:37.646
So there was a moment of estrangement

00:20:39.145 --> 00:20:42.812
and strangerness and
actually a later study,

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:51.117
a survey found that those
who answered yes in a poll

00:20:52.147 --> 00:20:56.422
that they felt like strangers
in their own country,

00:20:56.422 --> 00:21:00.646
this was Atlantic, a study,
were three and a half times

00:21:00.646 --> 00:21:03.646
more likely to vote for Donald Trump

00:21:05.685 --> 00:21:08.768
and I felt that the end of my odyssey

00:21:13.616 --> 00:21:17.116
Donald Trump was coming for the first time

00:21:19.222 --> 00:21:21.972
to a primary rally in New Orleans

00:21:23.004 --> 00:21:25.504
and he hadn't won the primary.

00:21:27.071 --> 00:21:28.822
He was just coming.

00:21:28.822 --> 00:21:31.989
But in Louisiana this was the next day

00:21:33.537 --> 00:21:37.120
and seeing the crowd,
seeing the excitement

00:21:38.825 --> 00:21:41.742
and here he comes down from the sky

00:21:42.731 --> 00:21:46.231
in the Donald Trump plane, you know almost

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.360
like descended from heaven right?

00:21:53.423 --> 00:21:56.256
And he was the emotions candidate.

00:21:57.782 --> 00:21:58.925
Look how emotional we are.

00:21:58.925 --> 00:22:00.957
We're not the silent majority.

00:22:00.957 --> 00:22:03.040
We're the noisy majority.

00:22:05.071 --> 00:22:07.594
And he promised in essence

00:22:07.594 --> 00:22:09.677
he hit the theme of loss.

00:22:10.849 --> 00:22:12.315
They did feel they had lost something.

00:22:12.315 --> 00:22:15.815
He hit that and he hit the theme of blame,

00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:18.626
who to blame for the loss.

00:22:18.626 --> 00:22:20.051
That would be the line cutters.

00:22:20.051 --> 00:22:23.551
And he hit the theme of uplift and rescue.

00:22:28.797 --> 00:22:29.797
Great again.

00:22:31.237 --> 00:22:35.994
Was almost I came to feel
like a secular rapture.

00:22:35.994 --> 00:22:39.291
Well I'm gonna take you
up to heaven with me.

00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:43.208
And in fact if you look
at some of the pictures

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.153
of the top floor of Trump Tower

00:22:50.431 --> 00:22:54.598
it looked very much like
people's description of heaven.

00:22:55.954 --> 00:22:57.905
Everything was gold.

00:22:57.905 --> 00:23:00.905
(audience laughing)

00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:07.550
So I concluded, came
home scratching my head

00:23:10.839 --> 00:23:15.561
and saying look I started
with this red state paradox

00:23:15.561 --> 00:23:19.728
but really I'm going home
with a blue state paradox.

00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:22.669
How could it be that the democratic party,

00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:25.832
the party of the working
man and the working women,

00:23:25.832 --> 00:23:27.579
did not speak to them.

00:23:27.579 --> 00:23:30.662
I didn't see any glimmer in their eye

00:23:32.988 --> 00:23:35.920
with regard to Hillary's candidacy.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.420
How could this be?

00:23:38.889 --> 00:23:42.306
Some of them, by the way, had nice things

00:23:43.892 --> 00:23:45.720
to say about Bernie Sanders.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.637
Extremely right wing tea
party people would say

00:23:52.015 --> 00:23:53.348
oh Uncle Bernie.

00:23:55.468 --> 00:23:57.259
Uncle Bernie.

00:23:57.259 --> 00:23:59.498
Well he's a socialist.

00:23:59.498 --> 00:24:04.011
We're a capitalist country and
he's promising pie in the sky

00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:05.765
but friendly feeling.

00:24:05.765 --> 00:24:06.932
He means well.

00:24:09.742 --> 00:24:13.521
So I came home with
the blue state paradox.

00:24:13.521 --> 00:24:17.422
Now what I'd like to share with you today

00:24:17.422 --> 00:24:22.058
is what some of the responses
to the book have been.

00:24:22.058 --> 00:24:26.141
I've been on another
odyssey with regard to that.

00:24:29.624 --> 00:24:33.527
I went home and when the
book came out the next week

00:24:33.527 --> 00:24:36.994
I sent out copies of it to the people

00:24:36.994 --> 00:24:39.072
that I'd written about who had helped me

00:24:39.072 --> 00:24:41.358
and I went back to Louisiana
put a dinner on for them,

00:24:41.358 --> 00:24:45.867
another one for the people
I dedicated the book to

00:24:45.867 --> 00:24:48.345
and one of the characters,
Janice Serrino if you've read,

00:24:48.345 --> 00:24:51.928
she was the company
loyalist and very tough

00:24:54.041 --> 00:24:57.374
and she came to the dinner with a jacket

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.771
and she came up to me
and said you wanna see

00:24:59.771 --> 00:25:02.354
what I have on under my jacket?

00:25:03.272 --> 00:25:04.105
Yeah.

00:25:05.712 --> 00:25:09.879
So she pulled it open and it
said adorable deplorables.

00:25:11.038 --> 00:25:13.705
I'm gonna send you one of these.

00:25:14.577 --> 00:25:16.206
(audience laughing)

00:25:16.206 --> 00:25:18.322
But you have to wear it.

00:25:18.322 --> 00:25:19.322
No promises.

00:25:29.425 --> 00:25:33.092
So they liked the
description of themselves.

00:25:34.836 --> 00:25:37.253
In fact this Janice would say

00:25:38.163 --> 00:25:42.188
Arlie you have a swear word in my chapter.

00:25:42.188 --> 00:25:43.819
Your chapter?

00:25:43.819 --> 00:25:47.554
She felt proprietary about her chapter.

00:25:47.554 --> 00:25:51.721
Well I did have a swear word
there but it was quoting

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.693
Sher Bono who has a transgender child

00:25:57.709 --> 00:26:01.542
and who was complaining
about the F tea party.

00:26:02.465 --> 00:26:05.965
So I had that in there in order to account

00:26:06.985 --> 00:26:11.152
for Janice Serino, my
respondent's hatred of Hollywood

00:26:13.943 --> 00:26:16.621
but that was, nevermind, she didn't want

00:26:16.621 --> 00:26:19.121
the swear word in her chapter.

00:26:20.051 --> 00:26:23.956
Did they read appendix C
which had all the facts

00:26:23.956 --> 00:26:25.745
that were taken out of the deep story?

00:26:25.745 --> 00:26:26.578
No.

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.413
I began receiving letters on my email

00:26:33.793 --> 00:26:36.320
from people across the country

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.487
and they give you, let me
share one with you here.

00:26:42.303 --> 00:26:45.468
This is from a young man, 23.

00:26:45.468 --> 00:26:49.635
He began I live 15 miles outside
a small one stoplight town

00:26:52.222 --> 00:26:54.472
of 2,500 in rural Virginia.

00:26:56.655 --> 00:27:00.400
I've lived here in Gretna
for all 23 years of my life

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.315
save for the four years I spent

00:27:02.315 --> 00:27:05.079
at the University of Virginia.

00:27:05.079 --> 00:27:08.850
Half a mile deep in the
woods behind my house

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:13.688
is an abandoned grave of a 19
year old Confederate private.

00:27:13.688 --> 00:27:16.332
I found it one day when I was hunting.

00:27:16.332 --> 00:27:20.324
I was 19 myself at the
time and standing there

00:27:20.324 --> 00:27:25.289
with a rifle in my hand I
had to reckon with that.

00:27:25.289 --> 00:27:27.686
What was really the
difference between me and him

00:27:27.686 --> 00:27:29.712
in that very moment except for the time

00:27:29.712 --> 00:27:31.712
in which fate placed us?

00:27:33.248 --> 00:27:36.785
Fields that were once full
of tobacco now go unplanted.

00:27:36.785 --> 00:27:39.785
Old plantation homes lie in despair.

00:27:40.928 --> 00:27:43.163
The furniture plant where
my grandfather worked

00:27:43.163 --> 00:27:44.496
has closed down.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.719
The textile mill where
by grandmother worked

00:27:47.719 --> 00:27:49.719
has been bulldozed down.

00:27:50.566 --> 00:27:52.983
The jobs outsourced overseas.

00:27:53.938 --> 00:27:57.318
At the end he thanks me for listening

00:27:57.318 --> 00:27:59.307
and then wonders if he should come

00:27:59.307 --> 00:28:02.327
to the sociology department at Berkeley.

00:28:02.327 --> 00:28:05.327
(audience laughing)

00:28:07.247 --> 00:28:11.414
An older woman writes I'm
writing from our farm house

00:28:12.531 --> 00:28:14.198
in Fairview, Kansas.

00:28:15.416 --> 00:28:17.726
I was sewing this afternoon and listening

00:28:17.726 --> 00:28:21.809
to a Canadian podcast from
2016 and a grace video

00:28:23.006 --> 00:28:26.131
in which you discuss the state
of people across America.

00:28:26.131 --> 00:28:29.222
You know the number of dairies around here

00:28:29.222 --> 00:28:31.781
has dropped dramatically over the years.

00:28:31.781 --> 00:28:34.588
The larger dairies employ a
couple of high school boys

00:28:34.588 --> 00:28:37.719
to work morning and evenings.

00:28:37.719 --> 00:28:40.157
The boys go to work at three a.m.

00:28:40.157 --> 00:28:42.675
And after work they stop
at Casey's for biscuits

00:28:42.675 --> 00:28:46.508
and gravy and bring with
them to school to eat

00:28:48.494 --> 00:28:51.718
before the tardy bell rings at eight.

00:28:51.718 --> 00:28:52.718
She goes on.

00:28:54.161 --> 00:28:56.161
Thanks me for listening.

00:28:57.246 --> 00:29:01.413
And wants to set up a high
school exchange program.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:07.548
A middle-aged woman writes I'm
from northeastern Kentucky.

00:29:07.548 --> 00:29:11.131
Appalachia is the sister
area to Louisiana.

00:29:11.972 --> 00:29:15.793
I came to Christ in the
Methodist church as a child

00:29:15.793 --> 00:29:20.141
and during the charismatic
renewal in the 1960s

00:29:20.141 --> 00:29:24.125
my mother started going
to a Pentecostal church.

00:29:24.125 --> 00:29:27.703
My walk with God is personal every day

00:29:27.703 --> 00:29:31.244
and outside of the physical church.

00:29:31.244 --> 00:29:34.292
My problem as a Christian is this.

00:29:34.292 --> 00:29:38.639
I find myself on the outside
of the Christian church

00:29:38.639 --> 00:29:42.383
because of the politics that consumes it.

00:29:42.383 --> 00:29:44.133
Thanks for listening.

00:29:46.779 --> 00:29:47.612
One more.

00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:52.680
As a female Indian Muslim,
another young woman writes,

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.446
living in a conservative part of America,

00:29:55.446 --> 00:29:59.060
I often felt disliked
and discriminated against

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:03.007
which led to my hatred of
many of those in my community.

00:30:03.007 --> 00:30:05.320
Reading your book has
changed my perspective

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.188
and made it easier to share my beliefs

00:30:08.188 --> 00:30:11.899
to help create understanding
and feel more understanding

00:30:11.899 --> 00:30:14.649
towards those I once disregarded.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.823
One more.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.960
I hail from Lake Charles, Louisiana.

00:30:24.729 --> 00:30:28.025
My brother works at the
company formerly known

00:30:28.025 --> 00:30:30.192
as Pittsburgh Plate Glass,

00:30:31.959 --> 00:30:34.459
central to many of my stories,

00:30:35.581 --> 00:30:39.119
and lives under the
chlorine cloud in the shadow

00:30:39.119 --> 00:30:43.029
cast by the cranes building
Sessel in West Lake.

00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:48.027
I was surrounded by the
milieu you capture so well.

00:30:48.027 --> 00:30:49.651
It's been hard to read your book,

00:30:49.651 --> 00:30:53.818
very hard to read your book,
but I thank you for it.

00:30:57.829 --> 00:31:01.412
Now I've been very
moved by these responses

00:31:05.844 --> 00:31:08.817
and it's raised for me a question

00:31:08.817 --> 00:31:12.734
about reaching out to
heal this partisan divide

00:31:18.364 --> 00:31:20.884
or as I describe in the book

00:31:20.884 --> 00:31:25.051
climb an empathy wall
across this partisan divide.

00:31:33.331 --> 00:31:36.914
Now there are people
who say you know what?

00:31:37.927 --> 00:31:39.844
That's a fool's errand.

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:44.192
There was a review of this book.

00:31:44.192 --> 00:31:47.442
It was respectful but
really took a different line

00:31:47.442 --> 00:31:51.517
by Frank Rich in New York
Magazine this last spring

00:31:51.517 --> 00:31:53.307
in which he said you know what?

00:31:53.307 --> 00:31:55.013
Don't waste your empathy.

00:31:55.013 --> 00:31:58.846
We need anger and it's
a waste of time to talk

00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:04.958
to any of these people and
someone I very much respect

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:10.523
normally and Katha Pollitt
again in The Nation

00:32:12.265 --> 00:32:16.003
takes a very respectful
but she said really

00:32:16.003 --> 00:32:17.219
hold on to your anger.

00:32:17.219 --> 00:32:19.136
Don't waste any breath.

00:32:21.775 --> 00:32:25.758
And that got me to the place where I am

00:32:25.758 --> 00:32:30.272
just speaking personally
to that very question

00:32:30.272 --> 00:32:34.439
of the efficacy of reaching
across this growing divide.

00:32:37.827 --> 00:32:39.827
The way I see it at this

00:32:42.545 --> 00:32:45.876
frightening political
moment is that we have three

00:32:45.876 --> 00:32:48.293
possible pillars of activism.

00:32:52.258 --> 00:32:55.425
First one is to address our attention,

00:32:58.606 --> 00:33:01.571
all our action, toward the defense

00:33:01.571 --> 00:33:04.904
of the principle of checks and balances.

00:33:06.933 --> 00:33:11.100
Independent press, a revered
and independent judiciary,

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:17.197
so that no president would
put himself above the law.

00:33:18.064 --> 00:33:20.102
This I think is number
one and you don't need

00:33:20.102 --> 00:33:22.380
to talk to anyone who disagrees with you

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.376
to pursue pillar one.

00:33:24.376 --> 00:33:27.673
Pillar two for me would be to turn

00:33:27.673 --> 00:33:31.590
to the democratic platform
which does not speak

00:33:35.221 --> 00:33:39.264
to the people I came to
know and those like them

00:33:39.264 --> 00:33:42.607
and to engage in electoral politics.

00:33:42.607 --> 00:33:45.453
And again, you wouldn't
need to talk to anyone

00:33:45.453 --> 00:33:48.703
you disagree with to engage pillar two.

00:33:52.284 --> 00:33:56.636
And then there's pillar
three and you can say

00:33:56.636 --> 00:34:00.459
well look, I don't wanna
talk to the hard core

00:34:00.459 --> 00:34:03.387
neo-Nazis we saw in Charles' film

00:34:03.387 --> 00:34:05.470
and I'm with you in that.

00:34:06.926 --> 00:34:10.379
But if we think about
what by some estimates

00:34:10.379 --> 00:34:13.510
are eight and a half
million people who voted

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:17.453
for Barack Obama in 2012 and
then switched to Donald Trump

00:34:17.453 --> 00:34:20.870
in 2016 we do wanna talk to some of them.

00:34:25.807 --> 00:34:28.420
Or if you look at the, by some estimates,

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:32.488
one out of three, other
estimates one out of four

00:34:32.488 --> 00:34:35.738
high school educated blue collar whites

00:34:38.173 --> 00:34:41.020
who would have voted for
Bernie Sanders if he had

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.437
been the Democratic candidate but instead

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.457
voted for someone else,
majority for Trump,

00:34:48.457 --> 00:34:50.624
would they be of interest?

00:34:51.628 --> 00:34:54.466
And once you selected
who it is you thought

00:34:54.466 --> 00:34:58.633
it would be interesting to
climb the empathy wall with

00:35:01.906 --> 00:35:03.573
how would you do it?

00:35:05.084 --> 00:35:07.084
And why would you do it?

00:35:09.676 --> 00:35:12.843
My thought is that these three pillars

00:35:13.699 --> 00:35:15.685
need to be coordinated with each other

00:35:15.685 --> 00:35:18.247
if you really want to revamp a platform

00:35:18.247 --> 00:35:21.454
you better know what the
response to it would be

00:35:21.454 --> 00:35:25.621
and if you want to defend
really the whole principle

00:35:28.239 --> 00:35:32.793
of checks and balances that
underlies our democracy

00:35:32.793 --> 00:35:34.496
you better know how people see it

00:35:34.496 --> 00:35:37.829
and how they feel about it so that these

00:35:39.703 --> 00:35:41.862
should be coordinated
and like in the British

00:35:41.862 --> 00:35:45.529
sort of loyal opposition
kind of coordinated

00:35:47.152 --> 00:35:49.100
and acting in unison.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.108
So you don't have to talk
to people you disagree with.

00:35:52.108 --> 00:35:55.155
You don't need to climb that empathy wall.

00:35:55.155 --> 00:35:57.964
But what you do need to do I believe

00:35:57.964 --> 00:36:00.464
is see the reason for doing it

00:36:03.085 --> 00:36:06.002
and the reason for doing it I think

00:36:10.281 --> 00:36:11.281
is two fold.

00:36:15.525 --> 00:36:16.608
One is moral.

00:36:18.937 --> 00:36:21.623
I felt again in the mail I'm getting

00:36:21.623 --> 00:36:25.623
a lot of moral sort of
wish to heal this divide.

00:36:26.617 --> 00:36:29.826
Another quote a woman
wrote that she was part

00:36:29.826 --> 00:36:33.048
of an Episcopal church in Massachusetts

00:36:33.048 --> 00:36:36.259
and she wanted to get in
touch with the congregation

00:36:36.259 --> 00:36:39.591
in Lake Charles and did
I know of a parishioner

00:36:39.591 --> 00:36:41.421
that she could contact?

00:36:41.421 --> 00:36:43.671
Well as luck had it, I did.

00:36:44.588 --> 00:36:48.755
Called my Louisiana friend
up and they are now in touch.

00:36:49.634 --> 00:36:52.884
And so if you got together with someone

00:36:56.424 --> 00:37:00.664
how would you do it and in
what way would you do it?

00:37:00.664 --> 00:37:03.343
Would you just get there and
say here's what I believe.

00:37:03.343 --> 00:37:05.859
I think is true and
you've got a deep story

00:37:05.859 --> 00:37:07.646
and it's not true.

00:37:07.646 --> 00:37:10.737
(audience laughing)

00:37:10.737 --> 00:37:14.117
Or would you say different as we are,

00:37:14.117 --> 00:37:18.284
maybe there are strips of common
ground on particular issues

00:37:22.641 --> 00:37:26.341
and those issues could be
getting money out of politics.

00:37:26.341 --> 00:37:29.841
They could be reducing prison populations.

00:37:32.478 --> 00:37:36.787
They could be alternative
energy to something

00:37:36.787 --> 00:37:38.374
called the green tea party.

00:37:38.374 --> 00:37:39.874
Did you know that?

00:37:41.015 --> 00:37:43.496
They're tea party people
for alternative energy.

00:37:43.496 --> 00:37:44.579
Check it out.

00:37:45.728 --> 00:37:48.228
Deborah Dooley now in Florida.

00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:51.694
So strips of common ground.

00:37:51.694 --> 00:37:56.451
so I'm not envisioning one
kind of right wing moderate

00:37:56.451 --> 00:37:57.914
getting together with one kind

00:37:57.914 --> 00:38:01.053
of left wing moderate morphing.

00:38:01.053 --> 00:38:03.470
That's one model for talking.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:09.727
But there's also possibility
when you completely disagree

00:38:09.727 --> 00:38:13.792
on basic principles but yet
the discourse of respect

00:38:13.792 --> 00:38:15.375
and empathic basis.

00:38:17.118 --> 00:38:18.742
I went back to one man,

00:38:18.742 --> 00:38:21.865
this one who was very
enthusiastic tea party.

00:38:21.865 --> 00:38:26.032
He was born on a sugar
plantation in the old south.

00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:30.397
He worked in oil all his adult life

00:38:30.397 --> 00:38:32.349
and he was big tea party and Trump.

00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:35.599
Name was Mike and last time I went back

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.713
I was with my son who was
a big environmentalist.

00:38:40.713 --> 00:38:44.703
I was trying to see if they
could come to common ground

00:38:44.703 --> 00:38:48.849
on ending pollution and my son asked him

00:38:48.849 --> 00:38:53.525
well Mike, do you have any
hesitations about Donald Trump?

00:38:53.525 --> 00:38:55.354
And if you looked at Mike's Facebook

00:38:55.354 --> 00:38:58.021
it was just all flags and Trump.

00:39:00.024 --> 00:39:03.517
But he answered in a spirit of openness

00:39:03.517 --> 00:39:04.934
where do I begin?

00:39:09.249 --> 00:39:12.916
So a lot is in the very
spirit you establish

00:39:14.946 --> 00:39:19.046
of mutual respect across deep differences.

00:39:19.046 --> 00:39:23.213
The other is what I think
of as simple stretching.

00:39:24.209 --> 00:39:27.626
I just did an op-ed for The
Washington Post on this.

00:39:27.626 --> 00:39:29.709
What is a symbol stretch?

00:39:31.568 --> 00:39:34.985
It's when you notice what the symbols are

00:39:38.584 --> 00:39:41.167
of the person you're talking to

00:39:45.498 --> 00:39:48.951
and you nod to that
symbol but you stretch it

00:39:48.951 --> 00:39:52.284
to something they're not thinking about.

00:39:54.047 --> 00:39:55.672
I followed around an extraordinary man

00:39:55.672 --> 00:39:59.839
named General Russel Honore
who is a three star general

00:40:01.287 --> 00:40:04.120
and was the rescuer of the victims

00:40:05.556 --> 00:40:07.723
of Katrina in New Orleans.

00:40:09.665 --> 00:40:12.467
He's now an ardent environmentalist

00:40:12.467 --> 00:40:15.514
and he goes around talking to people

00:40:15.514 --> 00:40:19.181
who don't agree with
him on the environment.

00:40:23.648 --> 00:40:26.699
I was there watching
him when he was talking

00:40:26.699 --> 00:40:30.866
to some very conservative
businessmen in Lake Charles.

00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:36.764
And their talk was all about freedom.

00:40:36.764 --> 00:40:39.153
The freedom to start your own business.

00:40:39.153 --> 00:40:42.165
The freedom to get as rich as you want.

00:40:42.165 --> 00:40:46.186
The freedom from big heavy
government regulations.

00:40:46.186 --> 00:40:47.019
Freedom.

00:40:48.669 --> 00:40:51.836
And so this general got up and he said

00:40:53.147 --> 00:40:57.327
I woke up this morning and
I looked out at Lake Charles

00:40:57.327 --> 00:41:01.494
and I saw a man in a boat and
he had his fishing line out

00:41:02.574 --> 00:41:05.661
and he had his bucket ready.

00:41:05.661 --> 00:41:09.828
But that man is not free to
lift out an uncontaminated fish.

00:41:15.098 --> 00:41:16.848
I thought you genius.

00:41:19.286 --> 00:41:22.868
You just stretched the symbol of freedom

00:41:22.868 --> 00:41:26.321
over to something they
hadn't thought about.

00:41:26.321 --> 00:41:28.683
And I followed him
around wherever he went.

00:41:28.683 --> 00:41:31.207
See how he stretched symbols.

00:41:31.207 --> 00:41:34.418
So their way is kind of
the skills of the mediator

00:41:34.418 --> 00:41:35.751
that we can use.

00:41:39.698 --> 00:41:44.459
There is actually for all
of the focus on a growing

00:41:44.459 --> 00:41:47.876
partisan divide and increasing bitterness

00:41:49.823 --> 00:41:53.323
and brittleness consolidation of each pole

00:41:55.793 --> 00:41:59.960
under an extremely divisive
leadership shall we say

00:42:00.999 --> 00:42:03.832
a grass roots movement of bridging

00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:08.121
and if you were to
Google tonight something

00:42:08.121 --> 00:42:12.288
called the Bridge Alliance
you would find some 70 or 80

00:42:13.326 --> 00:42:15.728
different small organizations
with funny names

00:42:15.728 --> 00:42:17.978
like hi from the other side

00:42:20.651 --> 00:42:24.484
or living room conversations
which was started

00:42:25.362 --> 00:42:28.491
by Joan Blades, the
co-founder of MoveOn.org

00:42:28.491 --> 00:42:29.908
here in Berkeley.

00:42:31.252 --> 00:42:34.085
She's a labor mediator by training

00:42:35.517 --> 00:42:38.931
that bring left and right to see

00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:43.098
if they can find common
ground on particular issues.

00:42:47.467 --> 00:42:51.634
There is a Bridge Berkeley
and one of the young men in it

00:42:55.554 --> 00:42:58.471
by the name of John Rider, John, no

00:43:02.506 --> 00:43:04.050
has tried to get left and right together

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:08.217
on climate change and actually
he and I were emailing

00:43:12.147 --> 00:43:13.776
and I was in Baton Rouge.

00:43:13.776 --> 00:43:15.725
He said oh, what are you
doing in Baton Rouge?

00:43:15.725 --> 00:43:17.635
I said well I'm giving a talk.

00:43:17.635 --> 00:43:19.549
He says I'm in Dallas.

00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:21.501
Well what are you doing in Dallas?

00:43:21.501 --> 00:43:24.510
He was getting left and right together

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:28.427
to see if there could be
common ground on that.

00:43:29.551 --> 00:43:31.911
So it made me proud that he was Berkeley

00:43:31.911 --> 00:43:34.518
and that he was part of
Berkeley Bridge Movement

00:43:34.518 --> 00:43:38.435
and that he was trying
for putting pillar three

00:43:39.293 --> 00:43:41.376
in its larger perspective

00:43:43.211 --> 00:43:45.711
but trying to be active in it.

00:43:51.066 --> 00:43:54.066
I think at its best you see Berkeley

00:43:55.831 --> 00:43:57.998
hatches students like John

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:04.250
and a place like International
House which is out looking,

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:07.175
out reaching to people in other countries

00:44:07.175 --> 00:44:11.175
that that very spirit
Berkeley could be a leader

00:44:12.136 --> 00:44:15.303
in extending to the strangers among us

00:44:16.412 --> 00:44:18.404
within this home country.

00:44:18.404 --> 00:44:19.787
Thank you.

00:44:19.787 --> 00:44:22.954
(audience applauding)

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:40.697
- Okay so we have about 10
minutes to have questions

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.304
and I would just urge
you to try to formulate

00:44:47.304 --> 00:44:48.565
your question concisely and to make sure

00:44:48.565 --> 00:44:51.183
that it's an actual question.

00:44:51.183 --> 00:44:54.183
(audience laughing)

00:44:58.625 --> 00:45:02.165
The mic is down front in the center.

00:45:02.165 --> 00:45:03.381
- That was a great talk, thanks.

00:45:03.381 --> 00:45:06.714
A lot of thought-provoking things there.

00:45:08.139 --> 00:45:09.643
I've been an activist for some 30 years.

00:45:09.643 --> 00:45:13.143
I lived in this house at one point.

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:14.490
I guess you were addressing
mostly federal issues.

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:17.376
We could talk about many things.

00:45:17.376 --> 00:45:18.840
We live in the sixth largest economy

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.308
here in this day.

00:45:20.308 --> 00:45:21.449
- We live in a what?

00:45:21.449 --> 00:45:22.282
Sorry.

00:45:22.282 --> 00:45:23.648
- The sixth largest economy in the state

00:45:23.648 --> 00:45:27.397
so when the California
legislature makes decisions

00:45:27.397 --> 00:45:28.941
it can really affect the country
and the world in many ways.

00:45:28.941 --> 00:45:32.720
So my recommendation to people is to learn

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.673
their assembly person
and their state senator

00:45:34.673 --> 00:45:37.929
and make calls and what
do you say to that?

00:45:37.929 --> 00:45:42.033
Is there a lot of room
to affect change through

00:45:42.033 --> 00:45:43.536
at the state level we were established

00:45:43.536 --> 00:45:44.470
as a federal system.

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:46.786
People have forgotten
that and we often are only

00:45:46.786 --> 00:45:49.552
looking at the national government.

00:45:49.552 --> 00:45:52.850
But isn't there a lot to
be done at state levels?

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:57.017
- There is a lot to be proud
of in this California state

00:45:58.457 --> 00:46:02.540
and a lot we can do as
Californians to reach out.

00:46:04.353 --> 00:46:07.889
I just learned of an
app that will tell you

00:46:07.889 --> 00:46:09.844
any particular day in what state

00:46:09.844 --> 00:46:14.011
what bill is coming up and
what friend in your Facebook

00:46:15.918 --> 00:46:18.835
pack of friends lives in that state

00:46:21.185 --> 00:46:25.352
and it was probably Silicon
Valley that invented it.

00:46:28.536 --> 00:46:31.143
- I've tried a strategy
that hasn't been successful

00:46:31.143 --> 00:46:33.776
so I'd like your comment.

00:46:33.776 --> 00:46:36.333
So my feeling is that of all the issues

00:46:36.333 --> 00:46:37.750
that the left has

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:40.481
which is dozens of issues

00:46:40.481 --> 00:46:43.494
they should focus on income inequality

00:46:43.494 --> 00:46:46.016
and not care about gun control,

00:46:46.016 --> 00:46:49.481
even immigration, even abortion.

00:46:49.481 --> 00:46:54.162
I advise everybody to just
pay Planned Parenthood a lot.

00:46:54.162 --> 00:46:56.927
But people are so wedded to their issues

00:46:56.927 --> 00:46:58.304
that they're not giving up.

00:46:58.304 --> 00:46:59.387
What do I do?

00:47:02.334 --> 00:47:06.483
- So your proposal is that
all of us pick one main issue.

00:47:06.483 --> 00:47:09.066
That is a hugely primary issue.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:16.153
It's the issue of a
sinking bottom, of poverty

00:47:17.159 --> 00:47:19.314
and loss of democracy.

00:47:19.314 --> 00:47:21.897
This is a Bernie Sanders issue.

00:47:27.454 --> 00:47:29.704
My thought would be to hold

00:47:31.197 --> 00:47:35.364
there are many issues and
I think race is a big issue

00:47:37.581 --> 00:47:40.922
and it underlies the inequality.

00:47:40.922 --> 00:47:43.089
It's connected with class.

00:47:52.717 --> 00:47:56.014
So I would put those two things,

00:47:56.014 --> 00:48:00.181
inequality, class, and race
primary, I guess, yeah.

00:48:04.879 --> 00:48:07.523
- Hi, thank you for your talk.

00:48:07.523 --> 00:48:09.232
I'm wondering, in terms of--

00:48:09.232 --> 00:48:10.371
- A little louder.

00:48:10.371 --> 00:48:11.224
- Louder.

00:48:11.224 --> 00:48:13.724
Closer to the mic, how's that?

00:48:14.927 --> 00:48:17.818
Finding the strips of common
ground that you mentioned.

00:48:17.818 --> 00:48:22.740
What about the more general
shared common humanity

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:26.356
of wanting to be happy,
not wanting to suffer?

00:48:26.356 --> 00:48:30.015
Caring about our families
that aren't political.

00:48:30.015 --> 00:48:31.806
That aren't charged.

00:48:31.806 --> 00:48:33.437
- Yes wonderful.

00:48:33.437 --> 00:48:37.512
When people come together
that's how they come together

00:48:37.512 --> 00:48:39.095
and create a family

00:48:40.646 --> 00:48:41.479
a fellow

00:48:44.384 --> 00:48:47.512
a feeling and I think that the gatherings

00:48:47.512 --> 00:48:50.926
that the Bridge Alliance is
doing kind of start with that.

00:48:50.926 --> 00:48:54.661
But then you can actually
get to these common grounds.

00:48:54.661 --> 00:48:57.180
I thought to tell you something recently

00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.726
that just happened.

00:48:58.726 --> 00:49:02.426
I got a call from someone named Ro Khanna.

00:49:02.426 --> 00:49:03.967
Anybody know?

00:49:03.967 --> 00:49:08.134
He's a Democratic
representative in Silicon Valley

00:49:10.423 --> 00:49:14.256
and in his constituency
is Facebook and Google

00:49:16.633 --> 00:49:18.050
and Intel, Yahoo.

00:49:19.403 --> 00:49:22.820
He told me half my constituency are Asian

00:49:23.681 --> 00:49:25.630
and I'm Asian myself.

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:26.463
Democrat.

00:49:29.984 --> 00:49:34.151
But I've made an alliance
with a Republican in Kentucky

00:49:35.105 --> 00:49:38.855
whose constituency are
unemployed coal miners

00:49:44.002 --> 00:49:48.358
and what Ro Khanna has
done is take a group

00:49:48.358 --> 00:49:52.025
of coding trainers to
Paintsville, Kentucky,

00:49:53.481 --> 00:49:57.791
set up a training program
promising that if you get

00:49:57.791 --> 00:50:00.758
through the program you are promised

00:50:00.758 --> 00:50:02.925
a 40,000 dollar a year job

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:09.623
and the first 30 graduates
of this training program

00:50:09.623 --> 00:50:14.099
have graduated and you know
what they call themselves?

00:50:14.099 --> 00:50:17.099
They call themselves Silicon Hollow.

00:50:17.962 --> 00:50:22.129
So there are a lot of ways you
get family feeling together

00:50:23.164 --> 00:50:25.560
these strips on particular issues

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:28.450
and then some actual imaginative ways

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:30.367
of handling real needs.

00:50:35.039 --> 00:50:37.928
- There's the problem
of alternative facts.

00:50:37.928 --> 00:50:38.761
- Alternative?

00:50:38.761 --> 00:50:39.594
- Facts.

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:44.149
In California we have a
petrochemical industry

00:50:44.149 --> 00:50:47.565
but we don't have to choke on the air

00:50:47.565 --> 00:50:48.867
and the people who work in
that industry don't have

00:50:48.867 --> 00:50:51.780
to live on eight dollar an hour wages

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.854
and the industry doesn't have to be

00:50:53.854 --> 00:50:57.604
a historic polluter or
essentially a scofflaw

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.758
in every way, shape, and form

00:51:00.758 --> 00:51:02.829
and we invite more regulation to make it

00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:05.272
even more so and we
probably have more jobs

00:51:05.272 --> 00:51:09.297
than they do in the
petrochemical belt in Louisiana.

00:51:09.297 --> 00:51:10.962
They look at it and they
say keep the government out

00:51:10.962 --> 00:51:14.217
otherwise it'll choke off our jobs.

00:51:14.217 --> 00:51:16.362
We look at it and say make
sure we have the regulations

00:51:16.362 --> 00:51:19.484
in order to ensure that
our jobs are consistent

00:51:19.484 --> 00:51:21.432
with our life.

00:51:21.432 --> 00:51:24.645
So we have a single item
of alternative fact.

00:51:24.645 --> 00:51:27.166
I'm sure we could run
through almost every category

00:51:27.166 --> 00:51:30.657
of governance, almost every
sociological category of data

00:51:30.657 --> 00:51:33.490
and find that somewhere or another

00:51:34.678 --> 00:51:38.381
on the ellipses or the
parentheses on the coast

00:51:38.381 --> 00:51:42.298
we have circumstances
that are exactly opposite

00:51:44.638 --> 00:51:47.159
to the circumstances in this area.

00:51:47.159 --> 00:51:50.454
How do they live with the
fact that the way they are

00:51:50.454 --> 00:51:53.787
doing it is producing an adverse result?

00:51:54.642 --> 00:51:58.392
Huge unemployment, low
wage, bad education,

00:51:58.392 --> 00:52:01.891
toxic environment, crap lifestyle

00:52:01.891 --> 00:52:05.427
in every way, shape, and form
except that they can hunt

00:52:05.427 --> 00:52:07.741
because they have multiple
guns easily available

00:52:07.741 --> 00:52:10.478
and out here we've got
all of the rest of that

00:52:10.478 --> 00:52:11.618
but on the good side of it.

00:52:11.618 --> 00:52:14.951
How do they rationalize this disconnect?

00:52:17.274 --> 00:52:18.411
And how do we get them to understand

00:52:18.411 --> 00:52:21.429
that it's a factual disconnect?

00:52:21.429 --> 00:52:25.596
- You know during World War
II my father-in-law had a job.

00:52:26.873 --> 00:52:29.401
He was based in London.

00:52:29.401 --> 00:52:32.401
He spoke German and he was a Colonel

00:52:36.144 --> 00:52:39.227
and his job was to take Nazi officers

00:52:40.897 --> 00:52:44.147
who believed in their own truth, right?

00:52:45.294 --> 00:52:48.424
Fake news because Hitler was saying

00:52:48.424 --> 00:52:50.507
oh London is in shambles.

00:52:53.702 --> 00:52:57.785
Big Ben is in smithereens
and we're about to win.

00:53:00.007 --> 00:53:04.279
And so what my father-in-law decided to do

00:53:04.279 --> 00:53:06.634
was to take these military people,

00:53:06.634 --> 00:53:11.268
put 'em in a car and go
to the center of London

00:53:11.268 --> 00:53:15.296
and say well you can tell what time it is.

00:53:15.296 --> 00:53:16.554
Look at Big Ben.

00:53:16.554 --> 00:53:20.546
And what restaurant
would you like to eat in?

00:53:20.546 --> 00:53:24.379
In other words, you
reveal a truth to a person

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:27.944
and then those officers
said you know what?

00:53:27.944 --> 00:53:28.777
We're not gonna win.

00:53:28.777 --> 00:53:32.944
We've been fed a pack of lies
and we're gonna help you.

00:53:34.114 --> 00:53:36.484
So there are lots of ways to skin a cat

00:53:36.484 --> 00:53:41.096
and one is not just how to
distance say you're stupid

00:53:41.096 --> 00:53:42.804
you don't know this.

00:53:42.804 --> 00:53:44.961
Come have a look.

00:53:44.961 --> 00:53:48.340
Come have a look at California.

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:52.090
And when I got this tea
party Trump supporter

00:53:53.677 --> 00:53:55.589
together with my son who is a member

00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:58.762
of the California Energy Commission,

00:53:58.762 --> 00:54:03.158
does this regulating and is
a ardent environmentalist

00:54:03.158 --> 00:54:06.227
to talk about precisely this thing.

00:54:06.227 --> 00:54:10.307
Hey you know we've got oil too
but we're not choking on it

00:54:10.307 --> 00:54:12.640
and we're not dying from it.

00:54:14.494 --> 00:54:18.661
You know what this tea party
Trump person's response was?

00:54:19.536 --> 00:54:21.203
Hey that's not fair.

00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:26.204
California gets to have it all.

00:54:26.204 --> 00:54:28.315
That's not fair.

00:54:28.315 --> 00:54:32.065
Well okay that's one of
these symbol stretch,

00:54:32.908 --> 00:54:35.636
in this case a value stretch.

00:54:35.636 --> 00:54:39.304
It's an opening for how to talk to people.

00:54:39.304 --> 00:54:40.137
Thank you.

00:54:42.191 --> 00:54:43.108
- Hi Arlie.

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:45.367
- Oh hey.

00:54:45.367 --> 00:54:46.867
- Nice to see you.

00:54:48.418 --> 00:54:50.209
So you inspired me to talk

00:54:50.209 --> 00:54:54.209
to my ardent Trump supporter
nephew who I adore.

00:54:57.078 --> 00:54:58.907
I thought that would really help.

00:54:58.907 --> 00:55:01.861
I did end up cussing like a sailor

00:55:01.861 --> 00:55:05.861
and we ended up back to
our love for each other.

00:55:07.105 --> 00:55:10.352
The one place we came
together was where you said

00:55:10.352 --> 00:55:13.970
about taking money out of politics.

00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:18.137
So my question for you has
been I would love to hear

00:55:19.123 --> 00:55:22.173
how you got over your own reactivity

00:55:22.173 --> 00:55:25.340
which I imagine you have in listening.

00:55:27.174 --> 00:55:29.674
So I'd find that very helpful.

00:55:32.621 --> 00:55:36.199
- Well (laughs).

00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:39.944
- [Woman] Reveal your
trade secrets please.

00:55:39.944 --> 00:55:44.413
- You know I've written
about emotional labor

00:55:44.413 --> 00:55:48.072
and this kind of research
I think requires it.

00:55:48.072 --> 00:55:50.572
But actually it's interesting.

00:55:52.381 --> 00:55:55.799
The job of listening was
to take my own political

00:55:55.799 --> 00:55:59.799
and moral alarm system
off while I was listening

00:56:00.645 --> 00:56:04.097
so that the purpose of my
being there was to learn.

00:56:04.097 --> 00:56:05.681
I'll give you an example
of how that worked.

00:56:05.681 --> 00:56:09.014
There was an evangelical minister's wife

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:14.823
who said at a meeting of Republican women

00:56:14.823 --> 00:56:18.490
of southwest Louisiana
I love Rush Limbaugh.

00:56:19.981 --> 00:56:23.064
You know the conservative radio host.

00:56:24.938 --> 00:56:28.476
And I had a gag response to that at first

00:56:28.476 --> 00:56:30.914
and then a thought, ooh
I'd really like to talk

00:56:30.914 --> 00:56:32.414
to you about that.

00:56:34.535 --> 00:56:38.702
And we went out for sweet
teas, what you do there,

00:56:41.776 --> 00:56:44.175
and she said I love Rush Limbaugh

00:56:44.175 --> 00:56:46.425
because he hates feminazis.

00:56:47.352 --> 00:56:51.104
I thought I hope they haven't Googled me.

00:56:51.104 --> 00:56:52.187
Second Shift.

00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.733
And then environmental wackos and so on.

00:56:59.733 --> 00:57:01.441
She went on and then she
was looking at my face

00:57:01.441 --> 00:57:05.378
which I was trying to hold
neutrally and she said

00:57:05.378 --> 00:57:06.961
is it hard for you?

00:57:07.939 --> 00:57:09.651
I know you don't agree with me.

00:57:09.651 --> 00:57:13.715
Cause I told her exactly who
I was and what I believed

00:57:13.715 --> 00:57:18.563
or side I was on and I said
actually no, it's not hard.

00:57:18.563 --> 00:57:20.269
That's not why I'm here.

00:57:20.269 --> 00:57:21.691
I know about me.

00:57:21.691 --> 00:57:23.521
But I don't know about
you and you're doing me

00:57:23.521 --> 00:57:26.604
more of a favor than you know to open

00:57:28.108 --> 00:57:30.754
your experiences to me
and I can't tell you

00:57:30.754 --> 00:57:32.424
how I appreciate it.

00:57:32.424 --> 00:57:34.496
You know what she said then?

00:57:34.496 --> 00:57:36.164
Oh take your alarm system off.

00:57:36.164 --> 00:57:37.911
I do that too.

00:57:37.911 --> 00:57:39.621
I do it with my parishioners.

00:57:39.621 --> 00:57:41.777
I do it with my kids.

00:57:41.777 --> 00:57:44.508
And then we had that in common

00:57:44.508 --> 00:57:48.675
and could kinda move from
there across vast differences.

00:57:49.713 --> 00:57:51.180
She was the one who described heaven

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:53.335
as a cube of gold, you know?

00:57:53.335 --> 00:57:55.335
So differences but yeah.

00:57:57.099 --> 00:58:00.889
- Well what I get out of that
is the focus on understanding

00:58:00.889 --> 00:58:04.309
as opposed to correcting or changing.

00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:05.142
- Yes.

00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:09.383
And you do wonderful work by the way.

00:58:10.529 --> 00:58:12.072
- Thank you.

00:58:12.072 --> 00:58:13.414
That was largely my question.

00:58:13.414 --> 00:58:16.744
But I guess I also wanna
ask what else did you learn

00:58:16.744 --> 00:58:19.221
about yourself in the process and ways

00:58:19.221 --> 00:58:22.060
that you had to show up differently

00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:25.186
or assumptions that you
had to check in the process

00:58:25.186 --> 00:58:27.853
of hearing others' perspectives?

00:58:29.906 --> 00:58:31.573
- Well people ask me

00:58:35.878 --> 00:58:38.795
did it change my political beliefs?

00:58:39.985 --> 00:58:42.068
And no, it didn't at all.

00:58:43.078 --> 00:58:44.787
But did it change me?

00:58:44.787 --> 00:58:45.765
Yes.

00:58:45.765 --> 00:58:49.432
I would say it did
because now I walk around

00:58:51.453 --> 00:58:53.453
with thinking how X or Y

00:58:55.068 --> 00:58:57.028
you know Janice Serino or Mike Chef

00:58:57.028 --> 00:58:59.445
would think about X or Y or Z

00:59:00.368 --> 00:59:03.174
and sometimes it makes me sad to think

00:59:03.174 --> 00:59:07.341
how they would see some things
here at our beloved Berkeley.

00:59:11.267 --> 00:59:14.017
The Antifa violence, for example,

00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:21.857
and their conclusion with that is whoa

00:59:21.857 --> 00:59:24.132
your students they think
they're the students

00:59:24.132 --> 00:59:26.965
or the fascists, you know, anyway.

00:59:28.481 --> 00:59:31.398
So it made me more worried about us

00:59:33.279 --> 00:59:36.196
and I see a kind of a defensiveness

00:59:37.147 --> 00:59:39.564
and a non-openness on my side

00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:48.197
that has me concerned and
has me wanting to work on it

00:59:49.679 --> 00:59:52.480
and I'll tell you one thing.

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:56.647
Just two days ago I was
at the New Yorker festival

00:59:57.928 --> 01:00:02.095
and got to speak with and hear
the Reverend William Barber

01:00:04.585 --> 01:00:08.892
the Second the Moral Mondays
guy from South Carolina.

01:00:08.892 --> 01:00:12.225
Very spellbinding and very incorporative

01:00:17.631 --> 01:00:19.542
and he is really an heir I think

01:00:19.542 --> 01:00:22.709
to Martin Luther King and his openness

01:00:25.849 --> 01:00:30.789
and what he gets up and says
is I'm black, I'm white,

01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:34.453
I'm Indian, I'm some ways conservative,

01:00:34.453 --> 01:00:36.286
some ways progressive.

01:00:36.286 --> 01:00:40.203
I'm all of these things
and I want to organize,

01:00:41.651 --> 01:00:44.151
we are organizing in 30 cities

01:00:45.996 --> 01:00:50.163
a big demonstration for poor
children across the country.

01:00:52.301 --> 01:00:55.108
Hold the moral high ground.

01:00:55.108 --> 01:00:57.223
The end of his speech it
was like a congregation.

01:00:57.223 --> 01:01:00.231
A spellbinder thing and at the end of it

01:01:00.231 --> 01:01:03.735
he had each person in the audience

01:01:03.735 --> 01:01:08.568
turn to your neighbor and
say I will not be depressed.

01:01:08.568 --> 01:01:10.568
I will not be depressed.

01:01:11.542 --> 01:01:14.139
And then turn to them and
say I will get active.

01:01:14.139 --> 01:01:15.639
I will get active.

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:18.448
And so I came home and
I thought you know what

01:01:18.448 --> 01:01:22.069
I'm gonna write Carol Christ and see

01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:24.986
if we can get this guy to Berkeley.

01:01:26.788 --> 01:01:30.371
Incorporative, we need
to be incorporative.

01:01:36.746 --> 01:01:38.829
- Hi, I am a young woman.

01:01:43.581 --> 01:01:46.543
I'm a freshman at UC Berkeley undergrad.

01:01:46.543 --> 01:01:48.904
I have grown up a military kid.

01:01:48.904 --> 01:01:51.585
I've experienced all different places

01:01:51.585 --> 01:01:54.335
and all different kinds of people

01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:57.686
and as a young woman who's going to spend

01:01:57.686 --> 01:02:02.157
the four years of Trump's
presidency at UC Berkeley

01:02:02.157 --> 01:02:04.685
how do you suggest we go about

01:02:04.685 --> 01:02:08.852
receiving our education and
going out into the world

01:02:10.009 --> 01:02:12.611
finding a job in this kind of culture

01:02:12.611 --> 01:02:14.763
that's been created and
this kind of like attitude

01:02:14.763 --> 01:02:16.802
that's been created in this country?

01:02:16.802 --> 01:02:19.398
How do you suggest we go about that?

01:02:19.398 --> 01:02:22.398
- Well classroom education, dive in.

01:02:24.148 --> 01:02:27.731
And as for your experience
here at Berkeley

01:02:30.002 --> 01:02:33.335
take yourself as a builder of a culture,

01:02:34.563 --> 01:02:37.480
of political discussion and debate.

01:02:39.605 --> 01:02:43.772
At the moment I feel that
the Berkeley campus culture

01:02:45.623 --> 01:02:49.119
of political debate reflects
the national culture.

01:02:49.119 --> 01:02:53.510
You have a few polarizing
speakers that come in

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:55.666
in attack-defend mode.

01:02:55.666 --> 01:02:57.785
You're either for them
or you're against them.

01:02:57.785 --> 01:02:59.046
There is no middle ground.

01:02:59.046 --> 01:03:00.511
It's kind of frozen.

01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:02.506
You don't dare say what you really think.

01:03:02.506 --> 01:03:04.302
That's a problem.

01:03:04.302 --> 01:03:07.263
I think we need to really thicken up

01:03:07.263 --> 01:03:09.988
and enrich the culture.

01:03:09.988 --> 01:03:12.063
I think we need to bring theater into it.

01:03:12.063 --> 01:03:13.563
We need satirists.

01:03:15.154 --> 01:03:17.154
We need Reverend Barber.

01:03:20.441 --> 01:03:23.524
People who have all kinds of projects

01:03:25.728 --> 01:03:28.978
and I think there is an important place

01:03:31.177 --> 01:03:32.924
for Berkeley Bridge.

01:03:32.924 --> 01:03:37.091
So I would invite you to plunge
into that set of activities.

01:03:41.813 --> 01:03:43.146
- Hi, thank you.

01:03:46.041 --> 01:03:50.675
It seems pretty clear to me
that the kind of awareness

01:03:50.675 --> 01:03:54.842
that you've demonstrated about
the deep story and climate

01:03:55.788 --> 01:03:59.538
in Lake Charles has
definitely been perceived

01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:04.954
and is in many ways used
by political campaigns

01:04:07.168 --> 01:04:10.251
and news media to exacerbate the sets

01:04:14.488 --> 01:04:19.209
of being hardly done by
and others getting ahead

01:04:19.209 --> 01:04:23.376
so I guess my question is
when you were in Lake Charles

01:04:24.782 --> 01:04:28.841
what is your sense of
people's ability to recognize

01:04:28.841 --> 01:04:33.008
when they're being manipulated
and or any optimistic views

01:04:37.992 --> 01:04:41.167
of how in Lake Charles the partisan divide

01:04:41.167 --> 01:04:44.667
can be minimized or at least not inflamed?

01:04:47.186 --> 01:04:49.138
- Well there are people there,

01:04:49.138 --> 01:04:53.685
first of all, there are pockets
of progressives, of course,

01:04:53.685 --> 01:04:57.504
in this conservative country and landscape

01:04:57.504 --> 01:05:01.577
and they all have friends and relatives

01:05:01.577 --> 01:05:03.768
who don't agree with them.

01:05:03.768 --> 01:05:05.191
So actually they've gotten pretty good

01:05:05.191 --> 01:05:07.941
at how to do this bridging thing.

01:05:08.853 --> 01:05:10.886
Many of them just avoid differences

01:05:10.886 --> 01:05:13.719
and keep their bonds without that.

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:23.950
They were as worried about
this divide as I was.

01:05:25.113 --> 01:05:29.910
That was kind of the first
thing they would say.

01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:31.946
I sort of came in like Mary Poppins.

01:05:31.946 --> 01:05:36.509
Hi, I'm Arlie Hochschild,
sociologist at Berkeley

01:05:36.509 --> 01:05:40.497
and you'll never remember my last name.

01:05:40.497 --> 01:05:43.020
So jokes and then I would say I'm worried

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:45.103
about this growing divide

01:05:46.396 --> 01:05:47.817
and that's the first thing they would say.

01:05:47.817 --> 01:05:48.734
We are too.

01:05:49.734 --> 01:05:52.460
We're feeling cut off and we don't feel

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.167
you understand us.

01:05:54.167 --> 01:05:58.334
We feel you liberal coastal
people are looking down on us.

01:06:01.936 --> 01:06:05.603
So you go write a book
and set 'em straight.

01:06:06.939 --> 01:06:08.606
What they would say.

01:06:09.823 --> 01:06:13.906
But you know what ultimately
I would love to see?

01:06:14.908 --> 01:06:18.991
I think we need new
mechanisms, social mechanisms

01:06:21.386 --> 01:06:24.553
for mixing up the American population.

01:06:25.977 --> 01:06:28.660
We know that the 46%
of Americans who voted

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:32.327
for Donald Trump are
regionally distributed.

01:06:34.836 --> 01:06:37.433
It's the south and it's the Midwest.

01:06:37.433 --> 01:06:39.507
We know it's racially distributed.

01:06:39.507 --> 01:06:42.340
More white, fewer people of color.

01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:46.543
And class distributed.

01:06:46.543 --> 01:06:49.515
Less likely to be highly educated whites

01:06:49.515 --> 01:06:52.525
that are Democrats but much more likely

01:06:52.525 --> 01:06:56.316
if they're high school educated or lower.

01:06:56.316 --> 01:06:59.733
So given that kind of sociological divide

01:07:02.644 --> 01:07:05.727
I think we need to look to mechanisms

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:09.672
that bridge those structural divides.

01:07:09.672 --> 01:07:13.505
We used to have before
1973 a compulsory draft

01:07:14.796 --> 01:07:16.629
which did that for men

01:07:17.686 --> 01:07:21.877
and we used to have in its
heyday through the labor movement

01:07:21.877 --> 01:07:24.969
labor unions used to do that for workers.

01:07:24.969 --> 01:07:27.733
But we don't have either
of those mechanisms today

01:07:27.733 --> 01:07:31.566
so I think it's on us
to invent new mechanisms

01:07:34.194 --> 01:07:38.277
and what I would love to
see is either a one year

01:07:42.439 --> 01:07:46.106
year of voluntary service
that kind of mixed

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:50.680
young people up or to have a program

01:07:51.871 --> 01:07:56.061
through high schools and
to have in your junior year

01:07:56.061 --> 01:07:58.255
coastal kids go inland.

01:07:58.255 --> 01:08:00.572
Have southern kids go north.

01:08:00.572 --> 01:08:02.932
Have norther kids go
south and for three weeks

01:08:02.932 --> 01:08:05.656
be the guest in an exchange program.

01:08:05.656 --> 01:08:09.153
So you don't send your
kid off to Italy or France

01:08:09.153 --> 01:08:13.092
for their experience of the other world,

01:08:13.092 --> 01:08:15.367
your national world.

01:08:15.367 --> 01:08:19.890
What you do is introduce
them to the strangers

01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:22.390
in their own country via this.

01:08:25.136 --> 01:08:27.897
So not only I think we need two things.

01:08:27.897 --> 01:08:31.314
These new mechanisms for mixing people up

01:08:32.496 --> 01:08:36.811
and the result of that will
be to have new questioning

01:08:36.811 --> 01:08:40.016
about what are true facts and fake facts?

01:08:40.016 --> 01:08:41.808
I mean that's gonna
start some conversations

01:08:41.808 --> 01:08:43.891
that aren't going on now.

01:08:45.911 --> 01:08:48.994
So I think we need the new mechanisms

01:08:50.669 --> 01:08:52.621
and then we all need to become mediators,

01:08:52.621 --> 01:08:56.788
develop that skill set and
apply it in the new world

01:08:57.908 --> 01:08:59.657
we wanna live in.

01:08:59.657 --> 01:09:01.403
Thank you very much.

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:04.570
(audience applauding)

01:09:07.583 --> 01:09:11.250
(upbeat instrumental music)
