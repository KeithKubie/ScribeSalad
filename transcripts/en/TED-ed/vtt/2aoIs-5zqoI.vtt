00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.558
Far beneath the palace
of the treacherous King Minos,

00:00:11.558 --> 00:00:15.295
in the damp darkness
of an inescapable labryinth,

00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:19.254
a horrific beast stalks the endless
corridors of its prison,

00:00:19.254 --> 00:00:25.247
enraged with a bloodlust so intense
that its deafening roar shakes the Earth.

00:00:25.247 --> 00:00:28.270
It is easy to see why 
the Minotaur myth has a long history

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.637
of being disregarded as pure fiction.

00:00:31.637 --> 00:00:33.983
However, there's a good chance
that the Minotaur

00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:37.966
and other monsters and gods
were created by our early ancestors

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:41.862
to rationalize the terrifying things
that they saw in the natural world

00:00:41.862 --> 00:00:44.209
but did not understand.

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:47.245
And while we can't explain 
every aspect of their stories,

00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:50.148
there may be some actual science
that reveals itself

00:00:50.148 --> 00:00:52.837
when we dissect them for clues.

00:00:52.837 --> 00:00:58.715
So, as far as we know,
there have never been human-bull hybrids.

00:00:58.715 --> 00:01:01.348
But the earliest material written 
about the Minotaur

00:01:01.348 --> 00:01:03.921
doesn't even mention its physical form.

00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:07.716
So that's probably not the key 
part of the story.

00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:10.216
What the different tellings 
do agree upon, however,

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:12.969
is that the beast lives underground,

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:18.405
and when it bellows, 
it causes tremendous problems.

00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:22.323
The various myths are also specific
in stating that genius inventor Daedalus,

00:01:22.323 --> 00:01:26.017
carved out the labyrinth 
beneath the island of Crete.

00:01:26.017 --> 00:01:28.779
Archeological attempts 
to find the fabled maze

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:30.918
have come up empty handed.

00:01:30.918 --> 00:01:34.181
But Crete itself has yielded 
the most valuable clue of all

00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:36.680
in the form of seismic activity.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.554
Crete sits on a piece of continental crust
called the Aegean Block,

00:01:41.554 --> 00:01:45.060
and has a bit of oceanic crust
known as the Nubian Block

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.311
sliding right beneath it.

00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:50.707
This sort of geologic feature,
called a subduction zone,

00:01:50.707 --> 00:01:55.946
is common all over the world
and results in lots of earthquakes.

00:01:55.946 --> 00:01:59.849
However, in Crete the situation 
is particularly volatile

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:01.667
as the Nubian Block is attached

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:06.611
to the massive buoyant 
continental crust that is Africa.

00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:08.020
When the Nubian Block moves,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.771
it does not go down nearly 
as easily or as steeply

00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:15.790
as oceanic crust does 
in most other subduction zones.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.112
Instead, it violently and abruptly forces
sections of the Mediterranean upwards

00:02:22.112 --> 00:02:24.524
in an event called uplift,

00:02:24.524 --> 00:02:28.573
and Crete is in uplift central.

00:02:28.573 --> 00:02:32.722
In the year 2014, Crete had more
than 1300 earthquakes

00:02:32.722 --> 00:02:35.802
of magnitude 2.0 or higher.

00:02:35.802 --> 00:02:38.723
By comparison, in the same period of time,

00:02:38.723 --> 00:02:45.098
Southern California, a much larger area,
experienced a mere 255 earthquakes.

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:50.055
Of course, we don't have detailed seismic
records from the days of King Minos,

00:02:50.055 --> 00:02:53.588
but we do know from fossil records
and geologic evidence

00:02:53.588 --> 00:02:55.872
that Crete has experienced 
serious uplift events

00:02:55.872 --> 00:03:00.687
that sometimes exceeded 30 feet
in a single moment.

00:03:00.687 --> 00:03:03.562
Contrast this for a moment
with the island of Hawaii,

00:03:03.562 --> 00:03:05.561
where earthquakes and volcanic activity

00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.651
were tightly woven to legends
surrounding Pele,

00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:12.029
a goddess both fiery and fair.

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:15.018
Like the Minotaur, her myths
included tales of destruction,

00:03:15.018 --> 00:03:19.021
but they also contained elements
of dance and creation.

00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:24.549
So why did Hawaii end up with Pele
and Crete end up with the Minotaur?

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.610
The difference likely comes down

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.772
to the lava that followed
many of Hawaii's worst earthquakes.

00:03:30.772 --> 00:03:36.523
The lava on Hawaii is made of basalt,
which once cooled, is highly fertile.

00:03:36.523 --> 00:03:39.094
Within a couple of decades 
of terrible eruptions,

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:42.081
Islanders would have seen 
vibrant green life thriving

00:03:42.081 --> 00:03:44.711
on new peninsulas made of lava.

00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:47.128
So it makes sense that 
the mythology captured this

00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:51.558
by portraying Pele as creator
as well as a destroyer.

00:03:51.558 --> 00:03:53.200
As for the people of Crete,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.536
their earthquakes brought only
destruction and barren lands,

00:03:56.536 --> 00:04:02.330
so perhaps for them the unnatural
and deadly Minotaur was born.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.860
The connections between mythical stories

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.959
and the geology of the regions
where they originated

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.129
teach us that mythology and science
are actually two sides of the same coin.

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.216
Both are rooted in explaining
and understanding the world.

00:04:16.216 --> 00:04:20.866
The key difference is that where mythology
uses gods, monsters and magic,

00:04:20.866 --> 00:04:24.360
science uses measurements, 
records and experiments.
