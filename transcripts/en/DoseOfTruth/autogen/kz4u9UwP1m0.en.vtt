since but it took a few more you took a
number a lot more years but eventually I

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310
number a lot more years but eventually I
 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.959
number a lot more years but eventually I
kind of

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:29.969

radical environmental transformation
 

00:04:58.829 --> 00:05:01.549
radical environmental transformation
will sink it it's the case but the

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:01.559
will sink it it's the case but the

a big price with regards to newcomers
 

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:07.459
a big price with regards to newcomers
and new information with regards to risk

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469
and new information with regards to risk
 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.219
and new information with regards to risk
to exposure to contaminating Welty

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229
to exposure to contaminating Welty
 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.749
to exposure to contaminating Welty
contamination period but also to

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759
contamination period but also to
 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.299
contamination period but also to
contaminating ideas and so then I've

00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:14.309
contaminating ideas and so then I've
 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:15.979
contaminating ideas and so then I've
always thought you know the the

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:15.989
always thought you know the the
 

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:18.139
always thought you know the the

environment itself moves back and forth
 

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:20.299
environment itself moves back and forth
like a snake in some sense and what

00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:20.309
like a snake in some sense and what
 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:21.949
like a snake in some sense and what
we're trying to do is stay on the center

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:21.959
we're trying to do is stay on the center
 

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:24.229
we're trying to do is stay on the center
of its back and the only way we can do

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:24.239
of its back and the only way we can do
 

00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:26.299
of its back and the only way we can do
that is by people by having people pull

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:26.309
that is by people by having people pull
 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:27.949
that is by people by having people pull
to the right and say be careful and

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:27.959
to the right and say be careful and
 

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:29.449
to the right and say be careful and
people pull to the left and say well

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:29.459
people pull to the left and say well
 

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:32.269
people pull to the left and say well
yeah but be open with that dialogue and

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:32.279
yeah but be open with that dialogue and
 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.089
yeah but be open with that dialogue and
the exchange of information that that

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099
the exchange of information that that
 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.339
the exchange of information that that
dialogue allows we can maybe specify the

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349
dialogue allows we can maybe specify the
 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.559
dialogue allows we can maybe specify the
center of that moving target and stay

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569
center of that moving target and stay
 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:42.769
center of that moving target and stay
and stay well and stay on the back let's

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:42.779
and stay well and stay on the back let's
 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:44.389
and stay well and stay on the back let's
yeah okay so that's a really complicated

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:44.399
yeah okay so that's a really complicated
 

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:46.369
yeah okay so that's a really complicated
metaphor with the snake but I think it's

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.379
metaphor with the snake but I think it's
 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.499
metaphor with the snake but I think it's
a perfect way in to what's going on on

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509
a perfect way in to what's going on on
 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:50.689
a perfect way in to what's going on on
campus and to why viewpoint diversity is

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699
campus and to why viewpoint diversity is
 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.149
campus and to why viewpoint diversity is
so important
