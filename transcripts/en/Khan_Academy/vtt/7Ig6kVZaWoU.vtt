00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:02.093
Voiceover:Let's say that
we've got the function

00:00:02.093 --> 00:00:06.710
y is equal to five times
two to the t power.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.284
Someone were to come up to you

00:00:08.284 --> 00:00:10.263
and say, "Hey look, this is
an interesting function."

00:00:10.263 --> 00:00:16.724
"But I'm curious, I
like the number 1,111."

00:00:16.724 --> 00:00:20.116
"I'm curious at what
point for what t value"

00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:24.876
"will my y be equal to 1,111."

00:00:24.876 --> 00:00:27.431
I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:29.151
and think about it on your own.

00:00:29.151 --> 00:00:32.526
At what t value will this y be equal

00:00:32.526 --> 00:00:36.583
to a roughly equal to 1,111.

00:00:36.583 --> 00:00:40.689
If you see the need you might
want to use a calculator.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.936
I'm assuming you've given a go at it.

00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:44.176
Let's work through this together,

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:45.639
so we want to say, when
does five times two

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:48.726
to the t power, equal 1,111.

00:00:48.726 --> 00:00:49.897
Let's write that down.

00:00:49.897 --> 00:00:53.396
When does five times two to the t power

00:00:53.396 --> 00:00:59.199
equal 1,111.

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.413
Whenever we're doing
anything algebraically

00:01:01.413 --> 00:01:03.636
it's always a little bit
useful to see if we can isolate

00:01:03.636 --> 00:01:06.290
the variable that we're
trying to solve for,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.230
we're trying to find what
t value will make this

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.852
equal that right over there.

00:01:09.852 --> 00:01:13.037
A good first step would
maybe try to get this five

00:01:13.037 --> 00:01:14.314
out of the left hand side,

00:01:14.314 --> 00:01:15.836
so let's divide the left by five.

00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:17.881
If we want to keep this being in equality

00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:19.607
we have to do the same
thing to both sides.

00:01:19.607 --> 00:01:24.817
We get two to the t power

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:30.786
is equal to 1,111 over five.

00:01:30.786 --> 00:01:33.576
How do we solve for t here?

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:36.534
What function is essentially the inverse

00:01:36.534 --> 00:01:38.919
of the exponential function?

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:40.496
Well it would be the logarithm.

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:46.471
If we say that a to the
b power is equal to c

00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:54.315
then that means that log base a of c

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:56.665
is equal to b.

00:01:56.665 --> 00:01:58.608
a to the b power is equal to c.

00:01:58.608 --> 00:02:01.225
Log base a of c says what power do I need

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:03.229
to raise a to, to get to c?

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.478
Well I need to raise a to
the b power, to get to c.

00:02:06.478 --> 00:02:07.887
a to the b power is equal to c.

00:02:07.887 --> 00:02:11.395
These two are actually
equivalent statements.

00:02:11.395 --> 00:02:16.965
Let's take log base two of
both sides of this equation.

00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:20.304
On the left hand side

00:02:20.304 --> 00:02:27.503
you have log base two
of two to the t power.

00:02:27.503 --> 00:02:28.865
On the right hand side,

00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:36.569
you have log base two of 1,111 over five.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.186
Why is this useful right over here?

00:02:39.186 --> 00:02:41.257
This is what power do
we have to raise two to,

00:02:41.257 --> 00:02:43.190
to get two to t power?

00:02:43.805 --> 00:02:45.882
Well to get two to the t power,

00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:48.169
we have to raise two to the t power.

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.839
This thing right over here

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:55.460
just simplifies to t.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.250
That just simplifies to t.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.977
On the right hand side,
we have log base two,

00:02:59.977 --> 00:03:02.014
we have all of these
business right over here.

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:03.224
I'll just write it over,

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:09.946
t is equal to log base
two of 1,111 over five.

00:03:09.946 --> 00:03:13.554
This is an expression
that gives us our t value

00:03:13.554 --> 00:03:14.469
but then the next question is

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:16.453
well how do we figure out what this is?

00:03:16.453 --> 00:03:18.245
If you take out your calculator,

00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:23.392
you'll quickly notice that
there is no log base two button,

00:03:23.392 --> 00:03:25.083
so how do we actually compute it?

00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:27.263
Here we just have to apply

00:03:27.263 --> 00:03:30.150
a very useful property of exponents.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:40.658
If we have log base two
of well really anything.

00:03:40.658 --> 00:03:41.976
Let me write it this way,

00:03:41.976 --> 00:03:44.919
if we have log base a of c,

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:51.570
we can compute this as
log base anything of c

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.402
over log base that same anything of a.

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.267
This anything has to be the same thing.

00:03:58.267 --> 00:04:00.634
Our calculator is useful
because it has a log,

00:04:00.634 --> 00:04:03.465
you just press log, it's log base 10.

00:04:03.465 --> 00:04:06.759
If you press ln, it's
natural log or log base e.

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.806
I like to just use the log base 10,

00:04:08.806 --> 00:04:10.781
so this is going to be the same thing

00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:16.216
as log base 10 of 1,111 over five

00:04:16.216 --> 00:04:20.984
over log base 10 of two.

00:04:20.984 --> 00:04:22.613
We can get our calculator out

00:04:22.613 --> 00:04:25.349
and we could unlog base e if we wanted

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.464
that would be a natural log

00:04:26.464 --> 00:04:28.152
but I'll just use the log button.

00:04:28.152 --> 00:04:34.207
This is logarithm of 1,111 over five,

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:37.132
so that's this part right over here.

00:04:37.132 --> 00:04:38.913
This is log base 10,

00:04:38.913 --> 00:04:40.847
implicitly that's what the log button is.

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:47.065
Divided by log base 10 of two

00:04:47.065 --> 00:04:50.504
and then that gives us seven,

00:04:50.504 --> 00:04:51.617
well it just keeps on going

00:04:51.617 --> 00:04:59.173
but is approximately equal to 7.796.

00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:05.151
This is approximately equal to 7.796,

00:05:05.151 --> 00:05:07.209
so when t is roughly equal to that

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:10.950
you're going to have y equaling 1,111.
