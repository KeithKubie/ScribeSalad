00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.480
well it's important when we think about

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490
well it's important when we think about
 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.740
well it's important when we think about
population and it is and I am concerned

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750
population and it is and I am concerned
 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.419
population and it is and I am concerned
about it we're talking probably around

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429
about it we're talking probably around
 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.129
about it we're talking probably around
three billion people between now and

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139
three billion people between now and
 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.279
three billion people between now and
2050 and I do think it is an issue but I

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289
2050 and I do think it is an issue but I
 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.170
2050 and I do think it is an issue but I
also want to be careful to say because a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
also want to be careful to say because a
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.820
also want to be careful to say because a
lot of people then take that and use it

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830
lot of people then take that and use it
 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.340
lot of people then take that and use it
as an anti-immigrant or you know could

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350
as an anti-immigrant or you know could
 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.490
as an anti-immigrant or you know could
potentially racist kind of thing when we

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500
potentially racist kind of thing when we
 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.740
potentially racist kind of thing when we
look at who is using the most energy and

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750
look at who is using the most energy and
 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.749
look at who is using the most energy and
water in the world it isn't the places

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759
water in the world it isn't the places
 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.250
water in the world it isn't the places
in the world where the population is

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260
in the world where the population is
 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.560
in the world where the population is
exploding it's here in North America

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570
exploding it's here in North America
 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.209
exploding it's here in North America
where their worst energy guzzlers and

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219
where their worst energy guzzlers and
 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.060
where their worst energy guzzlers and
the worst water guzzlers at followed by

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070
the worst water guzzlers at followed by
 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.130
the worst water guzzlers at followed by
Australia which has no water left and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140
Australia which has no water left and
 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.190
Australia which has no water left and
Europe so it's very important for us I

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
Europe so it's very important for us I
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.630
Europe so it's very important for us I
think to realize that it's the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640
think to realize that it's the
 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.590
think to realize that it's the
industrial model and the individual use

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600
industrial model and the individual use
 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.880
industrial model and the individual use
overuse and abuse of these resources

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890
overuse and abuse of these resources
 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.889
overuse and abuse of these resources
that that is the issue when then you

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
that that is the issue when then you
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.380
that that is the issue when then you
compound that with growing population

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390
compound that with growing population
 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.410
compound that with growing population
which is then growing in areas of the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420
which is then growing in areas of the
 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.479
which is then growing in areas of the
world that are industrializing so at the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
world that are industrializing so at the
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.979
world that are industrializing so at the
industrializing China the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989
industrializing China the
 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.789
industrializing China the
industrializing India with the class

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799
industrializing India with the class
 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.380
industrializing India with the class
structure where their upper class is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390
structure where their upper class is
 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.920
structure where their upper class is
buying you know all the stuffs and more

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930
buying you know all the stuffs and more
 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.649
buying you know all the stuffs and more
that we have here that's the thing

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
that we have here that's the thing
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.149
that we have here that's the thing
that's unsustainable so it's the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
that's unsustainable so it's the
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.980
that's unsustainable so it's the
connection between population and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
connection between population and
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.469
connection between population and
consumerism and industrialization that

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
consumerism and industrialization that
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.660
consumerism and industrialization that
we have to put together and if we in the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
we have to put together and if we in the
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.550
we have to put together and if we in the
global North don't want the global South

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
global North don't want the global South
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.350
global North don't want the global South
to destroy all of its water and energy

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
to destroy all of its water and energy
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.289
to destroy all of its water and energy
sources we better we better admit that

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299
sources we better we better admit that
 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.969
sources we better we better admit that
our development model may not be the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
our development model may not be the
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.249
our development model may not be the
best one and then but we're going to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259
best one and then but we're going to
 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.230
best one and then but we're going to
have to show some leadership as well and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
have to show some leadership as well and
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.270
have to show some leadership as well and
cutting back because how do you ask

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
cutting back because how do you ask
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.179
cutting back because how do you ask
people in a poor country to cut back

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189
people in a poor country to cut back
 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.770
people in a poor country to cut back
when we won't cut back ourselves you

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
when we won't cut back ourselves you
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.380
when we won't cut back ourselves you
know it's quite a lot to ask really if

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390
know it's quite a lot to ask really if
 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.270
know it's quite a lot to ask really if
you think of it it's like saying well

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
you think of it it's like saying well
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.010
you think of it it's like saying well
we'll all cut our emissions or we'll all

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
we'll all cut our emissions or we'll all
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.160
we'll all cut our emissions or we'll all
cut our water use or whatever by twenty

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
cut our water use or whatever by twenty
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.740
cut our water use or whatever by twenty
percent but if you're you know somebody

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
percent but if you're you know somebody
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.959
percent but if you're you know somebody
described it if you're 80 pounds and

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969
described it if you're 80 pounds and
 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.270
described it if you're 80 pounds and
you're supposed to just cut your food

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280
you're supposed to just cut your food
 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.190
you're supposed to just cut your food
consumption by you know twenty percent

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
consumption by you know twenty percent
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.410
consumption by you know twenty percent
you're going to die if you're 200 pounds

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420
you're going to die if you're 200 pounds
 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.910
you're going to die if you're 200 pounds
probably you can cut your food

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
probably you can cut your food
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.620
probably you can cut your food
consumption by twenty percent and then

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
consumption by twenty percent and then
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.050
consumption by twenty percent and then
some right so similarly I think we could

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060
some right so similarly I think we could
 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.029
some right so similarly I think we could
think of ourselves as being kind of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039
think of ourselves as being kind of
 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.850
think of ourselves as being kind of
gluttons in the global north and

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860
gluttons in the global north and
 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.690
gluttons in the global north and
maybe we can cut more than our share so

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700
maybe we can cut more than our share so
 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.370
maybe we can cut more than our share so
that the global South isn't taking the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380
that the global South isn't taking the
 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.920
that the global South isn't taking the
entire front
