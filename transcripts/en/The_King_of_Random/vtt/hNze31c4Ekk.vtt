Hey, what's up guys I brought you out to the islands of Hawaii to show you a cool little trick

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.180
I learned from my friends the polynesians on how to turn leaves from a palm tree into a cool Hawaiian headband

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.580
Let's jump right in. now for this project

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.009
We're gonna need to grab three of the leaves off of a palm tree.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.129
So check the branches, look for ones that are green all the way down

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.029
We don't want them to be rotted and now if you just reach up, and you grab beside one of them

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.849
Just give it a little tug, and it will start stripping away

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.229
And you can keep pulling until it breaks off all three of them very cleanly just like that

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.488
Each one of these palm leaves has a very rigid point at the top

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.308
It's all part of one branch these three different stems

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.299
Just came off in one go and if you hold them in your hand like this, you can be a little Hawaiian Wolverine

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.079
Gah!

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.979
We want to have all the ridges pointed upward so hold them also the ridges are facing up. Going to take these two outer leaves

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.879
And roll them Outward

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.799
I'm going to fold them so that they make an x with the right leaf on the top and it should make a little V

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.020
Pattern on the inside with the top kinds of leaves

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.899
They're going to take the bottom one and we're going to line it up

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.000
With the leaf on the left the tines should be facing the same direction and holding them in place

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.949
We're just going to roll that leaf inward

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.588
but then we're going to lift it up and bring it on top and

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.299
Set it down over that middle leaf it should look something like that then from there

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.820
We're going to take this outside leaf, and we're going to roll it in gently and twist it back the other way like that

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.180
So left to right right to left just gently rolling those leaves inward, so from here

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.470
We're just going to repeat that process all the way down the entire length of these palm leaves

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.240
if you give this little tug

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.860
You can see how it tightens that up, every now and then you might want to stop and just make sure everything is firm

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.549
Taking the outside leaves rolling them in and then placing them on top

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.089
Now that one you can see I actually pinched it

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.799
I didn't roll it properly

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.508
but if you use your finger to press the back you can use your finger as a form to roll the leaf first and

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.519
Then you can place it over top, and it makes a cool rounded shape instead of being pinched off

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.589
You can see how that's already starting to form a nice little headband shape at this point

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.200
You can see it's just

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.000
About big enough to fit my head so all we have to do is tie these off and finish it up

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.049
Now tying off the LeI is pretty simple

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.769
We're just going to gather up all the palm leaves in the same Direction here wrap it around our fingers

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.259
And then we're just going to pull it through like a simple overhand knot

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.289
You don't want to pinch it too hard, or it'll break

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.929
but just work the knot down until it's secure now look for the hole at the base of the branch and take the knot and

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.590
Just push it [straight] through

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.060
And we can use this now to size the [lay] to our heads

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.000
By putting it on our heads and just figuring out the size that we want

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.620
And when it feels like it's sized correctly just take it off

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.160
Take the knot and just tuck it inside one of these folds like so

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.409
And that's it now just go through and give your lay a little tug to work out any of the gaps

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.259
And it's finished and ready to go on your head

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.019
Now these headbands don't really serve any practical purpose

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.319
But they're cool to make for the kids or cool to wear, if you're going to be stranded on an Island

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.949
You got to have something to do, that's a really fun thing to do so make yourself a headband

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.239
They're really easy and if you don't have any palm leaves maybe go down to the store and get some long poster board you can

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.099
cut it into strips, I'm sure it will fold together a very similar way, you can make yourself a little paper Hawaiian headband

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.570
How about that and if you're stranded on a desert island what else do you have to do beside weave Palm leaves together?

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.529
Maybe you can make yourself some coconut husk rope. I'll show you how to do that in another project video

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.809
So there you have it guys a cool little trick for turning palm tree leaves into cool, Hawaiian headbands

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.769
Thanks so much for joining me for this experiment. I'll be looking for you the next one. Talk to you then!

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.340
I'm like a Hawaiian Wolverine.
