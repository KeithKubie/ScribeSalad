[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.025 --> 00:00:07.400
JAMIE GREEN: Beth
Kobliner is one

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.930
of the nation's
leading authorities

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.340
on personal finance.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.710
I measure this fact
by the fact that she's

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.900
been on "Sesame Street,"
which I find pretty--

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.550
I'm pretty starstruck now.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.890
In addition she also
served on President Obama's

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.070
advisory council for financial
capability for young Americans.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.540
So however you
want to measure it,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.350
Beth knows what
she's talking about.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.020
So please welcome Beth Kobliner.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.789
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:33.830
BETH KOBLINER: Thank you.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.001
Thank you so much.

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.500
JAMIE GREEN: Thanks
much for coming.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.660
You've been on a pretty
big book tour so far.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.560
BETH KOBLINER: I was in Detroit,
Chicago, Atlanta, Ann Arbor.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.240
And now I'm going
for the next leg,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.910
leaving on Thursday to
the West Coast, so a lot,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.650
a lot going on.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.180
It's fascinating to be meeting
parents with kids of all ages.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.690
I look at you all as kids.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.767
And so no, it's great.

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:03.350
I wanted to just say
two quick things.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.090
Is that OK, just to start?

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.660
The first is my dad
is in the audience.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.300
He's 87 years old,
Harold Kobliner.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.290
And it's very cute,
because my dad,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.184
he was an educator, a
principal, then chairman

00:01:20.184 --> 00:01:21.850
of what's called the
Board of Examiners,

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.330
which was the organization that
tested teachers, principals,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.670
and superintendents
in New York City.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.150
And he also was a great
role model about money.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.110
And he loves, to this day, to
go into the local supermarket

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.800
and hand out flyers about
my book to anyone he meets.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.520
He actually singlehandedly sold
four copies in Barnes and Noble

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.020
on the Upper West
Side yesterday,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.980
just talking to parents, oh,
my daughter wrote this book.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.260
Simon and Schuster said we
had a real spike in sales

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.690
on the Upper West Side.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.400
And so he hands out flyers.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.150
And he always just gives them to
people in stores who he really

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.610
likes and who are helpful.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.880
And in addition to giving
him like the freshest soy

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.460
milk in the back, they
also often say to him,

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.740
thank you for teaching
me these secrets.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.970
I didn't know the
basic money issues.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.400
And that's always been
very touching to him

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.580
and touching to me and my mom.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.150
And I just wanted to say
that the reason I wrote

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.750
the book was basically to share
that wisdom that I grew up

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.720
with and have been writing
about for 30 years with people.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.280
So that was the first thing.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.820
And the second thing
is, OK, I'm old.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.510
So I've been on "Oprah,"
and taught Elmo about money,

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.250
and met with President Obama
about children and money.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.420
But the one thing--

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.890
now my daughter's 21.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.420
And my son's 18.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.010
And the little one's 13.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.250
And the one thing they've been
impressed by, I'm like, I'm

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.170
speaking at Google today.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.940
And they're like, no way!

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.090
Wow!

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.350
So Google, I've never been here.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.420
It's really exciting.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.742
And I know how
smart you all are.

00:03:02.742 --> 00:03:03.700
JAMIE GREEN: Thank you.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.550
And we definitely
do still, I'm sure,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.040
have things to learn
from this book.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.480
BETH KOBLINER: Maybe one or two.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.563
JAMIE GREEN: I don't know.

00:03:11.563 --> 00:03:15.010
I felt like I learned
a lot reading it.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.114
The book works off the
premise that parents

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:19.780
should be teaching
their kids good money

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.790
habits from preschool all the
way through young adulthood.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.400
And you say in the book that
a child's basic money habits

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.280
are formed by the
age of seven, which

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.650
I hope is not terrifying to
any parents of 10-year-olds

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.316
in the audience.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.230
What sorts of things are
kids under seven picking up

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.522
on that are really
locking in those habits?

00:03:43.522 --> 00:03:45.730
BETH KOBLINER: Well there's
some really good research

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.030
done by a woman named
Corinne Holden at University

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.470
of Wisconsin.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.020
And I met her on
"Sesame Street."

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.350
I should say, I met her on
the street, Sesame Street.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.130
But I did.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.890
And she's done some remarkable
research looking at what

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.870
three-year-olds understand.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.020
And she found they
understand exchange, when

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.580
you give money for something.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.980
More like if you give
a card for something,

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.300
they get something back.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.660
They see that happening.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.120
They understand value.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.230
A diamond ring is more
valuable than a pair of shoes,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.230
although it depends upon what
shoes you're talking about.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.510
And also they understand the
basic concept of needs versus

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.530
wants.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.690
So if you go shopping
in a supermarket

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.270
with a young child you
can say, you know what?

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.940
We really need milk.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.700
But we really want
chocolate milk.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.150
Or we really need vegetables.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.010
But we really want potato chips.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.830
And we're going to spend most
of our money on things we need.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.170
And you can play the
game, need-want game.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.560
And as a kid gets
older, how do we

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.236
find the less expensive brand?

00:04:49.236 --> 00:04:51.610
And what are the trade-offs,
and all those sort of things

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.110
you could do in a supermarket.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.850
But I think it's key that
talking to kids at very

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.390
young ages, as little
as three, really

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.700
has an impact on having them
understand these concepts more

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.760
and more, which is really--

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.290
I was surprised by that.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.870
I didn't really realize that.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.020
And then the scary one
was Cambridge University

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.090
did a study.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.320
And they said by age seven,
many of those behaviors

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.040
that we associate with
money habits are actually

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.440
set by age seven.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.390
So I think they're
talking more about

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.990
like delayed gratification
and executive function.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.530
But it's not that
it's absolutely set.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.180
There's a lot more to teach
an eight-year-old up, I think.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.550
And that comes from
everyday moments,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.660
whether it's talking
to your kid about,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.950
OK, I'm going to go buy a car.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:52.680
That's my editor.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.360
He got my book.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.443
And he's like, I never
would have thought of that.

00:05:55.443 --> 00:05:58.580
But I brought my 10-year-old
to the car dealership,

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.500
because I would
think, she'd be bored.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.250
But I brought her.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.740
And I started telling her, OK,
well I'm going to buy a car.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.910
This is what the price is.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.350
I'm going to try to negotiate.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.766
I'm going to get
an interest rate.

00:06:07.766 --> 00:06:09.770
Maybe I'll go to a bank
for the interest rate.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.640
And those conversations
and those experiences,

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.540
frankly, are pretty
meaningful for kids.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.090
With everything
digital and online,

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.830
I think it's really essential
that parents start doing that

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.746
at many ages as kids get older.

00:06:27.746 --> 00:06:29.120
JAMIE GREEN: To
a certain extent,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.891
that sounds like an
extension of good parenting--

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.390
BETH KOBLINER:
Right, oh absolutely.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.190
JAMIE GREEN:
--explain to your kid

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.960
why you're doing
what you're doing.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.330
Let them into those decision.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.210
Make sure that things that
would otherwise go unspoken

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.300
are explained and clarified.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.350
What happens to a kid whose
parents don't consciously

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.880
make an effort to teach them
about money and finance?

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.450
BETH KOBLINER: What we're
seeing is-- so two years ago,

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.990
the government participated
in this international test

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.390
for 15-year-olds.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.490
And it's called
PISA is the test.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.950
And what was ironic, I was
on the President's council

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:07.460
at the time.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.220
And we couldn't come
up with the $200,000

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.700
to participate in this test,
which OK, as a government.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.900
But we did.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.060
And we were able
to take this test.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.250
And we found that 15-year-olds
in the United States

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.590
are mediocre, right
in the middle.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.820
So there are countries,
many, many countries

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.180
from all over that are
doing so much better than we

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.130
are in teaching kids basics.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.430
We're talking basics,
understanding the interest rate

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.810
on a credit card, or even being
able to dissect a paycheck,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.870
not understanding where that
money's going, whether it's

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.260
Social Security or tax.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.990
So I have in my book
a chart on all that.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:56.990
But it's so clear that
our nation, by not

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.360
under-- someone
I work with said,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.520
financial rights
are civil rights.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.790
And if you understand
that it's a mistake

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.960
to get into credit card debt
that's charging you 18%,

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.170
or if you understand that
if you miss a student loan

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.920
payment, that will likely
go on your credit record

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.320
for seven years,
those kind of things,

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.990
I've had so many people
tell me, I didn't know.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.740
And I want my kids to
know and to understand

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.272
this in age appropriate ways.

00:08:27.272 --> 00:08:28.730
JAMIE GREEN: It's
interesting where

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.850
you say, you just said that
one way of looking at it

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.586
is that financial issues
are civil rights issues,

00:08:35.586 --> 00:08:37.460
because you mentioned
a statistic in the book

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.580
that nearly half
of all Americans

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.880
couldn't pull together
$2,000 for an emergency.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.310
And this isn't just
half of all Americans

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.140
don't have $2,000 in the bank.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.560
But they wouldn't
be able to borrow it

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.560
from friends and family.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.901
They could not get $2,000.

00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:54.650
BETH KOBLINER: They
couldn't even get it--

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.191
you think, well use
your credit card.

00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:59.580
They didn't have access
to credit to get $2,000.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.220
So it probably means that they--

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.600
we don't know exactly--

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.170
but it probably means that
they are in credit trouble.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.870
And they no longer
had a line of credit.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.420
So when you think of that,
that's pretty terrifying.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.480
I've heard it called
financial fragility.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.770
We're so unsecure.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.360
We're not financially secure.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.990
And I think that is
so important, just

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.050
the concept of saving up money.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:35.840
And the more I've been touring,
I really strongly believe-- oh,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.590
and you're Google.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.180
You can help me
make this happen.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.730
I think cash should come back.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.660
I really think that.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.701
I'm not getting any nods.

00:09:42.701 --> 00:09:43.430
You're like, nah.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:49.410
But when I was a kid, my parents
would sit at the kitchen table.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.799
My mom and dad would
pay the bills together.

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:53.090
And there were a pile of bills.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:54.130
And they'd write a check.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.588
And they'd balance
their checkbook.

00:09:55.588 --> 00:09:59.010
How many people here balance
a checkbook honestly?

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.380
One person.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.787
So interesting.

00:10:01.787 --> 00:10:03.620
My dad could stand up
and tell you how many,

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.190
over 87 years, how many times he
found errors in the bank math.

00:10:10.056 --> 00:10:14.240
And I know you're all making a
decision of time versus money.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.370
And my time is worth
more than checking

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.350
to find the $10 mistake.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.810
But sometimes
there are mistakes.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.320
And I think for kids, my
favorite story in the book

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.260
is a mom going to
Target with her son.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.030
And he was about eight or nine.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.590
And she was buying juice boxes.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.180
And she pulled out a $20.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.550
And her kid said mommy,
don't pay for it.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.810
Use the card.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.990
That's the way to-- you get it
for free if you use the card.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:43.850
And I think that mindset,
particularly for younger kids,

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.340
and of course now
Venmo and all the ways

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.630
people are exchanging money
without exchanging money.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.530
And we know that MIT
did a study years

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.020
ago showing that people spend
twice as much if you use

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.770
a card than if you use cash.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.010
And I think the pain
of paying is something.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.190
When you fork over dollars,
it feels like oh, I'm

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.690
really giving up something.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:09.500
That's a behavioral
economics finding.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:16.400
So I think the inability to
make a connection between buying

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.120
things, and I'm going into
a bank and getting money,

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.115
instead of it all being online.

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:25.220
I think that that is something
that children are missing out

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:25.812
on.

00:11:25.812 --> 00:11:27.770
And a great parent would
say hey, come on over.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.450
I'm paying the bills online.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.460
But it doesn't really
look any different

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.980
to a four-year-old or
five-year-old than someone

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.770
doing work, because it's
hard to make that connection

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.200
versus the concrete experience.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.380
JAMIE GREEN: So you, in
the book you advocate for--

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.380
you advocate against giving
middle schoolers and teenagers

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.580
prepaid debit cards.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.230
Have them work on cash.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.130
But it sounds also like
adults would benefit

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.860
from working in cash too.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.270
BETH KOBLINER: I think,
or at least modeling it

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.770
for your child.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.900
That's how I learned
to make change.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.300
I had about four
jobs in high school.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.670
And one of them was
working at the local diner.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.130
I'm from Queens originally.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.830
And that was one
of my first jobs.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.100
And I was an AP math.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.080
But that wasn't my top subject.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:17.760
We both bonded.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.970
We went to Brown, English major.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:25.770
But when I was making change,
I remember that somebody

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.560
would be like $3.84 bill.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.940
And they'd give me a $10.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.980
So I'd try to subtract
it in my head.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.320
And my dad's like,
no, you just count up.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.150
If it's $0.34, a
penny for $0.35,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.440
then counting up
all the way to $10.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.970
And I learned that with cash.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:46.800
And I think just the counting,
little kids not knowing

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.940
coins or dollar bills, I
think that's all part of it.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.690
And I think that
is all important.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.700
Not that we will get
rid of our credit cards.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.290
They're super convenient.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.725
But if you're, of course,
using a credit card

00:13:00.725 --> 00:13:03.450
and you're paying it off in
full, it's good to do that.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.980
It's good to have
a credit record.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.220
But I think that that's
been pushed way too early.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.379
And I think kids
are missing out.

00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:13.920
JAMIE GREEN: So
we've already touched

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.990
on a couple of specific
bits of advice.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.780
A big one that
comes up in the book

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.000
that I thought was really
interesting, because it's

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.870
one that is so distant in
my memory, is allowances.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:32.190
So what is your take on
giving kids an allowance?

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.830
What are the learning
opportunities there?

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.240
What do you think about that?

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.940
BETH KOBLINER: So this study
at University of Minnesota--

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.770
and I have to say, this one
wasn't a randomized controlled

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.040
study.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.600
But it was interesting in
that they followed children

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:53.190
who were given chores
when they were little,

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.320
whether it's making
the bed or whatever

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.720
they were doing regularly.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.410
And they found that having
chores, not tied to money

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.660
but just chores as part
of a family, that's

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.100
your responsibility.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:05.620
We're team.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.900
We're all in it together.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:12.510
That was one predictor
of a child's success

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.970
in terms of certain
milestones like graduating

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:19.500
from high school or graduating
from school in general

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.350
or starting a career, that
that experience of doing

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:28.020
a job as part of a family was
quite important to a child's

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.100
development.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.500
But when you put money
into the equation,

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.200
and you give kids
money for chores,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.960
it takes away from that
intrinsic value of,

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.910
I'm going to work
hard for my family.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:40.500
We're in this together.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.240
And it dilutes it.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.420
Same with Roland
Fryer, great guy.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.780
He did research on giving
kids money for grades.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.140
How many people got
money for grades?

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.580
Most of you not, because your
parents said, you work hard.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.250
Whether you were born with it
or you were instilled with it,

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.910
this desire to work hard
for working hard's sake.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:07.210
And maybe we all knew, one
day I'll get to Google.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.060
And you did.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.330
But I think that idea of
parents instilling that in kids,

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.440
so that's--

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.280
it doesn't work.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.770
Roland Fryer, in a wonderfully
randomized controlled study,

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.530
showed that giving
kids money and saying,

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:22.160
I'll give you $100
if you get an A,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.360
or $50 if you get
an A doesn't work.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.210
JAMIE GREEN: Is it the same
for a gift or another kind

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:28.200
of reward?

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.962
BETH KOBLINER: If you reward
afterwards, that's different.

00:15:30.962 --> 00:15:32.670
If the kid does really
well, and you just

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.780
want to take them
out for ice cream,

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:34.821
that's a different thing.

00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:36.420
But if it's given
as an incentive,

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:41.010
any kind of gift or
reward doesn't work.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.652
So the question of
allowance, so given that, you

00:15:43.652 --> 00:15:44.610
want to give allowance.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.568
You can give allowance.

00:15:45.568 --> 00:15:49.530
And I looked into two
dozen studies on allowance.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.270
They were international studies.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:55.950
And one from Canada found that
when people give their children

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.380
allowance, the kids end
up being a little more

00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.400
responsible with money.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.270
And they save a little more.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.360
The study from
England found when

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.280
parents give their
kids allowance,

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.680
the kids are feeling
more entitled.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.640
So there was no one right
answer with the allowance.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.430
But what I have
found overall is you

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.000
want to be clear to your child
and in your own mind what

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.510
this allowance is for.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:22.290
So if it's a really little
kid, like a 10-year-old,

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.610
it's good to say OK,
this is going to be--

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.200
you have six LEGO kits.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.490
If you want another one,
and it's not your birthday,

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.865
and it's not the holidays,
and grandma and grandpa aren't

00:16:32.865 --> 00:16:37.090
getting it, you have
to save up for that.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.810
And you figure out what
that would roughly cost,

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.790
because I think one
mistake parents can

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.730
make is I think back.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.110
When I was a kid, I
got $1 for babysitting.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:49.060
And now people get $20
an hour for babysitting.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:53.070
So thinking of what
it really costs,

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.560
and then having
kids make choices.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.500
And you can buy the
Doritos on your way home.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.030
And you learn opportunity cost.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:04.589
Or you could put that $1 into
a jar, a piggy bank or whatever

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:05.550
and save it up.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.869
And then kids see
that excitement

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:10.890
of building up that money.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.810
So I think allowance
works like that.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:16.319
You can also give just a
regular allowance once a week.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.440
The rules of them are
give a kid's age--

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.869
10-year-old gets $10 a week.

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:24.030
But when I'm talking
about this in the Midwest,

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:27.760
the moms are like, I would
like $520 handed to me a year.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.810
So it really just depends.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:36.360
I think as a parent, we
really got most serious

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.870
about this when our kids were
going to college and said,

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.899
OK, how do we come up
with a realistic amount?

00:17:43.899 --> 00:17:44.565
They were lucky.

00:17:44.565 --> 00:17:46.320
They don't have to
take out student loans.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.000
And they were in
a situation where

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.130
we'll pay for their
health care and books.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.070
But if we wanted
to get-- they work.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.940
They both work.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.100
But if we give them
a little bit of cash

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.404
for that semester,
how much should it be?

00:17:59.404 --> 00:18:00.820
And what would it
be expected for?

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.540
So of course, I'm like,
I'll just give them $100.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.800
And then we thinking about it.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.730
And we're like, no.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.490
This is money for if they want
to go on a trip with a friend,

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:10.380
or they want to go--

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.190
so my daughter, for
example, went skiing,

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.580
even though she doesn't ski.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.890
Kids these days.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.200
She went over winter break.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.150
A bunch of friends
were going to Canada.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.830
And they were driving up.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.120
But she had to go later.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.610
So we saw her sitting
there, looking

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.770
at the train versus the plane.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.450
And the train took nine hours.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.520
And the plane took two hours.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.390
And she made the choice
to take the train.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.090
And of course I'm thinking,
[GROANS] maybe just

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.170
let her take the plane.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:41.010
It's so long.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.390
And then my husband and
I were talking about it.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.190
No this is-- to each
other, we didn't

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.810
do this in front of
her-- but the idea

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.559
that this is what we agreed to.

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:50.850
And this is so good for her
to be making those choices.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.254
And she had fun on the train.

00:18:52.254 --> 00:18:53.670
She said, I looked
out the window.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:54.586
And I did my homework.

00:18:54.586 --> 00:18:55.700
And I read a lot.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.900
I read a novel.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.150
I think at every level,
when you're a parent,

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.850
the hardest part is
coming up with something

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.010
and then sticking with it.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.100
JAMIE GREEN: Yeah,
that consistency.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.965
There ends up being a
big shift though around--

00:19:10.965 --> 00:19:12.840
I don't know if it
happens in middle school--

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.180
babysitting jobs,
or in high school

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.940
once, I remember just
like waiting and waiting

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.340
to be 16 so I could get a job.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.230
I was so excited.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.930
But it seems like from
the research you found,

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.710
there is a mix of
some benefits but also

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.780
some possible sacrifices
with high school jobs,

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.782
especially during
the school year.

00:19:33.782 --> 00:19:34.740
BETH KOBLINER: Exactly.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.410
There are a lot of great
books in the last few years

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:42.750
have come out that talked about
kids are coddled too much.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.640
And they should be out
working in high school

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.410
like we used to do.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:50.280
And that I agree with for sure
in theory and in practice.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.770
However the Department of Labor
Statistics did an analysis.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:58.690
And they found that
if a child is working

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.690
12 hours, 13 hours
a week, then it

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:05.440
doesn't have a negative
impact on their grades.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.690
In fact it may give them
a teeny boost in grades.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.360
And it could be because they're
using their time efficiently.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.200
But once you get to that
15 hour or over mark,

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.700
it has an impact on grades.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:21.780
So we know that when kids
do less homework in math,

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.160
it's a direct correlation
to their math grades.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.050
And then of course,
when we're talking

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:31.180
about thinking about college
and not just how great a school

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.450
you get into, but also which
will give you the most aid

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.480
and opening up your
opportunities to get more aid,

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.040
I think it's a hard trade-off.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.540
And of course, there
are many, many,

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.660
many families that
need their child

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.520
to work to contribute
to the family.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.580
But I think it's important
just to know that number.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.070
Whereas in college,
interestingly,

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.990
you can work up to 20 hours.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:01.060
Kids who work up to 20 hours
but work in an on-campus job

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:05.614
have slightly higher GPAs than
kids that don't work at all.

00:21:05.614 --> 00:21:07.030
JAMIE GREEN: And
then there's also

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:11.230
the question of is that
work important preparation

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:15.080
for future careers
and things like that?

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.630
And so you, in the
book, I think you

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.700
advocate for college
students working

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.152
during the summer, maybe as
a trade-off for working less

00:21:22.152 --> 00:21:23.110
during the school year.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.526
BETH KOBLINER:
Absolutely, I think

00:21:24.526 --> 00:21:28.060
working in the summer for
high school and college.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.960
And then that job during
high school, for example,

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.080
if it's during the
summer, it's a great way

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:40.240
to then segue, with
your kids, to the magic

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.240
of compound interest,
which is a hard one

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.430
to talk to a 14-year-old about.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.995
This is great,
compound interest.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:55.000
And the idea is if
a child is, say, 14.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.350
And they work every summer.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.930
And maybe they earn
$1,000 that summer.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.720
And they work for
four summers in a row.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.920
And if they put that
money into a Roth IRA--

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.570
and in order to open a Roth
IRA, you need to have income.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:09.970
So it has to be from the job.

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:13.450
So you put that $1,000 in
each year for four years.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.750
And then you stop and
never put money in again.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.340
You would most
likely, if you put it

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.770
in an index fund or an ETF--

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.675
and I talk about
those in my book--

00:22:22.675 --> 00:22:27.700
you would be likely
to have over $100,000.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.589
So saying that to a kid, you
do it for these four years.

00:22:30.589 --> 00:22:32.130
That's how much
you're going to have.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:36.130
That's fairly compelling,
I think, for many kids.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.620
And also it helps if you're
applying for financial aid,

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:42.100
because colleges expect
you to contribute

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:47.260
much more of a kid's savings
than a parent's savings.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.820
But if it's in an
IRA, they don't

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:55.180
look at that money typically,
which is a good thing to know.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.210
JAMIE GREEN: There's
so many trade-offs.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:01.000
No, no, no, it's all really
clear in the book though.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.220
There are a lot of little
worksheets and tables

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.720
that I found really,
really helpful.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.730
BETH KOBLINER: Thank you.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.790
JAMIE GREEN: We were saying,
the book starts or includes

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:12.070
in every chapter
ways to introduce

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.320
these ideas to a preschooler,
whether it's just

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.140
playing with coins or talking
about wants and needs.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.400
But you also take
all of the advice

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.620
passed college into
young adulthood.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:31.000
And so how much input on a 23,
24-year-old/s financial life do

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.160
you think a parent
should be having?

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.530
BETH KOBLINER: I think
a lot of guidance

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:39.640
is needed, either because they
didn't talk about it before,

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.044
or kids are graduating.

00:23:42.044 --> 00:23:43.960
If you don't mind me
asking one more question,

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.584
how many people here
have student loans

00:23:45.584 --> 00:23:46.965
that they're still paying off?

00:23:46.965 --> 00:23:50.017
[LAUGHS] The Brown major.

00:23:50.017 --> 00:23:52.100
JAMIE GREEN: You're talking
about grad school too.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.940
BETH KOBLINER: Yeah, grad
school, including grad school?

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.100
No, you all paid it off.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.620
But I think that many,
many people graduate

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.875
from college with
lots of student debt.

00:24:02.875 --> 00:24:04.250
And if it's federal
student debt,

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.780
there are a lot of
wonderful repayment options.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.560
And I met someone
here who worked

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.770
at one of these companies
that will also refinance

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:16.270
private student loans, typically
if you're from a school that

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:17.740
makes the list of
schools that they

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.210
think those kids
have a likelihood

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.782
to pay off their debt too.

00:24:20.782 --> 00:24:21.490
It's interesting.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:26.380
But I think that talking
about repayment options,

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.740
moving back home is something
that-- it's so interesting.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.976
One part of the country,
I said, out of college,

00:24:31.976 --> 00:24:33.100
you have to move back home.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.990
And they're like, oh.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.270
And then another
part of the country,

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.770
I actually spoke
to these kids, it's

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:42.670
called College Advising Corps.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.340
And these are kids who
graduate from high school.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.780
And it's like a Peace Corps
but for working in lower income

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.000
high schools that don't
have college counselors.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.070
And these kids
volunteer for two years.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.440
And they learn as
much as they possibly

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.940
can about being a
college counselor

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.850
and helping kids
with financial aid.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:04.510
And when I said, well,
move back home, kids said,

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:05.770
I'm from the Bronx.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.021
And I have four siblings.

00:25:08.021 --> 00:25:09.520
And we live in a
one room apartment.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.960
I can't move back home.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.640
I'm like, OK, so the
perspective there can be.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:20.050
But I do think there's so much
we can do to educate people.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:22.840
I have one quick
story about my dad.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.620
And a lot of the book is
about delayed gratification.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.340
And the marshmallow
experiments that--

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.059
Walter Michel is a professor.

00:25:33.059 --> 00:25:33.850
He was at Stanford.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:34.960
Now he's at Columbia.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.290
And he did an experiment
with five-year-olds.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:41.230
And he put a marshmallow
in front of them.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:43.630
And then he said, look, you
can eat this marshmallow now.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:44.560
Feel free.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.730
But if you wait, I'm going to
bring you a second marshmallow.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.850
And they did this
when kids are five.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:55.690
And then he tracked these kids
for years and years and years.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.820
And now those kids
are in their 50s.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.790
But when he did that experiment,
he'd walked out of the room.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.190
The examiner would
walk out of the room.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.520
And some kids
would be like, they

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.060
eat the marshmallow right away.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.450
But some kids would wait.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:10.510
And they'd wait.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.440
And they wait.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:16.320
And they would usually whistle
or try to distract themselves.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.940
And then they would wait for
him for 15 minutes to come back.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.670
And they got that marshmallow,
that second marshmallow.

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:24.130
And they found that
those kids who waited

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:28.690
had on average 200 points
higher on their SATs.

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.480
I feel like I should
start a prep course, a SAT

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.812
course with that in mind.

00:26:32.812 --> 00:26:33.520
I don't know how.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.500
Someone here can help
me figure it out.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:39.400
200 points higher
on their SATs, they

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.670
reported having happier
lives, better relationships

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.220
and lower body mass indexes.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:49.507
So that ability to delay
gratification is incredible.

00:26:49.507 --> 00:26:51.340
JAMIE GREEN: Is the
idea that it's intrinsic

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.790
or that it's learned very early?

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.040
BETH KOBLINER: Great question.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.740
JAMIE GREEN: I say this
as a marshmallow loving

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.320
five-year-old who's concerned.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.870
BETH KOBLINER: Well
that's the great question.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:07.270
So what we know is it wasn't
that these kids had this higher

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.230
moral code.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:12.220
Or they were even, oh,
I could deny myself.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.992
It was more of an executive
function, the ability to,

00:27:14.992 --> 00:27:17.200
I'm going to pretend that's
not really a marshmallow.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.669
I'm going to pretend there's
a picture of marshmallow.

00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:21.460
Or I'm going to pretend
there's dirt on it.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.050
And I don't want it anymore.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.030
Or I'm going to pretend
I'm a superhero.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:27.970
And I'm strong, all
these different ways.

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.470
And now what the
research is looking

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:30.730
at is how do we teach that?

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:33.280
Can we teach it?

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.830
And I was brought
up in an environment

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:39.550
where my dad was a teacher,
at this time in 1969.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:43.240
And he came home and told
my mom, OK, New York City

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.000
introduced a new pension plan.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.320
And we're going to put
away 50% of our income

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.580
in this pension plan.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.580
So we lived in Queens,
tiny little house.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.700
My dad earned like
$30,000 at the time.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.600
They had three kids,
a mortgage, a car.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.676
And my mom, Shirley,
said Harold, what?

00:28:05.676 --> 00:28:07.570
How can we save
half of our income?

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:09.190
We have three kids and a home.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.440
We can't afford it.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.330
And my father said, we
can't afford not to.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:21.700
And that set the theme, I think,
of how he approached life.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:26.530
And he was born in poverty.

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.320
He had no money.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:37.960
And when he was a child,
in order to keep going,

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.260
there's a story about him
where he was eight years old.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.870
And he felt like he
wanted to make some money.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.690
So he sat in the candy store
right near the tenement

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:48.100
where he grew up.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.650
And in those days, people
didn't have telephones.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.840
So my dad would sit.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.330
The phone would ring
in the candy store.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.420
And he'd get up and say,
call for Mrs. Jones.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:59.300
Mrs. Jones?

00:28:59.300 --> 00:28:59.980
Phone call.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.560
He'd go out.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.268
And Mrs. Jones would
come down the stairs

00:29:02.268 --> 00:29:03.970
and give him a nickel or a dime.

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:05.290
He'd get a tip.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:06.490
And he was in a candy store.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:07.989
So he always used
to say to my kids,

00:29:07.989 --> 00:29:09.800
do you think, what
did I do with it?

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.760
My kids are like, you
bought candy, all the candy.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.960
And he said, no.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.420
I saved it and gave
it to my parents.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.610
And because he knew the
delayed gratification

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.730
there was that his parents
wouldn't fight as much.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:25.120
And they'd have
bread on the table.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.150
I hesitate sometimes
to tell that story,

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:29.620
because not everyone's Harold.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.400
That is extraordinary
to be eight years old

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.440
and not eat the candy.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.910
But I think that kind
of thinking for kids,

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.340
and even telling those
stories, kids love anecdotes.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.381
You tell them this story.

00:29:43.381 --> 00:29:44.949
They're like, I
could be like Harold.

00:29:44.949 --> 00:29:46.490
Maybe I'll make a
little Harold doll.

00:29:48.767 --> 00:29:50.350
JAMIE GREEN: We're
going to open it up

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:51.870
to questions in a
couple of minutes.

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:53.578
So if you have questions,
you can line up

00:29:53.578 --> 00:29:56.246
at the two microphones
in the aisles.

00:29:56.246 --> 00:29:58.760
But I wanted to ask you
about something else.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.020
Because you actually,
in the book,

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.500
in general I often think
of good parenting advice

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.060
as being based on openness
and communication.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.000
But there are some things
about parents' finances

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.841
that you advocate
keeping private, which

00:30:13.841 --> 00:30:16.090
I found especially interesting,
because my parents are

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.090
divorced, which I think
brings money talk out

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:20.710
into the open in a
very different way.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.980
And there were, in
terms of child support

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.010
and who could afford what,
and it can be fraught.

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:29.770
But you hear a lot
more from your parents,

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:32.500
maybe because they're just
talking through you instead of

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.620
to each other.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.100
So what are some of the things
that, at different ages,

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:40.000
you think parents shouldn't
talk to their kids about?

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.640
BETH KOBLINER: I think that when
children are five, six, seven,

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.600
eight, nine, you don't have to--

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.780
telling them what
your salary is, to me,

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.670
is just out of context.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:53.720
They don't have
anywhere to put it.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.320
So if you're like, I
make $100,000 a year.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.490
Well then why can't
I get that candy bar?

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.040
And you could explain it.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:04.300
But I think the numbers
are meaningless to very

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.230
young children.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.900
I think as kids get older,
I've been having a lot

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.530
of questions from parents.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:12.020
My 16-year-old wants to
know how much I make.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.610
And should I tell her or not?

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:16.970
And in those cases, I think,
particularly if they're--

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:17.780
you start thinking.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:20.097
And this one mom, we
were talking about it.

00:31:20.097 --> 00:31:21.680
And she realized,
because her daughter

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.939
was nervous about college.

00:31:22.939 --> 00:31:24.230
Would she be able to afford it?

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:25.580
Would she be able to?

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.280
Should she try to get
into the best school?

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.450
Or would she just
not be able to go?

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.300
So those kind of,
I think those--

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.580
but I think you don't
have to tell your--

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:38.505
the ideal is not to fight in
front of your kids about money.

00:31:38.505 --> 00:31:40.880
They actually said that when
parents fight a lot in front

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.070
of their kids about
money, those kids

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:46.880
are three times more
likely to have $500 or more

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.940
in credit card debt in college.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.520
I think that trying to--

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.380
you don't talk to
your kids about it.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.090
It's just got to
be age appropriate.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:57.734
My 401(k) went down.

00:31:57.734 --> 00:31:58.400
They don't care.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.960
I'm frightened about
paying for college.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.600
There's anxiety that
can be passed along

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.330
to kids that, I don't
think it's a healthy thing.

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:12.170
JAMIE GREEN: The balance between
being conscientious and being

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:13.890
anxious, kids pick
up on that worry.

00:32:16.942 --> 00:32:19.550
And on that
wonderful happy note,

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:21.459
let's take it to the
audience, who can maybe

00:32:21.459 --> 00:32:22.500
turn those things around.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.270
You want to go first?

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.130
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:30.810
So first of all, I want to
say thank you for being here.

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:32.340
Some number of years ago--

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.600
I won't say how many--

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.870
I managed to get a copy
of "Get I Financial Life."

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:39.590
And it helped me tremendously.

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.251
So thank you.

00:32:41.251 --> 00:32:43.500
I've been flipping through
the book for the first time

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.590
just now.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:46.500
And I think one of the things--

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.710
we can acknowledge that
Google pays ridiculously well.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:52.200
Nobody here deserves to
make nearly as much money

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.080
as they do.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.290
So I think a lot of
Googlers are in a fairly--

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:57.165
BETH KOBLINER: There'll
be a hat in the back.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.950
AUDIENCE: So I see
things in your book about

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.190
don't worry about keeping
up with the Kardashians.

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:07.320
Don't buy your kid a car.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.440
I think, just my own
experience, those

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.750
weren't options growing up.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.852
And as a parent, my
kids are 10 and 12.

00:33:14.852 --> 00:33:17.310
We're at this point where like,
gosh, a lot of your friends

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:19.140
have all this stuff.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.900
And it's certainly, it's a want.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.610
But it's certainly within the
range of affordability for us.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:27.210
And figuring out that
line between am I

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:30.960
denying you and making you
an outcast socially, things

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.550
that you could be doing?

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:34.890
Every high school kid
in my town has a car.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.870
And the idea of
not doing-- so I'm

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:39.870
curious on how you make
a trade-off, if you have

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:43.230
any information on teaching
kids the hard lessons

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:46.500
versus making them an
outcast, that sort of thing.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.480
BETH KOBLINER: I
love that question.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.150
And I've heard it in
different communities.

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:57.120
And I think that a lot of
people who grew up middle class

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:03.090
or really struggling, and
then you're at Google.

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:04.650
Or you are making
a lot of money.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:06.250
Or you have a lot of money.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:11.130
It's very difficult.
Personally I'm all about denial

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:13.380
to my children, not completely.

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:18.330
But my daughter was the last
one to get her cell phone.

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:23.130
And I think that it
was so ingrained in me,

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:24.699
these values in my head.

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:27.270
And also I'm writing
about this, to be fair.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:33.659
But I think that by the
time, if I think delaying,

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:38.760
first of all, just as a mom I'm
saying this, in much technology

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.480
is so much better, because
kids are still reading books.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.570
And they're still communicating
and talking and looking you

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:46.860
in the eye.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:51.449
And I think that my classic
story was when my daughter--

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:54.060
who's now 21--

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:57.680
when she was 13, she said,
I'm going with some friends.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.710
We live in Manhattan.

00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:59.460
We're going to go.

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:00.420
Can we go to Macy's?

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.920
And we were a little
overprotective.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.390
She was our first child.

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:04.682
And we're like, OK, you can go.

00:35:04.682 --> 00:35:06.098
And she's like,
and all my friends

00:35:06.098 --> 00:35:08.150
have a credit card, their
parents' credit card.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:09.584
Or one was a debit card.

00:35:09.584 --> 00:35:11.250
And the parents, they
were good parents.

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:12.480
They gave them a limit.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.520
But I said, absolutely not.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.470
I said, I'm going
to give you cash.

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:17.820
And she's like, all right.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:21.240
She was a little embarrassed.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.140
But she went.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.750
And she used cash.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:26.820
And she said, you know what?

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.520
You gave me $100 mom.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.875
And it was $103.

00:35:29.875 --> 00:35:31.980
So I had to put something back.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:35.850
Whereas if you hand your kid
a card, a prepaid card even,

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:37.620
you can put it
exactly to the limit.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.080
But often it's like
off of your account.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.720
And if your kid comes
back and spends $120,

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.770
you're like, good job.

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:45.840
You didn't spend $4,000.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.460
And I think that, the
cash, and talking about it

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:54.930
with kids, because it's
trickier with everything now,

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:55.740
with Venmo.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:00.490
And I just felt,
up through college,

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:04.140
they did not need to have
experiences with plastic.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.930
And I think parents also,
one interesting thing

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:11.520
I've been hearing is that
we're worried about our kids

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.160
not having a credit
report or a credit record.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.750
And that, to me, feels
very insidious in that

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:19.980
the notion of needing--

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:23.670
you will get a credit card
when you graduate from college.

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:25.890
There will not be a problem
getting a credit card.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:28.050
And I think just
because now it's

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.510
Credit Karma, which I like.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:31.350
You get it for free,
your credit score.

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:35.100
But I think that people
are rushing it too much.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.990
So in terms, I think
if you talk and say,

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:41.160
I know you're the last one
in your grade to get a phone.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.690
And that's just the way we feel.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:44.340
And we understand
it could be hard.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.960
I understand.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.190
And yeah, those people--

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:49.680
I always hear often, those
people have a summer house.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.090
Or those people have,
and it's like, we

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.140
have such a good family.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.730
We're so lucky.

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.380
And everybody makes
different choices.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.800
And this is the choice we make.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.040
And we love you just as much.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.290
It sounds so trite.

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:09.090
You don't have to say yes.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:11.460
He's like, yeah,
it's really trite.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.940
But that idea of those
kind of conversations

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.480
and again, I was lucky.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.220
My family, we had
those conversations.

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.040
And we still, my
husband and I, still

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.190
have those conversations with
our kids and just explaining.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:28.330
And I have to say when
I see the next phase,

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:33.310
and I've been interviewing
lots of kids, 21, 22

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:34.870
and talking about it.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.330
And some of you are
probably close to that age.

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:40.510
And the whole I'm not really--

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:43.990
your generation, by the way,
the millennial generation,

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:47.260
has much less credit card debt
than Gen-Xer's in their 20s

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:48.850
or baby boomers in their 20s.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:51.610
And that's probably because
in 2009, President Obama

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:53.170
passed the Card
Act, which said you

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:56.620
have to be 21 to get a
credit card in college

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.330
unless a parent cosigns.

00:37:58.330 --> 00:37:59.260
Never do that.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.234
Never cosign a credit
card with your kid.

00:38:01.234 --> 00:38:02.650
I've met so many
parents who said,

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:05.020
yeah, ruined my credit rating.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.370
My kid used my card.

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:07.570
So never do that.

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:12.040
And also just I would say wait
till junior year in college

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.030
before.

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:15.357
Or suggest to them,
OK, if you have a job,

00:38:15.357 --> 00:38:16.440
you can get a credit card.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.010
Pay it off immediately.

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:20.860
But personally I've
seen freshman year,

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.020
they have to do laundry
for the first time.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.960
Not all kids, but my kids,
they had to do laundry.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.434
And there's a lot
going on freshman year.

00:38:28.434 --> 00:38:29.350
They're studying hard.

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:31.280
And they're trying
to figure it all out.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.870
And I think adding
credit to the mix, when

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:40.810
I graduated in 1986
from college, everyone

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:42.580
I knew had lots of
credit card debt,

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:43.906
because it was handed out.

00:38:43.906 --> 00:38:45.530
Someone's like, I
went to a frat party.

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:46.450
I got a credit card.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.440
It was just handed out.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.791
So I hope that helps.

00:38:49.791 --> 00:38:51.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.064
BETH KOBLINER: Thank you.

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:54.730
AUDIENCE: I've been
trying to figure out

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:56.239
how to ask this question.

00:38:56.239 --> 00:38:58.030
I think the marshmallow
example is probably

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:00.370
the best way to do it.

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:02.490
There's probably
not hard data on it.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.448
But I was just wondering
if you had an opinion,

00:39:04.448 --> 00:39:06.370
based on your knowledge.

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:08.449
What's too early?

00:39:08.449 --> 00:39:09.865
It's very tempting
for my kid, who

00:39:09.865 --> 00:39:11.989
is very responsive to all
kinds of different things

00:39:11.989 --> 00:39:12.700
we throw at him.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.080
It's very tempting to
say, OK, you know what?

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:14.580
You're two.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.780
Here's a marshmallow.

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.940
And let's see you fail.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.959
And then we'll try
again in a few months.

00:39:21.959 --> 00:39:23.250
Maybe that's a little damaging.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.250
And I'm wondering if you
have a thought on that.

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:28.660
BETH KOBLINER: That's
another great real question.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.060
So when I was reading about
the marshmallow experiment,

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.460
and I looked at his
original papers.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.990
And then I went online.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:37.390
And they're all these parents,
here's the marshmallow.

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:38.622
But don't eat it!

00:39:38.622 --> 00:39:41.040
And these kids are like,
oh my goodness, why?

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.700
I want it.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.867
And I wrote in
the book, you just

00:39:44.867 --> 00:39:46.750
want to go buy a
bag of marshmallows

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:49.120
and go under the covers
then eat them yourself.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:54.680
So I think that it's
a great question.

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.150
I'm happy and I pride myself on
my book being research based.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:01.690
But I think when you're
looking at being a parent,

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:06.640
sometimes it's better not to
have the research in your head.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.212
And I think certainly
my dad didn't have any

00:40:09.212 --> 00:40:10.420
of that research in his head.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:14.380
And it's sort of like, I think
with that knowledge sometimes

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.960
can come anxiety.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.730
Where does my kid
fall on the scale?

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:19.930
And I got to tell you.

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:22.510
This is something my mom
would say all the time.

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:24.880
There are always bumps
in the roads with kids.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.224
And they'll be,
they're so great.

00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:29.140
The teacher said they're
not paying attention,

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.556
because they're
writing, math code

00:40:30.556 --> 00:40:33.050
under the desk in second
grade, whatever it is.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.710
I made that up.

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:35.793
My child is not writing
math code in second grade.

00:40:35.793 --> 00:40:40.900
But I think that
I strongly believe

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:44.120
it's good to know this stuff and
to think about it a little bit.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.680
And it's fun when it crops up.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:51.940
But I would not be testing
kids, because they'll

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:55.390
start getting a little
anxious probably, or feeling

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.310
that I'm being tested.

00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:00.550
So I would say it's
just the parenting,

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.650
the daily life of parenting.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:04.450
Wow, look at that house.

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:05.530
That's a beautiful house.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:08.560
One day, maybe if we
save up a lot of money,

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.730
maybe we'll get that house.

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:11.552
Or yeah, we saved a lot.

00:41:11.552 --> 00:41:12.760
So we're going on a vacation.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:18.440
I'm so excited, just making it
a part of everyday conversation

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:18.940
in life.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.289
And it does take more
effort for your generation

00:41:21.289 --> 00:41:23.080
to do that because
again you're not saying,

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.430
let's take a trip to the bank.

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:28.750
Or opening a bank account
is a great thing to do.

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:31.780
But the interest rate is 0.1%.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.270
But that's almost
besides the point,

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:38.980
in terms of just having that
experience of going to a bank.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.590
Some banks still have
passbook savings accounts.

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:43.576
And of course, make sure
they don't have fees.

00:41:43.576 --> 00:41:44.950
Because your kid
will put in $10.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:47.440
Then it's gone the next month.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:51.270
But does that help a little?

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:54.100
AUDIENCE: Hello, so my wife
and I have a disagreement.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.520
I've started paying my
eight-year-old for each time

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.930
he practices the piano.

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:00.610
I give him a dime
each time he does it.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:03.370
And if he does it for a
whole week, I give him $1.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:07.040
She thinks it takes some of the
joy out of playing the piano,

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.710
because he's doing
it for money now.

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:11.530
BETH KOBLINER: Perhaps
it enhances the joy.

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:13.210
AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:15.280
So what do you think
about paying kids

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:18.062
for chores in general?

00:42:18.062 --> 00:42:19.520
BETH KOBLINER:
Again, the research,

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.120
when you look at the
idea of doing chores--

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.711
now that's different,
because piano--

00:42:23.711 --> 00:42:25.210
so when you're
talking about chores,

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:28.750
I think it's not a good idea
to tie regular family chores.

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.430
Everybody has to have a job.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.920
I used to load the dishwasher,
empty the dishwasher,

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:33.790
make my bed.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:36.100
Whatever it is, that's
something I had to do.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:40.515
If you're talking about one off
things, like OK, could you--

00:42:40.515 --> 00:42:42.890
I don't know-- I haven't lived
in a house in a long time.

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:43.530
What do you do?

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:46.514
Get the leaves out
of the whatever?

00:42:46.514 --> 00:42:47.680
JAMIE GREEN: Clean a garage?

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.506
BETH KOBLINER: Clean the garage.

00:42:49.506 --> 00:42:51.130
JAMIE GREEN: An
interesting distinction

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:54.280
you make in the book is
that you can pay children

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.050
for chores that if
they weren't doing it,

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:58.120
you might hire someone to do.

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.040
But the regular
maintenance stuff--

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:00.970
BETH KOBLINER: The
regular maintenance.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:02.590
So where does piano
fit into that?

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:03.644
I feel like--

00:43:03.644 --> 00:43:05.560
JAMIE GREEN: Is that
like paying for studying?

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.060
BETH KOBLINER: I think it's a
little like paying for grades,

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.360
which again Roland
Fryer's randomized

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.430
controlled study showed
on average, it just

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:13.330
doesn't matter.

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:14.820
It doesn't help.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:20.530
Now he also found, which is if
you're talking about small one

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:25.180
off projects, so maybe it would
fit into just complete it.

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:27.940
If you complete
it five times, I'm

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.250
going to reward you at
the end of the week.

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:35.020
He was saying that that can help
a child achieve a small term

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:35.710
goal.

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:37.390
But at the end of the day--

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:38.086
and it's funny.

00:43:38.086 --> 00:43:40.460
My husband and I have this
one, because when I was a kid,

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:42.690
I took piano lessons.

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.440
Eight years, and now
I can't play a thing.

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:49.660
He was more improvisational and
played when he felt like it.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.780
And two of our three kids
ended up being like that.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:53.830
And I was nervous.

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:56.140
Why aren't they
taking piano lessons?

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.960
So I think that I
would, in your case,

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.030
probably side with your wife.

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.549
Sorry.

00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:02.840
We could call her on the phone.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.930
Guess what?

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:09.610
But in the sense that in
the end, the point of it is

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:13.510
they're loving playing piano.

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:18.640
And I think that no matter
what value you give to it,

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.450
you want the value
for your child

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:23.320
to eventually come from them.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:29.320
And I pretty strongly feel
that in my control group

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.120
of three, of then my
brother and me, when

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:34.720
it was demanded or paid for--

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.770
we weren't paid for it--

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.530
probably if your child
was being paid for it,

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:42.550
maybe there's
something else they

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:44.550
would pick that they
really want to do that they

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:46.370
would spend the time doing.

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:48.610
So it's a tricky one.

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:55.640
But I would side with not
paying for playing the piano.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.070
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:59.249
BETH KOBLINER: Sorry.

00:44:59.249 --> 00:45:00.790
But you don't have
to tell your wife.

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:02.042
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:02.042 --> 00:45:04.509
JAMIE GREEN: It never happened.

00:45:04.509 --> 00:45:06.050
BETH KOBLINER: My
dad has a question.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:08.050
You can grab the microphone
for him if you want.

00:45:12.215 --> 00:45:14.340
HAROLD KOBLINER: I'd like
to tell you first of all,

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:17.990
I've been retired 26 years.

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:24.060
And I was on a cruise
a few years ago.

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:27.440
And a guy was
sitting next to me.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.320
And he said, what do you do?

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.930
So I said, well I'm an
educator in schools and so on.

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.290
Says, how long you been retired?

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:39.820
Well at that point, I
said about 23 years.

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:44.540
So he looked at me and he
said, how do you survive?

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:49.610
Now the problem, I think, that
the country is heading into

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:53.840
is the problem of people
are living longer.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.740
And by living longer,
you're going to have--

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:02.410
need finances over a
longer period of time.

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:06.110
And if you don't
have it, it's going

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:09.770
to cause major problems,
whether it's Social Security,

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:11.150
you don't have enough.

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:14.790
But it will aggravate
the situation.

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:18.650
And I think we have to address
that that your children should

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:21.740
be educated enough to save.

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:25.010
My wife, we were
married 65 years.

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:29.990
And my wife and I went on
our first trip, major trip

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:33.680
to Europe celebrating
our 25th anniversary.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.680
But we were constantly,
when she said--

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:45.200
my wife, and I said, we're
going to take that tax

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.170
deferred annuity.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:49.450
And now we must do it.

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:53.150
But I also got two
jobs to supplement it.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:56.990
I ran a college entrance
coaching course.

00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:58.720
Remember Stanley Kaplan?

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.890
BETH KOBLINER: He
was his competitor.

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:02.600
Stanley won.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.220
HAROLD KOBLINER:
He did very well.

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:08.250
But he was a teacher in New York
City school system, by the way.

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.100
He was teacher of economics.

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:13.460
And Chuck Schumer the
Senate minority leader

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:17.120
for the Democrats was a
kid in James Madison High

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.920
School in Brooklyn.

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:23.870
And he offered to give the
kids free coaching course,

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:26.980
if they do his
mimeographing work,

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.760
duplicating his knowledge.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.340
And that's how he started,
by the way, Stanley Kaplan.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.930
He was teacher of economics.

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:35.000
But anyway getting
back to this, it's

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.810
crucial for our
country's future to plan

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:45.500
helping our children become
independent and not dependent.

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:49.674
I've had no problems
being retired 26 years.

00:47:49.674 --> 00:47:51.340
BETH KOBLINER: Just
because you behaved.

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.798
HAROLD KOBLINER:
And it's something

00:47:52.798 --> 00:47:54.527
that you have to plan for.

00:47:54.527 --> 00:47:56.360
BETH KOBLINER: And I
didn't get that Lacoste

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.070
shirt I always wanted.

00:47:58.070 --> 00:47:59.870
I opened one chapter in that.

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:01.910
I wanted an alligator shirt.

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:05.240
Then my aunt gave us a bag
of clothes from our wealthier

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:05.796
cousins.

00:48:05.796 --> 00:48:06.920
And there was an alligator.

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.560
So I cut it off and
sewed it on my sweater.

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.900
And of course, this
mean girl said,

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.420
that's not a real
alligator sweater.

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:15.215
You sewed that on.

00:48:15.215 --> 00:48:16.400
And I was like, oh.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.800
But those things you remember.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.500
but we had such a
great childhood.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:27.080
It's interesting how that
kind of philosophy is just,

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:31.189
I think, the heart of it.

00:48:31.189 --> 00:48:32.480
JAMIE GREEN: Thank you so much.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:33.521
BETH KOBLINER: Thank you.

00:48:33.521 --> 00:48:34.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:36.965
JAMIE GREEN: Oh,
gosh, I'm sorry.

00:48:36.965 --> 00:48:38.190
One last quick question.

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:41.450
AUDIENCE: So I'm not sure if it
falls under financial education

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:42.890
or more child psychology.

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:46.780
But going back to getting
paid for piano lessons,

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:50.040
for practicing the piano, I want
to ask the other way around.

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.210
Let's say my kid does something
I really don't like her doing.

00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:56.194
And I'm willing to pay
her for not doing it.

00:48:56.194 --> 00:48:58.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.630
How would that be done?

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:03.729
Should it be done?

00:49:03.729 --> 00:49:06.020
BETH KOBLINER: I would also
say that shouldn't be done,

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.370
because they have to learn.

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:09.840
Again, I'm not a psychologist.

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.720
So take it with a
grain of salt. But I

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:14.060
think, in terms
of the stuff I've

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:16.860
read, that it's the same thing.

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:19.149
You don't want to say
a child knows, well

00:49:19.149 --> 00:49:20.690
if I misbehave--
first of all, you're

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:24.230
giving them a perverse
incentive that OK, I misbehave,

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:25.477
then I get money to stop it.

00:49:25.477 --> 00:49:26.810
So first I'm going to misbehave.

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:29.150
Then I'll get paid
to stop doing it.

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:30.350
Does that makes sense?

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:36.800
But also that it should
come from within.

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.380
I'm not going to misbehave,
because it really bugs my dad.

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:41.713
And I don't want to bug my
dad, because he's a nice dad.

00:49:41.713 --> 00:49:42.440
Or I want to--

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:46.590
I think of those
again, you're giving

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:54.920
an external, extrinsic
reward or disincentive, money

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:58.130
or whatever to do,
to change a behavior,

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:00.530
I think, is not a good
thing for children,

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:03.860
because children have to
understand intrinsically

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:08.870
why it's good to be good or to
listen or to stop being bad.

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:12.350
And I think it confuses it.

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:12.950
Thanks.

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:13.908
JAMIE GREEN: Thank you.

00:50:13.908 --> 00:50:15.810
And that's all the
time we have for today.

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:17.179
Thank you so much, Beth.

00:50:17.179 --> 00:50:18.220
BETH KOBLINER: Thank you.

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:20.530
Thank you so much.
