00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:02.441
- [Voiceover] "Which of
the following is equivalent

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:03.834
"to the above expression?"

00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:07.387
So, they have p plus
one, squared, minus four.

00:00:07.747 --> 00:00:09.105
Then I have all of these choices,

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:12.187
p plus one plus two, times
p plus one minus two,

00:00:12.187 --> 00:00:15.931
p minus one plus two, time
p minus one minus two.

00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:20.059
And so these kind of are reminiscent

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:21.620
of difference of squares.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.245
And when you look at this right over here,

00:00:23.245 --> 00:00:25.474
this is indeed a difference of squares.

00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:27.308
We could rewrite this one as,

00:00:27.308 --> 00:00:30.745
this is the same thing
as p plus one, squared,

00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:32.533
minus two squared.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.971
This literally is a difference of squares.

00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:36.851
And you might remember from your algebra,

00:00:36.851 --> 00:00:39.475
if I have a squared minus b squared,

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:42.703
this can be factored out as a plus b,

00:00:43.113 --> 00:00:45.234
times a minus b.

00:00:45.234 --> 00:00:46.882
So we can do the same thing over here.

00:00:46.882 --> 00:00:47.904
This thing is going to be,

00:00:47.904 --> 00:00:51.270
and we're not used to treating
an expression like p plus one

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.546
as our a, but there's
no reason why we can't.

00:00:53.546 --> 00:00:55.241
This is going to be equal to,

00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:56.472
and let me color-code it.

00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:01.965
This is going to be the
product of two things.

00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:06.357
It's going to be the
product of two things.

00:01:07.077 --> 00:01:08.967
So, it's going to be p plus one...

00:01:10.417 --> 00:01:13.352
so, p plus one here, p plus one here.

00:01:13.742 --> 00:01:16.184
And then, plus b and minus b.

00:01:16.184 --> 00:01:19.482
In this case, b is two.

00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:22.570
So, plus two and then minus two.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.124
Once again, this is just
a difference of squares.

00:01:25.124 --> 00:01:26.308
And I encourage you to search

00:01:26.308 --> 00:01:27.887
for difference of squares on Khan Academy

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:30.278
if this is looking
completely foreign to you.

00:01:30.278 --> 00:01:32.275
Well, this is kind of an
interesting variation on it.

00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:35.503
This is actually fully described

00:01:35.503 --> 00:01:37.291
by this one right over here.

00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:40.287
Do that in the appropriate color.

00:01:40.737 --> 00:01:43.473
All right, p plus one plus two,

00:01:43.473 --> 00:01:46.563
times p plus one minus two.

00:01:46.563 --> 00:01:47.786
Yep, that one right there.
