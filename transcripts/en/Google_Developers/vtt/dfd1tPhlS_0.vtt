DAN HERMES: Hey, everyone.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.490
I'm Dan Hermes.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.000
You can't see my
face just yet--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.370
I have a document that I
want everyone to see--

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.570
but I am on the Google
Commerce team here in

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.320
Developer Relations at Google,
and we're here to talk about

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.310
the Content API for Shopping.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.650
I have two announcements to
make, and then one question

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.740
that I'd actually like to
discuss with Andrew Lamonica,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.580
who's in the Hangout with me.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.110
And also Caroline, if she has
any inputs yet, but I don't

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.730
know that she will.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.020
And let's get started.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.700
So this first thing I want to
announce, this document I

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.750
have, something that the
community has been asking for

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.370
for a long time, and certainly
a lot in the last few months.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.740
And that's a developer's
guide for using

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.560
the .NET Client library.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.880
I just published it yesterday
afternoon.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.976
It can be found at
developers.googl

00:00:55.976 --> 00:00:57.226
e.com/shopping-c
ontent/developersguide.net.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.740
And if you don't want to
memorize that, you can just go

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.400
to developers.google.com, search
for the Content API,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.390
and then in the Developer
Resources section in our left

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.890
nav on our Content API docs,
you can find the .NET

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.070
developer's guide.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.320
And this guide will tell you
pretty much anything you want

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.580
to do with your items feed with
the .NET client library.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.310
So inserting, updating, deleting
individual items, and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.910
getting individual items, as
well as making batch requests,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.090
sending and requesting
performance data, handling

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.550
errors, handling batch errors,
and even using the generic

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.390
projection instead of the
schema projection.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.570
As well as warnings in dry run
mode, which are a big thing

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.190
when you're just testing and
getting things implemented.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.440
So please check it
out if you are a

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.070
.NET programmer, developer.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.979
It was a lot of hard work by
me, and also the document

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.210
brought about a lot of new
features for the library

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.520
itself, which was pretty nice.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.080
So as you try to document
something, and it doesn't

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.810
exist, then you go about
implementing it.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.320
So, now for my face.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.350
Hi, everybody.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.390
The second announcement I want
to make, since we last met,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.330
the sessions for Google I/O
have been released.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.590
So we'll be giving two different
talks on the first

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.030
day of Google I/O, which is
June 27, and the tentative

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.440
schedule is at--

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.707
let me find it-- it's
at developers.googl

00:02:41.707 --> 00:02:47.860
e.com/events/io/sessions.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.010
And we're going to first have
a remedial introductory

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.710
session and talk about how to
improve data quality and how

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.870
to go about making sure that
errors don't continue to

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.530
happen, and things like that.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.220
And then we're going to have a
more in-depth discussion about

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.180
using local shopping and having
products with the local

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.560
channel rather than the
online channel.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.480
So those are my two
announcements.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.490
Now that I've done talking for
five straight minutes, I do

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.910
have a question before you
guys have any questions.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.750
And from the consensus before,
with this shortened Memorial

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.440
Day week, there may not be any
questions other than mine.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.990
Which I'm OK with.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.130
We'll just have a shorter
Hangout this week than we've

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.700
had in the previous weeks

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.340
So the question is--

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.000
and the reason I'm going to ask
it specifically to Andrew

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.760
is because I know he's used
the API Dashboard in the

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.020
Merchant Center.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.670
And just a quick review for
people who haven't used it,

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.450
the API Dashboard is a way to
view your errors through your

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.880
account, through the
Merchant Center.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.930
And then also recently, we added
a feature that allows

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.720
you to go in and edit the
request that resulted in an

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.150
error, and try to resend it in
dry run mode, and find out if

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.070
you fixed the error or if
the error's still there.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.360
So it's a nice summary of the
errors you have if for some

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.000
reason your logs aren't
comprehensive enough, or some

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.200
other reason.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.030
So with that said, one limiting
feature of this API

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.590
Dashboard is that you can only
see errors for an account

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.380
associated with an authenticated
user.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.280
The implications of this are
if you're using an MCA, a

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.740
Multi-Client Account, and you
are authenticated as the owner

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.910
of the MCA, then all your errors
that you make on behalf

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.040
of all your sub-accounts will
not actually show in the API

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.460
Dashboard for those
sub-accounts.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.400
Rather, it'll show up in the
API Dashboard for the MCA

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.630
account because that's the
account directly associated

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.190
with the authenticated
user, right?

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.260
So there are a few paths that
we're considering taking, and

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
I wanted to hear your feedback,
Andrew, on what

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.060
would be helpful for you in what
you've seen with the API

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.660
Dashboard so far.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.420
And what you think you could use
and what you think really

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.080
wouldn't be helpful.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.080
So I'll read them off one by
one, and you can comment one

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.990
by one, if you want.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.210
Or you can tell me
just to go on.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:30.750
So the first would be seeing
errors in a sub-account

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.480
regardless of who the
authenticated user was.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.190
So that would be errors either
made from the parent or from

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.120
an administrator for
that sub-account.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.110
So it would be sort of a
mix of different users.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.590
I'm assuming most accounts that
are managed by MCAs don't

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.641
have more than one authenticated
account making

00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:54.720
requests [INAUDIBLE],
but it's possible.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.322
So what are your thoughts
on that?

00:05:57.322 --> 00:06:04.130
ANDREW LAMONICA: Well, for me,
it doesn't really matter.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.570
Because I have the same code
running, sending all the

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.110
requests, so it's actually good
for me to have it all

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.220
rolled up into one.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.200
I can see if there's a problem
across all the--

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.413
DAN HERMES: So that
won't go away.

00:06:16.413 --> 00:06:17.663
ANDREW LAMONICA: [INAUDIBLE]
--code.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.110
I can see where some people
who might have different

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.770
authenticated users, that
may be useful to them.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.290
Although I think even probably
most of the MCAs are going to

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.170
be running the same code
for all of their--

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.490
DAN HERMES: Right.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.290
So I acknowledge that.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.570
We acknowledge that.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.160
So the thought would not be
that getting to see a

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.950
different sub-account would be
able to help you analyze a

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.130
different set of code
that's running.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.520
Rather, maybe there's something
wrong with the

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.900
settings for that account or
something like that, and you

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.600
have a specific sub-account
where you're having issues.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.280
Right now, through your MCA,
you can't filter by

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.150
sub-account, and that's sort
of the goal there.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.390
The other one is more of a
secondary thing, that being

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.870
that you could see requests
across all

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.120
authenticated users.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.560
The reason I mentioned it at all
is just because it could

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.270
throw you off if you did have
another authenticated user.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.680
OK.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.750
So it sounds like not that
useful to you, but you think

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.050
it might be useful for others.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.870
ANDREW LAMONICA: Yeah.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.063
Maybe people that have varying
degrees of data quality.

00:07:26.063 --> 00:07:29.630
I've knocked out most of the
data quality error messages

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.070
that come up in there, but I
could see if people have data

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:42.900
coming from different sources,
they might want to know if one

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.020
sub-account was responsible
for most of their

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:45.990
data quality errors.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.670
That could be a useful
statistic.

00:07:51.448 --> 00:07:53.370
DAN HERMES: Caroline, do you
have any thoughts on that?

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.995
Looks like she's either
not paying attention

00:08:01.995 --> 00:08:04.360
or not miced up.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.120
That's OK.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:10.680
So, the other one is really
similar to this one, except it

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.880
would be a filter within the MCA
View or some similar thing

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.900
to this, where you can see
requests that you made

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.970
directly from your authenticated
account, but

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.140
filter based on sub-account.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.200
So, we don't really need
to discuss it.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.415
We pretty much discussed that
sort of functionality.

00:08:32.415 --> 00:08:34.439
ANDREW LAMONICA: Caroline's
in the chat, by the way.

00:08:34.439 --> 00:08:36.159
DAN HERMES: Oh, she is?

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.400
I see that now.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.490
"Sorry, mic's not working.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:42.809
Busted my headset yesterday."
That's OK.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:44.710
So another one would be--

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.380
let me see.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:09:00.130
So this first option that I
brought up about being able to

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.680
see errors for a specific
sub-account irrespective of

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.270
the authenticated user, the
other one would just be an

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:11.470
extension of that, where you
could create filter groups.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.590
So either this sub-account, or
this sub-account, or this

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.460
sub-account.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.890
If you had, let's say, all your
Canadian accounts or--

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.930
that's a bad example, because
Canada's not supported there.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.720
But all your US accounts, or
all your Great Britain

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.460
accounts, or something
like this.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.370
What do you think about
something like that, in

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.280
comparison?

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.760
Do you think that's something
you could use

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.010
or you would use?

00:09:36.969 --> 00:09:39.040
ANDREW LAMONICA: I'm not the
right one to ask, because it's

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.460
functionally equivalent for
me, because we pretty much

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.460
have one account per country.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.690
DAN HERMES: Cool.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.470
Oh, that's right.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:53.352
Well, you guys don't do
sub-accounts based on seller?

00:09:53.352 --> 00:09:54.683
ANDREW LAMONICA: No.

00:09:54.683 --> 00:10:01.010
We talked about doing that at
one point, and I think there

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:05.520
was an issue with too many
sellers, and they didn't want

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.810
to mix both, like a
rollup account and

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.060
individual seller accounts.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.900
I mean, we would definitely be
open to going by seller, but

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.385
we have a lot of sellers.

00:10:21.385 --> 00:10:24.870
DAN HERMES: So it sounds like
you guys already considered

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.850
the common case, but the
common case for other

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:31.010
marketplaces that do that is,
let's say they have a quota of

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:35.340
x sub-accounts in a certain
country, right?

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.430
Then they have x minus 1
sub-accounts, and then their

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:45.521
last sub-account is just a
spillover for smaller sellers.

00:10:45.521 --> 00:10:47.070
ANDREW LAMONICA: Yeah.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:47.770
That's something--

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.300
I think I talked to Ari about
that, maybe, a while back.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.580
And I can't remember
what the--

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.850
there was some reason that that
wasn't good for everybody

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:58.410
at that time.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:02.390
But we would definitely be open
to looking at that again.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.690
It would certainly help narrow
down quality issues.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.240
Right now, I just kind of, like,
I have some code to kind

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.920
of keeps an eye on sellers that
have too many quality

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.470
issues and just doesn't
send them anymore.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:20.230
But that would be easier if
they have a sub-account.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.965
It would just be like, no
more for those guys.

00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:24.900
DAN HERMES: Exactly.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.510
So Caroline, what he's
mentioning as you're

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:34.210
considering your move to MCA,
having multiple sellers coming

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.880
through the same account can be
an issue in that one of the

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.870
seller's data quality issues
can spoil the party for

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.810
everyone else.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.660
So if you're able to saddle them
in their own sub-account,

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.370
then those issues only affect
that sub-account rather than

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.410
the entire country account
in the case of Andrew.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.020
CAROLINE: Well, if we are
doing separate merchant

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.880
accounts-- you can hear
me now, right?

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.480
DAN HERMES: Yep.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:57.710
CAROLINE: OK.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.170
So if we were getting separate
merchant accounts and client

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.640
authentication versus OAuth,
that would be irrelevant.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.440
DAN HERMES: Yeah.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.690
Authentication's irrelevant,
whether using--

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.920
CAROLINE: All our merchants
have separate accounts,

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.840
anyway, so I don't think
that's an issue.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.620
DAN HERMES: Yes.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.950
I was just saying in the MCA
case, that would be something

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:16.320
to consider.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.200
CAROLINE: They denied me, so I
was hoping you were going to

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.180
look into that.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:20.900
Did you see that?

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.445
I sent it along to you?

00:12:22.445 --> 00:12:23.340
DAN HERMES: What's that?

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.170
CAROLINE: They denied the MCA
account, and I sent that to

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.736
you last week?

00:12:27.736 --> 00:12:29.580
DAN HERMES: It got reapproved.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:35.250
We can take this off the
Hangout, because I did have

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.580
some other questions
for you about that.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.490
CAROLINE: OK, cool.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:42.885
DAN HERMES: Yeah, there was some
miscommunication there.

00:12:42.885 --> 00:12:45.810
CAROLINE: It took me a couple
days, because I was concerned

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.730
about which email address
we had signed up with.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.160
So it's probable that
the couple of days

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.680
lag didn't help things.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.670
DAN HERMES: Yeah, let's connect
after this Hangout.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.710
I think I'm just going to end
early if you guys don't have

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:57.960
anymore questions.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.180
Any questions?

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:08.240
ANDREW LAMONICA: I'm reading
your Google I/O

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.820
summaries right now.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.350
That'll be pretty cool.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:13.140
DAN HERMES: Yeah, it
should be cool.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.270
We got some cool demos prepared,
and the first talk,

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:21.256
Andrew, you may be a
little bored in.

00:13:21.256 --> 00:13:23.930
But the second one is definitely
going to be a lot

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.600
of brand spanking new stuff.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.410
I'll be speaking in the first
one that you might consider

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:32.350
going, but I try not to be a
boring speaker, so we'll see

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.030
what happens.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.180
ANDREW LAMONICA: Well, you can
always give away some cool

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.430
stuff or something.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:37.800
DAN HERMES: Sure, sure.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.490
CAROLINE: [? He's always ?]
asking for swag.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.660
I can't believe this.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.264
Unabashedly asking for
swag all the time.

00:13:43.264 --> 00:13:48.690
DAN HERMES: Oh, it's common
practice from our communities.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.400
ANDREW LAMONICA: Just remember
to link to those from the

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.205
email list when they get
posted on YouTube.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.920
It's kind of hard to find
the Google I/O videos.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.940
I don't know if I'm just bad
at searching or something.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.490
DAN HERMES: I'll probably start
having a dedicated page

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:12.240
in the documentation to videos
and presentations

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.460
and things like that.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.770
We actually have a Google
Shopping Channel now on the

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.050
Google Developer's Live YouTube
account, and I can

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.770
post that to the forum.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.790
The demo tool is now hosted on a
separate app engine instance

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:30.840
from developers.google.com, and
I've started putting slide

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.760
decks in that instance
as well.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.820
So there's a lot of good
resources from the talks and

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:43.350
the presentations we give that
can be pulled into one easy to

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.710
navigate place.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.090
Well, guys, it was nice
talking to you.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.940
I hope you've enjoyed your
three day weekend.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:57.310
And one last announcement, which
I will also make via the

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:59.550
forum and via Google+.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:00.800
We're going to move Tuesdays.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.990
This Hangout is part of a
larger effort by all of

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:10.850
Developer Relations at Google,
and I picked Wednesdays

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.180
because it was the middle
of the week, and no

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:13.970
other reason at all.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.110
It wasn't more convenient
for me, wasn't less

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:16.890
convenient for me.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:21.640
It was just far from Monday and
far from Friday, you know?

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.330
So we're going to move to
Tuesdays because of this big

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.290
pileup of some of the other
teams. And so, the next one

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:31.680
will be, instead of in 14 days,
it will be in 13 days,

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.055
which is June--

00:15:33.055 --> 00:15:35.500
I don't know--

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.410
let me look.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:39.990
June 5.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:43.560
So that's actually the day
before my one year

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.360
anniversary at Google.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.070
So June 5, I will see you guys,
and we will likely have

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:57.430
somebody from Ads and AdWords
with us as a guest. So I did

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.940
take into consideration some
of the suggestions you had

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.450
last time, Andrew, when we met
on May 16, and have gotten

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.015
some interest from some PMs
and some folks in AdWords,

00:16:07.015 --> 00:16:08.700
some folks in Ops.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:13.420
And so our first guest next
time, June 5, will likely be

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.620
one of the folks from Ads.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.760
All right?

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.660
ANDREW LAMONICA: Sweet.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.210
DAN HERMES: All right.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:17.980
See you guys.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.450
Have a good one.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.392
ANDREW LAMONICA: See you.

00:16:19.392 --> 00:16:19.790
CAROLINE: See you.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:20.080
Thank you.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.330
DAN HERMES: Sure.
