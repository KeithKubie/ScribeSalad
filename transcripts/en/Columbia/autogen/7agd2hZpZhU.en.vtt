00:14:57.269 --> 00:15:02.150 align:start position:0%
that so I think that what what we're

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
really trying to do in this area is say
 

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.620 align:start position:0%
really trying to do in this area is say
that<00:15:02.399><c> when</c><00:15:02.519><c> you</c><00:15:02.640><c> come</c><00:15:02.850><c> together</c><00:15:03.000><c> around</c><00:15:03.360><c> a</c>

00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:22.019 align:start position:0%
