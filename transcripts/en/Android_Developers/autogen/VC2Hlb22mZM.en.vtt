just like us so we really want you to
 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.420
just like us so we really want you to
think about reducing any background

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430

to be some cases like that we want you
 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.540
to be some cases like that we want you
to really think hard about deferring it

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550
to really think hard about deferring it

what's called a foreground service this

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:42.100
what's called a foreground service this
 

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.189
what's called a foreground service this
is this is a service that has to have a

is this is a service that has to have a
 

00:10:44.199 --> 00:10:46.470
is this is a service that has to have a
persistent notification and such a

this service will retain its network
 

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.019
this service will retain its network

and app standby combined together can

00:12:02.009 --> 00:12:02.019
and app standby combined together can
 

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:04.259
and app standby combined together can
increase the standby battery life of a

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:04.269
increase the standby battery life of a
 

00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:07.559
increase the standby battery life of a
Nexus 9 tablet almost twice and so the

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:07.569
Nexus 9 tablet almost twice and so the
 

00:12:07.569 --> 00:12:09.929
Nexus 9 tablet almost twice and so the
battery life almost doubled there and we

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:09.939
battery life almost doubled there and we
 

00:12:09.939 --> 00:12:13.079
battery life almost doubled there and we
also saw up to 30% average improvement

00:12:13.079 --> 00:12:13.089
also saw up to 30% average improvement
 

00:12:13.089 --> 00:12:15.509

clearly those an app standby are very

00:12:21.749 --> 00:12:21.759
clearly those an app standby are very
 

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:23.579
clearly those an app standby are very
important features and and these

00:12:23.579 --> 00:12:23.589
important features and and these
 

00:12:23.589 --> 00:12:27.179
important features and and these
principles do seem to work but I'm still

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:27.189
principles do seem to work but I'm still
 

00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:29.340
principles do seem to work but I'm still
thinking about one thing these cases

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:29.350
thinking about one thing these cases
 

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.559
thinking about one thing these cases
make sense when I'm not using my device

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:31.569
make sense when I'm not using my device
 

00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:34.110
make sense when I'm not using my device
or the apps that I'm not using but what

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.120
or the apps that I'm not using but what
 

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.519
or the apps that I'm not using but what
I'm actually walking around with my

using all of the apps on my phone yeah

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000
using all of the apps on my phone yeah
 

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.539
using all of the apps on my phone yeah
that's right it turns out that most of

00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:42.549
that's right it turns out that most of
 

00:12:42.549 --> 00:12:44.100
that's right it turns out that most of
the time our devices aren't stationary

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:44.110
the time our devices aren't stationary
 

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.169
the time our devices aren't stationary
right we we have them in our hands or in

00:12:46.169 --> 00:12:46.179
right we we have them in our hands or in
 

00:12:46.179 --> 00:12:47.999
right we we have them in our hands or in
our pockets and we're moving about the

00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:48.009
our pockets and we're moving about the
 

00:12:48.009 --> 00:12:50.129
our pockets and we're moving about the
world doing what we need to do so we

00:12:50.129 --> 00:12:50.139
world doing what we need to do so we
 

00:12:50.139 --> 00:12:51.749
world doing what we need to do so we
wanted to bring the power of those the

00:12:51.749 --> 00:12:51.759
wanted to bring the power of those the
 

00:12:51.759 --> 00:12:53.519
wanted to bring the power of those the
the the battery gains of doze to that

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:53.529
the the battery gains of doze to that
 

00:12:53.529 --> 00:12:55.199
the the battery gains of doze to that
situation as well and that's why we're

00:12:55.199 --> 00:12:55.209
situation as well and that's why we're
 

00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:56.730
situation as well and that's why we're
extending doze in the Android and

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:56.740
extending doze in the Android and
 

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.410
extending doze in the Android and
release so let's take a look at how

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:58.420
release so let's take a look at how
 

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.559
release so let's take a look at how
that's going to work again think of

00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:01.569
that's going to work again think of
 

00:13:01.569 --> 00:13:03.569
that's going to work again think of
these orange bars as background activity

00:13:03.569 --> 00:13:03.579
these orange bars as background activity
 

00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:05.490
these orange bars as background activity
and at some point you turn the screen

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:05.500
and at some point you turn the screen
 

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.259
and at some point you turn the screen
off and you put the phone in your pocket

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:07.269
off and you put the phone in your pocket
 

00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:08.870
off and you put the phone in your pocket
so it's not being charged right now

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880
so it's not being charged right now
 

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.199
so it's not being charged right now
well shortly after that and this time on

00:13:12.199 --> 00:13:12.209
well shortly after that and this time on
 

00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:13.879
well shortly after that and this time on
the order of minutes so shortly after

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:13.889
the order of minutes so shortly after
 

00:13:13.889 --> 00:13:15.980
the order of minutes so shortly after
that the first sir phase of dose kicks

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:15.990
that the first sir phase of dose kicks
 

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.819
that the first sir phase of dose kicks
in and now this is a a lighter gentler

00:13:18.819 --> 00:13:18.829
in and now this is a a lighter gentler
 

00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:20.990
in and now this is a a lighter gentler
doze and what you saw with marshmallow

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000
doze and what you saw with marshmallow
 

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.999
doze and what you saw with marshmallow
in that it's only going to restrict the

00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:23.009
in that it's only going to restrict the
 

00:13:23.009 --> 00:13:25.100
in that it's only going to restrict the
applications network access and any of

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:25.110
applications network access and any of
 

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:26.860
applications network access and any of
this jobs and sinks will get deferred

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:26.870
this jobs and sinks will get deferred
 

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.790
this jobs and sinks will get deferred
when do they get deferred - you might

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800
when do they get deferred - you might
 

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.860
when do they get deferred - you might
ask to the next maintenance window so

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:30.870
ask to the next maintenance window so
 

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.269
ask to the next maintenance window so
sort of the familiar maintenance window

00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279
sort of the familiar maintenance window
 

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:34.879
sort of the familiar maintenance window
and those repeated cycle will ensue

00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:34.889
and those repeated cycle will ensue
 

00:13:34.889 --> 00:13:36.230
and those repeated cycle will ensue
after that so long as the screen

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240
after that so long as the screen
 

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.120
after that so long as the screen
continues to be off and again the idea

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:38.130
continues to be off and again the idea
 

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.769
continues to be off and again the idea
here is that we're balancing battery

00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779
here is that we're balancing battery
 

00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:42.829
here is that we're balancing battery
life with freshness of content and in

00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839
life with freshness of content and in
 

00:13:42.839 --> 00:13:44.090
life with freshness of content and in
the maintenance windows these

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.100
the maintenance windows these
 

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.829
the maintenance windows these
restrictions are lifted to allow any

00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839
restrictions are lifted to allow any
 

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:49.220
restrictions are lifted to allow any
pending activity to resume and all this

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:49.230
pending activity to resume and all this
 

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.319
pending activity to resume and all this
will end when the screen comes on or you

00:13:51.319 --> 00:13:51.329
will end when the screen comes on or you
 

00:13:51.329 --> 00:13:53.499
will end when the screen comes on or you
plug in the device as you would expect

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:53.509
plug in the device as you would expect
 

00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:56.600
plug in the device as you would expect
okay so let's quickly review the dough's

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:56.610
okay so let's quickly review the dough's
 

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.829
okay so let's quickly review the dough's
that we just talked about in marshmallow

00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839
that we just talked about in marshmallow
 

00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:00.740
that we just talked about in marshmallow
and figure out how this extended dough's

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:00.750
and figure out how this extended dough's
 

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.030
and figure out how this extended dough's
that I talked about will work with the

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040
that I talked about will work with the
 

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.050
that I talked about will work with the
dough's that I talked about in

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.060
dough's that I talked about in
 

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.639
dough's that I talked about in
marshmallow so for that we're going to

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:04.649
marshmallow so for that we're going to
 

00:14:04.649 --> 00:14:06.559
marshmallow so for that we're going to
zoom into this this red box on the

00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:06.569
zoom into this this red box on the
 

00:14:06.569 --> 00:14:08.930
zoom into this this red box on the
screen okay let's take a look at what

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:08.940
screen okay let's take a look at what
 

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.059
screen okay let's take a look at what
happens so as you would expect the

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:11.069
happens so as you would expect the
 

00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:13.189
happens so as you would expect the
device is stationary it's on battery and

00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199
device is stationary it's on battery and
 

00:14:13.199 --> 00:14:14.569
device is stationary it's on battery and
it's screen off but the amount of time

00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:14.579
it's screen off but the amount of time
 

00:14:14.579 --> 00:14:16.100
it's screen off but the amount of time
hasn't passed yet for dough's to trigger

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:16.110
hasn't passed yet for dough's to trigger
 

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.410
hasn't passed yet for dough's to trigger
only only a few minutes have passed at

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420
only only a few minutes have passed at
 

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.420
only only a few minutes have passed at
this point this extended doze or this

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:20.430
this point this extended doze or this
 

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:21.769
this point this extended doze or this
lighter gentler version of doze will

00:14:21.769 --> 00:14:21.779
lighter gentler version of doze will
 

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:24.769
lighter gentler version of doze will
kick in in the end release and you will

00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:24.779
kick in in the end release and you will
 

00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:26.540
kick in in the end release and you will
see that same pattern of doze and

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:26.550
see that same pattern of doze and
 

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.910
see that same pattern of doze and
maintenance window and at some point the

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920
maintenance window and at some point the
 

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.379
maintenance window and at some point the
device realize oh hey the device

00:14:30.379 --> 00:14:30.389
device realize oh hey the device
 

00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:31.819
device realize oh hey the device
actually has been stationary for quite

00:14:31.819 --> 00:14:31.829
actually has been stationary for quite
 

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:33.710
actually has been stationary for quite
some time and it's been stationary for

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720
some time and it's been stationary for
 

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.480
some time and it's been stationary for
the amount of time required for doze to

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:35.490
the amount of time required for doze to
 

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.309
the amount of time required for doze to
kick in and at that point just like it

00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:37.319
kick in and at that point just like it
 

00:14:37.319 --> 00:14:38.900
kick in and at that point just like it
does in marshmallow the full set of

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:38.910
does in marshmallow the full set of
 

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.199
does in marshmallow the full set of
those restrictions will kick in so at

00:14:42.199 --> 00:14:42.209
those restrictions will kick in so at
 

00:14:42.209 --> 00:14:43.519
those restrictions will kick in so at
that point applications again will lose

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:43.529
that point applications again will lose
 

00:14:43.529 --> 00:14:45.319
that point applications again will lose
weight clocks their alarms will get

00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:45.329
weight clocks their alarms will get
 

00:14:45.329 --> 00:14:46.819
weight clocks their alarms will get
deferred and there'll be no more GPS or

00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:46.829
deferred and there'll be no more GPS or
 

00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:49.040
deferred and there'll be no more GPS or

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:49.050
Wi-Fi scans because the device has been
 

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:53.809
Wi-Fi scans because the device has been
stationary great so we're very excited

00:14:53.809 --> 00:14:53.819
stationary great so we're very excited
 

00:14:53.819 --> 00:14:55.249
stationary great so we're very excited
about the battery life gains of this

00:14:55.249 --> 00:14:55.259
about the battery life gains of this
 

00:14:55.259 --> 00:14:57.439
about the battery life gains of this
extended doze but the even better news

00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:57.449
extended doze but the even better news

for all of you is if you've already

00:14:58.579 --> 00:14:58.589
for all of you is if you've already
 

00:14:58.589 --> 00:15:00.499
for all of you is if you've already
optimized your applications for doze and

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:00.509
optimized your applications for doze and
 

00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:02.389
optimized your applications for doze and
app standby you don't need to do too

00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399
app standby you don't need to do too
 

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:05.059

cool so we've been talking a lot about

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:20.760
cool so we've been talking a lot about
 

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.120
cool so we've been talking a lot about
background services and their impact on

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.130
background services and their impact on
 

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.010
background services and their impact on
battery life we're going to switch gears

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:25.020
battery life we're going to switch gears
 

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.870
battery life we're going to switch gears
a little bit and talk about background

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880
a little bit and talk about background
 

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.820
a little bit and talk about background
services and their impact on memory so

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:30.830
services and their impact on memory so
 

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.600
services and their impact on memory so
let's say you're trying to do something

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:32.610
let's say you're trying to do something
 

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.490
let's say you're trying to do something
on your phone and it's just really slow

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:34.500
on your phone and it's just really slow
 

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.690
on your phone and it's just really slow
and sluggish so you're trying to take a

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:35.700
and sluggish so you're trying to take a
 

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.310
and sluggish so you're trying to take a
picture of the camera and you miss that

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:37.320
picture of the camera and you miss that
 

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.200
picture of the camera and you miss that
moment because your phone was just too

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:39.210
moment because your phone was just too
 

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.970
moment because your phone was just too
slow and you know what I'm talking about

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:40.980
slow and you know what I'm talking about
 

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.040
slow and you know what I'm talking about
background services have an impact when

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:43.050
background services have an impact when
 

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.470
background services have an impact when
the screen is on as well and that's

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480
the screen is on as well and that's
 

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.880
the screen is on as well and that's
that's what we're going to focus on next

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:46.890
that's what we're going to focus on next
 

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.590
that's what we're going to focus on next
so again let's say you have an

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600
so again let's say you have an
 

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.700
so again let's say you have an
application you're trying to use that's

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:49.710
application you're trying to use that's
 

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:51.890
application you're trying to use that's
the top app here at any given time

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:51.900
the top app here at any given time
 

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.940
the top app here at any given time
there's there's a number of things

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:52.950
there's there's a number of things
 

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.260
there's there's a number of things
happening in the background

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:54.270
happening in the background
 

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.270
happening in the background
lots of lots of stuff happening in the

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:56.280
lots of lots of stuff happening in the
 

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.420
lots of lots of stuff happening in the
background services and that when the

00:15:59.420 --> 00:15:59.430
background services and that when the
 

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.370
background services and that when the
device enters a low memory situation or

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:01.380
device enters a low memory situation or
 

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.930
device enters a low memory situation or
if it just happens to be a low memory

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:02.940
if it just happens to be a low memory
 

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.480
if it just happens to be a low memory
device what happens is there's not a lot

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:05.490
device what happens is there's not a lot
 

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.130
device what happens is there's not a lot
of enough memory to run all that stuff

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:07.140
of enough memory to run all that stuff
 

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.420
of enough memory to run all that stuff
in the background while you're the

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:08.430
in the background while you're the
 

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:09.560
in the background while you're the
device while you're trying to use the

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:09.570
device while you're trying to use the
 

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.140
device while you're trying to use the
device with that thing in the top well

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:12.150
device with that thing in the top well
 

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.060
device with that thing in the top well
at that point Android is too busy trying

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:14.070
at that point Android is too busy trying
 

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.740
at that point Android is too busy trying
to swap applications in and out of

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:15.750
to swap applications in and out of
 

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.180
to swap applications in and out of
memory to let them do what they need to

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:17.190
memory to let them do what they need to
 

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:18.770
memory to let them do what they need to
do in the background which applies

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:18.780
do in the background which applies
 

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.030
do in the background which applies
pressure on the application you're

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040
pressure on the application you're
 

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.800
pressure on the application you're
actually trying to use and the net

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:21.810
actually trying to use and the net
 

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.390
actually trying to use and the net
result is that you get this frustrating

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:23.400
result is that you get this frustrating
 

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.550
result is that you get this frustrating
slow experience of the device so that's

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560
slow experience of the device so that's
 

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.310
slow experience of the device so that's
the problem you're trying to tackle but

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320
the problem you're trying to tackle but
 

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.020
the problem you're trying to tackle but
background work is pretty important so

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:30.030
background work is pretty important so
 

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.550
background work is pretty important so
let's figure out why background work is

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560
let's figure out why background work is
 

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.560
let's figure out why background work is
happening

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:32.570
happening
 

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.030
happening
one such trigger for background service

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040
one such trigger for background service
 

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.050
one such trigger for background service
is something called an implicit

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.060
is something called an implicit
 

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.960
is something called an implicit
broadcast a broadcast is just a signal

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:38.970
broadcast a broadcast is just a signal
 

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.130
broadcast a broadcast is just a signal
that gets sent out on the device

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:40.140
that gets sent out on the device
 

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.900
that gets sent out on the device
whenever something happens all right

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:41.910
whenever something happens all right
 

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.850
whenever something happens all right
remember something changes and the

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:43.860
remember something changes and the
 

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.530
remember something changes and the
implicit type of broadcast is the type

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:45.540
implicit type of broadcast is the type
 

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.850
implicit type of broadcast is the type
that gets sent to any app or any

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:46.860
that gets sent to any app or any
 

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.860
that gets sent to any app or any
application can listen to it versus the

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:48.870
application can listen to it versus the
 

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.390
application can listen to it versus the
explicit side which would be something

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:50.400
explicit side which would be something
 

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.690
explicit side which would be something
that gets sent to a specific application

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:52.700
that gets sent to a specific application
 

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.900
that gets sent to a specific application
what makes this particularly bad is that

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:55.910
what makes this particularly bad is that
 

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.160
what makes this particularly bad is that
often these broadcasts are listened to

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:58.170
often these broadcasts are listened to
 

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.750
often these broadcasts are listened to
the receivers for these broadcasts are

00:16:59.750 --> 00:16:59.760
the receivers for these broadcasts are
 

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.880
the receivers for these broadcasts are
declared in a static way in the in the

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:01.890
declared in a static way in the in the
 

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.950
declared in a static way in the in the
applications manifest file what that

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:03.960
applications manifest file what that
 

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.990
applications manifest file what that
means is that the application doesn't

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000
means is that the application doesn't
 

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.490
means is that the application doesn't
actually have to be running for it to

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:07.500
actually have to be running for it to
 

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.440
actually have to be running for it to
receive this broadcast and react to it

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:09.450
receive this broadcast and react to it
 

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.199
receive this broadcast and react to it
in fact a broadcast sent in this manner

00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:12.209
in fact a broadcast sent in this manner
 

00:17:12.209 --> 00:17:13.610
in fact a broadcast sent in this manner
would cause the applications that are

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620
would cause the applications that are
 

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.410
would cause the applications that are
not even running but listening for it to

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:15.420
not even running but listening for it to
 

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.390
not even running but listening for it to
be woken up brought into memory and

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400
be woken up brought into memory and
 

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.699
be woken up brought into memory and
react to it in some way and while

00:17:19.699 --> 00:17:19.709
react to it in some way and while
 

00:17:19.709 --> 00:17:21.890
react to it in some way and while
Android is too busy doing that the

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:21.900
Android is too busy doing that the
 

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.880
Android is too busy doing that the
application that you're actually trying

application that you're actually trying
 

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:25.240
application that you're actually trying
to use starts to be sluggish and slow

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:25.250
to use starts to be sluggish and slow
 

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.100

take a quick example of this a broadcast

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.110
take a quick example of this a broadcast
 

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:29.840
take a quick example of this a broadcast
called connectivity change this is a

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:29.850
called connectivity change this is a
 

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.000
called connectivity change this is a
broadcast that sends quite

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.010
broadcast that sends quite
 

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.520
broadcast that sends quite

connectivity change happens this
broadcast gets sent it turns out a lot

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:41.630
broadcast gets sent it turns out a lot
 

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:43.120
broadcast gets sent it turns out a lot
of applications listen to this broadcast

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:43.130
of applications listen to this broadcast
 

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.790
of applications listen to this broadcast
in a static way by declaring receivers

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:45.800
in a static way by declaring receivers
 

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.210
in a static way by declaring receivers
in the manifest file and so whenever

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:49.220
in the manifest file and so whenever
 

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.800
in the manifest file and so whenever
this broadcast gets sent lots and lots

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:50.810
this broadcast gets sent lots and lots
 

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:52.480
this broadcast gets sent lots and lots
of applications are woken up to perform

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:52.490
of applications are woken up to perform
 

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.430
of applications are woken up to perform
activity in the background and you get a

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440
activity in the background and you get a
 

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.830
activity in the background and you get a
frustrating experience on your device so

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:56.840
frustrating experience on your device so
 

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.760
frustrating experience on your device so
this is the problem we're trying to

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:57.770
this is the problem we're trying to
 

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:01.840
this is the problem we're trying to
solve so what do we do well we could

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:01.850
solve so what do we do well we could
 

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.220
solve so what do we do well we could
just get rid of background services and

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:03.230
just get rid of background services and
 

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:07.090
just get rid of background services and
implicit broadcast in Android all right

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:07.100
implicit broadcast in Android all right
 

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.830
implicit broadcast in Android all right
it's not that simple because background

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:08.840
it's not that simple because background
 

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.150
it's not that simple because background
background activity is actually pretty

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160
background activity is actually pretty
 

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:10.630
background activity is actually pretty
important

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640
important
 

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.870
important
so what we're envisioning here is that

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880
so what we're envisioning here is that
 

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.980
so what we're envisioning here is that
applications perform any background

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:14.990
applications perform any background
 

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.890
applications perform any background
activity using exclusively job scheduler

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:17.900
activity using exclusively job scheduler
 

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.190
activity using exclusively job scheduler
jobs right and they sort of reduce their

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200
jobs right and they sort of reduce their
 

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.050
jobs right and they sort of reduce their
reliance on background services and

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:23.060
reliance on background services and
 

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.640
reliance on background services and
statically declared receivers for

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:24.650
statically declared receivers for
 

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.650
statically declared receivers for
implicit broadcasts let's take a quick

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:26.660
implicit broadcasts let's take a quick
 

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.670
implicit broadcasts let's take a quick
look at what I mean right

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:27.680
look at what I mean right
 

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.650
look at what I mean right
so what we envision here is that

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:29.660
so what we envision here is that
 

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.330
so what we envision here is that
applications statically declared

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:31.340
applications statically declared
 

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.340
applications statically declared
implicit broadcast receivers would no

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:33.350
implicit broadcast receivers would no
 

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.980
implicit broadcast receivers would no
longer get woken up at one time declared

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:35.990
longer get woken up at one time declared
 

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.070
longer get woken up at one time declared
receivers would continue to work

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080
receivers would continue to work
 

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.030
receivers would continue to work
explicit broadcast receivers would

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:40.040
explicit broadcast receivers would
 

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.200
explicit broadcast receivers would
continue to work both declared

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:41.210
continue to work both declared
 

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.080
continue to work both declared
statically or at one time but the the

statically or at one time but the the
 

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.700
statically or at one time but the the
statically declared implicit broadcast

statically declared implicit broadcast
 

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:46.990
statically declared implicit broadcast
receivers would be the ones that are

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.000
receivers would be the ones that are
 

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.600
receivers would be the ones that are
specifically affected second for

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:49.610
specifically affected second for
 

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:50.890
specifically affected second for
background services we envision that

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:50.900
background services we envision that
 

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.210
background services we envision that
apps are no longer running background

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:52.220
apps are no longer running background
 

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.860
apps are no longer running background
services or dependent on that for any

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:53.870
services or dependent on that for any
 

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.840
services or dependent on that for any
kind of background execution now I set

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:55.850
kind of background execution now I set
 

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.220
kind of background execution now I set
background execution is important and

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:57.230
background execution is important and
 

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:58.030
background execution is important and
for that

00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:58.040
for that
 

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.770
for that
we want developers to use job scheduler

00:18:59.770 --> 00:18:59.780
we want developers to use job scheduler
 

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.800
we want developers to use job scheduler
jobs now foreground services will still

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:02.810
jobs now foreground services will still
 

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.540
jobs now foreground services will still
continue to work so as your music will

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:04.550
continue to work so as your music will
 

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.790
continue to work so as your music will
still continue to play well thank you

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:06.800
still continue to play well thank you
 

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.770
still continue to play well thank you
for that Megan but all this sounds

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:08.780
for that Megan but all this sounds
 

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.810
for that Megan but all this sounds
pretty scary these are pretty big

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:10.820
pretty scary these are pretty big
 

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.270
pretty scary these are pretty big
changes are they coming in n do we need

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280
changes are they coming in n do we need
 

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.520
changes are they coming in n do we need
to change all of our apps in time for n

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:15.530
to change all of our apps in time for n
 

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:19.000
to change all of our apps in time for n
which is very soon it's not coming in n

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:19.010
which is very soon it's not coming in n
 

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.250
which is very soon it's not coming in n
but you need to change your app soon so

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:21.260
but you need to change your app soon so
 

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.930
but you need to change your app soon so
today we're just giving a preview of

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:22.940
today we're just giving a preview of
 

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.910
today we're just giving a preview of
what we envision to be the future of

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:24.920
what we envision to be the future of
 

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.560
what we envision to be the future of
Android where we think Android is going

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:26.570
Android where we think Android is going
 

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.540
Android where we think Android is going
with respect to background activity we

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:28.550
with respect to background activity we
 

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.160
with respect to background activity we
know that background activity plays a

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:30.170
know that background activity plays a
 

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.380
know that background activity plays a
huge factor in both battery life and the

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:32.390
huge factor in both battery life and the
 

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.050
huge factor in both battery life and the
OD overall performance of the system so

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:35.060
OD overall performance of the system so
 

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.190
OD overall performance of the system so
this is sort of where we are going and

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200
this is sort of where we are going and
 

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.350
this is sort of where we are going and
and we're planning to launch these when

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:38.360
and we're planning to launch these when
 

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.520
and we're planning to launch these when
we think they're going to be ready in

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:39.530
we think they're going to be ready in
 

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.290
we think they're going to be ready in
some future release and they'll apply to

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:41.300
some future release and they'll apply to
 

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.770
some future release and they'll apply to
the apps that target that release

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:42.780
the apps that target that release
 

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.080
the apps that target that release
in the end release we want to give you

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:45.090
in the end release we want to give you
 

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:46.850
in the end release we want to give you
tools to start testing your applications

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:46.860
tools to start testing your applications
 

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.830
tools to start testing your applications
under those conditions and giving us

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840
under those conditions and giving us
 

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.750
under those conditions and giving us
feedback on as you think about changing

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760
feedback on as you think about changing
 

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.640
feedback on as you think about changing
your applications to use jobscheduler

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:52.650
your applications to use jobscheduler
 

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.120
your applications to use jobscheduler
where you can we're also removing a few

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:56.130
where you can we're also removing a few
 

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.080
where you can we're also removing a few
broadcasts that we think are

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:57.090
broadcasts that we think are
 

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.450
broadcasts that we think are
particularly harmful in the system today

00:19:59.450 --> 00:19:59.460
particularly harmful in the system today
 

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.310
particularly harmful in the system today
and I'll talk about that in just a

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320
and I'll talk about that in just a
 

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.220
and I'll talk about that in just a
second so we have some adb commands you

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:04.230
second so we have some adb commands you
 

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:06.980
second so we have some adb commands you
can use today in the preview and apply

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:06.990
can use today in the preview and apply
 

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.420
can use today in the preview and apply
them to your applications start testing

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:08.430
them to your applications start testing
 

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.800
them to your applications start testing
to see what happens how your

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:09.810
to see what happens how your
 

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:10.970
to see what happens how your
applications behave under these

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:10.980
applications behave under these
 

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.980
applications behave under these
conditions and send us feedback

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:12.990
conditions and send us feedback
 

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:14.840
conditions and send us feedback
let us know what implicit broadcasts

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:14.850
let us know what implicit broadcasts
 

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.430
let us know what implicit broadcasts
that you're currently dependent on in

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440
that you're currently dependent on in
 

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.840
that you're currently dependent on in
your manifest files that you can't live

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:17.850
your manifest files that you can't live
 

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.850
your manifest files that you can't live
without what kind of background services

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:19.860
without what kind of background services
 

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.620
without what kind of background services
use cases you have that you can't move

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:21.630
use cases you have that you can't move
 

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.740
use cases you have that you can't move
over to job scheduler jobs ok actually

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:24.750
over to job scheduler jobs ok actually
 

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.480
over to job scheduler jobs ok actually
so think your specific question was

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:26.490
so think your specific question was
 

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.430
so think your specific question was
what's actually going to be changing in

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440
what's actually going to be changing in
 

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.390
what's actually going to be changing in
the end release so let me talk a little

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400
the end release so let me talk a little
 

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.850
the end release so let me talk a little
bit about that first I already talked

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:31.860
bit about that first I already talked
 

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.230
bit about that first I already talked
about connectivity change as being a

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240
about connectivity change as being a
 

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.690
about connectivity change as being a
particularly harmful broadcast so that's

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:35.700
particularly harmful broadcast so that's
 

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.890
particularly harmful broadcast so that's
one that we're getting rid of so

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:36.900
one that we're getting rid of so
 

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.270
one that we're getting rid of so
applications that are targeting the end

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280
applications that are targeting the end
 

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.030
applications that are targeting the end
release will no longer be woken up as a

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:41.040
release will no longer be woken up as a
 

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.920
release will no longer be woken up as a
result of this broadcast this means that

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:42.930
result of this broadcast this means that
 

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.750
result of this broadcast this means that
if you have declared a receiver for this

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760
if you have declared a receiver for this
 

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.370
if you have declared a receiver for this
broadcast in your manifest file that's

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.380
broadcast in your manifest file that's
 

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.230
broadcast in your manifest file that's
no longer going to work if you declare

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240
no longer going to work if you declare
 

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.180
no longer going to work if you declare
that runtime as I said runtime receivers

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:50.190
that runtime as I said runtime receivers
 

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:51.500
that runtime as I said runtime receivers
for broadcast will continue to work

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:51.510
for broadcast will continue to work
 

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:52.700
for broadcast will continue to work
because your application is already

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:52.710
because your application is already
 

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.710
because your application is already
running at that point and for other use

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720
running at that point and for other use
 

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.450
running at that point and for other use
cases we want you to use job scheduler

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460
cases we want you to use job scheduler
 

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.520
cases we want you to use job scheduler
and job scheduler already has Network

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:58.530
and job scheduler already has Network
 

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:03.140
and job scheduler already has Network
trigger semantics the other two are new

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:03.150
trigger semantics the other two are new
 

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.210
trigger semantics the other two are new
picture and new video these are two more

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:05.220
picture and new video these are two more
 

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.120
picture and new video these are two more
implicit broadcasts that are sent when

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:08.130
implicit broadcasts that are sent when
 

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:09.740
implicit broadcasts that are sent when
right when the user takes a picture and

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:09.750
right when the user takes a picture and
 

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.810
right when the user takes a picture and
they're sent by the camera and it'll and

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820
they're sent by the camera and it'll and
 

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.070
they're sent by the camera and it'll and
that's sort of the worst time and you

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080
that's sort of the worst time and you
 

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.300
that's sort of the worst time and you
want a lot of other background stuff to

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:14.310
want a lot of other background stuff to
 

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.830
want a lot of other background stuff to
be happening because you want to focus

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840
be happening because you want to focus
 

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.450
be happening because you want to focus
on taking that next picture or whatever

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:17.460
on taking that next picture or whatever
 

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.800
on taking that next picture or whatever
it is you're doing with your with the

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:18.810
it is you're doing with your with the
 

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.870
it is you're doing with your with the
camera application so starting with the

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880
camera application so starting with the
 

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.970
camera application so starting with the
end release all applications will no

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:22.980
end release all applications will no
 

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.380
end release all applications will no
longer be able to send or receive these

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:24.390
longer be able to send or receive these
 

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.090
longer be able to send or receive these
two broadcasts right so not just those

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.100
two broadcasts right so not just those
 

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.270
two broadcasts right so not just those
targeting in all applications and in

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280
targeting in all applications and in
 

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.010
targeting in all applications and in
fact these broadcasts are actually

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:31.020
fact these broadcasts are actually
 

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.200
fact these broadcasts are actually
pretty important because they unleash

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:33.210
pretty important because they unleash
 

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.000
pretty important because they unleash
some pretty cool use cases right so one

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.010
some pretty cool use cases right so one
 

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.890
some pretty cool use cases right so one
of them is uploading photos as soon as

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:36.900
of them is uploading photos as soon as
 

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.270
of them is uploading photos as soon as
you take a photo you want that uploaded

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280
you take a photo you want that uploaded
 

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.000
you take a photo you want that uploaded
but maybe you can wait right and so for

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:41.010
but maybe you can wait right and so for
 

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.160
but maybe you can wait right and so for
that we're actually expanding

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:43.170
that we're actually expanding
 

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.050
that we're actually expanding
jobscheduler to be able to be triggered

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:45.060
jobscheduler to be able to be triggered
 

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.600
jobscheduler to be able to be triggered
on content provider changes right so the

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:47.610
on content provider changes right so the
 

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.040
on content provider changes right so the
the media folder has a content provider

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:49.050
the media folder has a content provider
 

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.140
the media folder has a content provider
URI that could be the trigger whenever

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:51.150
URI that could be the trigger whenever
 

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:52.740
URI that could be the trigger whenever
something updates there

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:52.750
something updates there
 

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:56.310
something updates there
- to upload that photo and the cool

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320
- to upload that photo and the cool
 

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.290
- to upload that photo and the cool
thing about this is that now because

00:21:58.290 --> 00:21:58.300
thing about this is that now because
 

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.730
thing about this is that now because
you're using jobscheduler system can

00:21:59.730 --> 00:21:59.740
you're using jobscheduler system can
 

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.740
you're using jobscheduler system can
optimize when that action takes place it

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:01.750
optimize when that action takes place it
 

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.120
optimize when that action takes place it
doesn't have to happen immediately when

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:03.130
doesn't have to happen immediately when
 

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:04.230
doesn't have to happen immediately when
you're trying to take that next picture

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240
you're trying to take that next picture
 

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.940
you're trying to take that next picture
it can find the next opportune time to

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:05.950
it can find the next opportune time to
 

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.710
it can find the next opportune time to
do it depending on the memory conditions

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720
do it depending on the memory conditions
 

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.880
do it depending on the memory conditions
cool so I've been talking a lot about

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:11.890
cool so I've been talking a lot about
 

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.040
cool so I've been talking a lot about
job scheduler and how awesome it is but

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:14.050
job scheduler and how awesome it is but
 

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.090
job scheduler and how awesome it is but
just a show of hands how many of you

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:15.100
just a show of hands how many of you
 

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.720
just a show of hands how many of you
actually heard of job scheduler well

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:18.730
actually heard of job scheduler well
 

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.240
actually heard of job scheduler well
that's a good number but I also see a

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:21.250
that's a good number but I also see a
 

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.740
that's a good number but I also see a
lot of the hands that are not up so

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:22.750
lot of the hands that are not up so
 

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.450
lot of the hands that are not up so
maybe it's a good time for us to review

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:24.460
maybe it's a good time for us to review
 

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.090
maybe it's a good time for us to review
what this really important job scheduler

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:27.100
what this really important job scheduler
 

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.650
what this really important job scheduler
API really looks like and what the

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:28.660
API really looks like and what the
 

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.840
API really looks like and what the
features are because you made it sound

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:30.850
features are because you made it sound
 

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.930
features are because you made it sound
like very important ok let's do a quick

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:33.940
like very important ok let's do a quick
 

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.910
like very important ok let's do a quick
review of the job scheduler API so that

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:35.920
review of the job scheduler API so that
 

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.880
review of the job scheduler API so that
everyone here is on the same page the

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:38.890
everyone here is on the same page the
 

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.400
everyone here is on the same page the
job scheduler API think of it like a

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:41.410
job scheduler API think of it like a
 

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.530
job scheduler API think of it like a
wrapper around any background activity

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:43.540
wrapper around any background activity
 

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.250
wrapper around any background activity
so any background sink any background

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.260
so any background sink any background
 

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.080
so any background sink any background
activity that you have job scheduler is

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.090
activity that you have job scheduler is
 

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.480
activity that you have job scheduler is
the way to think about scheduling doors

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:51.490
the way to think about scheduling doors
 

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.960
the way to think about scheduling doors
and this is slightly a paradigm shift

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:54.970
and this is slightly a paradigm shift
 

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:56.760
and this is slightly a paradigm shift
where what you're doing is you're

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:56.770
where what you're doing is you're
 

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.280
where what you're doing is you're
letting Android know that I have some

00:22:59.280 --> 00:22:59.290
letting Android know that I have some
 

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.080
letting Android know that I have some
tasks that need to get done and you

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:01.090
tasks that need to get done and you
 

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:04.020
tasks that need to get done and you
specify certain triggers when Android

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:04.030
specify certain triggers when Android
 

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.510
specify certain triggers when Android
will schedule those jobs for you rather

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:06.520
will schedule those jobs for you rather
 

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.400
will schedule those jobs for you rather
than something that you try and take

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:08.410
than something that you try and take
 

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.710
than something that you try and take
care of yourself so let's take a couple

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720
care of yourself so let's take a couple
 

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.080
care of yourself so let's take a couple
of examples these triggers when you

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:13.090
of examples these triggers when you
 

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.960
of examples these triggers when you
request Android 2 to schedule your job

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:15.970
request Android 2 to schedule your job
 

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.690
request Android 2 to schedule your job
could be based on a certain time window

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:18.700
could be based on a certain time window
 

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.090
could be based on a certain time window
so say you have a job that's important

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:21.100
so say you have a job that's important
 

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.130
so say you have a job that's important
not exactly urgent it doesn't need to

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:23.140
not exactly urgent it doesn't need to
 

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.320
not exactly urgent it doesn't need to
happen right away you can tell Android

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:25.330
happen right away you can tell Android
 

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.110
happen right away you can tell Android
that schedule this job anytime within

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:28.120
that schedule this job anytime within
 

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.570
that schedule this job anytime within
the next 1 hour and what Android would

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:30.580
the next 1 hour and what Android would
 

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.210
the next 1 hour and what Android would
do is once many applications are using

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:33.220
do is once many applications are using
 

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.190
do is once many applications are using
the job scheduler API it now has this

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200
the job scheduler API it now has this
 

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.410
the job scheduler API it now has this
context about all the background

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:37.420
context about all the background
 

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.730
context about all the background
activity from the different apps that

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:38.740
activity from the different apps that
 

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.490
activity from the different apps that
needs to happen and it's going to do a

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:41.500
needs to happen and it's going to do a
 

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.590
needs to happen and it's going to do a
good job at scheduling your job at write

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600
good job at scheduling your job at write
 

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.810
good job at scheduling your job at write
the write at just the right time so that

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:45.820
the write at just the right time so that
 

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.080
the write at just the right time so that
the the efficiency of the CPU and the

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:49.090
the the efficiency of the CPU and the
 

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:51.690
the the efficiency of the CPU and the
networking radios can be maximized now

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:51.700
networking radios can be maximized now
 

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.360
networking radios can be maximized now
what you can also do is specify triggers

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:54.370
what you can also do is specify triggers
 

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:56.100
what you can also do is specify triggers
based on network connectivity or the

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:56.110
based on network connectivity or the
 

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:57.750
based on network connectivity or the
type of network that becomes available

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760
type of network that becomes available
 

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.690
type of network that becomes available
so say for example an application that's

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:00.700
so say for example an application that's
 

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.670
so say for example an application that's
uploading a whole bunch of photos or

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:02.680
uploading a whole bunch of photos or
 

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.779
uploading a whole bunch of photos or
videos

00:24:03.779 --> 00:24:03.789
videos
 

00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:05.489

that you might have on your phone now

00:24:05.489 --> 00:24:05.499
that you might have on your phone now
 

00:24:05.499 --> 00:24:07.619
that you might have on your phone now
it's a really good idea for such an app

00:24:07.619 --> 00:24:07.629
it's a really good idea for such an app
 

00:24:07.629 --> 00:24:12.210
it's a really good idea for such an app
to schedule or to specify a trigger for

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:12.220
to schedule or to specify a trigger for
 

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.340
to schedule or to specify a trigger for
a Wi-Fi network because what that's

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:14.350
a Wi-Fi network because what that's
 

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:16.200
a Wi-Fi network because what that's
going to do is Wi-Fi typically has more

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:16.210
going to do is Wi-Fi typically has more
 

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.719
going to do is Wi-Fi typically has more
bandwidth and it's less expensive in

00:24:18.719 --> 00:24:18.729
bandwidth and it's less expensive in
 

00:24:18.729 --> 00:24:21.450
bandwidth and it's less expensive in
terms of money and it costs power also

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:21.460
terms of money and it costs power also
 

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.999
terms of money and it costs power also
less power than the cellular radio so

00:24:23.999 --> 00:24:24.009
less power than the cellular radio so
 

00:24:24.009 --> 00:24:26.099
less power than the cellular radio so
that it can be a constraint or a trigger

00:24:26.099 --> 00:24:26.109
that it can be a constraint or a trigger
 

00:24:26.109 --> 00:24:29.279
that it can be a constraint or a trigger
that you can specify and finally the

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:29.289
that you can specify and finally the
 

00:24:29.289 --> 00:24:31.529
that you can specify and finally the
thing which which is my favorite which

00:24:31.529 --> 00:24:31.539
thing which which is my favorite which
 

00:24:31.539 --> 00:24:33.930
thing which which is my favorite which

the devices on charger you can specify
 

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.549
the devices on charger you can specify
that control to so you can tell that

00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559
that control to so you can tell that
 

00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:40.919

here's a job that I want to done want to
get done and trigger it when the device

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:43.720
get done and trigger it when the device
 

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.419
get done and trigger it when the device
is charging but not just that because

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:47.429
is charging but not just that because
 

00:24:47.429 --> 00:24:50.399
is charging but not just that because
that you know every time you plug in the

get enough charge out of the outlet
 

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:20.159
get enough charge out of the outlet
because you're spending all of that

00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:20.169
because you're spending all of that

make sure that this is a nice time to
schedule all of those background jobs

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320
schedule all of those background jobs
 

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.820
schedule all of those background jobs
and it will trigger your job right then

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:40.830
and it will trigger your job right then
 

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.889
and it will trigger your job right then
so we've seen that the job scheduler API

00:25:43.889 --> 00:25:43.899
so we've seen that the job scheduler API
 

00:25:43.899 --> 00:25:47.549
so we've seen that the job scheduler API
is really important and it will help you

00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:47.559
is really important and it will help you
 

00:25:47.559 --> 00:25:50.190
is really important and it will help you

so let's take a look at a quick example
 

00:25:59.979 --> 00:26:02.249
so let's take a look at a quick example
of how the job scheduler API works and

00:26:02.249 --> 00:26:02.259
of how the job scheduler API works and
 

00:26:02.259 --> 00:26:05.369
of how the job scheduler API works and
how easy it is in a few lines of code to

code sample of how you're going to use
the job scheduler API for something like

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:38.980
the job scheduler API for something like
 

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:42.240
the job scheduler API for something like
a new picture content provider update

new picture and you can schedule your
 

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:07.650
new picture and you can schedule your
job and that's it you're done so this is

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:07.660
job and that's it you're done so this is
 

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.420

again for background activity it's

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:00.040
again for background activity it's
 

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.680
again for background activity it's
available not only on Android but coming

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:01.690
available not only on Android but coming
 

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:05.820
available not only on Android but coming
soon also on iOS in it on Android free

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:05.830
soon also on iOS in it on Android free
 

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.530
soon also on iOS in it on Android free
lollipop to Google Play services will

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:07.540
lollipop to Google Play services will
 

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.510
lollipop to Google Play services will
act that's as the central scheduling

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520
act that's as the central scheduling
 

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.180
act that's as the central scheduling
driver on lollipop and onwards where job

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:12.190
driver on lollipop and onwards where job
 

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:13.650
driver on lollipop and onwards where job
schedule is available it will just use

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:13.660
schedule is available it will just use
 

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.720
schedule is available it will just use
job scheduler and then on iOS it will

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:15.730
job scheduler and then on iOS it will
 

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.540
job scheduler and then on iOS it will
use Grand Central Dispatch so that's

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:18.550
use Grand Central Dispatch so that's
 

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:19.770
use Grand Central Dispatch so that's
pretty cool let's take a quick example

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:19.780
pretty cool let's take a quick example
 

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.750
pretty cool let's take a quick example
of what job dispatcher looks like when

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760
of what job dispatcher looks like when
 

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.610
of what job dispatcher looks like when
you're performing background activity so

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:23.620
you're performing background activity so
 

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.050
you're performing background activity so
this is a quick example of creating a

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:25.060
this is a quick example of creating a
 

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.540
this is a quick example of creating a
simple job service that encapsulates a

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:27.550
simple job service that encapsulates a
 

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:28.650
simple job service that encapsulates a
code you need to perform in the

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:28.660
code you need to perform in the
 

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.150
code you need to perform in the
background right this is the whatever it

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:30.160
background right this is the whatever it
 

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.920
background right this is the whatever it
is your application needs to do in the

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:31.930
is your application needs to do in the
 

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.270
is your application needs to do in the
background you put in that do

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:33.280
background you put in that do
 

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.890
background you put in that do
function and then again very simple

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:36.900
function and then again very simple
 

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.560
function and then again very simple
create a job using the the job builder

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:40.570
create a job using the the job builder
 

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.470
create a job using the the job builder
from the dispatcher give it the the

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:43.480
from the dispatcher give it the the
 

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.580
from the dispatcher give it the the
service that you just created that's

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:44.590
service that you just created that's
 

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.170
service that you just created that's
wrapping around all the activity and

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:46.180
wrapping around all the activity and
 

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.060
wrapping around all the activity and
then in this case I'm just giving it a

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:48.070
then in this case I'm just giving it a
 

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.740
then in this case I'm just giving it a
constraint that I wanted to happen on an

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:49.750
constraint that I wanted to happen on an
 

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.440
constraint that I wanted to happen on an
unneeded network and then that's it and

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:52.450
unneeded network and then that's it and
 

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.020
unneeded network and then that's it and
schedule so pretty simple very easy to

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:55.030
schedule so pretty simple very easy to
 

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.580
schedule so pretty simple very easy to
use to perform any kind of background

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:56.590
use to perform any kind of background
 

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:59.640
use to perform any kind of background
activity so so as we've been talking a

00:30:59.640 --> 00:30:59.650
activity so so as we've been talking a
 

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.740
activity so so as we've been talking a
lot about very cool from platform

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:01.750
lot about very cool from platform
 

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.720
lot about very cool from platform
features a lot of API is that we have

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:03.730
features a lot of API is that we have
 

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.090
features a lot of API is that we have
introduced and they sound like they're

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:06.100
introduced and they sound like they're
 

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.440
introduced and they sound like they're
gonna have a huge impact but how can we

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:07.450
gonna have a huge impact but how can we
 

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:08.850
gonna have a huge impact but how can we
be sure that they're going to make any

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:08.860
be sure that they're going to make any
 

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:10.890
be sure that they're going to make any
difference that's right Megan it's not

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:10.900
difference that's right Megan it's not
 

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.540
difference that's right Megan it's not
an easy problem something that I've

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:12.550
an easy problem something that I've
 

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:15.090
an easy problem something that I've
personally suffered with or or struggled

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:15.100
personally suffered with or or struggled
 

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.040
personally suffered with or or struggled
with for a while and that is how do you

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:17.050
with for a while and that is how do you
 

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:18.720
with for a while and that is how do you
really make sure that your app is

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:18.730
really make sure that your app is
 

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:20.370
really make sure that your app is
behaving the way that you intend it to

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:20.380
behaving the way that you intend it to
 

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.800
behaving the way that you intend it to
be when it comes to all of these battery

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:22.810
be when it comes to all of these battery
 

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:26.760
be when it comes to all of these battery
optimizations or worse what if your app

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:26.770
optimizations or worse what if your app
 

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.100
optimizations or worse what if your app
is draining more battery than you think

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:29.110
is draining more battery than you think
 

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.680
is draining more battery than you think
it should how do you diagnose that so

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:31.690
it should how do you diagnose that so
 

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:35.040
it should how do you diagnose that so
let me take a quick poll how many of you

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:35.050
let me take a quick poll how many of you
 

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:36.960
let me take a quick poll how many of you
have tried diagnosing battery problems

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:36.970
have tried diagnosing battery problems
 

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:42.660
have tried diagnosing battery problems
on your applications okay but um now for

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:42.670
on your applications okay but um now for
 

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.490
on your applications okay but um now for
the others who did not raise their hands

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:44.500
the others who did not raise their hands
 

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.100
the others who did not raise their hands
was that because you find found it too

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:47.110
was that because you find found it too
 

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.690
was that because you find found it too
hard to diagnose battery problems

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:48.700
hard to diagnose battery problems
 

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.090
hard to diagnose battery problems
because I've been in that you know in

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:51.100
because I've been in that you know in
 

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.790
because I've been in that you know in
that same place well you can be honest

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:53.800
that same place well you can be honest
 

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:59.370
that same place well you can be honest
but so diagnosing of battery problems

00:31:59.370 --> 00:31:59.380
but so diagnosing of battery problems
 

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.750
but so diagnosing of battery problems
can be really tricky and I've felt that

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760
can be really tricky and I've felt that
 

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.480
can be really tricky and I've felt that
pain and good thing we have a tool and

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:03.490
pain and good thing we have a tool and
 

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.430
pain and good thing we have a tool and
we have some logs on the device that can

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440
we have some logs on the device that can
 

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.710
we have some logs on the device that can
help us do that in an easier fashion and

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:07.720
help us do that in an easier fashion and
 

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.000
help us do that in an easier fashion and
not have to struggle through all of the

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:09.010
not have to struggle through all of the
 

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:12.570
not have to struggle through all of the
pain let's look at some of the logs or

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:12.580
pain let's look at some of the logs or
 

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.100
pain let's look at some of the logs or
the types of logs that are present on

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:14.110
the types of logs that are present on
 

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.890
the types of logs that are present on
the device now Android maintains our

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:16.900
the device now Android maintains our
 

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.770
the device now Android maintains our
data structure in memory on all devices

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:19.780
data structure in memory on all devices
 

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.100
data structure in memory on all devices
and these this log is called battery

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:23.110
and these this log is called battery
 

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.520
and these this log is called battery
stats

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:23.530
stats
 

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:26.310
stats
now what battery stats is is it is a set

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320
now what battery stats is is it is a set
 

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.440
now what battery stats is is it is a set
of cumulative counters that go on

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:28.450
of cumulative counters that go on
 

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:31.530
of cumulative counters that go on
incrementing while your device is on

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:31.540
incrementing while your device is on
 

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.530
incrementing while your device is on
battery so since it's in memory and

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:34.540
battery so since it's in memory and
 

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.300
battery so since it's in memory and
these are cumulative counters that go on

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:36.310
these are cumulative counters that go on
 

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:37.830
these are cumulative counters that go on
increasing they need to get reset at

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840
increasing they need to get reset at
 

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.960
increasing they need to get reset at
some point and that point is when you

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:39.970
some point and that point is when you
 

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.850
some point and that point is when you
fully charge your device and you just

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:41.860
fully charge your device and you just
 

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.280
fully charge your device and you just
unplugged it so say for example you

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:44.290
unplugged it so say for example you
 

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:46.060
unplugged it so say for example you
charge your device overnight

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:46.070
charge your device overnight
 

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:47.770
charge your device overnight
and you unplugged it at 7 a.m. in the

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:47.780
and you unplugged it at 7 a.m. in the
 

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.110
and you unplugged it at 7 a.m. in the
morning and maybe it's about 10 and a

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.120
morning and maybe it's about 10 and a
 

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.080
morning and maybe it's about 10 and a
half hours since then if you take a bug

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:53.090
half hours since then if you take a bug
 

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.240
half hours since then if you take a bug
report on your device now then it would

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:55.250
report on your device now then it would
 

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:57.010
report on your device now then it would
contain the whole ten and a half hours

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:57.020
contain the whole ten and a half hours
 

00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:00.580
contain the whole ten and a half hours
worth of battery stats and counters

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:00.590
worth of battery stats and counters
 

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.290
worth of battery stats and counters
about various things happening on your

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:02.300
about various things happening on your
 

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.720
about various things happening on your
device that we think are relevant with

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:04.730
device that we think are relevant with
 

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.730
device that we think are relevant with
respect to battery life so things like

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:06.740
respect to battery life so things like
 

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.040
respect to battery life so things like
how long was the partial way clock held

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:09.050
how long was the partial way clock held
 

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:10.480
how long was the partial way clock held
on the device across all applications

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:10.490
on the device across all applications
 

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.750
on the device across all applications
and on an application basis or how much

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760
and on an application basis or how much
 

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.340
and on an application basis or how much
data was transferred over the mobile

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:15.350
data was transferred over the mobile
 

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:17.980
data was transferred over the mobile
network or the Wi-Fi network and what

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:17.990
network or the Wi-Fi network and what
 

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:20.410
network or the Wi-Fi network and what
you can see here is there's also a start

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:20.420
you can see here is there's also a start
 

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.000
you can see here is there's also a start
clock time which tells you exactly when

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:22.010
clock time which tells you exactly when
 

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.550
clock time which tells you exactly when
the stats were reset so this is really

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:24.560
the stats were reset so this is really
 

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.900
the stats were reset so this is really
useful when you're trying to look at

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:25.910
useful when you're trying to look at
 

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:29.020

the device is something that we call
 

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:39.700
the device is something that we call
battery history and what this is it is

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:39.710
battery history and what this is it is
 

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:42.490

this and what this tool would do is it

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:33.080
this and what this tool would do is it
 

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.720
this and what this tool would do is it
would take all of those logs that are

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:34.730
would take all of those logs that are
 

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:36.010
would take all of those logs that are
present the two logs that I just

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:36.020
present the two logs that I just
 

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.810
present the two logs that I just
mentioned that are present in the bug

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:37.820
mentioned that are present in the bug
 

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.700
mentioned that are present in the bug
report and it would help you look at

now shows you the battery level drop

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:05.180
now shows you the battery level drop
 

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:09.550
now shows you the battery level drop
from 73 to 72 and how long it take it

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560
from 73 to 72 and how long it take it
 

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.710
from 73 to 72 and how long it take it
took for the device to discharge from 73

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:11.720
took for the device to discharge from 73
 

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.550
took for the device to discharge from 73
to 72

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560
to 72
 

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.140
to 72
giving you an indication of what the

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:14.150
giving you an indication of what the
 

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:15.550
giving you an indication of what the
average discharge rate was during that

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:15.560
average discharge rate was during that
 

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.100
average discharge rate was during that
time and you can see all of the events

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:18.110
time and you can see all of the events
 

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.290
time and you can see all of the events
lined up nicely so you can actually

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:20.300
lined up nicely so you can actually
 

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.510
lined up nicely so you can actually
figure out when your device was

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:22.520
figure out when your device was
 

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.250
figure out when your device was
discharging rather fast what were the

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:24.260
discharging rather fast what were the
 

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.680
discharging rather fast what were the
events that were happening on the device

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:26.690
events that were happening on the device
 

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:29.260
events that were happening on the device
let me take you through another example

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:29.270
let me take you through another example
 

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.170
let me take you through another example
so say you have adopted or migrated your

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:32.180
so say you have adopted or migrated your
 

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.150
so say you have adopted or migrated your
app to you start using jobscheduler now

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160
app to you start using jobscheduler now
 

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.940
app to you start using jobscheduler now
how do you figure out whether when your

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:36.950
how do you figure out whether when your
 

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.920
how do you figure out whether when your
jobs are getting scheduled so in the

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:38.930
jobs are getting scheduled so in the
 

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.110
jobs are getting scheduled so in the
jobscheduler row you go on any one of

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:41.120
jobscheduler row you go on any one of
 

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.300
jobscheduler row you go on any one of
those events and if you're in a zoomed

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:43.310
those events and if you're in a zoomed
 

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:45.310
those events and if you're in a zoomed
out view it might collapse a bunch of

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:45.320
out view it might collapse a bunch of
 

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.370
out view it might collapse a bunch of
these little jobs that didn't last as

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:48.380
these little jobs that didn't last as
 

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.140
these little jobs that didn't last as
long but it will give you information

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:50.150
long but it will give you information
 

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.270
long but it will give you information
about how many jobs were run in that

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:52.280
about how many jobs were run in that
 

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.430
about how many jobs were run in that
particular small box and for how long

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:54.440
particular small box and for how long
 

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.920
particular small box and for how long
each of those jobs ran and you can zoom

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:56.930
each of those jobs ran and you can zoom
 

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:01.180
each of those jobs ran and you can zoom
in if you like so these it's a very

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:01.190
in if you like so these it's a very
 

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:03.760
in if you like so these it's a very
interactive and fun tool I have a lot of

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:03.770
interactive and fun tool I have a lot of
 

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:06.190
interactive and fun tool I have a lot of
fun playing with it and diagnosing all

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:06.200
fun playing with it and diagnosing all
 

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.020
fun playing with it and diagnosing all
the battery problems what I want you to

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:08.030
the battery problems what I want you to
 

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:12.760
the battery problems what I want you to
do is look at an example of doles in

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:12.770
do is look at an example of doles in
 

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.650
do is look at an example of doles in
action so we've been talking about the

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:14.660
action so we've been talking about the
 

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.810
action so we've been talking about the
doors mode in marshmallow that was

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:16.820
doors mode in marshmallow that was
 

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.420
doors mode in marshmallow that was
introduced and the more deeper the

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:19.430
introduced and the more deeper the
 

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:21.190
introduced and the more deeper the
lighter version of doors that was

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200
lighter version of doors that was
 

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.970
lighter version of doors that was
introduced in the end release so what

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:24.980
introduced in the end release so what
 

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.560
introduced in the end release so what
I'm showing you here is a bug report

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:26.570
I'm showing you here is a bug report
 

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.540
I'm showing you here is a bug report
that I uploaded to the battery store in

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:28.550
that I uploaded to the battery store in
 

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:30.610
that I uploaded to the battery store in
tool and the black line that you see

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:30.620
tool and the black line that you see
 

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.800
tool and the black line that you see
going down that's not exactly horizontal

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:32.810
going down that's not exactly horizontal
 

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:35.860
going down that's not exactly horizontal
that's your instantaneous battery level

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:35.870
that's your instantaneous battery level
 

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:38.170
that's your instantaneous battery level
so typically it would start off with

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:38.180
so typically it would start off with
 

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.640
so typically it would start off with
something high if you've started with a

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:39.650
something high if you've started with a
 

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.500
something high if you've started with a
hundred percent in this case I manually

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:41.510
hundred percent in this case I manually
 

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:44.320
hundred percent in this case I manually
reset the stats so it starts somewhere

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:44.330
reset the stats so it starts somewhere
 

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:47.080
reset the stats so it starts somewhere
around fifty percent and then what you

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:47.090
around fifty percent and then what you
 

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:50.050
around fifty percent and then what you
can't see is let's zoom into this little

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:50.060
can't see is let's zoom into this little
 

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:53.590
can't see is let's zoom into this little
area when your screen was on you can see

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:53.600
area when your screen was on you can see
 

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.630
area when your screen was on you can see
that the frequency of your jobs and

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640
that the frequency of your jobs and
 

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.880
that the frequency of your jobs and
things was fairly high all of the jobs

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:57.890
things was fairly high all of the jobs
 

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:00.160
things was fairly high all of the jobs
and and sinks were getting scheduled

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:00.170
and and sinks were getting scheduled
 

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:02.830
and and sinks were getting scheduled
fairly periodically but then after when

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:02.840
fairly periodically but then after when
 

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.720
fairly periodically but then after when
after the screen has been turned off for

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:04.730
after the screen has been turned off for
 

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:06.850
after the screen has been turned off for
a while what you see in the doors line

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:06.860
a while what you see in the doors line
 

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:10.030
a while what you see in the doors line
or the doors row in orange that's the

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.040
or the doors row in orange that's the
 

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.950
or the doors row in orange that's the
lighter version of doors kicking in so

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:11.960
lighter version of doors kicking in so
 

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.380
lighter version of doors kicking in so
some applications would lose network

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:14.390
some applications would lose network
 

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:16.540
some applications would lose network
access and you start to see that now

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:16.550
access and you start to see that now
 

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:19.240
access and you start to see that now
your jobs and your sinks are beginning

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:19.250
your jobs and your sinks are beginning
 

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:20.810
your jobs and your sinks are beginning
to get less and less

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:20.820
to get less and less
 

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.610
to get less and less
frequent and they're getting batched

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:22.620
frequent and they're getting batched
 

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.430
frequent and they're getting batched
together and fertile out after the

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440
together and fertile out after the
 

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.100
together and fertile out after the
device has had its screen off for a

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:28.110
device has had its screen off for a
 

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:30.410
device has had its screen off for a
while and it has been stationary you see

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:30.420
while and it has been stationary you see
 

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.450
while and it has been stationary you see
the device entering this deeper doze

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:32.460
the device entering this deeper doze
 

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.790
the device entering this deeper doze
mode which is shown in the blue row here

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800
mode which is shown in the blue row here
 

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.880
mode which is shown in the blue row here
and when that happens now we know that

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:37.890
and when that happens now we know that
 

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:39.680
and when that happens now we know that
the device is not being touched by the

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:39.690
the device is not being touched by the
 

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:42.110
the device is not being touched by the
user is not being used and that's an

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:42.120
user is not being used and that's an
 

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.940
user is not being used and that's an
opportunity for the jobscheduler api to

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:43.950
opportunity for the jobscheduler api to
 

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:46.010
opportunity for the jobscheduler api to
start throttling and and batching

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:46.020
start throttling and and batching
 

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.690
start throttling and and batching
together a lot of the activities so you

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:47.700
together a lot of the activities so you
 

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.930
together a lot of the activities so you
see that under the blue bar the job

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:50.940
see that under the blue bar the job
 

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.610
see that under the blue bar the job
scheduler and the sync manager frequency

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:52.620
scheduler and the sync manager frequency
 

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.770
scheduler and the sync manager frequency
is fairly infrequent and and they get

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:54.780
is fairly infrequent and and they get
 

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.380
is fairly infrequent and and they get
scheduled at you know during the

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:57.390
scheduled at you know during the
 

00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:00.350
scheduled at you know during the
maintenance windows now what's really

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:00.360
maintenance windows now what's really
 

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.780
maintenance windows now what's really
interesting is and this slide will help

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:02.790
interesting is and this slide will help
 

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:05.750
interesting is and this slide will help
you get a perspective on what uses the

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760
you get a perspective on what uses the
 

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.060
you get a perspective on what uses the
most power on your phones initially when

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:08.070
most power on your phones initially when
 

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:10.520
most power on your phones initially when
the screen was on my battery level was

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:10.530
the screen was on my battery level was
 

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:12.170
the screen was on my battery level was
discharging it really fast so you see

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:12.180
discharging it really fast so you see
 

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.010
discharging it really fast so you see
the slope of the line

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.020
the slope of the line
 

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.870
the slope of the line
that's my battery level going from 50 to

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880
that's my battery level going from 50 to
 

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.380
that's my battery level going from 50 to
maybe 30 very quickly and after the

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:18.390
maybe 30 very quickly and after the
 

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:20.690
maybe 30 very quickly and after the
screen has been turned off and the doors

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:20.700
screen has been turned off and the doors
 

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.400
screen has been turned off and the doors
mode has kicked in that's when you start

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:22.410
mode has kicked in that's when you start
 

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:23.900
mode has kicked in that's when you start
to see that now my battery is not

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:23.910
to see that now my battery is not
 

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:26.120
to see that now my battery is not

as the screen is turned off or turned
 

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.920
as the screen is turned off or turned
back on we see that the device exited

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:36.930
back on we see that the device exited
 

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.750
back on we see that the device exited
the doors mode and you go back to that

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:38.760
the doors mode and you go back to that

that's that's pretty cool issue so so

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:44.190
that's that's pretty cool issue so so
 

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:45.230
that's that's pretty cool issue so so
all that stuff we were talking about

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240
all that stuff we were talking about
 

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.360
all that stuff we were talking about

that is living proof that's pretty cool

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:52.010
that is living proof that's pretty cool
 

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.620
that is living proof that's pretty cool

the UI of the time line of events you
 

00:42:19.359 --> 00:42:22.140
the UI of the time line of events you
will see that in the job the job row or

applications will appear and all else
 

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.260
applications will appear and all else
will disappear so that can really get

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:31.270
will disappear so that can really get
 

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:34.230
will disappear so that can really get
you a visibility into how frequently

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240
you a visibility into how frequently
 

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.180
you a visibility into how frequently
your application was scheduling all of

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:36.190
your application was scheduling all of
 

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:39.900
your application was scheduling all of
these tasks so we found this tool to be

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:39.910
these tasks so we found this tool to be
 

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:42.480
these tasks so we found this tool to be
very useful but there is one case that

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:42.490
very useful but there is one case that
 

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:44.640
very useful but there is one case that
has been especially painful for me and

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:44.650
has been especially painful for me and
 

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:47.520
has been especially painful for me and
that is when you are developing in the

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:47.530
that is when you are developing in the
 

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:49.680
that is when you are developing in the
app or see you made a change in your app

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:49.690
app or see you made a change in your app
 

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:53.790
app or see you made a change in your app
and suddenly your device is discharging

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:53.800
and suddenly your device is discharging
 

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.099
and suddenly your device is discharging
very fast now I write perfect code I

00:42:56.099 --> 00:42:56.109
very fast now I write perfect code I
 

00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:58.650
very fast now I write perfect code I
never make mistakes but then my device

00:42:58.650 --> 00:42:58.660
never make mistakes but then my device
 

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.450
never make mistakes but then my device
is discharging fast what did I do and

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:00.460
is discharging fast what did I do and
 

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:04.440
is discharging fast what did I do and
and in this position more than I would

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:04.450
and in this position more than I would
 

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:07.290
and in this position more than I would
like to admit I'm sure a lot of us have

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:07.300
like to admit I'm sure a lot of us have
 

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.950
like to admit I'm sure a lot of us have
been in this situation for one or the

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960
been in this situation for one or the
 

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.839
been in this situation for one or the
other time and so for that what we have

00:43:12.839 --> 00:43:12.849
other time and so for that what we have
 

00:43:12.849 --> 00:43:15.000
other time and so for that what we have
is an Eevee comparison mode in the same

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:15.010
is an Eevee comparison mode in the same
 

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:17.280
is an Eevee comparison mode in the same
tone so what you can do is you can

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:17.290
tone so what you can do is you can
 

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:19.980
tone so what you can do is you can
upload to bug reports and if you have a

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:19.990
upload to bug reports and if you have a
 

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:22.260
upload to bug reports and if you have a
good case and you have a bad case then

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:22.270
good case and you have a bad case then
 

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:24.420
good case and you have a bad case then
what the tool will let you do is it will

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:24.430
what the tool will let you do is it will
 

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.250
what the tool will let you do is it will
highlight all the biggest differences

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:26.260
highlight all the biggest differences
 

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.770
highlight all the biggest differences
that it sees between these two bug

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:28.780
that it sees between these two bug
 

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:31.410
that it sees between these two bug
reports so say for example it's

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:31.420
reports so say for example it's
 

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:33.510
reports so say for example it's
comparing now file one versus file two

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520
comparing now file one versus file two
 

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.180
comparing now file one versus file two
and it's telling me that in file one it

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:36.190
and it's telling me that in file one it
 

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:39.510
and it's telling me that in file one it
has used 7.5 times more Wi-Fi data than

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520
has used 7.5 times more Wi-Fi data than
 

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.910
has used 7.5 times more Wi-Fi data than
the other and the screen of discharge

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920
the other and the screen of discharge
 

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.160
the other and the screen of discharge
rate on let's say the first one was less

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:44.170
rate on let's say the first one was less
 

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:45.989
rate on let's say the first one was less
than 2.5 times and a whole

00:43:45.989 --> 00:43:45.999
than 2.5 times and a whole
 

00:43:45.999 --> 00:43:48.179
than 2.5 times and a whole
lot of other good stuff I haven't shown

00:43:48.179 --> 00:43:48.189
lot of other good stuff I haven't shown
 

00:43:48.189 --> 00:43:50.429
lot of other good stuff I haven't shown
you all of the detail but if you upload

00:43:50.429 --> 00:43:50.439
you all of the detail but if you upload
 

00:43:50.439 --> 00:43:52.379
you all of the detail but if you upload
to bug reports it will automatically

00:43:52.379 --> 00:43:52.389
to bug reports it will automatically
 

00:43:52.389 --> 00:43:54.989
to bug reports it will automatically
normalize those two bug reports so see

00:43:54.989 --> 00:43:54.999
normalize those two bug reports so see
 

00:43:54.999 --> 00:43:56.429
normalize those two bug reports so see
if you have one bug report that was

00:43:56.429 --> 00:43:56.439
if you have one bug report that was
 

00:43:56.439 --> 00:43:57.989
if you have one bug report that was
taken for four hours and the other that

00:43:57.989 --> 00:43:57.999
taken for four hours and the other that
 

00:43:57.999 --> 00:44:00.239
taken for four hours and the other that
was at 2:00 it would automatically you

00:44:00.239 --> 00:44:00.249
was at 2:00 it would automatically you
 

00:44:00.249 --> 00:44:02.369
was at 2:00 it would automatically you
know normalize all of that and show you

00:44:02.369 --> 00:44:02.379
know normalize all of that and show you
 

00:44:02.379 --> 00:44:03.929
know normalize all of that and show you
a good comparison which can give you a

00:44:03.929 --> 00:44:03.939
a good comparison which can give you a
 

00:44:03.939 --> 00:44:05.759
a good comparison which can give you a
very good starting point as to what

00:44:05.759 --> 00:44:05.769
very good starting point as to what
 

00:44:05.769 --> 00:44:07.109
very good starting point as to what
actually changed on the device whether

accounted for this difference so that's

00:44:15.059 --> 00:44:15.069
accounted for this difference so that's
 

00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:17.759
accounted for this difference so that's
an interesting mode and to wrap up I'd

because it's close to about four to five

00:45:14.909 --> 00:45:14.919
because it's close to about four to five
 

00:45:14.919 --> 00:45:17.009
because it's close to about four to five
milliamps so there's several orders of
