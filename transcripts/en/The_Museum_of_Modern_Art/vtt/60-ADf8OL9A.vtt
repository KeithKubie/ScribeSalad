00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.500
I'm just wondering if you could

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.040
talk a little about the life of an artist

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.400
you've collaborated with so many great artists

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.940
whether they are traditional artists

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.180
or songwriters, dancers

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.520
 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.300
but the life of an artist

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.480
the life that you've led

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.800
very publicly, for the most part

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.800
and you've reflected in your films

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.760
I'm just wondering if you can comment on that

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.760
