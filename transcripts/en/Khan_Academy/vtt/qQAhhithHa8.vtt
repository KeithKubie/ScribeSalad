00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.140
Where we left off in the last
video, we were finding the

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.580
surface area of a torus,
or a doughnut shape.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.210
And we were doing it by
taking a surface integral.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.920
And in order to take a surface
integral, we had to find the

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.310
partial of our parameterization
with respect to s, and the

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.920
partial with respect to t, and
now we're ready to take

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.910
the cross product.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.940
And then we can take the
magnitude of the cross product.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.810
And then we can actually take
this double integral and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.820
figure out the surface area.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.670
So let's just do
it step by step.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.360
Here we could take the cross
product, which is not

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.330
a non-hairy operation.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.150
This is why you don't see many
surface integrals actually get

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.400
done, or many examples done.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.220
Let's take the cross product
of these two fellows.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.560
So the partial of r with
respect to s, crossed with--

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.720
in magenta-- the partial
of r with respect to t.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.610
This will be a little
bit of review of cross

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.390
products for you.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.070
You might remember this
is going to be equal

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.660
to the determinant.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.360
I'm going to write the
unit vectors up here.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.240
The first row is i, j, and k.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.630
And then the next 2 rows are
going to be-- let me do that in

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.760
that yellow color-- the next 2
rows are going to be the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.460
components of these guys.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.670
So let me copy and paste them.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.740
You have that right there.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.620
Copy and paste.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.050
Put that guy right there.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.930
Then you have this
fellow right there.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.140
Copy and paste.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.510
Put him right there.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.130
And then you got this
guy right here.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.350
This'll save us some time.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.160
Copy and paste.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.900
Put him right there.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.440
Then the last row is going to
be this guy's components.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.260
Copy and paste.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.720
Put him right here.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.680
Almost done.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.740
This guy-- copy and paste.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.870
Put him right there.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.890
Make sure we know that
these are separate terms.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.280
And finally, we don't have to
copy and paste it, but just

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.430
since we did for all of the
other terms, I'll do it

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.490
for that 0, as well.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.010
So the cross product of these
is literally the determinant

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.275
of this matrix right here.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.600
And so, just as a bit of
a refresher of taking

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.490
determinants, this is going to
be i times the subdeterminant

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.700
right here, if you cross out
this column and that row.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.350
So it's going to be equal to
i-- you're not used to seeing

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.770
the unit vector written first,
but we can switch the order

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.330
later-- times i times the
submatrix right here.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.290
If you cross out this
column and that row.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.370
So it's going to be this term
times 0-- which is just

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.490
0-- minus this term
times that term.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.930
So minus this term times this
term- the negative signs are

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.520
going to cancel out, so
this'll be positive.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.510
So it's just going to be i
times this term times this

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.240
term, without a negative
sign right there.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.850
So i times this term,
which is a cosine of s.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.630
It's really that term times
that term, minus that term

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.230
times that term, but the
negatives cancel out.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.370
That times that is 0.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.100
So that's how we can do this.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:14.230
It's a cosine of s times b plus
a cosine of s-- I'll just all

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.140
switch to the same
color-- sine of t.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.700
So we've got our i term
for the cross product.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.190
Now it's going to be minus j--
remember when you take the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.590
determinant, you actually have
this, kind of, you have to

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.060
checker board of
switching sines.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.370
So now it's going to be minus j
times-- and you cross out that

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.390
row and that column-- and it's
going to be this term times

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.000
this term-- which is just
0-- minus this term

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.160
times this term.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.770
And once again, when
you have-- oh, sorry.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.020
When you cross out this
column and that row.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.750
So it's going to be that
guy times that guy, minus

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.230
this guy times this guy.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.690
So it's going to be minus this
guy times this guy-- so it's

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.440
going to be-- let me
do it in yellow.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:11.980
So the negative times negative
that guy, b plus a cosine of s

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.680
cosine of t times this
guy, a cosine of s.

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.574
We'll clean it up
in a little bit.

00:04:21.574 --> 00:04:24.420
Well, we'll clean this up, and
you see this negative and that

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.500
negative will cancel out.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.520
We're just multiplying
everything.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.800
And then finally, the k term.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.470
So plus-- I'll go to the next
line-- plus k times-- cross out

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.800
that row, that column-- it's
going to be that times that,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.340
minus that times that.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.990
So that looks like a kind
of a beastly thing.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.520
But I think if we take
it step by step, it

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.390
shouldn't be too bad.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.300
So that times that.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.255
The negatives are
going to cancel out.

00:04:51.255 --> 00:04:56.270
So this term right here
is going to be a sine

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.770
of t, sine of s.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.960
And then this term
right here is b plus a

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.375
cosine of s sine of t.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.490
So that's that times that-- and
the negatives canceled out,

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.890
that's why I didn't put any
negatives here-- minus

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.370
this times this.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.000
So this times this is going
to be a negative number.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.660
But if you take the negative
of it, it's going to

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.480
be a positive value.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:31.470
So it's going to be plus
that a cosine of t

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.780
sine of s times that.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.710
Times b plus a cosine
of s cosine of t.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.850
Now you see why you don't see
many examples of surface

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.420
integrals being done.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.070
Let's see if we can clean this
up a little bit, especially if

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.930
we can clean up this
last term a bit.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.660
So let's see what we
can do to simplify it.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.985
So our first term.

00:05:55.985 --> 00:05:58.040
So let's just multiply
it out, I guess is the

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.510
easiest way to do it.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.770
Actually, the easiest first
step would just be factor out

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.960
the b plus a cosine of s.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.680
Because that's in every
term. b plus a cosine of s.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.530
b plus a cosine of s.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.480
b plus a cosine of s.
b plus a cosine of s.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.710
So let's just factor that out.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:20.310
So this whole crazy thing can
be written as b plus a cosine

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.370
of s-- so we factored
it out-- times--.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.140
I'll put in some brackets
here, so you don't multiply

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.790
times every component.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.125
So the i component, when you
factor this guy out, is going

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:34.310
to be a cosine of s sine of t.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.480
Let me write it in green.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:46.770
So it's going to be a cosine of
s sine of t times i-- you're

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.700
not used to seeing the i
before, so I'm going to write

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.290
the i here-- and then plus--.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.170
We're factoring this guy out,
so you're just going to be

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.750
left with cosine of
t, a cosine of s.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:06.350
Or we can write it as a cosine
of s cosine of t-- that's that

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.050
right there, just putting it in
the same order as that--

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.110
times the unit vector j.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.590
And then when we factored this
guy out-- so we're not going

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:21.290
to see that or that anymore.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.360
When you factor that out,
we can multiply this

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.990
out, and what do we get?

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.140
So in green, I'll write again.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.220
So if you multiply sine of t
times this thing over here--

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.500
because that's all that we have
left after we factor out this

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:44.550
thing-- we get a sine of s,
sine squared of t, right?

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.360
We have sine of t
times sine of t.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.910
So that's that over there.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.460
Plus-- what do we
have over here?

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.520
We have a sine of s times
cosine squared of t.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.450
And all of that times
the k unit vector.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.310
And so things are looking a
little bit more simplified,

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.580
but you might see
something jump out at you.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.700
You have a sine squared
and a cosine squared.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.160
So somehow, if I can just make
that just sine squared plus

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.240
cosine squared of t, those
will simplify to 1.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.580
And we can.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.280
And this term right here, we
can-- if we just focus on that

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.220
term-- and this is all kind
of algebraic manipulation.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.120
If we just focus on that term,
this term right here can be

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:42.170
rewritten as a sine of s-- if
we factor that out-- times sine

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:47.400
squared of t plus cosine
squared of t times

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.360
our unit vector, k.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:50.590
Right?

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.480
I just factored out an a sine
of s from both of these terms.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.360
And this is our most
fundamental trig identity

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.330
from the unit circle.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.950
This is equal to 1.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:05.110
So this last term simplifies
to a sine of s times k.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.920
So, so far we've
gotten pretty far.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.840
We were able to figure out the
cross product of these 2, I

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.445
guess, partial derivatives of
the vector valued,

00:09:14.445 --> 00:09:16.710
or our original
parameterization there.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.820
We were able to figure out what
this thing right here, before

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.070
we take the magnitude of it, it
translates to this

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.370
thing right here.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.270
Let me rewrite it-- well, I
don't need to rewrite it.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:27.780
You know it.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.820
Well, I'll rewrite it.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.393
So that's equal to-- I'll
rewrite it neatly and we'll use

00:09:31.393 --> 00:09:38.000
this in the next video-- b plus
a cosine of s times open

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:46.810
bracket a cosine of s sine of t
times i plus-- switch back to

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:56.840
the blue-- plus a cosine of s
cosine of t times j plus--

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.900
switch back to the blue-- this
thing-- plus-- this simplified

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.870
nicely-- a sine of s times k.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.315
Times the unit vector k.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.020
This right here is this
expression right there.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.740
And I'll finish this
video, since I'm already

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.970
over 10 minutes.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:18.900
And in the next video,
we're going to take

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.180
the magnitude of it.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.540
And then, if we have
time, actually take

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.470
this double integral.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:24.470
And we'll all be done.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.390
We'll figure out the surface
area of this torus.
