00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There's just a single change in here--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
instead of using x at the old step, we're using x at the new step.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We see that they're taking almost eight orbits around that planet

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and the trajectory does not seem to explode or to implode.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Even better, we see that the energy follows a periodic pattern.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There is no drift up or drift down in energy, and the overall changes of the energy are pretty small,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but keep in mind that the energy is not precisely conserve.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
With some mathematical sophistication, one can show that there's a series of quantities

00:00:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that are close to energy and are conserved better and better.
