[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.210
SPEAKER: Yeah, welcome to
today's Talks at Google event.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.010
We're here to
welcome Neil Gibson.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.219
He's founder and editor-in-chief
of the British comic book

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.560
publisher TPub.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.430
He writes several
of their titles,

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.060
including but not limited
to the "Twisted Dark"

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.680
series and several
other series with T.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.870
He speaks to
businesses and students

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.350
about how they can use comic
books to their advantage.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.410
And today he's here
to talk about how

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.980
comics can help you improve
your memory and your career.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.570
So please welcome Neil Gibson.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.962
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:48.010
NEIL GIBSON: Can I ask
a quick show of hands--

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.460
who here actually reads comics?

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.400
Almost everyone.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.600
Great.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.310
Not you, kind of.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.670
AUDIENCE: Been a while.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.150
NEIL GIBSON: Been a while.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.710
I'm actually going to come
on to that in a minute.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.621
Fantastic.

00:00:56.621 --> 00:00:57.120
Good.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.440
OK, well, welcome to talk.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.427
Thanks for being
here, first of all.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.010
This talk is about
how comics can help

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.420
your memory and your career.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.450
And I generally believe
that whether you're

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.070
studying or working,
comics really can help you.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.150
My objective with this talk is
to give you tools afterwards so

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.767
that you actually use
and start using comics,

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:16.850
either to help your memory
or to help your career.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.670
And I'll explain why afterwards.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.820
OK.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300
So the agenda is,
first of all, it's

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.529
the public perception of
comics, because you're

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:27.570
unusual in that most of
you actually read comics.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.280
Most people I speak to don't.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.297
But a lot of people
think comics,

00:01:31.297 --> 00:01:32.880
and they immediately
think superheroes

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.710
or they think kids' stuff.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.070
And it's unfortunate, but
that is the public perception.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.507
I want to get into why that's
the case, because if you're

00:01:40.507 --> 00:01:42.840
going to use comics, especially
in the work environment,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.216
you need to able to counter
the public perception.

00:01:45.216 --> 00:01:46.590
The next thing,
I'm going to have

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.020
to give you examples of
the advantages comics

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.204
have over other mediums.

00:01:52.204 --> 00:01:53.370
All mediums have advantages.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.610
For example, music and
radio, you can multitask.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.110
You can do something else at
the same time you're listening.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.910
You can't do that with a
film, because your attention

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.961
can't be split like that.

00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:02.460
And comics have a
definite advantage

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.560
over the other mediums.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.836
Then I'll tell you exactly how
comics can help you and give

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:09.835
examples, And then we'll
do a live demonstration

00:02:09.835 --> 00:02:12.375
on how you can make your own
comics, because I can't draw.

00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:13.750
So don't worry if
you can't draw.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.810
That's not a problem.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.750
I'll show you how you
can get around that.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.166
And finally, there's questions
and free comics at the end,

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:20.740
if you want them.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.700
So first of all, a
little bit about me.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.200
My name is Neil Gibson.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.010
That's Neil Gibson, not
Mel Gibson, all right?

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.270
That's me.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.470
That's not me.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.904
Please, don't confuse us.

00:02:32.904 --> 00:02:34.320
Because whenever
I go to countries

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.490
where English isn't
the first language,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.260
I often get confused
with Mel Gibson.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.490
And people think it's the
first time I've heard it.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.570
They think it's
hilarious, I don't.

00:02:43.061 --> 00:02:43.560
OK.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.940
So how I got into comics.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.240
Well, I got into
really them quite late.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.340
I read them as a
kid, but it was--

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.540
well, I grew up.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.590
I stopped reading them
because I felt like I grew up.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.770
But I got back into
comics because of this.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.390
Can anyone tell me who that is?

00:03:02.931 --> 00:03:03.778
What was that?

00:03:03.778 --> 00:03:04.750
AUDIENCE: Wolverine?

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.136
NEIL GIBSON: Absolutely, yeah.

00:03:06.136 --> 00:03:08.260
I had just finished university
and was backpacking,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.750
and I was in Vancouver at the
time, and the film "X-Men"

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.400
had just come out.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.540
And I had a friend of mine.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.498
We used to joke that he
wanted to be Wolverine,

00:03:15.498 --> 00:03:18.010
so I thought I'd buy
that as a joke present.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.620
I went into the shop,
and at that time--

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.219
this was back in 2000, all the
top creators, writers of comics

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:24.760
were British.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.210
You had Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman,
Garth Ennis, Warren Ellis,

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.522
Grant Morrison.

00:03:29.522 --> 00:03:31.480
And when I got talking
to the guys in the shop,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.480
and they assumed I
personally knew these people,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.130
and I had to point out I
hadn't even heard of them.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.130
And then it goes to a
blank look, and they said,

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.664
"but you've read
'Watchmen,' right?"

00:03:41.664 --> 00:03:43.090
Well, I said, "No."

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.389
They said, "Stay here."

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.180
And this girl went to
the back of the shop.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.971
And I'll never forget
the way she did this.

00:03:47.971 --> 00:03:51.520
She came back and with such
intensity said, "Buy this."

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.220
And I did.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.470
And I remember feeling silly
as I walked out the shop.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.940
I thought, "I spent $30 on
something I don't really want."

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.270
But I read it, and it
changed my life, really.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.460
I became a massive fan of
comics for the next 12 years.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.227
I read loads of them.

00:04:09.227 --> 00:04:10.810
And the reason it
changed my life is I

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.900
didn't realize how
intelligent comics could be.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.390
I assumed it was all just
people punching each other

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.450
or the "Beano," like kid stuff.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.690
So why did it affect me so much?

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.030
I had preconceptions,
and a lot of people

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.270
do about comics who
don't read them.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.630
So let's talk about
the first point,

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.661
public perception of comics.

00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:35.160
And first of all, the difference
between medium and content.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.346
So who here used to
listen to music as a kid?

00:04:38.346 --> 00:04:39.879
See, you guys are awesome.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.170
Normally, I do this talk,
and no one raises their hand.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.820
So I make a joke saying
you're all liars or something.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.930
But you guys are actually
very interactive.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.380
I even have bribes here.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.430
I threw sweets to people,
the first hand that goes up.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.020
You guys just all raised them.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.050
So you don't get the sweets.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.810
So the answer is everyone
listened to music as a kid.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.030
And I'm not saying I own that.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.362
I'm not saying I owned that.

00:05:02.362 --> 00:05:04.380
I did.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.050
But your tastes change
as you get older,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.840
and normally the content
you consume would change.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.590
It's the same with TV.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.830
Like, I watched "Sesame
Street" as a kid.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.450
I don't anymore.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.530
Your tastes change, but the
medium is still the same.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.580
You still consume
the same medium.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.485
But for comics, well, you
could read it as a kid,

00:05:23.485 --> 00:05:25.830
and especially in this
country, it's the "Beano."

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.010
And a lot of them just stop.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.845
But they don't need to, because
the content is out there

00:05:30.845 --> 00:05:33.250
for people, but more
people just don't find it,

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.500
because they see it is
just a limited palette.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.440
A lot of people I recommend
"Sandman" to, for example.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.340
Why do they stop?

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.215
Well, a lot of it is
public pressure as well.

00:05:43.215 --> 00:05:44.910
I remember when I
first told a friend

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.530
of mine reading a manga comic
called "Lone Wolf and Cub."

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.310
And I was waiting for
her in a restaurant.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.710
And she said, "You can't read
comics forever, can you?"

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.270
And it was a little
bit offensive to me

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.530
because she just genuinely
looked down on them.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.590
And so why is it that
people do look down on them?

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.580
Well, I apologize to any
Rob Liefeld fans out there,

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.490
but I don't blame people for
it if the available content is

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.045
awful.

00:06:09.045 --> 00:06:11.370
If you're new to comics
and you go into a shop,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.245
or you're trying to
graduate from the "Beano"

00:06:13.245 --> 00:06:16.580
and this is what you discover
in the shop, well, I'm sorry.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.210
That's just silly.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.850
I mean look at the
proportions here.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.790
No human looks like that.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:22.810
It's overly muscly.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.740
The anatomy is completely wrong.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.190
And however bad male characters
are portrayed in comics,

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.920
female characters
are usually worse.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.540
That is a human spine.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.130
It's right angles.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.910
It's ridiculous!

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.451
So if that's what people--

00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:39.950
if that's all they see when
they first go into a comic shop,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.740
I don't blame them
for not trying more.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.244
Another reason is,
historically, it was humorous.

00:06:45.244 --> 00:06:47.410
Comics were called comics
because they were comical.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.442
Another word for them
is the funny pages.

00:06:50.442 --> 00:06:52.400
And my book there, that
psychological thriller,

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.700
"Twisted Dark," I gave it to my
uncle, and he read a bit of it

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.500
and said, "Neil, is this
supposed to make me laugh?"

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.490
No, it's not, but
people just assume

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.920
that comics should be funny.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.720
Another reason they're looked
down upon is poor logic.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.970
So if someone says "all
crows are black," fine.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.224
Oh, this bird is black,
therefore, it must be a crow.

00:07:17.224 --> 00:07:18.890
That's not really
good logic, but people

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.729
do apply it to comics.

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:22.520
All children's books
tend to have pictures,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.480
because that's how
they learn what

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.460
the world is like, what
a castle looks like,

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.877
what a rocket looks like.

00:07:26.877 --> 00:07:28.460
So all children's
books have pictures.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.940
Oh, this book has pictures.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.860
Therefore it must be
a children's book.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.600
Now, you guys are
all Google employees

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.058
who are super smart,
so you'd never

00:07:35.058 --> 00:07:38.360
make that kind of mistake,
but a lot of people do.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.960
But I think the main reason in
the English-speaking language

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.501
that it's looked
down upon is because

00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:43.890
of this guy, Fredric Wertham.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.170
Does anyone here
know who this is?

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.190
No.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.717
He wrote a book called
"Seduction of the Innocent,"

00:07:49.717 --> 00:07:51.300
in which he wrote
that comic books are

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.730
dangerous to children.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.722
And he proved that
children reading comics

00:07:56.722 --> 00:07:58.680
were more likely to be
anti-social, more likely

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.790
to drink alcohol, to take
drugs, and commit crime.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.180
He was so powerful that
Congress launched an inquiry

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.200
into comics.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.200
Across schools in America,
they burned comic books.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.571
it's true.

00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:14.070
And what Congress did was they
launched the Comic Book Code,

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.486
which meant that comic books
could not be marketed or have

00:08:16.486 --> 00:08:17.840
adult or mature themes.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.920
Had to be limited to
people 13 or younger.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.200
So it made the material puerile.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.510
So unlike content
in France or Japan,

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.280
where it can have
whatever you want,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.480
until fairly recently, it
had to be limited age-wise.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.890
And when he died--

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.510
in his book, he went
on to say that "I

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.760
think Hitler was a beginner
compared to the comic book

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.566
industry."

00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:38.190
That's an incredible
statement to make.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.850
That shows you how
anti-comics he was.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.020
And when he died, it was
proved that he fabricated

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.140
everything, made it all up.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.890
But we're still feeling
the effects today.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.700
The good news is that
perceptions do change.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.450
Does anyone know
who this guy is?

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.100
No?

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.610
OK, well, this is Jack LaLanne.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.380
You see those handcuffs there?

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:04.230
He swam a mile upriver, towing
70 rowboats behind his back.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.810
A mile with 70 rowboats, the
last one full of passengers.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.570
And he did it with his hands
handcuffed behind his back.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.020
And he did it when
he was 70 years old.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.556
One rowboat per
year for his life.

00:09:14.556 --> 00:09:15.930
And the reason I
mention all this

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.210
is because he is the guy who
invented weights machines.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.376
Gyms as they exist today
wouldn't exist without him.

00:09:20.376 --> 00:09:22.140
He was a hero of
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.870
And when he first started
saying that you should lift out

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.720
with weights and use these
machines, doctors at the time

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.630
said, working out with weights
will give people heart attacks

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.460
and they will lose
their sex drive.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.281
They were vehemently
opposed to him.

00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:36.030
But obviously, today,
things have changed.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.825
Now it's a central part
of any athletic training.

00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:40.200
Another perception
that's changed

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.500
is "Smoking is good for you."

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.340
More doctors smoked Camels
than any other cigarette.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.990
And that is a young
Ronald Reagan,

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.660
the future president of
America, advertising cigarettes.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.555
Now, that wouldn't happen today.

00:09:55.555 --> 00:09:57.930
Another thing that's changed,
"Women have smaller brains.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.524
They aren't as
intelligent as men."

00:09:59.524 --> 00:10:01.440
This was a real reason
why women weren't given

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.776
the vote, a real reason quoted.

00:10:03.776 --> 00:10:05.400
Now, it is true that,
physically, women

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.066
do have smaller brains,
but intelligence

00:10:07.066 --> 00:10:08.080
is made of gray matter.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.220
Women have a higher
percentage of that,

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.261
so it works out the same.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.402
And finally this--

00:10:13.402 --> 00:10:15.610
"No black man will ever be
considered for president."

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.390
This was said by the
Reverend Jeremiah Wright

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.365
three years before
Barack Obama was elected.

00:10:21.365 --> 00:10:24.780
And what I find amazing
is that this reverend

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.890
was his own reverend.

00:10:29.012 --> 00:10:30.720
Anyway, the good news
is that perceptions

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.550
do change, and the perceptions
of comics will change,

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.010
and with your help,
will happen sooner.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.460
That's the perception of
comics, but what advantage

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.380
do they have over other mediums?

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.820
Well, let's start with pacing.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.870
For me, comics sit in
between books and film.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.780
The best communication you ever
get, I think, in my experience,

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.030
is when you're with someone
you're in complete rapport

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.540
with.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.420
You finish each other's
sentences, the way they speak,

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.410
their cadence, their
intonation, the way they move,

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.451
you're just completely in
sync and you understand

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:00.570
what they're saying 100%.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.216
But that's very
rare, and you tend

00:11:02.216 --> 00:11:03.590
to be very similar
to that person

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.600
to be able to get
that kind of rapport.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.430
So you don't have
that mass appeal.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.571
But with books, the advantage
of books is you decide the pace.

00:11:11.571 --> 00:11:13.320
You can go as fast or
as slow as you like.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.736
You can skip
passages if you want.

00:11:14.736 --> 00:11:15.620
You can skim read.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.120
Or you can pore over what the
meanings of these actual words

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.130
are.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.020
With films, the director
decides the pace.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.700
You don't get a
choice in the matter.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.610
And that lands you into trouble
sometimes, because, for myself,

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.580
for example, I sometimes
speak too quickly for people.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.470
What's worse is people
who speak too slowly.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.276
That just drives me mad.

00:11:32.276 --> 00:11:34.150
You don't get a choice
when it gets to films.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:38.420
It's given to you at the
speed the director chooses.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.687
And sometimes it's too much,
sometimes it's too slow.

00:11:41.687 --> 00:11:43.520
Comics, to me, is
wonderfully in the middle,

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.010
because, again, like
books, you decide the pace,

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.711
but you can be guided
by the pictures.

00:11:47.711 --> 00:11:49.460
And it's very efficient,
because a picture

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.772
says a thousand words.

00:11:50.772 --> 00:11:52.730
They can reduce the amount
of text in the page,

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:56.080
or the size of the panels,
or the detail of the panels

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.080
to guide you through it.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.209
With books, you create the
entire character's surroundings

00:12:03.209 --> 00:12:03.750
in the world.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.090
If you want to lose yourself
for a couple of hours,

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.180
a great way to do that is to
play video games, to program,

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.030
or to read a book.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.275
With a film, you see and
hear all the characters

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:16.950
but are limited
by the direction.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.160
And again, with comics, you
get to see the body language

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.700
of someone, what someone's
feeling in their body in how

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.900
they move and how they--

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.409
but the transition
between the panels

00:12:27.409 --> 00:12:29.700
and how the characters sound,
what they're really like,

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.910
is, again, in your head.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.940
All of these, your
interpretation

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.950
can be very personal, because
they're all great mediums.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.999
But another way of saying
this is that no medium

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:42.040
is superior to the other.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.757
They all have their own
advantages and disadvantages.

00:12:44.757 --> 00:12:46.590
For me, one of the main
advantages of comics

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:47.173
is the pacing.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.640
Next is ease of vision.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.860
I've got a question
for you guys.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.830
First right question
gets a packet of sweets.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.000
So what percentage of
neurons in the brain cortex

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.490
do you think is
devoted to hearing?

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:05.200
AUDIENCE: 20%.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.386
NEIL GIBSON: 20%.

00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:08.841
Anyone else?

00:13:08.841 --> 00:13:09.382
AUDIENCE: 10.

00:13:09.382 --> 00:13:10.879
NEIL GIBSON: 10?

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:12.380
One more.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.090
5?

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.700
We're getting closer.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.990
It's only 3%.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.950
What about touch?

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:20.800
AUDIENCE: 5%.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.029
NEIL GIBSON: 5%?

00:13:22.029 --> 00:13:22.570
AUDIENCE: 1%.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.810
NEIL GIBSON: 1%?

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.850
No, it's 8%.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.761
What about vision?

00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:29.027
AUDIENCE: 30%.

00:13:29.027 --> 00:13:30.110
NEIL GIBSON: There you go.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.610
Well done.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.260
It is 30%.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.470
That's 10 times as
many as hearing.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.720
Vision dominates
the other senses.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.099
Even your retina itself is
an outcrop of the brain.

00:13:41.099 --> 00:13:43.640
It's the only part of the brain
that's not inside the cortex.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.560
So what?

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.950
Why does that matter?

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.740
Well, vision is so easy, it's
so quick to understand things.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.569
I'm going to show you
now four pictures,

00:13:54.569 --> 00:13:56.110
and in a fraction
of a second, you're

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.520
going to get two or three
meanings from each picture

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.470
without any effort.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.158
You ready?

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.770
All right, done.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.840
Instantly all of you saw that
this is a toothbrush holder.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.710
That's a cloud.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:10.270
That's a bag.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.200
That's a sink.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.590
You also saw that's a
smiley face on these three.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:14.760
Maybe that's a Shopped one.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.140
And that's a human body.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.436
And if you want a bit more
detail, this is joyous.

00:14:19.436 --> 00:14:20.560
This one looks almost smug.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.210
And that one looks shocked.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:26.467
And that is not a euphoric
movement of that character,

00:14:26.467 --> 00:14:28.300
as it were, because
it's like it's stressed.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.091
It's under tension.

00:14:29.091 --> 00:14:30.416
Something's going on there.

00:14:30.416 --> 00:14:31.832
You can get those
meanings from it

00:14:31.832 --> 00:14:33.900
so quickly without any effort.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.080
And that's what I love
about how easy comics are--

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.640
your understanding.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.360
You can instantly make
sense of pictures.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.169
And to give you another
example of this,

00:14:42.169 --> 00:14:43.960
I'm going to show you
just this panel here.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.710
Special bonus points
if anyone can tell me

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.290
what comic this is from.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:51.730
But can someone tell me what
is going on in this panel?

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.834
What do they see happening?

00:14:53.834 --> 00:14:54.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:55.918
NEIL GIBSON: Fantastic, yeah.

00:14:55.918 --> 00:14:57.687
Perhaps that's a
padded room over there.

00:14:57.687 --> 00:15:00.020
Wherever they are, you can
tell it's been there a while.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.145
There's cracks in the wall.

00:15:01.145 --> 00:15:02.810
It's not a new location.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.200
To me, perhaps this is a
security guard by this cable

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.890
here.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.650
What's interesting
to me is, I don't

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:09.941
know if this is male or female.

00:15:09.941 --> 00:15:13.020
It's androgynous and
hair that's distinctive.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.460
To have the strength to break
someone's neck like that

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.545
is extraordinary, but
it's not very muscly.

00:15:17.545 --> 00:15:19.125
There's Something unusual there.

00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:21.940
And this person seems totally
uninterested in this as well.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.620
There's no emotion on the face.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.900
And even these three
lines here implies hat

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.592
this person is
distracted elsewhere.

00:15:27.592 --> 00:15:29.800
The girl is almost an
afterthought to this character.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.650
Even her dialogue is cut off.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.790
And the artist has changed
the angle of the panel

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.220
to make it look more intense.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.110
This is all stuff--

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.318
I don't even know what's
actually happening in there.

00:15:39.318 --> 00:15:41.410
This is what you can
pick up from the picture.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.400
And the reason I
mention all this

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.066
is because a picture's
a thousand words.

00:15:44.066 --> 00:15:46.840
Communication through pictures
is incredibly efficient.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.429
If you choose the
time to look at it,

00:15:48.429 --> 00:15:50.720
because you can spend as much
time on this as you want,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.011
you can just look at it, go,
"oh, it's killed someone,"

00:15:53.011 --> 00:15:54.680
and you move on
to the next panel.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.570
It's your choice.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:00.150
Another advantage, though,
apart from the ease of vision,

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.080
is memory retention.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.121
And this is where it gets
very interesting to me.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.587
Have you ever been
reading a book

00:16:08.587 --> 00:16:10.920
and you put it down for a day
or two, and you come back,

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.670
and you you've lost
your page in the book?

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.490
And you wonder,
where am I in this?

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:15.540
And you flick through--

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.440
have I read this
before, this bit or not?

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.190
Yeah, some people.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:18.720
Yeah.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.178
What's more common,
you're actually

00:16:20.178 --> 00:16:22.620
reading a page of text, and
suddenly you realize, oh, I

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.327
haven't taken any of this in.

00:16:24.327 --> 00:16:25.910
And you have to go
back and reread it.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.290
Everyone's experienced
that, right?

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.950
With comics, both of these
happen a lot less frequency.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.480
First of all, for
the picture, it's

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.840
because visual recall is
so much higher for images

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.280
than it is for text.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.660
And they do studies--

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.660
they've done studies on
babies and monkeys, babies

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.990
with images of people.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.130
And if they keep showing
new people, new faces--

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.897
and it can be same
with lemurs as well--

00:16:48.897 --> 00:16:51.480
humans can't really distinguish
between different lemurs, even

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.646
humans who have worked with
them their entire lives.

00:16:53.646 --> 00:16:57.870
So a baby, way the
brain works, if it's

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.626
a different image,
a different picture,

00:16:59.626 --> 00:17:00.750
it'll hold their attention.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.708
Show the same one twice,
and they'll look away.

00:17:02.708 --> 00:17:03.903
They've lost interest.

00:17:03.903 --> 00:17:05.819
Whereas with monkeys,
they've done experiments

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:08.530
with the lever, and
they'll show photographs.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.140
If they've seen the
photograph before

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.780
and they mark it as seen,
they get a banana pellet.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.780
If they haven't seen it before,
they'll mark the other way.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.270
And monkeys show
incredible memory retention

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.631
for visual images.

00:17:19.631 --> 00:17:21.839
They can show them the
picture once three months ago,

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.380
and they'll remember
they've seen it.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.650
As for not taking in a page,
again, your comprehension

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.320
is usually much
higher with comics

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.689
than it is with just text.

00:17:33.689 --> 00:17:35.480
You don't normally go
back and say, well, I

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.896
haven't taken this
in, because you

00:17:36.896 --> 00:17:38.950
understand from the
pictures what's happening.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:43.390
Now, I do say "usually"
here, because just like there

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.490
are some awful books,
there are some awful TV,

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.110
there's some awful
music out there,

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.040
there are some awful comics.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:49.780
Right?

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:50.830
I do love the medium,
but it doesn't

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:51.996
mean I love all the content.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.380
Now, combining the
recall aspect of this,

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.630
that you can remember
it, and the comprehension

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.424
gives you an advantage.

00:18:02.424 --> 00:18:04.840
And in neurology, this is
called the pictorial superiority

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:05.870
effect.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:09.160
And Alex Lundry has done some
extensive research on this.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.760
If you present
information orally,

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.490
like if I gave you
this talk without any

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:17.380
of these pictures, just hearing
it as opposed to seeing it,

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:22.000
72 hours after you hear
something, typically recall is,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.290
according to Alex Lundry,
10% if you just hear it.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:31.330
Whereas if you add pictures,
recall soars to 65%.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.060
Now, that to me
is extraordinary.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.120
Over six times as effective
recall when you add pictures

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.320
to what you're saying.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.660
We are hard-wired to
find visualization more

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.600
compelling than a spreadsheet.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.970
So look at this data here,
and please tell me which

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.080
product or region is different.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.500
Region 3, absolutely.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.080
Showing this, here
you can clearly

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.717
see that these have all gone
up but [? T ?] has gone down,

00:18:56.717 --> 00:18:58.800
whereas if you do this
graphically, red's gone up.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.530
The other two are trending down.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:05.120
Now, it shouldn't be news to
you that understanding this

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.980
is easier than this, right?

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.590
Now, there's science
behind why it's the case,

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.720
but that's intuitive.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.940
What's interesting
is that if you're

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.860
trying to make a point
in the presentation,

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.510
not only is this
easier to understand,

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.190
but people will remember
it more afterwards.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.590
And that's why you're giving
the talk in the first place,

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.298
because you want it
to make a difference.

00:19:27.074 --> 00:19:28.592
So how can comics
actually help you?

00:19:28.592 --> 00:19:30.050
And I've gone
through and explained

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.760
the advantages of the medium.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.760
Well, I used to work as
a management consultant.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.400
And I was on a project
in [? Amman ?] once.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.220
And this company was
building roads and bridges,

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.720
and they had a
problem, because they

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.890
had a production department
and a maintenance department.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.557
And the production
department, their job

00:19:47.557 --> 00:19:49.515
was to build, build,
build as fast as possible.

00:19:49.515 --> 00:19:50.890
They had deadlines to meet.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.556
Whereas the maintenance
department's job

00:19:52.556 --> 00:19:54.710
was to keep the equipment
maintained properly

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.137
and avoid downtime.

00:19:56.137 --> 00:19:58.220
But they were experiencing
huge levels of downtime

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.740
because the production guys
wouldn't release the equipment

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.240
for maintenance,
because they wanted

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.700
to meet their targets, which
resulted in when it did

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.590
fail, failing
catastrophically, and having

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.450
to do expensive
rebuilds and have

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.370
expensive hiring for
emergency equipment.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:15.367
So the cheap solution
was to use a comic.

00:20:15.367 --> 00:20:17.700
"It's time for preventive
maintenance on the equipment."

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.200
"No time.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:18.990
We have to work."

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.240
"It'll just take three hours."

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.780
"Nope, sorry."

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.010
"At least let us grease it."

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:23.855
"No time."

00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:25.480
And of course it breaks.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.910
"How much time to repair it?"

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:27.510
"Oh, not long.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.700
Just three weeks."

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.945
Now, this is very
simple, this comic.

00:20:31.945 --> 00:20:34.320
But what they did was they
took this and they blew it up,

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.282
and they put it in all
the regional offices,

00:20:36.282 --> 00:20:37.740
and they put small
versions of this

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.740
and stuck this inside each
machine, inside each crane,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.690
inside each truck,
inside each bulldozer.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.280
So whenever someone didn't want
to release it for equipment,

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.690
the maintenance guys just go
in and point to the picture.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.485
And a lot of these guys
didn't speak or read English,

00:20:52.485 --> 00:20:54.450
but they knew what
the comic was.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:58.500
And this resulted in a big
reduction in their downtime.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.930
My question to you is why?

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:03.210
Why did this work?

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.914
It's because it was
easy to understand.

00:21:04.914 --> 00:21:06.830
There was no effort
required for these people,

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.205
and it was there, right in
front of them, the whole time.

00:21:10.919 --> 00:21:12.210
Or it can be more professional.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.490
This was a comic we made
for a company called Komodo.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.930
They were the first
company to guarantee

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:16.971
against virus infections.

00:21:16.971 --> 00:21:20.280
So if your company got
viruses on your computers,

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.680
they'd give you like
100,000 pounds or something.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.710
And their problem was
the IT departments

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.430
of their customers
wanted to buy it,

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.620
but the management
wouldn't sign off.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.980
So we made this comic telling
a story of a virus infecting

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.190
a company and escalating.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.650
Eventually,
everyone's going nuts

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.360
because they
couldn't do any work

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.157
and trying to guilt
management to realizing

00:21:38.157 --> 00:21:39.990
that it was their fault,
because they didn't

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.660
take the preventive measures.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.430
And what we did here
was we also put--

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.110
this was the sales
guy at conventions.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.943
He'd give these leaflets
out to all these IT

00:21:47.943 --> 00:21:50.400
guys who didn't just give
this to the management guys,

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.830
but they'd remember
who they spoke to.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.520
Because I don't
know about you guys,

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.800
but I've been to many
networking events,

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.940
and you get so many
business cards.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.710
And you look at
like a month later,

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.240
and you go, who is this person?

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.072
You don't remember.

00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:03.780
You actually see what
the guy looks like.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:04.560
You remember it.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.630
So compared to the
other competitors,

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.160
who are they more
likely to go for?

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.830
Someone they know and recognize.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.990
We also made one
for an oil company.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:17.310
They had a warehouse system they
were implementing worldwide.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.540
And so we taught people
about the system,

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.380
how it worked, and made it funny
with the president and vice

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.950
president looking
like the people.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.050
I had them arguing
with each other.

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:31.660
And yes, the recall and
retention was why we did it,

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.530
but why they liked it so much
was not what we expected.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.880
It's because they tried several
new initiatives in the past,

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.500
and no one would read them.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.150
Everyone's so busy, they don't--

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:43.180
I can get to that later.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.170
It's not for me.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.224
With that warehouse
comic, it was funny.

00:22:46.224 --> 00:22:48.390
Even people who had nothing
to do with the warehouse

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.430
had read it, because it
is different and fun.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.530
OK.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.970
OK, Neil, calm down.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.932
I get that comics can
be effective at work.

00:22:57.932 --> 00:22:58.640
What about study?

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.650
What about for memory?

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:05.500
Well, in Japan, they
teach GSCE-level physics

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.720
using comic books,
even up to engineering.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.240
In India, in Bangalore,
there's a medical school

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.535
which is teaching
medicine through comics.

00:23:13.535 --> 00:23:15.160
Even some of our
comic, "Twisted Dark,"

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.993
is used in schools in
the US, UK, and Canada

00:23:16.993 --> 00:23:18.640
to teach about social issues.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.070
The University of Chicago
even uses one of the stories

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.560
to teach about
modern-day slavery.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.249
And they do it because it's
more compelling as a story,

00:23:26.249 --> 00:23:27.040
and it's different.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.675
It shakes people up, as opposed
to the normal, dry textbooks.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:37.730
If you ever get confused
just once, draw a picture.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:41.770
That's the red sun setting with
the blue sea in front of you.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.577
None of you will ever get this
wrong the rest of your lives

00:23:44.577 --> 00:23:45.660
now that you've seen this.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.284
If you think about
redshift, blueshift,

00:23:47.284 --> 00:23:49.880
you'll remember that, oh the
sun's setting on the sea.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.820
I guarantee you you'll
never get that wrong.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.570
And you can do this
in groups with people.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:54.810
And we did this at school.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:56.768
Actually, someone else
did something different.

00:23:56.768 --> 00:23:59.760
They took a firetruck and the
fireman firing the blue water

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.840
towards them.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.300
Whatever comes to
your mind first.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.080
But drawing these pictures,
as when you have a physics

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.150
problem, you're always
taught to draw a diagram

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:09.600
to help you visualize
it and remember it.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.280
So this is a very effective tool
for exams to remember things.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.530
OK, OK, I get it, Neil.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:18.200
But I need to convince others.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:18.880
OK.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.780
Well, first of all, if you're
going to use this stuff,

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.814
comics are fun.

00:24:23.814 --> 00:24:24.909
OK?

00:24:24.909 --> 00:24:25.950
They're not intimidating.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.630
It's not like seeing
a big block of text.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.500
They're friendly.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.524
Memory retention is higher.

00:24:32.524 --> 00:24:33.440
They're quick to read.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.449
You can learn more faster.

00:24:35.449 --> 00:24:37.740
And they're more likely to
be shared and passed around.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.260
Let's park those
points for a minute

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.530
and then go into Kirkpatrick's
model of sequential learning.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:51.840
And this model, I
like to go backwards.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.230
As I said before, whenever
you teach anyone anything,

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:56.400
you want results.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.562
You want to make a
difference, what you taught.

00:24:58.562 --> 00:25:00.270
It's only going make
a difference if they

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.834
use what you taught them.

00:25:01.834 --> 00:25:03.750
They're only going to
use what you taught them

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:04.994
if they've learned it.

00:25:04.994 --> 00:25:06.660
And they're much more
likely to learn it

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.140
if they liked or
saw a use for it.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:12.410
Did they like it?

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.906
Well, comics are fun, and
they're not intimidating.

00:25:14.906 --> 00:25:15.830
Did they learn it?

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:16.970
Well, memory
retention is higher,

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:17.600
and they're quick to read.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.470
You can learn more, faster.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:19.719
You can read the thing faster.

00:25:19.719 --> 00:25:20.725
And did they use it?

00:25:20.725 --> 00:25:22.600
They're more likely to
be shared with others.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.016
And when lots of people do
something, the culture changes.

00:25:26.917 --> 00:25:28.250
And here's some more ammunition.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.647
This was just last month.

00:25:29.647 --> 00:25:31.480
Psychologists at Sheffield
Hallam University

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.480
investigated how well
students learn something.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.790
And they went through
three different methods.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:40.090
It was comics, the
traditional text, and text

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:41.650
with incongruous images.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.140
And I think it
was for neurology.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.070
It was standard
coursework, but they just

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.420
put it in this format.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.150
And this was the comic
they actually used.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:53.260
And what they found
was comics by far

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.510
were the best method
for teaching for people

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.567
to remember the core concepts.

00:25:57.567 --> 00:25:59.650
And they did multiple
choice questions afterwards.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:03.370
But what's interesting is that
text with the wrong images

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.342
came last.

00:26:05.342 --> 00:26:06.800
You have to know
what you're doing.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.350
You have to have--

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.440
it's showing, not telling, but
showing the right thing so it

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.132
makes sense with the text.

00:26:14.132 --> 00:26:15.590
And the actual
quote they said was,

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:17.750
"Combining relevant
images and text

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:21.980
creates the maximum memorability
for educational material."

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.487
This is edutainment.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.730
They're even being used in
South Africa for people who

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.642
can't read as legal documents.

00:26:30.642 --> 00:26:31.725
Have you heard about this?

00:26:31.725 --> 00:26:32.615
AUDIENCE: No.

00:26:32.615 --> 00:26:34.160
NEIL GIBSON: OK.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.870
This is a fruit-picking company,
and you have a three-week trial

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.610
period, picking fruit.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.110
This is the amount
you need to pick.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.580
If you don't make it, sorry.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.150
You're sad.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:45.984
You go home.

00:26:45.984 --> 00:26:47.400
If you make it,
the trial is over.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.750
Welcome to the team.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.240
Sign there.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:51.910
Legal document.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.770
Examples for professional use--

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:00.530
NASA uses it to explain
about ionosphere.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:02.650
Yahoo mapped how they
inferface [? engineering ?]

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:04.110
in comic books.

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.140
Kelmer Investment Company
taught about options

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:06.980
using comic books.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.870
Even you guys, Google,
launched the Chrome

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.240
using Scott McCloud's comic.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.200
I read that entire comic
because it was a comic book

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.400
all about Chrome.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.130
User manuals, I don't
normally read them.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.920
I normally just go and play
with them, but I read that one.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.930
But this one is the
biggest one for me.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:27.550
The 9/11 Commission, they made
a book about the findings.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:28.150
Why?

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.920
Because no one read
the original one.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.172
It was so big and so dry
and dull, no one read it.

00:27:32.172 --> 00:27:33.880
So two graphic novelists
went and made it

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.740
in the graphic format, and
then half of Congress read it.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.200
It's all about the result you
want, and because they read it,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.533
they're more likely to remember
what they actually read.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:47.090
Great.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:49.250
So now hopefully
I've convinced you

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:50.900
that there is merit in this.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.210
But how do you make
your own comics?

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.280
Because when I draw,
there's not much difference

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:59.480
between seven-year-old me
drawing and my age now drawing.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.059
So you don't need
to be able to draw.

00:28:03.059 --> 00:28:05.100
I mean, you could even do
like XKCD or something,

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.820
stick insects, stick
men drawing things.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.270
You can do things that way.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.660
But if you want to
make it look nicer,

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.910
there's a free app
called Prisma, which

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:14.330
you can download on your phone.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:15.070
And I checked this morning.

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.900
Comic Life is another
app you might need,

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.780
which costs just 4.99.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.060
So all you do is
you take photographs

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:25.870
of the scene on your phone,
plug it into prism, the photos,

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:29.590
and select a filter
you want to use.

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:34.000
It will take a couple of
seconds to process it,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.060
and then it changes
into a comic book font.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.020
It's got a comic
book feel to it.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.100
To show you some examples,
I tried a few of them.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.740
And I did that did this just
a few days ago with some guys

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.600
around the office.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.870
Try this way, this one, this
one, which I did not like,

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:50.890
and that one.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:54.400
So I decided to make a comic
using this particular filter,

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.290
which I'll take you to.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:01.096
OK, so this is Comic Life.

00:29:01.096 --> 00:29:01.596
OK.

00:29:04.135 --> 00:29:06.942
And these are the pictures
we have right here.

00:29:06.942 --> 00:29:09.150
All you need to do is, after
you have these pictures,

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.330
you can just take
them and drop them in.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:12.960
Done.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.200
And you can move them
around if you want,

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.699
but I think this
frames up perfectly

00:29:15.699 --> 00:29:17.180
for this particular panel.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:21.760
Then you take the
next one, pop it in.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.360
And let's say I want to take
this one and put this in here.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.240
I actually want to--

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.999
I can't fit both of
them in this panel.

00:29:29.999 --> 00:29:31.540
I can change the
size of these panels

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:36.990
if I wanted by dragging
things different sizes.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:42.268
Here, I want to zoom in on
this guy's angry expression.

00:29:42.268 --> 00:29:44.410
And that's going to go there.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.190
And then to add
the balloons, you

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:49.347
can drag these things
up here and say--

00:29:49.347 --> 00:29:49.930
hang on a bit.

00:29:53.346 --> 00:29:54.910
Put it up here.

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:56.259
Put this tail down here.

00:29:56.259 --> 00:29:56.925
Or add captions.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.410
"Dan was a good worker."

00:30:07.847 --> 00:30:09.830
OK.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.420
Look how quickly
I'm making this.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.822
It's so easy.

00:30:12.822 --> 00:30:14.030
So here's one I made earlier.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:19.870
And the reason this came
about, actually, was because--

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:24.170
before I show you
this, these guys,

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.740
they're doing a
documentary with us,

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.740
and they are saying
that they hate meetings

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.120
where people are always
playing with their phone

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:29.870
or answering them.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.790
Well, I needed some
demonstration for today,

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.035
so I thought we'd make this.

00:30:33.035 --> 00:30:37.110
So "Dan was a good worker
except in meetings.

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.830
Hang on.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:38.540
Again?

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.100
He was always on his phone.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.630
Now he's texting?

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:44.120
Didn't realize how
much he upset people.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.340
Well, he soon found out.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.846
No phones in meetings, unless
you want to end up like Dan."

00:30:48.846 --> 00:30:51.220
That was just something we
threw together quickly, right?

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.630
But you can see--

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:55.130
I can tell right now by
the smiles on your faces,

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.500
if you put up a poster saying
"no phones in meetings,"

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.640
how effective is that?

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.280
How engaging is
that with people,

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.300
as opposed something like this?

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.160
And it's all about
the result you want.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.870
Now, maybe phones
in the meetings

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:07.745
aren't a big problem
for you, but actually it

00:31:07.745 --> 00:31:08.890
is for a lot of companies.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:11.840
But if there's an important
message you want to get across,

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.670
is it worth spending--
and this whole thing

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:15.890
took me about 15 minutes,
most of it processing power

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:16.930
for Prisma.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.640
15 minutes to the whole thing.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.980
If you want to get an
important message across,

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.440
is it worth spending 15
minutes doing something

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:28.397
that will engage people and
that they will remember?

00:31:28.397 --> 00:31:28.980
I think it is.

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:36.264
So I'm just going back
to the presentation.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:43.944
And it's not just for studying
and for memory or for work.

00:31:43.944 --> 00:31:45.860
This is something we did
with a charity called

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:49.850
Check One Two because it was
in conjunction with Stephen Fry

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:53.720
and [? Anton Deck. ?] It's
about testicular cancer.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.400
Breast cancer has had
massive reductions

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.730
in this country due to proper
screening and awareness,

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.350
but testicular cancer has
stayed pretty much level.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:01.799
Men don't check themselves.

00:32:01.799 --> 00:32:03.590
So we made a comic
which was actually aimed

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:07.670
at women to show men in
their lives, made it funny,

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:10.760
having a little feel
there, testing himself.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:14.450
And this was just to get
people to check themselves.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:15.897
I think it's a
worthwhile message,

00:32:15.897 --> 00:32:17.230
and apparently it was effective.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:18.521
They used it in their campaign.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.380
So going back to why people
stopped reading comics

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:28.390
at the end-- this is just
a parting message on this.

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:30.412
People do stop
reading comics mostly

00:32:30.412 --> 00:32:32.620
because they don't evolve
the content they're taking.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.840
But there is so much
content out there

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.460
which will suit
almost anyone's taste.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.410
I genuinely believe that.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.780
And you can read it
for many reasons.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.730
You can read it just
because you like stories,

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.230
or because you like
fantasy stories,

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:45.480
or you like superhero stories.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.542
Whatever you like.

00:32:46.542 --> 00:32:48.250
But let's say you like
historical comics.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.208
A lot of people ask me
if I could recommend one

00:32:50.208 --> 00:32:52.330
for comic for them,
what shall I recommend?

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:55.090
My honest answer is, well,
if you're reading it just

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.800
for fun and
enjoyment of reading,

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.569
what content do you enjoy
film-wise or book-wise?

00:33:00.569 --> 00:33:02.110
So if someone says
they like history,

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.270
well, I recommend "Maus."

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.499
Anyone read this?

00:33:06.499 --> 00:33:07.540
Two people, three people.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.140
Good.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.060
So this is a fantastic comic.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.415
This is the first comic
to win a Pulitzer Prize.

00:33:12.415 --> 00:33:14.290
And this is set in the
'80s and in the run-up

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:15.360
to the Second World War.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.110
And it's about this
guy who doesn't really

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.310
get on with his father.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:21.070
He's a horrible man, but he
has incredible respect for him

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:23.200
because he survived Auschwitz.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.510
And it makes you laugh,
and it makes you cry,

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:27.850
and it educates you so much
of what actually happened.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:30.342
It's fascinating.

00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:32.050
Or let's say you want
to learn something.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:33.657
I studied engineering
at university,

00:33:33.657 --> 00:33:34.990
and my roommate studied physics.

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:38.920
And he had this book called
"Introducing Einstein," which,

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.290
because I read that, I know
the theory of relativity

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:44.694
and I can explain it anyone,
which I think is fantastic.

00:33:44.694 --> 00:33:47.110
I doubt I would have gone and
picked up a textbook to read

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:48.020
about the theory of relativity.

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:51.040
But because it was in comic book
format and funny and well told,

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.690
I definitely did.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:55.030
On the back of this,
though, as a warning,

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.440
I read "Introducing
Chaos Theory,"

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.690
and that was terribly written.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:00.740
I don't understand any of that.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.930
So if someone could explain that
to me later, that'd be great.

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:05.687
Or about travel.

00:34:05.687 --> 00:34:07.270
If someone likes
travel, this is a guy

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:09.460
who spent time in North Korea.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:13.750
And just how bizarre
the life style is there.

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:17.620
Every public room
has photographs

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.050
with frames at an angle, so
it's looking down at you,

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:22.969
of the family.

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:24.429
Or you can learn
about the economy

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:26.989
or the Arab-Israeli Conflict.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:30.100
Or even if you're not
reading it for fun

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.197
but for social interactions,
I have a Japanese friend.

00:34:33.197 --> 00:34:34.280
And this is amazing to me.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.400
I didn't even know this.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.130
She read a bunch of manga
when she moved to the UK

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.409
on Shakespeare and classic
English literature,

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:43.620
like "Pride and Prejudice,"
so that in dinner parties

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.190
or in casual
conversation she could

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:47.199
have a meaningful discussion
about these things

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:50.460
without having to spend the time
of reading all these classics.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.080
Now, if they're
great classics, you

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:52.810
might want to read
them yourselves

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:54.280
for the enjoyment of it,
but if you're doing it

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.710
for a different objective,
whatever your end result is,

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:58.001
that's a great way of doing it.

00:34:58.001 --> 00:35:00.190
Again, because
it's quick to read,

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:04.500
and you'll remember
it for conversations.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.750
So I think this
is my final slide.

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:10.430
Are there any bad examples
of companies using comics?

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:12.860
Yes, and I think
the biggest culprit

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:17.720
worldwide has to be IKEA.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.920
This is awful.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.660
I mean, even the
structure of it.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.430
Books are the shape
they are for a reason.

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.596
Over thousands of years,
there's science behind that

00:35:24.596 --> 00:35:26.359
as well, why humans
like that shape.

00:35:26.359 --> 00:35:28.400
You have to go all the
way across here before you

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.544
find the first panel.

00:35:29.544 --> 00:35:31.210
If someone reads a
comic and people say,

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.350
"oh, I don't know which
panels to read next,"

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:35.300
that means the creators
have failed you.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.740
Because it should be easy,
the way the flow is done.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.825
They've had to put
numbers in this.

00:35:40.825 --> 00:35:44.530
And the journeys one will read
through this is there to there,

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:48.020
to there, then it goes all
way over there, then down up.

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.114
It's terrible.

00:35:50.114 --> 00:35:54.185
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] pay
someone to do it for you.

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:56.870
NEIL GIBSON: Well, my
feedback on this is,

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:59.550
actually, has anyone ever
actually made something

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:03.060
from IKEA and made a mistake?

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.000
Yeah, you've never
made a mistake?

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.140
Not once?

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.320
AUDIENCE: I plan it out.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.070
NEIL GIBSON: Classic
Google employee here.

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:10.730
Well done, sir.

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:11.580
Well done.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:12.040
AUDIENCE: I get my
pencil and mark it.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:12.960
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.210
NEIL GIBSON: OK, that's great.

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:15.584
I have a master's
in engineering,

00:36:15.584 --> 00:36:16.830
and I've made mistakes.

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:17.500
OK?

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.820
I think these are terrible
instructions, if I'm honest.

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.230
And I don't think
anyone's made a mistake as

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.510
bad as this woman, who's on the
floor in shame after what she

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:24.100
did.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.590
I mean, that was
truly unforgivable.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.810
But if they gave
this to people who

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:31.570
knew what they're doing
comic book people,

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.650
they can make this so
much more engaging,

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:36.270
and people wouldn't
make as many mistakes.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.017
And yes, IKEA do print this
on very thin, cheap paper,

00:36:39.017 --> 00:36:40.850
and they do it in as
few panels as possible,

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.850
but I think adding an extra
two or three pages to this

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:46.712
would make the experience so
much better for customers.

00:36:46.712 --> 00:36:48.920
They wouldn't have the dread
of having to assemble it

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.050
or having to pay
other people about it.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:54.200
And they also maybe
even have a competition

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.110
on Twitter about it, like
how was your experience?

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.710
How many mistakes did you make?

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.890
Turn it into a positive thing.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:03.350
If I was in IKEA, I'd definitely
be getting proper people

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:04.420
to do this.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.270
And I actually think
in IKEA job interviews,

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:10.860
they might want to
do this, and have

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.840
their manual versus a
comic manual, someone

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.900
who knows what they're doing.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:20.040
So in this talk, I've explain to
you about the public perception

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.140
of comics, the advantages
of the medium, how

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.580
it can be useful for you,
how to make your own comics.

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:30.090
And I would really
love, if any of you

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:33.210
have any questions after this,
to get in contact with me,

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:36.400
because I want you guys
to use comics in some way.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.130
It could be helping
your children revise.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:41.940
It could be helping change the
culture of a different company.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.440
It could be a
significant problem

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.356
that people are having
that you want to change

00:37:45.356 --> 00:37:46.440
or a marketing idea.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.180
Whatever it is,
I'd love to help,

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:52.030
because I genuinely care about
the medium, and I think--

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.750
actually, I know that if you
do use comments correctly,

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:58.500
they really can help you, either
in your studies or your career.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.780
Hope you found it interesting.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.738
Thank for listening to me.

00:38:01.738 --> 00:38:04.058
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:05.412 --> 00:38:06.620
SPEAKER: Thank you very much.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.273
We do have time for questions.

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:17.970
AUDIENCE: I just saw you
have described how anybody

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:20.400
can draw using the images.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.060
Is that how you
have made this book?

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:26.640
I mean, do you do
photo shoot-outs

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.010
with actors or
something like that?

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.410
How do you make a
big story out of it?

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:33.410
NEIL GIBSON: I personally don't.

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:35.040
That was just a quick
way of doing it,

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.080
because when people
buy comics, they

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.445
buy it for one of four reasons.

00:38:39.445 --> 00:38:41.070
And everyone has
their own preferences,

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:42.750
but generally
speaking, the majority

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:45.187
buy it for actually the
stories, then for the art,

00:38:45.187 --> 00:38:46.770
then for the coloring,
and some people

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.930
buy just for the lettering,
if you can believe it.

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:51.790
So a large market is
because of the artwork.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:53.790
So all the work we
do, it constantly

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.794
gets better and better.

00:38:55.794 --> 00:38:57.960
So doing it using photos
is a cheat for some people,

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.110
because they want
to actually see art.

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.017
So that's why we don't.

00:39:02.017 --> 00:39:03.350
AUDIENCE: But you actually draw?

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:03.710
NEIL GIBSON: Me?

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:04.751
No, that requires talent.

00:39:04.751 --> 00:39:06.030
So no, I don't.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:07.835
No, I have a team of
artists I work with.

00:39:07.835 --> 00:39:08.668
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:39:11.789 --> 00:39:12.330
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:15.890
So one medium which
lots of people

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:18.260
have got onto now with
all the forums and reddits

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.460
and everything is memes.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.132
So that's kind of an
accessible comic creation.

00:39:23.132 --> 00:39:23.840
NEIL GIBSON: Yes.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.631
AUDIENCE: So what's
your thoughts on those?

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:34.160
NEIL GIBSON: Comics are
actually sequential artwork,

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.320
so it has to be time-based.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.260
Memes tend to be just one
picture, so that, to me,

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.860
is a cartoon rather
than a comic.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.310
That's getting a bit analytical
about it, academic about it.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:44.715
But I think memes are great.

00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:45.840
Some of them are hilarious.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.839
Some of them are stupid.

00:39:46.839 --> 00:39:49.650
Some of them I don't
understand, frankly.

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:52.750
But they can be very
effective, and the reason

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:54.550
they are so popular
now is because people

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:57.500
share them, because it speaks
to them, it gets a reaction.

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:58.990
So the good ones are great.

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:02.660
The bad ones, well, are
not shared for a reason.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:03.868
Is that a fair enough answer?

00:40:09.725 --> 00:40:11.100
Oh, by the way,
the best question

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.095
gets a copy of my
brand-new book.

00:40:14.095 --> 00:40:16.470
This won't be available in
stores till I think next year.

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:17.860
So the best question gets this.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.340
That's an incentive for you.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.515
AUDIENCE: That's
a lot of pressure.

00:40:21.515 --> 00:40:23.245
Yeah, I wanted to
ask if you have used

00:40:23.245 --> 00:40:24.960
a comic for your personal use?

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.620
Not for careers or drawing
a comic for other companies.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.640
Have you created your own
comic for your personal use,

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.500
like to educate your
kids or whatever?

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:43.360
NEIL GIBSON: I did,
and it backfired on me.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.870
So I made this.

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:49.100
This is cool "World
of Chub Chub."

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.839
And this is true
stories of me as a kid.

00:40:50.839 --> 00:40:52.380
I mean, these are
stories my mum used

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:55.980
to like telling everyone of what
I did, of what a bad kid I was,

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:56.880
and how funny it was.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.720
It's funny now.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.170
It wasn't funny at the time.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:02.310
So I made this comic as a
gift to her for her birthday,

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:04.110
and she found it so
funny she shared it

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:06.540
with her friends, which
was not my intention.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.540
And then they all said, "Neil,
you have to publish this."

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:10.770
"No, this is private.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.150
This is--" But no, they made me.

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.900
She made me do it.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.180
So now everyone knows
what a bad kid I was.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:19.772
So I did it for my own
personal reasons, yes, but ah,

00:41:19.772 --> 00:41:21.230
I did it for
educational purposes--

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:24.330
So for educational purposes,
I did it as well for one guy.

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:26.250
Because he had
difficulty understanding

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:30.090
the difference between
"affect" and "effect," right?

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:31.690
And he was a writer.

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:35.910
So I drew an image
of special effects,

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:38.710
and the special effects
blew out in a big E shape.

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:39.300
OK.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.008
And there was someone
else who went "Ah!"

00:41:41.008 --> 00:41:43.110
He was hit by it, and
he was shouting "Ah."

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:48.270
And his body shape
was like an A.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.570
The special effects affect him.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:53.432
So that way, he's not
going to forget it.

00:41:53.432 --> 00:41:54.810
AUDIENCE: Was it effective?

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:58.910
NEIL GIBSON: It was
effective, not affective, yes.

00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:59.880
Question?

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.400
Anyone else?

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.300
Sorry, I thought-- no, sorry.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.855
SPEAKER: Questions, questions?

00:42:06.855 --> 00:42:07.525
Yeah.

00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:09.150
AUDIENCE: What comics
do you personally

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:11.570
enjoy reading for fun?

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:13.070
NEIL GIBSON: I read
a lot of comics.

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.410
I have a massive
library at home.

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:19.940
Unfortunately, the comic
book world isn't that big.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.550
So I read all the
great stuff, I think.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:27.140
So my current
favorite right now is

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.912
"Saga," which is the
biggest-selling comic

00:42:28.912 --> 00:42:29.870
in the world right now.

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:31.245
It used to be "The
Walking Dead,"

00:42:31.245 --> 00:42:33.040
because it's overtaken them.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:38.680
But other than that, I'm
struggling to find good stuff.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.250
[INAUDIBLE] more
independent creators

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:42.708
who aren't that professional,
but I meet them at comic cons

00:42:42.708 --> 00:42:44.030
and I buy their stuff.

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:45.470
But if you have any
recommendations afterwards,

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.180
I would love to hear
them, because I'm always

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.221
looking for good content.

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:55.300
AUDIENCE: Have
you had any issues

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:59.030
with expressing something
that is somewhat

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:04.130
like an abstract concept
in a way through comics?

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:07.130
Like, for example,
there was the concept--

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:10.370
there was the comic
about Einstein's--

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:18.380
wouldn't that take some of the
value away that a wall of text

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:22.730
would have in expressing
abstract concepts more easily?

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:25.310
NEIL GIBSON: Ah, that's
a very good point.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:26.300
I've never had to--

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.570
I've never personally had to
make very abstract concepts,

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:33.760
because most of the stuff I
write or publish is fiction.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.052
Or it's very clear, the
message you want to get across.

00:43:36.052 --> 00:43:37.468
When it's something
very complic--

00:43:37.468 --> 00:43:39.420
Like, I've always thought
advanced mathematics

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.890
and theoretical physicists
are the smartest

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:42.720
people on the planet, because
the way their brains work,

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.760
these concepts which--

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.400
I get that.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:44.899
Oh, wait.

00:43:44.899 --> 00:43:46.090
No, I don't get it anymore.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:49.050
It's very difficult to
wrap your head around.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:51.650
I have not had to do it
myself, so "I don't know"

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:52.980
is the answer for that.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:59.190
But I still think just from
when I was studying engineering,

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:01.800
they bring in models
for you to look at,

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.930
and rather than
just reading text,

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:06.300
showing images always
is more effective.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.540
I still remember those
models years later.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but
I guess the problem

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:13.320
is how to show them
so that you express

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:17.735
more abstract concepts in a
way that is visually memorable.

00:44:17.735 --> 00:44:19.110
NEIL GIBSON: I
think you're going

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:21.058
to have to give me an
example of something.

00:44:23.926 --> 00:44:29.700
AUDIENCE: Like if
you teach programming

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.509
to someone for instance.

00:44:31.509 --> 00:44:32.550
NEIL GIBSON: Programming?

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:33.304
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:33.304 --> 00:44:33.970
NEIL GIBSON: OK.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:46.860
AUDIENCE: I don't see a way of
expressing that through comics

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:50.950
without having a wall of
text in one of the comics,

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:53.859
or just having
text with examples.

00:44:53.859 --> 00:44:55.400
NEIL GIBSON: Oh, I
see what you mean.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.040
OK, fine.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:56.946
Yes, fine.

00:44:56.946 --> 00:44:58.320
Well, for programming,
you'd have

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.960
to have the text, because that's
what you're actually doing.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.079
But I'll tell you what.

00:45:03.079 --> 00:45:04.620
If you actually want
to discuss this,

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:05.990
I can talk to you
afterwards, and we can

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.970
go through a practical example.

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:09.594
I'll see if I can actually help
you on that, because I actually

00:45:09.594 --> 00:45:11.130
would love to see if I could.

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:13.480
AUDIENCE: Have you seen Scratch?

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.305
NEIL GIBSON: Nope.

00:45:14.305 --> 00:45:14.840
AUDIENCE: Scratch is a kind
of a graphical programming

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.319
environment.

00:45:16.319 --> 00:45:17.599
NEIL GIBSON: Ah.

00:45:17.599 --> 00:45:19.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but
that's different.

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:24.300
I was just thinking
if we could express

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:27.060
textbook sort of
subjects into comics

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:34.752
and whether this would be
a limitation of comics.

00:45:34.752 --> 00:45:35.835
NEIL GIBSON: I don't know.

00:45:35.835 --> 00:45:38.168
I'll talk to you afterward
about it, but what I will say

00:45:38.168 --> 00:45:41.420
is I remember when I was
young, science textbooks, they

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:44.652
were very text-heavy and didn't
have many pictures, compared

00:45:44.652 --> 00:45:48.140
to by the time I got to just
before I started university,

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.030
they were so much more
glossy with color,

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:53.724
and they had a lot, maybe
five times as many diagrams

00:45:53.724 --> 00:45:55.640
as the ones that were
around when I was a kid,

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.740
because they're effective.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:59.560
So I do think there
probably is a way,

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.310
but I have to go into
the specifics of how

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:02.090
to actually help you on this.

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:03.450
I have to discuss afterwards.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:05.407
So no one fault me, OK?

00:46:05.407 --> 00:46:06.385
Good, OK.

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:18.200
AUDIENCE: This is more
of a follow-up to that.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.490
So there are some comic
book textbooks that exist.

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:23.620
So for example, "The
Manga Guide to Databases."

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:28.890
There is a lot of text in it,
but giving it reasons to exist.

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:30.640
Like, why do you care
about normalization?

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.320
Well, you care about it
because otherwise you

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.153
might be giving apples
to the Fairy Kingdom,

00:46:34.153 --> 00:46:36.270
and you shouldn't be doing that.

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:38.770
So that can be helpful.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:41.290
And also you can
better express--

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:42.400
so there's a book.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.390
It's not a comic book.

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:48.130
It's a regular book
book called "If I Only

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:51.140
Changed the Software, Why
is the Phone on Fire?"

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:55.599
which is useful for teaching
process-related bits of coding,

00:46:55.599 --> 00:46:57.640
for example, that are
quite difficult to describe

00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:02.485
in a traditional
textbook format.

00:47:02.485 --> 00:47:04.960
So thought processes, how
stuff happens, and this

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.040
is done with a
cast of characters

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.990
as a kind of mystery
novel type thing.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.601
So.

00:47:10.601 --> 00:47:11.351
NEIL GIBSON: Cool.

00:47:16.835 --> 00:47:17.335
Yeah.

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.190
AUDIENCE: What do you think
of digital comics or comics

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.600
in a digital form?

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.310
NEIL GIBSON: OK, so
that's a good question.

00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:32.910
I think you're the contender
for this one right now.

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:35.010
I personally get enough--

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:36.990
like you guys, probably
get enough screen time.

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:38.542
So I personally prefer reading.

00:47:38.542 --> 00:47:40.750
I like touching the books
and reading it and flicking

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.860
through.

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:43.401
I like having a library where
I can see everything I've read.

00:47:43.401 --> 00:47:46.470
So I personally prefer print
massively to digital ones.

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:49.170
However, I'm old, OK?

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:51.002
Young people like
reading digital comics,

00:47:51.002 --> 00:47:51.960
and that is the future.

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.940
Because with digital comics,
you can reach a mass market.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.950
You can get anyone in
the world instant access

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:58.500
to your material, and you
can share it so much easier.

00:48:01.472 --> 00:48:03.430
The thing with digital
comics, though, as well,

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:09.580
is what's interesting to
me is that right now people

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:11.712
will go into Waterstones
or Barnes &amp; Noble,

00:48:11.712 --> 00:48:14.170
look at the books they want to
buy, and then on their phone

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:18.250
buy it on Kindle as they're
walking out the shop.

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:22.030
Digital sales of books
exceed print sales of books

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:23.420
and they cannibalize it.

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.320
That doesn't happen in comics.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.700
In comics, digital sales
increase print sales

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:30.101
because people want to have
the physical copy as well.

00:48:30.101 --> 00:48:31.100
So I think that's great.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:33.350
I don't think comics are
going to go anywhere.

00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:34.540
The consumption does change.

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.010
It used to be all
floppies, but now it's

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:37.060
all moved to trade paperbacks.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.851
This is the big growth
area, because people

00:48:38.851 --> 00:48:40.900
like having a proper book.

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.180
But digital comics
have their place.

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.440
A lot of people love them.

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.766
I personally like a book.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.880
AUDIENCE: Just as a
follow-on to that,

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:55.090
I almost exclusively read
digital comics, the reason

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:58.480
being, if I have a
comic book in my hand,

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.850
I will want to read
the entire thing.

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:02.470
And comic books
these days are too

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:05.290
long to read the entire thing,
and it feels really jarring.

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:07.300
I do the same with
actual novels as well.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:11.530
But episodic digital
comics are beneficial,

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:13.765
because there's only
one new page every week.

00:49:13.765 --> 00:49:17.774
So you're limited in how
much you can binge read.

00:49:17.774 --> 00:49:19.190
NEIL GIBSON: I
like binge reading.

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:20.440
I like binge watching Netflix.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.690
AUDIENCE: I do too, but I can't.

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:25.640
NEIL GIBSON: That's
a fair enough point.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.885
Look, it's how you
want to consume it.

00:49:27.885 --> 00:49:30.790
That's all your choice.

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:34.237
I personally do think
that when you binge read,

00:49:34.237 --> 00:49:36.070
you get more of the
creator's vision for it,

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:37.236
because the story continues.

00:49:37.236 --> 00:49:40.364
You don't forget things as much.

00:49:40.364 --> 00:49:42.280
I'm quite looking forward
to "Game of Thrones"

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.960
when it comes out
later this year,

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.360
but I am probably going to
go back and try and find

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.160
an online catch-up
in an hour where

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.494
I can go through everything
that's happened in the past.

00:49:50.494 --> 00:49:52.285
Whereas, so if you're
reading it in one go,

00:49:52.285 --> 00:49:53.410
you don't need to do that.

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:55.140
You can read it once.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.190
But it's individual taste.

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.310
AUDIENCE: So I guess
a different form

00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:07.560
of digital comics, do you
have any experience with--

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:10.320
particularly for the
industrial applications--

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.330
interactive comics?

00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:15.750
NEIL GIBSON: Yes, I
have experienced them.

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:18.210
I don't like them.

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:21.732
Now, I think there's a
reason it hasn't taken off.

00:50:21.732 --> 00:50:23.940
It could be that there hasn't
been enough good enough

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:28.890
content, but I think if
it's like a web comic, where

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:31.055
it's just one button,
so you have the image

00:50:31.055 --> 00:50:33.450
and then you click the button
and something extra happens

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:37.170
just there, that is interactive,
and that has its place.

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:40.150
But it hasn't taken
off in the mainstream,

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:42.940
because it's not really a comic.

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:45.110
It's sort of a hybrid.

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:48.280
And maybe there's some
great stuff out there,

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.020
but I've yet to see
one where I go, wow,

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.409
I really enjoyed this, whereas
there are dozens of comics

00:50:52.409 --> 00:50:54.950
which I recommend to people and
say, look, this is fantastic.

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:56.950
I know you will enjoy it.

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:58.744
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:58.744 --> 00:51:00.160
NEIL GIBSON: It's
my nemesis here.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:06.590
AUDIENCE: So just a thought
it's on industry comics.

00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:09.090
They're really good for
getting across a concept,

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:11.370
getting people to
read the new concept,

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:12.622
and getting information out.

00:51:12.622 --> 00:51:13.330
NEIL GIBSON: Yes.

00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:15.660
AUDIENCE: But they're
really bad for reference.

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:18.390
So you always need
the text counterpart

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:21.780
to be able to look things up,
because you can't look things

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:25.132
up inside a visual novel.

00:51:25.132 --> 00:51:27.090
NEIL GIBSON: What do you
mean "look things up?"

00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:28.710
AUDIENCE: So something
has happened.

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:30.420
You need to instantly
reference what

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.670
to do to fix that situation.

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:34.080
Basically, an index.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.775
How do you index
into a visual novel,

00:51:36.775 --> 00:51:38.400
where the information
could be anywhere

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.930
on a page, anywhere in a book?

00:51:43.114 --> 00:51:44.780
NEIL GIBSON: Can you
give me an example?

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:48.890
AUDIENCE: For instance, say one
of the databases is blurring up

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:50.220
and there's an error.

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:53.360
How do I find this in my
graphical novel information

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.520
about how to fix errors?

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:54.740
NEIL GIBSON: Right.

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:56.220
Well, to me, then
that's a process flow.

00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:56.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:57.590
NEIL GIBSON: So you
see the flowchart.

00:51:57.590 --> 00:51:59.010
You don't need a
graphic novel for that.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:51:59.635
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:59.635 --> 00:52:03.056
NEIL GIBSON: Graphic novels
are for telling a story.

00:52:03.056 --> 00:52:04.805
You knew that when you
asked the question.

00:52:04.805 --> 00:52:05.310
AUDIENCE: I'm just saying--

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:06.420
NEIL GIBSON: You're my nemesis.

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:08.586
I was going to give you
this comic, but not anymore.

00:52:11.642 --> 00:52:13.100
SPEAKER: I think
we can close here,

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.782
so please join me in
thanking Neil Gibson.

00:52:16.782 --> 00:52:17.740
NEIL GIBSON: Thank you.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:18.940
Thank you, guys.

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.690
[APPLAUSE]
