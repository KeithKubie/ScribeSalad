00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.600
We're told that Imran is
two years older than Diya.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.800
Diya is 2.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.170
How old is Imran?

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.789
So I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:10.330
and try to think
about this yourself.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.290
How old is Imran given
the information here?

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.520
So let's use some letters to
represent Imran and Diya's age.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.290
Let's say that I is
equal to Imran's age.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.526
And let's say that D
is equal to Diya's age.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.320
So given that, what does
this first sentence tell us?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.460
It says that Imran's age, Imran
is two years older than Diya.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.890
So Imran's age is going to be
equal to Diya's age plus 2.

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:52.090
That's what this first
sentence tells us.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.920
Imran's age is
Diya's age plus 2.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.139
Imran is two years
older than Diya.

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:59.680
Another way you
could think about it,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.480
if we were to imagine
their ages on a number line

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.960
right over here,
so if this is 0,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.870
and then this is Diya's
age right over here--

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.710
let me do it in that same color.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.170
This is Diya's age
right over here.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.910
If you were to add
2 to Diya's age,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.950
if you were to go
to more, so plus 2,

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.595
you would get to Imran's age.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.340
So that's what this
first sentence tells us.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.830
Then they tell us
that Diya is 2.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.380
So that's like
saying that D, which

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.570
we're using to represent
Diya's age, that's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.180
going to be equal to 2.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.360
So this thing is equal to 2.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.230
So we can rewrite
this as Imran's age

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:54.320
is equal to Diya's age,
which we know to be 2 plus 2.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.690
So what's 2 plus 2?

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.570
Well, you know that.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.160
That's going to be 4.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.360
So Imran's age is
going to be equal to 4.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.640
If this is 2 right
over here, and then you

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.889
were to go up 2 more,
you're going to get to 4.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.100
Imran's age is 4.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.590
Let's try one more of these.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.330
So here we're told that the
giraffe at the zoo is 3 times

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.240
taller than Shantanu.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.160
Shantanu is 6 feet tall.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.617
How tall is the giraffe?

00:02:22.617 --> 00:02:24.700
So once again, I encourage
you to pause this video

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.735
and try to think
about it on your own.

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:28.700
Well, let's do the same idea.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.600
Let's use some
letters to represent

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.880
the different heights, so G
for giraffe and S for Shantanu.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.670
I'll use G for the
height of the giraffe.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.680
The height of the
giraffe is 3 times

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.470
taller-- not 3 more
feet-- 3 times taller

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.862
than Shantanu's height.

00:02:51.862 --> 00:02:53.570
So we could say that
the giraffe's height

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.180
is equal to 3 times
Shantanu's height.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.285
So let's be clear.

00:03:04.285 --> 00:03:06.600
G represents the
height of the giraffe,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.910
S represents the
height of Shantanu.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.750
So another way of
thinking about it--

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.640
let me see if I can draw
a giraffe reasonably here.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.780
So if this is the
giraffe-- actually,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.010
this isn't a bad job
at drawing a giraffe.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.050
So this is the giraffe
right over here.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.640
They're saying that if you
take Shantanu's height times 3,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.380
you get to the giraffe's height.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.080
Actually, a giraffe might
have longer legs than that.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.460
So this is G. The height
of the giraffe is G.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.540
So let's say this is
Shantanu's height.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.970
If I multiply that by 3, I
get the giraffe's height.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.760
Let me see-- one, two.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.390
So Shantanu might look
something like this.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.040
And if you took 3
times his height,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.180
so this is 1 time his height,
2 times his height, 3 times

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.470
his height, you would get to
the height of the giraffe.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.830
So that's what this
first sentence tells us.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.570
Shantanu is 6 feet tall.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.140
So they tell us that this height
right over here is 6 feet.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.680
Or another way of saying
it is S is equal to 6 feet.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.520
How tall is the giraffe?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.769
Well, once again, S
is equal to 6 feet.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.800
So the giraffe's height is equal
to 3 times Shantanu's height,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.280
which we now know to be 6
feet, so 3 times 6 feet.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.290
So in feet, the giraffe's
height is 3 times 6.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.530
Well, we know that
3 times 6 is 18.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.900
And we're dealing with feet.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.115
So the giraffe's
height is 18 feet.

00:04:40.115 --> 00:04:41.490
And you see that
right over here.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:49.230
6 feet plus another 6
feet plus another 6 feet,

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:56.740
or 6 feet times 3 is going
to get you to 18 feet.
