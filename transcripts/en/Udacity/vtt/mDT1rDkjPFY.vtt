00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.760
Before we dive into the canvas let's take a look at what we'll be building.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.540
&gt;&gt; Huh. You know, it looks like there's a lot going on there.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.020
Shouldn't we start with something a little simpler?

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.921
&gt;&gt; How about this one?

00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:13.400
&gt;&gt; Oh, this is a lot better.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.700
We can totally build this within a lesson or two.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.430
But I've got one question.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.440
Why exactly are we building a meme generator?

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.460
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.390
Let's say you have a website that you want to add some sort of chart or

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.250
maps to, like the resume project we did in JavaScript Basics.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.890
It is possible to do that with some artful positioning of HTML tags in CSS or

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.200
even Flash, but it's much easier to do with Canvas.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.520
Right, Canvas has a set of functions that allow us to draw shapes, images, text,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.570
and patterns.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.920
And instead of working through a bunch of examples with charts and

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.400
data, we thought it'd be fun to make some memes.
