COURT DIMON: All
right, everybody.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.270
Thank you for coming.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.800
I want to welcome you to this
Authors@Google presentation

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.290
with our guest
Aaron Hurst today.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.940
My name is Court
Dimon, and I'm very

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.030
proud to welcome
Aaron to Google today

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.210
to talk about his new book,
"The Purpose Economy."

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.670
I had the pleasure of
meeting Aaron in 2005,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.390
when I joined the
Taproot Foundation,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.620
which, Aaron, I believe
you started in 2001.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.250
And for those of
you who don't know,

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.211
the Taproot Foundation
is a wonderful nonprofit

00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:35.085
organization that really
was at the vanguard,

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:38.794
and continues to be a leader,
in the pro bono service market.

00:00:38.794 --> 00:00:40.460
And if you're interested
in volunteering

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.780
for things beyond
general cleanup

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.190
or supporting soup kitchens
and things of that like

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.380
and you want to donate your
professional experience,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.600
I highly recommend you check
out the Taproot Foundation,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.110
their site,
taprootfoundation.org.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.340
But when I met Aaron
in 2005, it was

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.440
sort of an electrical moment.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.379
You meet him, and you just
sense this high level of energy

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.420
from Aaron.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.947
He's incredibly bright, very
warm, and very friendly.

00:01:08.947 --> 00:01:10.780
But the thing that stood
out the most for me

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.550
was that Aaron is
a frenetic thinker.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.640
And I mean that in all
senses of the word frenetic.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.749
It's rapid fire.

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:19.290
You get into a
conversation with him.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.247
And the topics seem to veer
left, right, and center.

00:01:22.247 --> 00:01:24.080
They touch on all sorts
of different things.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.380
And you're kind of left
reeling for a moment,

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.120
wondering where is
he going with this,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.880
how is he getting from point
A, to B, to C, to D, so fast.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.490
And what I ended
up finding out was,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.430
you know, an hour, or a
day, or a week later, he'd

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.480
come back to you and have a
conversation about that topic,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.530
or he'd give a
presentation on something.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.050
And what you'd
realize is that he

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.060
was busy connecting
all of these dots.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.860
He was making connections,
and dissecting relationships,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.160
and rebuilding relationships.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.900
And he'd come at you with this
very clear, on-point, concise

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.420
presentation of an exposition
on what you were talking about.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.520
And it was just amazing.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.820
It's amazing to see.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.540
And it's that attribute
of Aaron's that

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.620
allowed him to foresee the
pro bono service market

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.190
and kind of lay the foundation
for that with the Taproot

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.500
Foundation.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.710
And again, he's done something
amazing, using that skill set,

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.680
by dissecting the difference
between cause and purpose

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.430
as well as identifying
that we're now

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.300
entering this new economic
stage-- the fourth economy

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.170
stage, if we could call it that
after the information economy--

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.550
one that's driven by purpose.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.580
And what he's here to talk about
today is the purpose economy,

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.170
how he came to this realization
and what it means for us,

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.500
and how we, as
individual Googlers,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.290
and together as Google,
can participate and help

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.730
drive this new
purposeful economy.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.690
So give it up for Mr. Aaron
Hurst and "The Purpose

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.559
Economy."

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:51.475
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:51.475 --> 00:02:55.310
AARON HURST: Thank you, Court.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.441
And thanks, Cliff, for
putting this together.

00:02:57.441 --> 00:02:58.940
I'm going to go
back and forth here.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.565
But it's great to be
back in this room.

00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:04.310
I think I was here maybe five
years ago talking about Taproot

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.450
and excited to be here
talking about my new book

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.950
and new venture, Imperative.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.160
But before I begin, I want
to explain a little bit

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.070
about the background
of writing this book.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.540
Because I think it speaks
to what you just mentioned,

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.700
which is, I wrote this
book in a couple months

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.700
and was about to publish
it and then decided,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.666
you know what, I don't
like this book enough.

00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:26.040
Because it's too
much of my book.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.990
I want to be in our book.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.430
And I got the publisher to
agree to print 2,000 copies

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.040
and send them to 2,000
people in my network.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.624
On every page, I
marked it up, saying,

00:03:36.624 --> 00:03:38.081
like, do you have
a better example,

00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:39.750
do you have any other
data, et cetera,

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.480
and sent it out all around
the world-- in China, India,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.800
all around the
world-- to friends

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.310
and got back just, like,
reams and reams of feedback.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.330
And the book that you see today
is actually only about 20%

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.610
the book that was
based on my thinking.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.910
80% of it came from
getting all of this input

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.444
from people around the world.

00:03:58.444 --> 00:03:59.860
But one of the
pieces of feedback,

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.080
which I was really
challenging, was,

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.649
one guy said, why are you
writing a book no one reads?

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:08.440
And I struggled with
what to do about that.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.670
And it's like developing a
car for people who don't drive

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.730
or a phone for people who
don't talk, et cetera.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.060
And the solution came
in hiring a cartoonist.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.050
You'll see, in the book,
before each section,

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.460
there's a cartoon the lays
out sort of the summary.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.293
So you don't actually
have to read the book.

00:04:25.293 --> 00:04:27.330
Because I wanted to be
realistic about the fact

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.950
that most people don't read.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.810
Apparently, the
business books, only 20%

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.560
of those even purchased
ever get read.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.090
So hopefully, at a minimum,
you can read the cartoons.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.620
And that's me as a cartoon.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.880
You'll notice one thing
that's anatomically incorrect.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.340
Can anybody guess what it is?

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.840
Seth?

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.423
SETH: Fingers.

00:04:44.423 --> 00:04:45.360
AARON HURST: Fingers.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.082
I actually only
have two fingers.

00:04:47.082 --> 00:04:48.540
And there, you'll
see, I have four.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.456
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:52.860
AARON HURST: So Court was
saying, I spent a lot of time

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.520
over the last five
years trying to look

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.780
at different patterns,
different relationships,

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.030
different trends, different
innovations, to try

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.360
to figure out what was going
on overall in our economy,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.520
as I saw Taproot taking off and
saw so much change happening,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.750
from even five or
10 years ago, when

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.340
I used to work in
Silicon Valley,

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.840
and trying to understand what
was the fundamental underlying

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.420
trend of what we saw.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.450
And I came across my
uncle's 1978 dissertation

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.840
when he was an
economist at Stanford

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.600
and coined the term
"information economy."

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.790
And he had this
nine-volume dissertation,

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.498
which I honestly have
not read, because I

00:05:26.498 --> 00:05:28.220
think you have to
go to DC and find it

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.405
in the Library of Congress
to actually read it.

00:05:30.405 --> 00:05:33.110
But I was lucky enough
to find a synopsis of it.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.640
And it was really
interesting to see

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.590
what he had started to see
happening 50 years ago,

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.270
which was a fundamental
evolution in our economy.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.820
And the best way to understand
is to go back to biology.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.950
And you think about how we
started off as apes, right?

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.730
Is there anyone here
who disagrees with that?

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.160
OK, so you got one.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.970
What was it, guy?

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.610
We started off as dolphins, or--

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:55.560
AUDIENCE: God made us.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.370
AARON HURST: God made us.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.869
There it is.

00:05:56.869 --> 00:06:01.790
So God made us, or we
started off as apes.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.670
And over millions of years, we
evolved from apes to humans.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.070
It took millions and
millions of years.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.500
But one thing that defines
who we are as humans is we're

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.090
impatient bastards, right?

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.620
We're incredibly impatient.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.570
We're never going to
wait for anything.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.430
And as part of
that, we were really

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.520
frustrated by how
slow evolution works.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.830
We didn't want to wait another
20 million years to evolve.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.010
We wanted to take sort of our
own destiny into our own hands.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.870
And we started with
the agrarian economy,

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.630
using the land, animals, to
increase our life expectancy,

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.130
increase our quality of life.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.420
But again, we grew impatient.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.319
And after a few
thousand years, we

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:40.860
created the industrial
economy, where

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.610
we started learning how to
be stronger than evolution

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.542
would have ever
allowed us to be.

00:06:45.542 --> 00:06:47.000
We started to be
able to manipulate

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.230
large amounts of
rock and machines,

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.090
to become incredibly strong.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.825
But that wasn't
good enough, either.

00:06:53.825 --> 00:06:56.820
And what my uncle saw was the
start of another era, where

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.430
we said, we want to
hack evolution again.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.502
We want to hack it to
become smarter and be

00:07:02.502 --> 00:07:04.460
able to access and
manipulate more information,

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.814
to have relationships
with more people,

00:07:06.814 --> 00:07:08.730
to be able to access
content from more places.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.980
And the information economy
arose in the late '60s,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.470
to become the dominant driver
of the American gross domestic

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:17.230
product.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.582
So we've had this evolution
that took millions of years.

00:07:20.582 --> 00:07:21.790
And then we got better at it.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.710
And we started taking
just thousands of years,

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.670
hundreds of years, and
then more recently,

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:27.840
well less than 100 years.

00:07:31.642 --> 00:07:33.350
If you take nothing
else away from today,

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.780
and you think nothing I
say makes any sense to you,

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.820
the one thing I'd really
challenge you with

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.810
is a question, which is,
is information economy

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.100
the last stop in our process
of hacking evolution?

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.770
Are we done?

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.570
If you look at the trend
here, it's very unlikely.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.000
It is very likely
that we're done.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.120
It's more likely
that there is going

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.000
to be a fourth,
fifth, sixth, seventh.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.010
We will continue to evolve, and
to hack evolution, and to make

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.840
it better meet our
needs as human beings.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.730
And it's likely getting
shorter and shorter.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.369
Just like with Moore's
law around computing,

00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:07.910
we're finding that
each of these eras

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.450
is getting shorter and shorter.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.116
And if you look at
that on a trend line,

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:13.490
it basically means, in
the next 10 to 20 years,

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.980
we're likely to see
another economy become

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.300
the dominant economy, not
the information economy.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.295
Are any of you
entrepreneurs or consider

00:08:21.295 --> 00:08:23.260
yourselves entrepreneurial?

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.290
So a few of you.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.420
So I think, as an
entrepreneur, it's

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.128
one of the most exciting
questions, which

00:08:27.128 --> 00:08:30.170
is-- we've seen so much
disruption in the last 50

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.744
years.

00:08:30.744 --> 00:08:33.160
In the last 50 years, we've
seen almost everything change.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.210
We are probably 10
to 20 years away

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.340
from another change of that
order of magnitude happening,

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.520
and we don't yet have
a clear path on it.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.100
And it's an opportunity for
the next set of entrepreneurs

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.040
to really remake
every industry, based

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.865
on whatever this
next economy is.

00:08:48.865 --> 00:08:50.490
So I think it's just
an important thing

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.140
to wrap your mind
around-- is there

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.306
going to be another economy?

00:08:53.306 --> 00:08:55.660
And, if so, based on what
you see in the world, what do

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.680
you think it's going to be?

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.840
As I looked around and tried
to understand the changes

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.700
I saw happening all around the
world-- as I traveled in China,

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.170
traveled in Europe, throughout
the US, South America-- what

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:10.260
was going on?

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.800
What were the little signs of
evolution that were happening?

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.255
Not just rare,
one-off anomalies,

00:09:18.255 --> 00:09:20.370
but where did you see
real trends happening?

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.700
And the best way I could come
to explain this in a clear way

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.359
was going back to Psychology 101
and Maslow's hierarchy of needs

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:29.900
and looking at the fact that,
over time, what we've basically

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.360
been doing is trying to
hack each of these levels

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.590
to become able to be sort
of masters of our domain,

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.140
where we first really focused
on biological and physiological

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:39.640
needs.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.806
And we started moving up
to safety needs, et cetera.

00:09:41.806 --> 00:09:44.070
And as we moved up
this, we actually

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.970
started focusing
on the next one.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.090
And as we look at the
millennial generation,

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.110
and you look at what drives
the millennial generation,

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.910
millennials around
the world-- and this

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.770
is not true of every
social economic class

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.460
but those that are really at
the forefront of innovation--

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.930
they're no longer scared
of where is my next bed,

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.890
where is my next meal,
how am I going to survive.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.850
The fear is, am I going to
have a life that matters?

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.060
Am I going to have
a life with meaning?

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.310
Does my work matter?

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.610
It's a fundamental
fear of not mattering,

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.155
of not having made an impact.

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:16.530
This is the thing that we're
hearing over and over again.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.810
And we're seeing innovation
around people wanting and being

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.370
scared of a life
without meaning.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.785
And it's changing labor.

00:10:23.785 --> 00:10:25.025
It's changing products.

00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:26.650
It's changing retail.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.560
This fundamental desire to
have a life that matters

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.580
is a thing that is
defining this generation.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.790
So that, along with a
lot of other variables

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.900
which I won't bore you with, has
really led me to the conclusion

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.830
that this next economy,
this fourth economy,

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.330
is going to be one driven
by man's quest for purpose.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.830
Now that we've hacked and become
faster, stronger, and smarter,

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:52.220
we're now hacking evolution
to become human beings again

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.670
and to bring meaning
and human nature back

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.832
to who we are and hacking all
of these great tools we've built

00:10:57.832 --> 00:11:00.040
so that they can actually
improve our quality of life

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.510
on a much more meaningful level.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.860
So, as Court said, I founded
the Taproot Foundation in 2001,

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.230
with the goal of making sure
that every nonprofit has access

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.640
to the marketing,
technology, HR,

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.677
strategy support they
need to be successful.

00:11:14.677 --> 00:11:16.510
Because I had worked
in the nonprofit sector

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.360
and knew that these
organizations,

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.160
without those resources,
are not set up for success.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.090
And so many corporate
volunteer programs

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.440
were not focused on meeting
them with what they needed.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.090
They were just doing the
things that were easy,

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.060
not the stuff that
actually made an impact.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.010
And over 12 years, we scaled the
organization around the world,

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.850
working with dozens of
companies and really

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.420
focusing on building
a marketplace

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.840
for this new form of
philanthropy, parallel to cash,

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.910
a marketplace for pro bono
services, for human capital,

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.066
to meet these core needs.

00:11:46.066 --> 00:11:48.065
I mean, imagine Google
if you had no technology,

00:11:48.065 --> 00:11:49.940
HR, or marketing
department, right?

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.977
It would be pretty
hard to survive.

00:11:52.977 --> 00:11:55.393
We built this out to the point
where, when I left Taproot,

00:11:55.393 --> 00:11:58.600
it was a $15 billion
marketplace for pro bono

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.120
services around the US, and
then global markets around it,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.950
from schools, to
companies, et cetera.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.964
But ultimately, I left
because of exactly what

00:12:07.964 --> 00:12:08.880
you mentioned earlier.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.300
I started seeing a bigger trend
emerging, and a more important

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.400
one, which was,
that when we talked

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.240
to people who did
pro bono work, this

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.340
is consistently what we heard.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.210
I find pro bono work
so much more rewarding

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.070
than my paycheck job.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.800
And at first, we were,
like, hot damn, we did it.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.370
Ha!

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.480
We created Disneyland for work.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.090
We created the ultimate,
funnest, awesomest,

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.240
most rewarding form
of work there is.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.049
But then we took a step back and
realized we had done just that.

00:12:37.049 --> 00:12:38.215
We had created a Disneyland.

00:12:38.215 --> 00:12:41.430
We had created a place that you
go and have an amazing time,

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.110
but when you come back, it's
not even anything remotely

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.659
close to Disneyland and that,
ultimately, the question is not

00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:47.700
how to create Disneyland.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.347
It's how do you make sure
what you're doing 40,

00:12:50.347 --> 00:12:54.410
50, 60, 70 hours a week
fundamentally feels more

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.950
like pro bono work and meets
our needs as human beings.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.470
We can't continue to take
supplements to make up

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.380
for work that no longer
meets the needs that we

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.680
have as human beings.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.760
So my new goal,
of my new company,

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.460
is no longer how
do we make pro bono

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.000
accessible to every nonprofit.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.530
It's a much scarier goal,
which is much more exciting,

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.065
which is, how do we make all
work feel like pro bono work?

00:13:17.065 --> 00:13:19.340
How can we radically
redesign work

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.790
so that all work feels
like pro bono work?

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.910
So this sort of raises
the question, overall, of,

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.960
like, what is purpose?

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.130
What is meaning?

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.190
And does anyone have an answer?

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:33.122
What is the meaning
of life, anyone?

00:13:33.122 --> 00:13:34.418
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] 42?

00:13:34.418 --> 00:13:35.595
AARON HURST: 42.

00:13:35.595 --> 00:13:37.178
That's the answer I
got from, I think,

00:13:37.178 --> 00:13:38.940
it was actually someone
from Google in Dublin

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.731
a couple weeks ago.

00:13:39.731 --> 00:13:41.950
So clearly, "The
Hitchhiker's Guide"

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.076
is doing well in
the Google culture.

00:13:44.076 --> 00:13:46.760
So this is a tough question.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.940
And if you look
throughout history,

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.830
back in the day,
when I was a caveman,

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.630
we used to stay up late at
night, looking at the stars,

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.634
wondering what the
meaning of life was.

00:13:55.634 --> 00:13:56.550
I was raised Buddhist.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.160
And it's one of
many religions that

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.330
spends its time contemplating
what is the meaning of life,

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.290
why are we here,
what are we doing.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.090
The great philosophers
spent most

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.600
of their time wondering
what is the meaning of life.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.400
And today, talk show
hosts, like Oprah,

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.020
spend a lot of time pondering
what is the meaning of life.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.800
And I have great news for
you, which is I have no clue.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.097
That is not what I'm
talking about today.

00:14:18.097 --> 00:14:20.430
What I am going to share with
you is that, in the last 5

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.800
to 10 years, scientists
have been able to determine,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.610
to a large degree, what is it
that actually defines meaning

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.440
and purpose when
it comes to work.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.023
Not the rest of your life, but
at least when it comes to work,

00:14:32.023 --> 00:14:33.774
what drives purpose,
what drives meaning.

00:14:33.774 --> 00:14:34.690
And it's been amazing.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.356
And it's basically a
set of researchers,

00:14:36.356 --> 00:14:38.870
from Penn, the
University of Michigan,

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:43.650
and Yale, have been behind
incredible breakthroughs

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:44.240
in this work.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.656
I mean, I think of it
as like when we first

00:14:46.656 --> 00:14:48.280
were able to
commercialize the internet

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.750
and what that enabled
in terms of change

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.670
in the economy and
change in society.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.420
This new research is
just as break-through

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.920
in my mind in terms of enabling
us to understand finally

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.280
what actually generates
purpose at work.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.820
And I'm going to
share with you some

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.320
of those highlights,
because I think

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.550
that's really critical
to the future.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.170
And as Court said, I
think the first thing

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.900
I struggled with was that I
had been practicing malpractice

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.210
for about 12 years and
giving terrible advice

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.277
to professionals all around the
world about how to find purpose

00:15:17.277 --> 00:15:18.110
and meaning at work.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.570
And it wasn't until I saw the
research that I was, like,

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.540
uh, duh, I totally
missed the point here.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.780
And it was really,
really profound for me

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.280
and I want to share with you,
before I define what generates

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.290
purpose, to help
you understand some

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.250
of these myths about purpose
that I had been holding

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:36.520
and had been giving as bad
advice for about a decade.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:41.210
The most important is the myth
that purpose and cause are

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.560
the same thing or that
they are even connected.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.519
Like when a 22-year-old
comes to me and says,

00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:49.060
I want more meaning
in my work, but I

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.870
can't figure out
what my cause is.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:51.960
Is it kittens?

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.485
Is it dogs?

00:15:52.485 --> 00:15:54.030
Is it health care?

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.150
Is it wells in Africa?

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.270
Like, I haven't been able
to find out my cause.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:58.800
And we tend to
think that cause is

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.160
the thing we need to have
a career rich in purpose.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.460
This is incredibly prevalent.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.040
And the reality is,
much like this lady

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.950
from the Upper East
Side in New York,

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:14.927
many people have many causes
in their lives and no purpose.

00:16:14.927 --> 00:16:17.010
Does anybody know anybody
who has a lot of causes,

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.400
like they go on
Facebook or LinkedIn,

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.024
and they check off
all of their causes,

00:16:20.024 --> 00:16:22.450
but they don't really
have any purpose?

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:22.950
Anyone?

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:23.480
Some nods?

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.145
A couple.

00:16:24.145 --> 00:16:25.770
But similarly, do
you guys know anybody

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.460
who has tremendous
purpose in their work

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.500
but doesn't have a single
cause that you could name?

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.980
These things are not connected.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.984
And we can't continue to rely
on causes as the way in which we

00:16:34.984 --> 00:16:36.275
connect with people of purpose.

00:16:36.275 --> 00:16:38.900
And as I've talked to
executives at large companies

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.330
around the world,
I think they're

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.985
starting to realize that
cause marketing, like all

00:16:41.985 --> 00:16:43.360
of these things
we've been doing,

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.839
aren't actually addressing
what the core need is.

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:46.880
And they tend to be fads.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.480
They tend to come and go.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.480
People can find
purpose in many causes.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.400
And having worked with
the nonprofit sector,

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.520
many people at large
nonprofits actually

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.350
do pro bono work at
small nonprofits,

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.141
because they don't find
any purpose working

00:16:59.141 --> 00:17:01.190
at a large nonprofit.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.920
It's really fascinating
that nonprofits

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.910
don't generate necessarily any
more purpose than a company.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.690
It's a complete
misunderstanding of the nature

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:12.079
of how purpose works.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:17.374
The other two myths are that
purpose is a revelation.

00:17:17.374 --> 00:17:19.040
And this one sounds
ridiculous at first.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.415
But I'm guessing
most of you have

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:23.490
this myth in your head,
which is that purpose

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:24.686
is going to find you.

00:17:24.686 --> 00:17:27.185
You're going to open up "The
New York Times Sunday Magazine"

00:17:27.185 --> 00:17:29.180
and read an article
and find purpose,

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.800
or that you're going
to go to Africa

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.216
and see someone
struggling and be,

00:17:32.216 --> 00:17:34.837
like, I have found
my purpose, right?

00:17:34.837 --> 00:17:37.170
It's amazing how much we think
purpose is something that

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:41.020
happens to us and comes
to us by revelation.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.970
I was at Oxford a
couple weeks ago,

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.860
talking to a bunch
of graduate students.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.110
It was a wonderful discussion.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.680
I shared this research.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.225
And they all looked
incredibly depressed.

00:17:50.225 --> 00:17:53.250
And I thought, OK, what's
going on here, guys?

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.000
This was people from
all around the world.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.125
And they said, without
exception, every one of them

00:17:57.125 --> 00:17:59.330
had gone to graduate
school, because they thought

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.435
they would have a
revelation about purpose

00:18:01.435 --> 00:18:04.030
and that they would graduate
with a revelation about what

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.107
their purpose in
their career was.

00:18:06.107 --> 00:18:07.940
And they had sort of
come to the realization

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.356
through this, that,
wow, like, I'm

00:18:09.356 --> 00:18:11.935
probably not going to
graduate with a revelation.

00:18:11.935 --> 00:18:13.670
And I think so
many of us are sort

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.030
of waiting for that revelation,
instead of realizing purpose

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.590
is within us and that
we have to make purpose.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.540
We have to create
it in our lives,

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.380
not wait for it to happen to
us, not go $150,000 in debt

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.890
to get an MBA that we
think will give us purpose,

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.300
when, in fact, it's not how
we're going to find purpose.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:35.320
And the third myth is
that purpose is a luxury.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.760
We tend to think
that purpose is only

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.059
for those who can afford it.

00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:40.850
It's only once you have
earned enough money

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.220
or if you have a
certain level privilege

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.910
or you're middle-class that
you're allowed to have purpose.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.630
And this myth is most common
among middle and upper-class

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.160
folks, because they
project onto people

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.327
who are of lesser
economic status

00:18:53.327 --> 00:18:55.160
and say, how could you
possibly have purpose

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.650
if you're poor, right?

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.040
And it's not meant
to be patronizing.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.000
It's not meant to be insulting.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.990
But it's a lack
of understanding.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.940
I would argue, often the
people with the least means

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.350
have the most purpose.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.930
Most of the senior execs
I know have less purpose

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:13.288
than the folks who are at the
entry level in most companies.

00:19:13.288 --> 00:19:14.746
I had the most
purpose in my career

00:19:14.746 --> 00:19:17.170
when I was probably
22, when I was actually

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:19.300
able to have authentic
relationships,

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.960
do coding myself, do
things that actually

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.870
created a sense of progress.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:25.955
And it's interesting.

00:19:25.955 --> 00:19:26.960
We were over at
LinkedIn, and we were

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.570
talking to them the other day.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:29.862
And they were saying how one
of their most senior folks

00:19:29.862 --> 00:19:31.945
just demoted himself three
levels, because he was,

00:19:31.945 --> 00:19:34.420
like, I get so much more purpose
from working as a manager

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.546
than I did as a VP.

00:19:36.546 --> 00:19:39.765
And if you think about
universities, among academics,

00:19:39.765 --> 00:19:43.542
it's considered a demotion
to make dean, right?

00:19:43.542 --> 00:19:45.250
Like, everyone fights
to not be the dean.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.624
And yet, in
companies, everyone's

00:19:46.624 --> 00:19:48.920
fighting to be the dean and
not realizing, actually,

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.580
it's much better to be the
professor than to be the dean.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.163
We tend to move ourselves out
of purpose and into these higher

00:19:54.163 --> 00:19:56.750
roles that are much harder
to generate purpose in.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:00.080
The best, I think, example of
the fact that purpose is not

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.702
a luxury is Viktor Frankl.

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:04.160
How many of you
know Viktor Frankl?

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.359
So he's one of the most sort of
famous writers about meaning.

00:20:07.359 --> 00:20:08.900
And he found that
it was purpose that

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.427
enabled him to survive being a
slave in a concentration camp

00:20:12.427 --> 00:20:13.260
during World War II.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.990
It was finding purpose
every day as a slave.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.010
So I tend to think, unless
your work environment is worse

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.210
than being a slave in
a concentration camp,

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:23.550
there is really no excuse.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.990
It's really on you, if
he was able to do that.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:27.895
And it really points to the fact
you don't have to have a yacht,

00:20:27.895 --> 00:20:29.225
you don't have to
have a private plane,

00:20:29.225 --> 00:20:30.599
you don't even
have to own a home

00:20:30.599 --> 00:20:32.830
to have purpose in your work.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:34.830
So the next question
I looked at,

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.330
sort of coming from
my Taproom lens,

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.579
trying to get my head around
what is purpose actually,

00:20:38.579 --> 00:20:40.620
were these two scenarios.

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.099
These are two women who
have the exact same job.

00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:44.390
And the cartoonist added a cat.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:45.700
I'm not sure why.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.270
But even the cat is much
happier in the second picture.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.820
So one is miserable
and has no purpose.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.790
The other one has
tremendous purpose.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.850
But they're doing
the exact same job.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.292
It doesn't make any sense.

00:20:56.292 --> 00:20:58.000
It shouldn't be possible
that two people,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.730
in the exact same job, one
experiences tremendous purpose,

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:02.960
the other one doesn't.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.010
What's going on here?

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:09.160
The second one is my man, Dr.
Pickle, who is in Brooklyn.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.060
He's a local pickle merchant.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.750
He makes pickles,
and he sells pickles,

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.850
and he smells like pickles.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.000
This guy's job sucks, right?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.521
And he has so much
purpose and is so happy.

00:21:19.521 --> 00:21:21.270
So my question was,
what's wrong with him?

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:23.480
How can this guy have
purpose and be happy,

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.250
probably making not that much
money, smelling like vinegar

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.630
and hawking pickles
all day, right?

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.010
Again, what's going on here?

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.687
What do we actually understand
about the science of purpose?

00:21:33.687 --> 00:21:35.020
This guy doesn't work at Google.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.840
Like, how could he
be happy, right?

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.880
The research really
shows that there

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.490
are three ways
people look at work.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:43.990
And this is an
important distinction

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.198
I want to make sure is clear.

00:21:45.198 --> 00:21:46.490
And it's not like every day.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.781
It has to do with if somewhat
interviewed you and said,

00:21:48.781 --> 00:21:51.680
what is the purpose
of work itself?

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.960
People tend to fall into
one of three categories

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.322
around how they have a mental
construct in their head,

00:21:56.322 --> 00:21:58.530
that they carry usually
throughout their entire lives

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:01.720
about what the rule of work
is, that largely comes out

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.990
of their childhood and
adolescence when it's formed.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.670
The first is job.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:10.900
I work so that I can afford to
have a life outside of work.

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.600
It's a necessary evil.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.760
These people tend
to be coin-operated.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.111
They tend to be people who
work as a necessary evil.

00:22:18.111 --> 00:22:19.360
They just do it for the money.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.260
It's an ability to
generate resources.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.260
And that's the contract.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.280
What is work for?

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.040
It pays the bills.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.930
The second one is career.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:32.230
These people tie work to ego.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:33.481
They tie it to their identity.

00:22:33.481 --> 00:22:35.688
Like, when they go back to
their high school reunion,

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:37.750
they want to be able to
say, I worked at Google,

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.800
I am a doctor, I am
whatever it is, and know

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.400
that they'll be thought of well.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.405
They want their mommy and daddy
to be able to be proud of them.

00:22:44.405 --> 00:22:45.280
And that's the story.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.540
It's tied to identity.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.440
And the third is calling, which
are people who fundamentally

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.050
see work as something that
adds value to the world.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.220
They see the act of work
itself to be something

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.470
of value and something
of purpose and meaning.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.780
It's sort of the easiest
way to understand this.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.350
Does that make sense?

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.680
So what's fascinating about
this is, first of all,

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.290
the researchers find
that those with a calling

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.790
have higher satisfaction
with their lives

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:12.760
and with their work.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.010
And in most regards,
they're better employees.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:18.080
They're more loyal.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.620
They're more collaborative,
dot, dot, dot.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.460
So this is not necessarily
like diversity.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.600
Oh, isn't it wonderful,
we have some people here

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.690
that were into jobs,
some were into career,

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:27.810
some were into calling.

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:31.790
Calling is a better place
to be as an individual

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:37.010
and for a company to have
employees of this mindset.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.910
What's fascinating
is, in the research

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.680
they've done so far, in the
United States, roughly a third

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.810
of Americans see
their work as a job.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:46.410
A third see it as a career.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.030
And a third see it as a calling.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.215
It breaks down roughly to
a third, a third, a third.

00:23:51.215 --> 00:23:54.710
But what's more interesting
is that it doesn't really

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:57.550
matter what the job is.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:01.260
So for doctors, roughly a third
of doctors see it as a job.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.540
It's really good, regular pay.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.560
It pays well.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.209
It's stable.

00:24:05.209 --> 00:24:07.250
Like, I know I'm going to
be set for life by just

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.626
being able to be a doctor.

00:24:08.626 --> 00:24:09.750
A third see it as a career.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.750
Mommy and Daddy are so
proud that I'm a doctor.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.380
I'm going to go to
a cocktail party.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.100
I'm a doctor.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.000
No one's going to be
like, oh, sorry to hear

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.127
that, such a failure.

00:24:19.127 --> 00:24:20.460
And a third see it as a calling.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.860
And they actually see
the act of medicine

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.520
and doing the work
as fundamental,

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.090
like adding value
to the world is

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.332
the primary driver
of what they do.

00:24:28.332 --> 00:24:30.540
But the same thing is true
of this guy depicted here,

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.870
who is an executive assistant.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.500
A third of executive
assistants see work as a job,

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.030
a third as a career, and
a third as a calling.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.070
So it's fascinating,
and it leads only

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:46.320
to one strong conclusion,
which is, purpose is a choice.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.354
If you can have
the exact same job,

00:24:49.354 --> 00:24:50.770
like those two
women with the cat,

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.925
and have one that has tremendous
purpose and one who doesn't,

00:24:53.925 --> 00:24:55.550
the only conclusion
you can really draw

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.340
is it's a choice, especially
if it doesn't really

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.852
depend what the
career is, et cetera.

00:25:00.852 --> 00:25:02.560
And I guess an incredibly
important thing

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.080
to understand as individuals.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.590
As we tend to externalize
our need for purpose,

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.370
we tend to look for
others to give us

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.170
permission to have purpose,
for others to hand us purpose,

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.855
when, in fact, the only
conclusion you can really draw

00:25:13.855 --> 00:25:15.320
is that it's up to you.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.899
That doesn't mean certain jobs
aren't a better fit for you.

00:25:17.899 --> 00:25:19.690
It doesn't mean certain
jobs don't give you

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:21.237
more purpose than others.

00:25:21.237 --> 00:25:22.820
But at the end of
the day, at the core

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.080
is whether or not you
see work fundamentally

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.820
as about adding value, and
how do you optimize that?

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.250
So what is purpose?

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.040
Purpose is relationships.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.290
It's about working
with other people.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:38.094
You can generate purpose on your
own, but not for a long, right?

00:25:38.094 --> 00:25:40.760
Purpose is something that we get
from working with other people,

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.090
interacting with other
people, serving other people.

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:45.602
It's about doing something
greater than yourself.

00:25:45.602 --> 00:25:47.060
But that doesn't
mean it's a cause.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.351
You don't have to have a cause.

00:25:48.351 --> 00:25:49.922
It could just be
helping a friend.

00:25:49.922 --> 00:25:51.255
It could be helping a co-worker.

00:25:51.255 --> 00:25:53.000
It could be working
on a product that

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.210
makes a few people's
lives a little bit easier.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.452
It doesn't have to be
this grandiose vision.

00:25:57.452 --> 00:25:58.910
It's fundamentally
just about doing

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:00.470
something that's
not just about you.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:06.510
And the third is personal
growth and challenge, right?

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:09.000
We get purpose when we
grow, when we stretch,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.290
when we lean into our fear.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.880
That is something that
generates purpose for us.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.190
These are the three things
that general purpose.

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:16.140
And it is fascinating.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.881
We're doing this whole project
around what's the next Silicon

00:26:19.881 --> 00:26:20.380
Valley?

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.880
Because Silicon Valley has
been the hub of the information

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.954
economy, just like Detroit was
for the industrial economy.

00:26:26.954 --> 00:26:28.870
And as Silicon Valley
potentially becomes more

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.859
like Detroit, another
Silicon Valley

00:26:30.859 --> 00:26:32.650
will likely emerge
around this new economy,

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:34.210
if you look at
historic trending.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.793
So we have been going
around the world

00:26:35.793 --> 00:26:37.550
helping cities think
about how can you

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.476
become this hub of
the new economy.

00:26:40.476 --> 00:26:41.850
And last week, we
were in Dallas.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.190
And we went out and, on the
street, just interviewed

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.950
200 random people--
taxi drivers,

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.510
policemen, bankers,
across the board--

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.980
and asked them, when
was the last thing

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.320
that you remember that you
got purpose in your lives

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.030
around, right?

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:57.230
And this was a warm-up exercise
for the people involved

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:59.330
in this conference we did.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.100
And it was fascinating,
just to hear,

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.705
everything fit into these
three categories yet again.

00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:06.260
And no matter what the diversity
was, what part of world

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.980
they came from, purpose
is driven and created out

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.250
of these three things.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.632
So how do you act on this?

00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:16.090
How do you, as an individual,
build purpose into your work?

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.980
But also, how do you, as a
company, organization manager,

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.652
help others generate purpose?

00:27:20.652 --> 00:27:22.360
And I think this is
an early-day science.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:27.600
This is like the web back when
I worked in technology in 1997,

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.770
where it was just static images.

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:31.350
This was like the early days.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:34.090
But here is what we
understand about how

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:37.105
to generate purpose
for yourself.

00:27:37.105 --> 00:27:39.110
All of the research
points to self-awareness

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:41.490
as being the most
critical first step.

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.760
You need to understand what
generates purpose for you.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.754
Because not everyone gets
purpose from the same things.

00:27:47.754 --> 00:27:49.920
And that's why the first
thing we did at Imperative,

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.250
my company, was create
the first-ever purpose

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:53.990
diagnostic that, in
about 15 minutes,

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:57.110
can help you determine which
of sort of 24 different purpose

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.580
types you are, so you can
start to actually become more

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:03.140
self-aware about what actually
generates purpose for you.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.480
Because not everyone's the same.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.400
The second one is
to craft your job

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.710
around what gives you purpose.

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:11.918
And I think Google is one
of the great companies when

00:28:11.918 --> 00:28:12.760
it comes to this.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.676
Not to say it's perfect--
it's never perfect--

00:28:14.676 --> 00:28:18.185
but I think you guys are
often cited in this way.

00:28:18.185 --> 00:28:19.560
And I'll talk more about this.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.449
But we often think
about jobs like we

00:28:21.449 --> 00:28:23.990
do clothes, where you go and
you just buy stuff off the rack.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:26.495
You don't necessarily tailor
it to actually fit you well.

00:28:26.495 --> 00:28:28.036
And I think the same
thing with jobs.

00:28:28.036 --> 00:28:29.560
We tend to take the
job description,

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.250
but we don't tailor
it to actually fit us.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.708
We think of the
job description as,

00:28:32.708 --> 00:28:34.660
like, the final product
instead of the start

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.680
of the conversation,
that needs to be tailored

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.000
to meet our own
individual purpose

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.290
needs to make that work.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.800
The third is to connect
personal purpose

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.420
to organizational purpose.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.190
So we're working right now
with a large company that

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.666
has 10,000 new employees
starting in September.

00:28:51.666 --> 00:28:53.540
And what we're doing
with them is making sure

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.820
every employee, when they
start at that company,

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.450
has an understanding of what
generates purpose for them

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:01.720
but then also a translation
of their personal purpose

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.690
into the organization's
purpose, so they

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:05.820
can understand how they
are generating purpose

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:09.020
at that organization and
connect those dots, which

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:13.690
is so critical to understand
the context in which you work.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:17.110
The fourth is to celebrate
and connect around purpose.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.860
Most companies celebrate the
jobs mentality and the career

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:20.960
mentality, right?

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.016
Our company just made our
quarterly earnings report.

00:29:24.016 --> 00:29:25.890
We just got featured in
"The New York Times."

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:28.389
Like, these are the things that
are about ego and resources.

00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:30.200
They're not about purpose.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.980
Cultures that actually celebrate
the generation of purpose

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.610
are much more likely to then
build a culture and support

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.360
people around purpose.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.790
We're also doing some
incredible experimentation

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.990
around the role of purpose
in social networks.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.370
And what we've
done internally is

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:47.860
we asked people on our
team to identify someone

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.210
in our database who has the
exact same purpose type as them

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.392
but has a job that they would
never want and thinks sucks.

00:29:54.392 --> 00:29:56.600
Like, pick someone over
there who was doing something

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.520
that you would never want to do.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.110
And shoot them an
email, and say, hey,

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:02.180
can we get together and talk
about what you do for a living?

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.940
I'm really curious
to hear how you

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.930
generate purpose in that job.

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:08.060
And two things
consistently happen.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.610
The first is they
become immediate BFFs.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:11.801
They're, like, oh, my god.

00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:12.300
Me, too.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.424
I totally love that, right?

00:30:13.424 --> 00:30:15.729
Because they're of
the same purpose type,

00:30:15.729 --> 00:30:18.020
and they connect on a totally
different level than they

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.202
do with other people.

00:30:19.202 --> 00:30:20.660
The second thing
we've heard almost

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.520
always is, that sounds
like such an awesome job.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.011
I would totally
love to do that job.

00:30:26.011 --> 00:30:27.740
This is a job that
they decided and they

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:30.654
picked because they thought
it would suck, right?

00:30:30.654 --> 00:30:32.820
And the reason this is, is,
one, our social networks

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.220
today don't connect us based
on the things that matter.

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.720
They connect us
around universities.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.130
They connect is around
jobs, gender, ethnicity.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:41.590
They don't connect us on who
we are as human beings, right?

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.432
So social networks are
incredibly shallow.

00:30:44.432 --> 00:30:45.890
The second thing
is, we tend to get

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.756
career advice from
the wrong people.

00:30:47.756 --> 00:30:49.130
We get career
advice from someone

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:50.704
who is of a different
purpose type,

00:30:50.704 --> 00:30:52.120
and they describe
what that job is

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.876
like for someone of
their purpose type.

00:30:53.876 --> 00:30:56.125
They don't describe it from
the perspective of someone

00:30:56.125 --> 00:30:58.200
who shares a purpose
type and therefore looks

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.740
at it through the same lens.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.470
So when we talk to our parents,
coworkers, our parents'

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.984
friends, someone we
meet at a conference,

00:31:04.984 --> 00:31:07.150
we're getting it through
the filter of how they find

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:09.150
purpose, not how
you find purpose.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.670
And therefore, it's incredibly
misleading data, right?

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:13.940
It's bad data.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.920
And this, we're finding, is
an incredibly powerful way

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.260
to change the way we
do social networking.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.600
So I want to talk a little bit
about this job crafting, which

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.537
has been studied, again, by
those three universities.

00:31:26.537 --> 00:31:28.620
And I think it's really
important in understanding

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.324
how work needs to change.

00:31:30.324 --> 00:31:31.490
And work is going to change.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.270
I mean, by the end of this
decade, 40% of the work force

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:37.380
is going to be freelancers, 40%.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.770
The average job tenure
now is two years.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:41.440
People are working
in portfolio careers.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.942
Like, work is
radically different

00:31:42.942 --> 00:31:44.650
than I knew it when
I came out of college

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:47.850
and insanely radically
different than my parents.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:50.827
Job crafting, to me, is like
the most promising sort of wave

00:31:50.827 --> 00:31:51.535
approaching this.

00:31:51.535 --> 00:31:52.330
And I mentioned it earlier.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.663
So I wanted to go through a
little bit of the case study

00:31:54.663 --> 00:31:56.930
and what the researchers saw.

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.600
This is a hospital orderly
or cleaning person.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:03.661
Does anyone know anyone
who is in that profession?

00:32:03.661 --> 00:32:04.160
Not one.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.920
So I can make up complete
lies, and none of you

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.090
will know any different.

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:08.490
Awesome.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:12.100
So this is one of the worst
jobs out there for two reasons.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.450
You're literally
cleaning up shit,

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:16.431
and you're treated like shit.

00:32:16.431 --> 00:32:17.930
So these people
literally are having

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:20.471
to clean up after dead bodies,
people who have just thrown up

00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:22.510
everywhere, people who
have, like, wounds.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.670
I mean, they're
literally doing, like,

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.710
fundamentally dirty work, right?

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:29.290
Secondly, nurses and doctors--
and in reading this research,

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:31.710
like, I came to tears
several times-- treat

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.350
these people worse
than any career

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:35.805
I've ever heard, in terms of
treating them as subhuman--

00:32:35.805 --> 00:32:38.110
and that language is
literally used-- treating them

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.864
like furniture, disrespecting
them in so many different ways.

00:32:40.864 --> 00:32:42.780
And the next time you're
at a hospital, watch.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.350
You'll see how they're not
even thought of as human beings

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:48.670
and how they're treated
around the hospital.

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:51.650
But again, a third of these
people roughly love their jobs

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:53.499
and find them incredibly
full of purpose.

00:32:53.499 --> 00:32:55.040
So the question
became, what the hell

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.206
was wrong with these people?

00:32:56.206 --> 00:32:58.590
How dare they like their jobs,
given how awful they are,

00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:59.090
right?

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.730
What were they doing
to make this viable?

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.910
And what was interesting
was, when the doctors

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:08.225
and nurses weren't looking,
they were singing to patients.

00:33:08.225 --> 00:33:10.850
They were dancing with patients.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.071
And many of them were
telling jokes, not

00:33:14.071 --> 00:33:15.320
part of their job description.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.550
They were crafting it
in a different way.

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:21.770
They described their work
as, as important as doctors

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:22.315
and nurses.

00:33:22.315 --> 00:33:23.940
And if you asked
them, what's your job,

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:25.540
they take care of patients.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:28.300
They don't see patients solely
as someone to clean up after.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.010
They actually saw it that
way, even though that was not

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:31.540
part of their job description.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:34.760
And the most moving thing I
read was, in a long-term care

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.070
facility, they actually
move art around

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:39.630
so that patients wouldn't
have to look at the same art.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.720
They frequently were
doing things, way more

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:45.099
than doctors or nurses, to help
people's family and friends

00:33:45.099 --> 00:33:47.390
connect with them and to help
provide emotional support

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.440
to them, because doctors
and nurses were too busy

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.280
and didn't care.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.530
They were often like the
front-line social workers.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.910
They were the ones helping to
provide connections for folks.

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:57.750
They had made themselves
into a vital part

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:59.530
of the caring
institution, not just

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.340
someone who cleans
up a mess, right?

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.800
They had not changed their job.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.369
None of them stopped cleaning.

00:34:05.369 --> 00:34:06.910
None of them stopped
doing their job.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:10.090
But they changed that 10%
to 20% that fundamentally

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.750
went from being a bad
job into a great job,

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:16.330
because they crafted it, they
tailored it to their needs

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.290
and their need for purpose.

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:21.600
They did this around
three things, the tasks

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.250
that they actually
did-- so it was not

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:24.389
one of their tasks to sing.

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:26.332
It was not in their
job description.

00:34:26.332 --> 00:34:28.040
No one tested them
when they took the job

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.620
to see what jokes they
could tell-- relationships--

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.239
they changed fundamentally the
relationship with a patient

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:37.780
from someone who makes a
mess to someone I care for--

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.320
and they changed perception.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.870
Their job was not just cleaning.

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:43.940
Their job was to be
the human being that's

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.600
connecting with these patients,
because doctors and nurses were

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.530
most often not acting
like human beings, right?

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:52.719
They had crafted the job
to make it rich in purpose.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:55.290
And again, if they can
do this in a job that's

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.835
that dirty and
that disrespected,

00:34:57.835 --> 00:34:59.210
again, there's
very little excuse

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:02.430
for how we can't, in any
job we have in this room,

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:05.110
figure out how we can do the
equivalent of singing, dancing,

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.630
and telling jokes, caring for
families, moving art around.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:11.630
There is so much more we
can do to optimize purpose.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.630
And I think this is
the key for managers--

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:16.800
it's the key for, like,
the next generation of HR--

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.070
to try to help us all
do that 10% to 20%

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:21.920
crafting to really make it ours,
instead of just taking a job

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.830
description as
off-the-rack clothing

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:27.270
that just kind of fits, right?

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:31.280
I saw this happen somewhere
that I would least expect it.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.300
I went into this company,
Cornerstone Capital,

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.690
in Midtown in New York.

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:38.321
And it's all people wearing
black suits, investment

00:35:38.321 --> 00:35:38.820
bankers.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.528
And I was, like,
finally, I found a place

00:35:40.528 --> 00:35:44.160
where there's no chance there
is purpose in this place, right?

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.994
There's no way, right?

00:35:45.994 --> 00:35:47.410
And I walk in the
door, and, like,

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.530
you could literally
feel waves of purpose

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.572
coming out of the office.

00:35:50.572 --> 00:35:52.571
And I was, like, what the
hell is going on here?

00:35:52.571 --> 00:35:53.560
This is not right.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.040
How dare there be purpose
in Midtown, right?

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.744
So I went and met with the
CEO, and I asked her, like,

00:35:58.744 --> 00:35:59.410
what's going on?

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:00.460
Your culture is insane.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.710
It's so awesome.

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:04.100
These folks are,
like, so incredible.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.390
What is your secret recipe?

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:08.540
And what I found out was,
that, without technology,

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.870
without academics,
without anything, she

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:13.970
had naturally,
organically, created

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:16.600
a culture of job crafting,
of exactly what I had just

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.750
described.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:21.130
And she did it in a really
simple but profound way.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:25.070
She asked people regularly,
hey, how are you doing?

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.890
How many of you ask
that of other people?

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:29.922
And how many of you
actually mean it?

00:36:29.922 --> 00:36:31.880
So I'm one of those people
who usually doesn't.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:32.990
I'm usually, hey, what's up?

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.960
It's like you're
just in passing.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:34.835
Hey, what's going on?

00:36:34.835 --> 00:36:36.660
They're like, hey,
good to see you, right?

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.000
She actually asks,
and she really

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.450
wants to know the answer.

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:42.880
And if someone says, oh I'm
having a good day, she says,

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.838
that's not good enough.

00:36:43.838 --> 00:36:46.032
You need to tell me what
today made it a good day.

00:36:46.032 --> 00:36:47.240
What was that purpose moment?

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.160
What was that moment that
made it a good day, right?

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.350
And she asks this over a
couple weeks or a month.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:54.281
And she starts to
see patterns emerge.

00:36:54.281 --> 00:36:56.405
And based on that, she
starts to change their jobs.

00:36:56.405 --> 00:36:59.160
She starts to find them projects
that she knows would likely

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.790
create those moments she saw.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.830
She crafts their jobs around
who they are as human beings,

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:08.210
based on a process of job
crafting in real time.

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:10.160
And this is something
that we can all

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.840
do for each other, right,
just by asking each other,

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.760
how was your day, and asking
for moments that matter to them,

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.129
and helping them recognize
moments of purpose,

00:37:18.129 --> 00:37:20.545
and finding ways, when we come
across our product, to say,

00:37:20.545 --> 00:37:22.710
hey, that looks like a great
project for this person,

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.440
because I know these are the
kind of things that are going

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.750
to generate purpose for them.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:26.880
You don't have to be a CEO.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.463
You don't even have
to be the manager.

00:37:28.463 --> 00:37:30.230
You can do this for
co-workers, by simply

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:32.790
helping them become aware
of what's generating purpose

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:34.970
for them, and helping
push them, and helping

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:37.455
them get to access
these other things.

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:39.810
From my point of view, and
what I've seen and heard

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.320
reinforced as I've traveled
across the world talking

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.760
about this book and
the work at Imperative,

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.090
is that the purpose
economy is coming.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:48.790
In the next 10 to
20 years, we're

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:51.350
likely to see a major
shift in every industry.

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:54.720
And we're already seeing it in
retail, finance, health care.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.100
We're seeing radical changes
that are all around humanizing

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.970
industry again, bringing
it back to purpose.

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:02.720
And there are really
two choices you have.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.830
You can bust out an umbrella,
or you can bust out a surfboard.

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:08.360
And if you bust out
a surfboard, you

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.100
have a much greater chance of
not only surviving but also

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.260
having a great time
in the process.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.129
And that's my core
message, which is,

00:38:15.129 --> 00:38:16.170
this change is happening.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.607
How can you anticipate
it, grab your surfboard

00:38:18.607 --> 00:38:20.190
and enjoy it, and
make the most of it?

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:23.104
Because I think it's going to
be an incredibly thrilling time.

00:38:23.104 --> 00:38:25.520
It's going to be a time of
great innovation and innovation

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.642
that's fundamentally about
our needs as human beings.

00:38:29.642 --> 00:38:31.100
You know, I think
it's interesting,

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.474
as Google-- because
you guys are,

00:38:32.474 --> 00:38:35.280
you know, an 800-pound
gorilla in the information

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.900
economy right now--
to think about,

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.960
how does this company
continue to thrive that way

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.080
but, at the same time,
prepare for the next economy

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.860
and not do what
Detroit did, which

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.320
was assume that what
got them there was going

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.360
to be what keeps
them there, right?

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.564
That was Detroit's hubris.

00:38:49.564 --> 00:38:51.230
And the question is,
will Silicon Valley

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.540
have the same hubris of
thinking-- the information

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.230
economy is the last stop
on the train-- or will they

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:59.560
fundamentally see whether
or not this is just one step

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.000
and a need to constantly
evolve and not just

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.690
rest on what worked in the past.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.870
So with that, I want to
open it up for discussion.

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.444
I also wanted to share
my email address.

00:39:09.444 --> 00:39:11.610
It's really important to
me to always be accessible.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.440
As you saw in writing my
book, all the work I do

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.834
is done by a community.

00:39:15.834 --> 00:39:17.250
And I'm really
excited to have you

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.542
guys as part of that community,
helping me to identify,

00:39:19.542 --> 00:39:21.833
as Court said, these different
trends that are going on

00:39:21.833 --> 00:39:23.790
and opportunities
in this new economy

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:25.655
so that we can really,
together, build

00:39:25.655 --> 00:39:27.720
an economy that's
built for human beings.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.750
So with that, if
there's any questions,

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:33.465
I would love to open it up.

00:39:33.465 --> 00:39:36.220
AUDIENCE: So the
purpose diagnostic

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.670
you mentioned, is that
available to the public, anyone

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:39.470
can go on your site and take it?

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:41.178
AARON HURST: Yeah,
yeah, it's a free tool

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:44.104
that we built on the website
as sort of our first step

00:39:44.104 --> 00:39:46.270
in the building out of our
platform, which is really

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:48.210
going to be about helping
you discover purpose

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:51.140
and then connect to people,
jobs, opportunities,

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.370
projects that will
generate a purpose for you

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:54.280
based on who you are.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:54.906
AUDIENCE: OK, great.

00:39:54.906 --> 00:39:55.410
That's terrific.

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:55.903
AARON HURST: Yeah.

00:39:55.903 --> 00:39:56.930
So yeah, check it out.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:58.275
The price is right.

00:39:58.275 --> 00:39:59.165
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:59.165 --> 00:40:00.726
AARON HURST: Yeah?

00:40:00.726 --> 00:40:03.530
AUDIENCE: Earlier you mentioned
the three different areas,

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:06.370
whether it's calling or
career, and you said something

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.620
like it's kind of instilled
early on and how you're raised.

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:13.290
Do you have any best
tactics to maybe fight

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:15.460
against if you think you
might have been raised

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:18.020
one way or your parents
were kind of on one side

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:21.410
but you feel like the
calling purpose is really

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:24.065
what's going to elevate
how you do your daily work

00:40:24.065 --> 00:40:24.690
and everything?

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:25.430
AARON HURST: Yeah,
there hasn't been

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:27.480
a lot of research on
how to actually shift it

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.390
once it's set in
your adolescence.

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:30.240
So I think the first
thing I would say--

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.520
is anyone a parent in
this room, anyone aspiring

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.240
to be a parent at some
point in their lives--

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.150
I think it's so
important as a parent

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:41.080
to understand what role
you play in imprinting this

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.610
on your kids, especially
in their adolescence,

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:45.986
around how do you
model for them.

00:40:45.986 --> 00:40:47.401
It doesn't have
to be what you do,

00:40:47.401 --> 00:40:48.950
but it's what they
perceive, right?

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:51.075
So even if you, deep
down, really are this job,

00:40:51.075 --> 00:40:53.491
but you recognize for your kid
to be better to be calling,

00:40:53.491 --> 00:40:56.190
see if you can trick them.

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:57.740
They need to perceive
you as thinking

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.884
about work as something
that adds value

00:40:59.884 --> 00:41:02.050
and not practicing coming
home from work complaining

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:05.110
about work and how awful it
is, instead bringing home

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:07.250
the questions and seeing
work as an integrated

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:08.280
part of your life.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.738
So that's the most
important thing,

00:41:09.738 --> 00:41:12.110
is just to be parents who
model this the right way.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.570
I think if you haven't
been raised that way

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:16.320
and you're trying to
figure out how do you

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.210
change that, my sense of
it, from what I've read,

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:22.284
is that the first step is you
have to let go of that story.

00:41:22.284 --> 00:41:23.950
Because we each walk
around with stories

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:25.120
that make our life workable.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.507
They're the things that
help explain our behavior,

00:41:27.507 --> 00:41:28.840
explain the way the world works.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.280
And it's incredibly scary
to let go of those things,

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.060
because those are
the things that

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.230
make us feel comfortable
operating in the world.

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:35.980
So before you can build
a new perspective,

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.090
you have to, to some
degree, let go and tear down

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:39.970
that old model.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:41.929
And that's a really hard
and scary thing to do.

00:41:41.929 --> 00:41:43.386
And I think it's
probably something

00:41:43.386 --> 00:41:45.550
that requires something
like a boot camp

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:47.380
to get yourself to
just let go of that

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:51.160
and to feel like you're still
OK naked without that story.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.179
And then starting to
become self-aware--

00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:55.720
and I think the best
practice is just

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.160
daily journaling of nothing
longer than a tweet,

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.970
like just a sentence or two,
of what was a moment today that

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:02.467
brought you purpose--
and starting

00:42:02.467 --> 00:42:04.050
to build self-awareness
about the fact

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:05.780
that purpose is in
your job already.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:06.690
It's all around you.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:09.410
But you have to build up an
appreciation, a consciousness

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:12.270
of it and not just take
that all for granted.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:14.770
We had someone take this
purpose diagnostic on our site.

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:17.692
And he emailed us and said,
shit, I just quit my job.

00:42:17.692 --> 00:42:19.650
And I just realized, by
taking this diagnostic,

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:21.127
I shouldn't have quit my job.

00:42:21.127 --> 00:42:23.210
I was getting so much
purpose, but I was taking it

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:25.520
for granted and just assumed
you could get that in any job.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.010
And I realize now how much I
love the people I worked with,

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:29.926
how I was doing something
greater than myself,

00:42:29.926 --> 00:42:31.900
and how much opportunity
I had for growth.

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:34.316
But it just sort of was always,
like, the grass was always

00:42:34.316 --> 00:42:35.270
greener.

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:36.840
So it's so important
just to take

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.650
stock of what you already have.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:41.810
AUDIENCE: So it
sounds really great,

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:43.890
if the purpose
economy is coming.

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:46.530
But why do you have such a
rosy forecast for the future?

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:47.946
Because I think,
you know, there's

00:42:47.946 --> 00:42:50.570
plenty of kind of cynicism and
dehumanization in the world

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:51.740
and in all of the
future forecasts.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:52.120
AARON HURST: Yeah.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.715
AUDIENCE: So why are
you so optimistic

00:42:53.715 --> 00:42:56.456
that that will change?

00:42:56.456 --> 00:42:57.680
AARON HURST: I'm an optimist.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.480
So I'll start with that.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.720
Like, if this was AA, I'd
be, like, my name is Aaron,

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.720
and I'm an optimist.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:07.060
I have found that, first of
all, optimism tends to breed

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.650
results, whereas
pessimism doesn't.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:12.170
So in building this case,
building this story,

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.110
building a community
of people around it,

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:16.070
it's infinitely more
likely to happen.

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:16.790
So first of all.

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:20.630
I think, second of all, is I
look at, again, health care.

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:21.680
I look at finance.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:22.760
I look at retail.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:23.692
I look at education.

00:43:23.692 --> 00:43:25.650
And I look at where the
innovation's happening.

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.550
And there are a lot of
things we have to overcome.

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:29.200
But I look at where
the innovation is.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.600
There's a lot of
reason for hope.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.141
And I think there
are a lot of trends

00:43:32.141 --> 00:43:34.846
that are happening around
the world around us that

00:43:34.846 --> 00:43:37.220
point to purpose and point to
these innovations as what's

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:37.970
happening.

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:39.590
And I see in the
millennial generation

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:40.798
the greatest reason for hope.

00:43:40.798 --> 00:43:43.820
And I think the millennial
generation values purpose more

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.029
than any previous generation.

00:43:45.029 --> 00:43:46.694
Because, again, it's
a generation that's

00:43:46.694 --> 00:43:49.035
about relationships, it's
about doing something greater

00:43:49.035 --> 00:43:51.036
than themselves, and it's
about personal growth.

00:43:51.036 --> 00:43:52.576
So I feel like, with
this generation,

00:43:52.576 --> 00:43:54.920
there is so much reason for
hope and to clean up so many

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.336
of the messes that have been
made by previous generations,

00:43:57.336 --> 00:43:58.110
to be candid.

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:00.690
And I think that that
generation in and of itself

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:05.220
is probably the one that gives
me the greatest hope for this.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.730
You know, I'm a
Jewish New Yorker,

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:10.480
and I can paint you a really
horrible picture the world.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.439
And I can, right now,
tell you the perfect case

00:44:12.439 --> 00:44:14.688
for why I don't even think
the human race will be here

00:44:14.688 --> 00:44:17.410
in five years, if you
wanted to go down that path

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:19.230
and think about a
doomsday scenario.

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:21.313
But I think there's a lot
more reason for optimism

00:44:21.313 --> 00:44:22.434
than pessimism right now.

00:44:22.434 --> 00:44:24.100
And every time I meet
with a millennial,

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:26.372
and every time I meet with
one of these companies

00:44:26.372 --> 00:44:27.830
or nonprofits or
governments that's

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:30.490
innovating in this
space, it's hard to not

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:32.720
walk away incredibly optimistic.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.580
AUDIENCE: So is this sort
of another way of saying,

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.530
purpose-driven
people and companies

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:39.490
out-compete other
people in companies,

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:42.237
and so they're going to
gain market mindshare

00:44:42.237 --> 00:44:43.570
in the world over the next year?

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:43.670
AARON HURST: Yeah.

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:44.910
So this is what I
think will happen.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:46.409
I'm already seeing
this in the data.

00:44:46.409 --> 00:44:48.540
From a workforce point
of view, employers

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.520
that aren't able
to provide purpose

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.770
to their employees and
individual employees who

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:54.490
are not purpose-oriented
are going

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:56.917
to find that the market is
not as responsive to them.

00:44:56.917 --> 00:44:59.000
So it is going to become
economically in your best

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.958
interests to be purpose-driven
as an individual

00:45:00.958 --> 00:45:02.890
and as an organization
to be able to create

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.510
the place those
people want to work.

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.426
Because it's going to
be increasingly obvious,

00:45:06.426 --> 00:45:08.500
those are the people you
want in your company.

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.458
So that's sort of one,
which goes to that data.

00:45:12.922 --> 00:45:14.130
And you see that, by the way.

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:16.060
Like, all the major
consulting firms now,

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:18.030
they lead almost
entirely with purpose

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:19.134
as what they're selling.

00:45:19.134 --> 00:45:20.550
And, in fact, their
big conference

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:21.800
is around marketing purpose.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.550
Like, that's what
consulting firms are now

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.814
having to sell to get the
best talent into their firms

00:45:25.814 --> 00:45:26.980
and not just about pro bono.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.930
And I think the other big
piece is around retail, right?

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:32.370
And you see what's
happening with retail

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:33.610
and the fundamental shifts.

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:35.465
And you see that in
the maker economy.

00:45:35.465 --> 00:45:37.580
You see it in the
sharing economy,

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:40.165
across all these
different innovations.

00:45:40.165 --> 00:45:41.540
More and more of
these industries

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:45.040
are being disrupted
by disintermediated,

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.762
purpose-oriented businesses.

00:45:46.762 --> 00:45:48.595
And that's going to
also create that change.

00:45:48.595 --> 00:45:50.178
So you have it both
from the workplace

00:45:50.178 --> 00:45:53.005
and from a retail perspective
seeing that change.

00:45:53.005 --> 00:45:54.040
Is it guaranteed?

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:54.620
No.

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:55.995
I would guarantee
that there will

00:45:55.995 --> 00:45:58.286
be another economy
after this one.

00:45:58.286 --> 00:45:59.660
I think it's going
to be purpose.

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:03.035
I, again, very sincerely say,
to a group of very smart people,

00:46:03.035 --> 00:46:05.660
think about it, and tell me what
you think the next economy is,

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.035
if you think it's
something else.

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:12.221
AUDIENCE: Do you see this as
a US phenomenon or global?

00:46:12.221 --> 00:46:13.720
Or how is it in
different countries?

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:14.928
AARON HURST: Good to see you.

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.580
I have experienced it globally
as I have travelled around

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:20.080
the world.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.746
And I haven't traveled
to every country.

00:46:21.746 --> 00:46:23.792
I haven't even traveled
to every state.

00:46:23.792 --> 00:46:25.500
I think it will evolve
in different ways.

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.083
And I'm struggling
somewhat, honestly,

00:46:27.083 --> 00:46:30.040
with this question because
the sort of one narrative

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.860
is, each country and culture
has to go through this rise

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:35.040
from agrarian,
industrial, information,

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.450
and purpose, right?

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:39.290
And there are some economies
that are still agrarian.

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:41.900
So you could just say, from an
innovation curve standpoint,

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.450
they're going to have to go
through those different steps.

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:46.480
To be able to get to the
point where their economy is

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.790
fundamentally driven
by purpose, they're

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:49.940
going to need to have the
industrial infrastructure,

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.314
then the information economy
infrastructure, then they'll

00:46:52.314 --> 00:46:54.740
get there.

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:56.360
And I've already
seen it in China.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:59.180
I've seen it throughout Europe.

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:02.569
Purpose economy businesses are
disrupting the marketplace.

00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:04.610
And China's one of the
most fascinating examples.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:06.760
Because there, you've got
an incredible challenge--

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:10.050
when I was talking to business
students there-- at one hand,

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:13.420
they've got capitalism,
an incredible excitement

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:14.320
of capitalism.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.545
But they all were raised on
a belief in a collective good

00:47:17.545 --> 00:47:19.670
and trying to figure out
how to reconcile those two

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:22.475
things, and looking to
the US for examples,

00:47:22.475 --> 00:47:24.600
largely in Europe, of how
do you create businesses,

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.020
how do you create
approaches that

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:29.844
can reconcile those
two sets of beliefs.

00:47:29.844 --> 00:47:32.260
And I think a lot of the ideas
behind this really resonate

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.580
with the next generation
of entrepreneurs in China,

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:38.200
around how do we create
things that both represent

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.940
the old values of China and
the new values of China.

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:44.230
The piece I struggle with is,
I think purpose is universal.

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:46.390
And I think, obviously,
people experience purpose

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:48.340
in every culture,
in every country,

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:52.350
no matter what the poverty is,
what the economic reality is.

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:54.620
But in terms of being
an economic driver,

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:56.641
I don't think it likely
will emerge as dominant

00:47:56.641 --> 00:47:58.890
until companies have gone
through these other economic

00:47:58.890 --> 00:47:59.925
stages.

00:47:59.925 --> 00:48:02.790
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering if you
can talk more about guidance

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:04.692
you would give to
parents in the room.

00:48:04.692 --> 00:48:06.150
And then, the other
question I have

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:09.200
is, can you cite some examples
of this where it's happening?

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.050
I mean, I can think of a few,
like Teach for America, NGOs,

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:15.120
and other things like this.

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.600
Even open-source software
is, I think, another one.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:21.647
So guidance for parents of young
kids and more examples, please.

00:48:21.647 --> 00:48:23.730
AARON HURST: So I'll start
with the parents piece.

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:25.480
And I'll tell you a
little bit about what

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:26.981
I do as sort of
the best example.

00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:28.980
I don't like to give
advice I don't take myself,

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:30.720
because that's cheap.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.260
I think one is just the way you
talk to your kids about work

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:35.555
and the role of work in your
life is really important.

00:48:35.555 --> 00:48:37.180
And actually, the
last time I was here,

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.450
when my kids' book came
out, "Mommy and Daddy

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:41.620
do it Pro Bono," which
I wrote with my wife,

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:45.240
which is all about the impact of
work in different professions.

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.470
And I just find it so
important to talk to our kids

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:48.800
about why we work.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.951
Why is it we're away from
them for 50 hours a week?

00:48:50.951 --> 00:48:51.700
What are we doing?

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.009
What value are we creating?

00:48:53.009 --> 00:48:55.050
And it's also really
important to bring your kids

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:56.059
to work regularly.

00:48:56.059 --> 00:48:58.600
So I think that's another thing
that the research has started

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.099
pointing to, is how important
it is for them not to see work

00:49:01.099 --> 00:49:03.760
as this black box that you go to
but actually be able to relate

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.430
to and understand work as a
real thing with real people

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:11.184
and understand why you love it
and enjoy it and why you work.

00:49:11.184 --> 00:49:13.740
The other thing I
would say, which

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:18.700
I do as best I can-- but one
of your Googlers, actually,

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.177
was the key researcher on this
when she was at Michigan--

00:49:21.177 --> 00:49:22.760
really points to the
fact that mothers

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.880
matter a whole hell of
a lot more than fathers

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.260
when it comes to
this imprinting.

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:28.865
And they haven't done research
yet on same-sex couples.

00:49:28.865 --> 00:49:30.490
They haven't done it
on single parents.

00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:32.610
But in the context of,
like, a quote, unquote,

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:37.570
"traditional family," if
you have a good relationship

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:39.700
with your mother,
there's almost no chance

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.924
you will grow up with
a jobs orientation.

00:49:41.924 --> 00:49:43.340
In that research,
I don't believe,

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.240
they didn't find a
single person who

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:48.540
had a jobs mentality, who saw
work only as about money, who

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:52.180
also had a good relationship
with their mother, which

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.440
is pretty interesting, right?

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:57.550
So there's clearly something
about the role of mothers

00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:00.494
in a family setting that's
incredibly important.

00:50:00.494 --> 00:50:01.910
And I've written
a lot about this,

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:05.520
just how important it is for
workplaces to really embrace

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.170
mothers bringing
their kids to work.

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:08.599
And traditionally,
what I've seen,

00:50:08.599 --> 00:50:10.390
for myself, is when I
bring my kids to work

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:11.950
or I bring them
on speaking tours

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:13.910
like this-- which I
do as often as I can--

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:16.355
everyone's like, that's so
awesome, you love your kids,

00:50:16.355 --> 00:50:17.855
you're incorporating
them into work,

00:50:17.855 --> 00:50:19.870
it's so great to see
a dad doing that.

00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:21.550
But if my wife did
the same thing,

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:23.570
it would more likely
be a story of,

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:25.320
like, why can't you
get your act together?

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.640
Why can't you control your kids?

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.860
Why do you need to
bring your kids to work?

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:29.250
Couldn't you find childcare?

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:31.664
We tend to have a double
standard around people

00:50:31.664 --> 00:50:32.580
bringing kids to work.

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:35.230
So I think it's really important
to embrace and encourage

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:37.210
mothers to bring
their kids to work.

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:40.570
And then, the second
question was around examples.

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:42.360
So, you know, I
think, in real estate,

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.590
seeing the rise of shared office
space-- like in New York now,

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:47.330
there are so many
shared office spaces,

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:50.442
where people are working as
freelancers amongst each other

00:50:50.442 --> 00:50:52.650
in these more collective
environments instead of just

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:55.000
being, like, in monolithic
corporate cultures--

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.800
and you see just sort of
this whole sharing economy

00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.640
overall hitting
workspace in a big way.

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.675
And I saw it all
around Europe, as well.

00:51:01.675 --> 00:51:03.300
In retail, you see
companies like Etsy,

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:05.920
that you're enabling
individual makers

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.010
to find a market
for their goods.

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:10.730
I just did a call the
other day with IKEA.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:13.820
And IKEA actually
runs whole malls

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.840
in Europe and in Asia, not
just the standalone stores.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.690
And they're trying to figure
out what does a shopping

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:21.684
mall in the purpose
economy look like.

00:51:21.684 --> 00:51:24.225
And they're sort of seeing it
as this mash-up between an IKEA

00:51:24.225 --> 00:51:28.654
and an Etsy studio in one
place, environments for makers.

00:51:28.654 --> 00:51:30.070
And that's really
sort of like how

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:33.157
a lot of these large developers
are thinking about the shopping

00:51:33.157 --> 00:51:35.490
malls of the future, as if
they're actually places where

00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:37.640
you're making, not
just buying, right?

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.340
So that's a fundamental shift.

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:41.600
In health care, you look
at Kaiser Permanente.

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.340
It's one of the biggest
health care providers.

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:46.530
They're trying to return
to an old model, which

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:48.571
is, it used to be-- and
I thought this was, like,

00:51:48.571 --> 00:51:50.990
thousands of years ago-- but
even, like, 50 years ago,

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:55.040
the majority of times you saw
a doctor were in your home.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.910
They came to you, which right
now sounds fricking crazy,

00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:58.410
right?

00:51:58.410 --> 00:51:59.990
Like, that would never happen.

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:01.790
But if you think
about it rationally,

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:04.309
who's the sick one,
you or the doctor?

00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:06.100
Like, do you ask the
sick person to get out

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.390
of bed or the healthy person
to get out of bed, right?

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:10.055
We go and spend a
bunch of time when

00:52:10.055 --> 00:52:13.250
we're sick-- getting out of
bed, getting to a hospital

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:15.670
room or a doctor's room
full of other sick people--

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:18.090
to see a doctor
for a few minutes.

00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:19.419
It's not the right model.

00:52:19.419 --> 00:52:21.210
And we need to have it
fundamentally where,

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:23.543
when you're sick or you need
attention, it comes do you.

00:52:23.543 --> 00:52:25.340
And Kaiser has made
it their 10-year goal,

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.330
to flip that whole
model on it's head,

00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:30.995
to make relationship-based,
human-centered health

00:52:30.995 --> 00:52:34.040
care the norm in its model.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.860
So that's sort of
another example.

00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:38.350
In education, you
see a major shift

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:41.070
toward customized,
personalized education and away

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:42.860
from an industrial
education model.

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:47.640
The fastest-growing segment of
the US educational population

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.120
right now is homeschooling,
not because homeschooling

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.619
is the model but because people
are realizing that they need

00:52:52.619 --> 00:52:54.180
to be able to
customize education.

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:56.221
And homeschooling's
producing much better results

00:52:56.221 --> 00:52:58.430
than classrooms, right?

00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:00.780
We're starting to see
where we can actually

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:02.350
innovate to make this work.

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:03.420
Those are some examples.

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:06.034
I can go on forever.

00:53:06.034 --> 00:53:06.970
AUDIENCE: Aaron--

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:07.124
AARON HURST: Yeah?

00:53:07.124 --> 00:53:07.393
What's up?

00:53:07.393 --> 00:53:09.190
AUDIENCE: First off,
thank you for the talk.

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.750
AARON HURST: Yeah, of course.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:11.833
AUDIENCE: It was really
inspiring and eye-opening.

00:53:11.833 --> 00:53:13.950
But I had a question.

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:15.037
Can purpose change?

00:53:15.037 --> 00:53:17.120
Or what are your views on
purpose as an individual

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:19.150
and from a cultural perspective?

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:21.540
And, if so, how would
we adapt to that?

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:23.790
AARON HURST: In terms of
what generates purpose for us

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:24.990
individually?

00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:28.210
So I have not seen
a longitudinal study

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:29.820
overall of that question.

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.820
I can only speak to having
worked with thousands

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:35.530
of professionals at
Taproot and other places.

00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:37.490
And I have never seen a change.

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:39.720
What I have seen
is people becoming

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:40.980
more and more self-aware.

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:42.980
So they start off with
thinking purpose is here.

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:45.786
But as they work in the world
and become more self-aware,

00:53:45.786 --> 00:53:47.410
they start to peel
layers of the onion,

00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:50.270
getting closer and closer to
who they are at their core.

00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:51.650
So that's what I've seen.

00:53:56.269 --> 00:53:57.810
Every time I've see
it, it's actually

00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:00.080
been a manifestation
of them simply

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.620
becoming more self-aware
and more awake,

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:05.600
and not just taking what
they see from their friends.

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.070
Most of younger people
early in their career, where

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:09.840
their sense of
purpose comes from,

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.980
they often perceive
it as being about what

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:14.500
they see on the web, what they
see on TV, what they read,

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:15.857
what their friends are doing.

00:54:15.857 --> 00:54:17.690
Like, everyone's into
water all of a sudden,

00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:19.430
and they think that's
what's purpose for them.

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:20.705
It's much more of
a social construct.

00:54:20.705 --> 00:54:22.205
And then, I think,
as you get older,

00:54:22.205 --> 00:54:24.010
you start to get
rid of those things

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:25.740
and start realizing
who you actually are,

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.200
not what your social
environment says you are.

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.820
And therefore, it
appears to change.

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:31.963
But actually, you're just
becoming more self-aware.

00:54:31.963 --> 00:54:32.740
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:33.240
Thank you.

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:33.920
AARON HURST: Yeah.

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:34.600
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:36.641
It's such a very interesting,
fundamental concept

00:54:36.641 --> 00:54:39.020
that you present, job,
career, and calling.

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.940
I just wonder whether
you have historical data

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:45.010
to show in the past that
this makes changes over time?

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:47.270
Are we at the low
point of calling,

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:48.550
or are we at the high point
of calling [INAUDIBLE] future?

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:50.758
AARON HURST: Yeah, yeah,
and that's a great question.

00:54:50.758 --> 00:54:52.510
So all of this
research is so new.

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:54.410
So your question would
be, like, how fast

00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:57.820
was the internet in the 1960s?

00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:58.670
It wasn't, right?

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:00.865
So I think the challenge
is this research is so new,

00:55:00.865 --> 00:55:03.380
there hasn't been a longitudinal
look at, like, 10, 20,

00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:04.585
or 30 years ago.

00:55:04.585 --> 00:55:06.714
And it's also been
US-centric, right?

00:55:06.714 --> 00:55:08.130
So, I mean, one
of the areas where

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:10.320
I would love to see
additional research investment

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:14.000
is in longitudinal but
then also going and seeing,

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.170
in different countries,
how does this change

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:19.200
with different cultures, right,
to see how that plays out,

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.590
and across different
generations.

00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:23.340
Like, do boomers tend to
have a different distribution

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:25.980
than Gen X or
millennials, right?

00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:29.150
Again, we're just at the
tip of this research, right?

00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:30.840
There are so many
awesome questions,

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.200
which is the perfect
time for somebody

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.200
like me to get involved.

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.010
Because you can still
look smart asking

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:37.120
really simple basic
questions, because we're not

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.754
yet at those little
minutia questions,

00:55:38.754 --> 00:55:40.420
where we are with a
lot of other places.

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.220
You can still ask
really simple questions,

00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:43.230
and no one's answered them.

00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:45.271
And it's a chance to go
out there and really make

00:55:45.271 --> 00:55:46.070
an impact.

00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:48.150
So keep on asking the question.

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:50.610
And I know Google does a lot
of great research on work

00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:53.600
and has the largest,
most robust team looking

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.359
at the analytics and
research of work.

00:55:55.359 --> 00:55:57.525
I think these are the
questions that we collectively

00:55:57.525 --> 00:55:58.770
need to answer.

00:55:58.770 --> 00:55:59.460
COURT DIMON: Thank
you very much, Aaron.

00:55:59.460 --> 00:55:59.690
Great speech.

00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:00.110
AARON HURST: Yeah, thank you.

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:00.730
It was great.

00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:01.930
Thank you, guys.

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:07.080
[APPLAUSE]
