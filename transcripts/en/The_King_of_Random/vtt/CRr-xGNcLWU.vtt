00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
[Captions by Y Translator]
Previously, we made some
Angry Birds and a slingshot,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.000
and now we need some targets.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.677
So today we're going to make
some targets by taking eggs,

00:00:06.677 --> 00:00:09.180
painting them to look
like fragile green pigs,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.100
setting them up,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.760
and then using the slingshot
and birds to knock them down.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:21.100
[music]

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.100
We've got our birds made.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.500
We've got our catapult built.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.500
Now, what we need is some pigs.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.600
And it may seem a little strange,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.600
but what we are going
to use for pigs is eggs.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.000
And I know, eggs are more like the birds.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.980
But, in the game the pigs
are extremely fragile.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.920
One little bump,
and they just poof into dust.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.560
And I figured if we use eggs,
then will easily be able to see

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.900
if they get broken or
even just slightly injured.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.200
Here's the basic plan.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.200
We've got our birds.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.300
We've got our slingshot.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.500
So now we need targets.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.000
And we're going to be painting
some eggs to look like green pigs,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.560
setting them up in towers,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.000
and using a slingshot
to shoot our birds at the targets.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:13.380
[music]

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.560
Green eggs and ham,
green eggs as ham.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.920
Green eggs, and then they're pigs.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.680
Green eggs as ham, but yep.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.620
Yep.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:59.900
[music]

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.300
All right, little bird,
let's see what you can do.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.700
HA! Direct Hit.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.358
Yeah, that piggy egg is dead.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.400
I got him.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.000
I like that.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.800
It didn't hit the blocks
of wood and fall over.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.200
I just smashed him directly.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.600
Yes!

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.700
Destruction!

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.700
Broken egg, broken egg.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.400
Well, that guy's only leaking a little,
bit but in Angry Birds that's enough.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.070
They just puff and turn
to dust when you get them.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.120
Well, he is broken.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:43.160
[music]

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.940
Two success is in a row.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.860
[music]

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.520
Oh!

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.820
Half points.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.060
Oh no.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.500
Well, that's one pig
definitely got squished in there.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.740
The building fell on him.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.060
[music]

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.300
It's gone.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.140
That's all of them.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.400
Three, two, one.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:26.360
[music]

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.900
I think a couple of them survived.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.020
At least one of them.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.900
This guy somehow managed to
roll down and land on the soft grass

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.260
without getting injured.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.740
Way to go, pig!

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:52.720
[music]

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.500
His face is nicely presented their.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.700
Giant Angry Birds slingshot,
real life projectiles cracking eggs.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.100
Everything you've ever hoped for.
This is a lot of fun, now

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.200
I just got to figure out what
to do with a giant slingshot.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.080
I think I might get one of those
water balloon slingshots,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.500
and just permanently attach it to here.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.100
Like just one person launch
water balloons like 300 feet.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.940
That should be great.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.360
This was awesome.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.700
Guys that's not all.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.700
