hi I'm Maggie and I wanted to know what

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550
hi I'm Maggie and I wanted to know what
 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.700
hi I'm Maggie and I wanted to know what
the future of the universe is and what

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710
the future of the universe is and what
 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.590
the future of the universe is and what
is our place in it according to physics

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600
is our place in it according to physics
 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.850
is our place in it according to physics
and engineering Thank You Maggie the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860
and engineering Thank You Maggie the
 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.549
and engineering Thank You Maggie the
future of the universe that's literally

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559
future of the universe that's literally
 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.420
future of the universe that's literally
a big question first of all the universe

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430
a big question first of all the universe
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.250
a big question first of all the universe
is accelerating and when I was your age

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260
is accelerating and when I was your age
 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.090
is accelerating and when I was your age
everybody thought the universe was

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100
everybody thought the universe was
 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.740
everybody thought the universe was
slowing down everybody thought the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750
slowing down everybody thought the
 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.179
slowing down everybody thought the
universe was going slower and slower but

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189
universe was going slower and slower but
 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.300
universe was going slower and slower but
turns out is going faster and faster and

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310
turns out is going faster and faster and
 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.669
turns out is going faster and faster and
nobody knows why so when it comes to

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679
nobody knows why so when it comes to
 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.100
nobody knows why so when it comes to
predicting the future of the universe

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110
predicting the future of the universe
 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.080
predicting the future of the universe
there's just got to be a an enormous

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
there's just got to be a an enormous
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.490
there's just got to be a an enormous
amount of information that we don't know

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500
amount of information that we don't know
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.950
amount of information that we don't know
anything about and that will help us

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960
anything about and that will help us
 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.619
anything about and that will help us
figure out what the future might be but

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629
figure out what the future might be but
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.090
figure out what the future might be but
I gotta tell you I think the universe

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100
I gotta tell you I think the universe
 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.319
I gotta tell you I think the universe
will keep going whether or not we're

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329
will keep going whether or not we're
 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.090
will keep going whether or not we're
here I mean that's just what it seems

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
here I mean that's just what it seems
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.860
here I mean that's just what it seems
like I've watched a lot of people come

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
like I've watched a lot of people come
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.990
like I've watched a lot of people come
and go and just seems like the world

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
and go and just seems like the world
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.369
and go and just seems like the world
keeps spinning and the universe keeps

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379
keeps spinning and the universe keeps
 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.410
keeps spinning and the universe keeps
circulating ever so slowly actually the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420
circulating ever so slowly actually the
 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.689
circulating ever so slowly actually the
enormous speeds perceptibly it looks

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699
enormous speeds perceptibly it looks
 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.319
enormous speeds perceptibly it looks
very slow to us with that said it's a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329
very slow to us with that said it's a
 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.850
very slow to us with that said it's a
cool thing to think about and it's also

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860
cool thing to think about and it's also
 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.920
cool thing to think about and it's also
reasonable Maggie that you will in

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
reasonable Maggie that you will in
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.240
reasonable Maggie that you will in
trying to find out what happens in the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
trying to find out what happens in the
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.570
trying to find out what happens in the
future of the universe you'll discover

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580
future of the universe you'll discover
 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.580
future of the universe you'll discover
something amazing something astonishing

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
something amazing something astonishing
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.840
something amazing something astonishing
and it's very reasonable to me that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
and it's very reasonable to me that
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.910
and it's very reasonable to me that
you'll find some source of energy that

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
you'll find some source of energy that
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.600
you'll find some source of energy that
we haven't thought about 94% depends of

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
we haven't thought about 94% depends of
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.310
we haven't thought about 94% depends of
you talked to 96 percent of the universe

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320
you talked to 96 percent of the universe
 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.530
you talked to 96 percent of the universe
is dark matter and dark energy and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
is dark matter and dark energy and
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.359
is dark matter and dark energy and
nobody really knows what that is and

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
nobody really knows what that is and
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.310
nobody really knows what that is and
it's very reasonable if somebody could

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320
it's very reasonable if somebody could
 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.530
it's very reasonable if somebody could
figure out what that is way out in deep

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
figure out what that is way out in deep
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240
figure out what that is way out in deep
space that same stuff is it here

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250
space that same stuff is it here
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.460
space that same stuff is it here
somewhere and if you can figure out what

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470
somewhere and if you can figure out what
 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.370
somewhere and if you can figure out what
that is you could tear I say it change

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380
that is you could tear I say it change
 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.770
that is you could tear I say it change
the world and what I am glad you're

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
the world and what I am glad you're
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.539
the world and what I am glad you're
pondering this but also think about your

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549
pondering this but also think about your
 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.170
pondering this but also think about your
future it's coming up a lot quicker than

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180
future it's coming up a lot quicker than
 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.850
future it's coming up a lot quicker than
like the next the next time the Sun

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
like the next the next time the Sun
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.999
like the next the next time the Sun
becomes a red giant for example but

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009
becomes a red giant for example but
 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.240
becomes a red giant for example but
that's billions of years away
