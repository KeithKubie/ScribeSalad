00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:06.359
Vsauce! Kevin here. With a video giveaway
idea for YouTube’s most prolific philanthropist,

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.600
MrBeast. It gives everyone who watches it,
including you, a chance to win one million

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.980
dollars.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.350
Here are the rules of my hypothetical contest.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.660
MrBeast makes a video and if that video gets
one single like, only one thumbs up in the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.980
first 24 hours -- the person who liked the
video wins a million bucks. However, if more

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.420
than one person smashes that like button,
or nobody clicks it at all, then no one wins

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.480
anything.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.109
Oh, and another thing: only MrBeast can see
whether anyone has liked the video. Everyone

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:50.789
is playing the game blind to the results.
You’ll have no way of knowing whether you’re

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.210
the first and only person to like the video
or the 10 millionth.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.899
So, what do you do? Do you click like and
magically hope you’re the only person who

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.159
did? Do you like the video just to troll the
contest hoping it’ll ruin someone else’s

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.930
chances? Do you just do nothing, and forego
the chance of winning feeling safe in the

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.560
knowledge that you didn’t ruin it for anyone
else? Here’s the biggest question: Is it

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.530
even possible to win this game?

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.570
Welcome to the Platonia Dilemma.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.369
A mathematical game devised by cognitive scientist
Douglas Hofstadter. His version went like

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:39.350
this: 20 people were sent telegrams by fictitious
oil baron S. N. Platonia. If only one person

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.740
replied to the telegram, that person would
win $1 billion dollars. If nobody or more

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.640
than one person replied, no one wins anything.
Collusion, or secretly working together, was

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.780
strictly forbidden, and participants didn’t
even know who the other 19 potential respondents

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.920
were anyway, So, like, they couldn’t all
get together and agree that only number 15

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.510
would reply and the rest of them would split
the billion dollars, y'know, 20 different

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.510
ways.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:23.800
In an attempt to rationally solve this dilemma
in your favor, you face four important questions:

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.360
What should I do? What will other people do?
What should I do after knowing what other

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.610
people will do? What will other people do
after knowing that I know what they’d do?

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.580
And the answers to these questions are...
I don’t know. Not sure. No idea. And who

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.630
knows?! Because the thing is... The more rational
we all are, the more the right answer keeps

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.850
changing. Cheating the game is a good example
of this and we’ll get to that in a bit but...

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.710
To make the best of the Platonia Dilemma,
your rationality alone isn’t enough. No.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.130
No! We need superrationality.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.040
Hofstadter described superrationality as a
state of knowing the perfectly rational thing

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.310
to do, but also knowing that everyone else
knows and will behave that exact same way.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:26.080
So, you know, they know, you know they know,
and you know they know you know. That process

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:34.420
goes on forever, and everyone arrives at the
same exact conclusion. It’s like a rational

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.950
singularity.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.920
Hofstadter decided the best way forward, the
superrational thing to do, was to to roll

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:51.160
a 20-sided or icosahedral die and commit to
only replying to the telegram if his pre-chosen

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.270
number came up. Like the number one.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.460
Here’s why.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.750
The best odds for someone to win this game
occur when you transcend the rationality hyperloop.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.650
You have to move beyond simply trying to figure
out, “What should I do?” “What will

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.460
other people do?” etc. and create an artificial
probability mechanism.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:22.560
If all 20 people in the game act superrationally,
they’ll each roll a 20-sided die once and

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:31.470
commit to replying to the telegram only if
they roll a 1. That leaves about a 37% chance

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:38.540
of somebody winning. It is possible for no
one to roll a 1 and it’s also possible for

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.660
more than one person to roll a 1, so that
means your personal odds of winning are not

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:55.340
1 in 20 which would be 5%, no, your odds of
winning personally are about 2%. But at least

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:04.000
this superrational system leaves the game
up to math instead of everyone just guessing.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.560
Why not cheat, though? Seriously! Uhh. Why
don't you just lie and reply anyway if there’s

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:18.650
only a 37% chance that somebody won? That
way, you would be the winner if none of the

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:28.300
other 19 players rolled a 1. Genius! But if
you know that -- then that means other people

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.639
know that and they’d cheat too, which would
instantly wipe out the boosted odds of winning

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.139
by lying.

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:43.840
The rational thing for you to do is cheat.
But if everyone thinks that, they’ll also

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:52.570
cheat and everyone loses. That’s why the
superrational thing to do is not cheat.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:58.090
Hofstadter even suggested removing the cheat
temptation entirely by using a die-rolling

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:05.870
machine that instantly replied to Platonia
if, and only if, it rolled a 1.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:13.470
But this is all just theoretical, right. It's
really hard to do that with these sticky things.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.660
We don’t actually know how people would
behave in a Platonia-like situation, right?

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.660
Wrong.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.570
It actually happened. Hofstadter convinced
Scientific American to run what he called

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:31.310
a “Luring Lottery” in a 1983 Metamagical
Themas column. The basic rules were a little

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.441
different, but the essence was the same: the
prize for one lucky lottery winner was $1

00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:42.530
million bucks, which would be divided by N,
where N equaled the number of entries mailed

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.530
in.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:49.150
There was, however, a crucial twist. Instead
of each reply counting as one entry, you could

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:54.410
write any number on the postcard and it would
count for that many entries. So, a postcard

00:06:54.410 --> 00:07:00.280
with a 1 on it counts as one entry, and a
postcard with 1,000,000 on it counts as a

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.680
million entries. A higher number of entries
gave the player a better chance of winning,

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.790
but it also reduced the potential prize money.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:15.520
Some people submitted googolplex entries,
which is 10 raised to a googol. Others wrote

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:21.721
mathematical expressions that filled the postcard,
resulting in incalculably high numbers. Which

00:07:21.721 --> 00:07:29.620
meant the total entries hit such an unfathomable
number that Scientific American was unable

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:37.000
to choose a winner… it became impossible.
And even if they could’ve, the winner would’ve

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.650
received $1 million dollars divided by such
a high N that the prize would’ve worked

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.870
out to an infinitesimal fraction of one cent.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:54.050
The takeaway here is that coupling unlimited
entries with people pursuing their own self-interest

00:07:54.050 --> 00:08:01.180
-- while recognizing that everyone else would
do that too -- quickly bulldozed that $1 million

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.800
dollar prize into dust. Nobody won.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:14.870
The intrigue of the Platonia Dilemma is less
about how to win the game and more about how

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:26.250
to think about how to win the game. It's about
merging math... and you. How you behave, how

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:36.320
other people behave, and how we can use our
minds and math to eclipse our imperfect rationality.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:42.479
So if MrBeast launches his version of the
Platonia Dilemma and it’s your turn to like

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:49.829
the video… What do you do? What will everyone
else do? Are you rational? Are they rational?

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:53.420
Is everyone superrational?

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:59.360
The most likely scenario for you or anyone
to win would require all 10 million viewers

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:06.980
to act superrationally, with no cheating,
no trolling, and each person rolling a die

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:12.649
with 10 million sides.

00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:19.290
I think MrBeast’s million is safe on this
one.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:24.999
This pocket's not open. So I can't put that
in there.

00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:29.779
And as always -- thanks for watching.

00:09:29.779 --> 00:09:38.290
"I want a Vsauce hat!" is a thought that popped
into my brain one day so I designed this hat

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:44.050
for myself. If you want to get one for yourself
go to CuriosityBox.com/Store. If you just

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:49.240
want to keep watching Vsauce2 videos, well,
I recommend The Missing Dollar Riddle. That's

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:54.130
a good one. And if you aren't subscribed yet
to Vsauce2, do that right now if you ever

00:09:54.130 --> 00:10:02.079
want to see the sun rise again. That's a little
dramatic. The sun doesn't actually rise or

00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:09.350
set contingent upon whether or not you are
subscribed to Vsauce2. I think.
