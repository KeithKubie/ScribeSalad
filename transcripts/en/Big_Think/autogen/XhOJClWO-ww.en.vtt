simultaneously have to be looking

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409
simultaneously have to be looking
 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:51.899
simultaneously have to be looking
through the microscope at your cost and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909
through the microscope at your cost and
 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.640
through the microscope at your cost and
looking through the telescope at what

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650
looking through the telescope at what
 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.869
looking through the telescope at what
your future is going to be and that's

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879
your future is going to be and that's
 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.840
your future is going to be and that's
kind of a difficult you know thing for

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850
kind of a difficult you know thing for
 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.410
kind of a difficult you know thing for
anybody for anybody to do and and I

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420
anybody for anybody to do and and I
 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.140
anybody for anybody to do and and I
think something similar it is involved

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150
think something similar it is involved
 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.490

in the sustainability issues obviously

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500
in the sustainability issues obviously
 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.320
in the sustainability issues obviously
the first question about the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330
the first question about the
 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.060
the first question about the
sustainability of a company is am i

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070
sustainability of a company is am i
 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.719
sustainability of a company is am i
alive I mean is securing liquidity and

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729
alive I mean is securing liquidity and
 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.359
alive I mean is securing liquidity and
making sure that I have the resources to

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369
making sure that I have the resources to
 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.760
making sure that I have the resources to
get through what is going to be you know

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770
get through what is going to be you know
 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.609
get through what is going to be you know
several more months at least of a pretty

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619
several more months at least of a pretty
 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.649
several more months at least of a pretty
difficult of suppressed demand and and

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659
difficult of suppressed demand and and
 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.599
difficult of suppressed demand and and
and difficult time so the first thing is

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609
and difficult time so the first thing is
 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.669
and difficult time so the first thing is
that liquidity and survival question and

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679
that liquidity and survival question and
 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.679
that liquidity and survival question and
I think most people mostly dealt with

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689
I think most people mostly dealt with
 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.989
I think most people mostly dealt with
that I mean at to some extent now we're

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:30.999
that I mean at to some extent now we're
 

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:32.789
that I mean at to some extent now we're
sort of like survivors of an earthquake

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799
sort of like survivors of an earthquake
 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.349
sort of like survivors of an earthquake
you know the whole everything's falling

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359
you know the whole everything's falling
 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:35.669
you know the whole everything's falling
down the walls are gone we sort of

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679
down the walls are gone we sort of
 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.160
down the walls are gone we sort of
emerged from the rubble and say I'm

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170
emerged from the rubble and say I'm
 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.940
emerged from the rubble and say I'm
alive now what and then I think there

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950
alive now what and then I think there
 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.099
alive now what and then I think there
are sort of two streams of activity one

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109
are sort of two streams of activity one
 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:45.809
are sort of two streams of activity one
stream of activity is how do I get

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819
stream of activity is how do I get
 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.499
stream of activity is how do I get
operationally fit get and stay

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
operationally fit get and stay
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.149
operationally fit get and stay
operationally fit the second stream is

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159
operationally fit the second stream is
 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.059
operationally fit the second stream is
how do i get strategically strong so the

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069
how do i get strategically strong so the
 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.709
how do i get strategically strong so the
operational Fitness is not the same as

operational Fitness is not the same as
 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.620
operational Fitness is not the same as
being lean and mean when I think about

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630
being lean and mean when I think about
 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.870
being lean and mean when I think about
operational fitness one of the ways that

operational fitness one of the ways that
that we like to think about it and I

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619
that we like to think about it and I
 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.309
that we like to think about it and I
like to think about it is what are the

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319
like to think about it is what are the
 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.389
like to think about it is what are the
capabilities I have that given the

changing what are the capabilities I
 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.980
changing what are the capabilities I
have that give me a right to win and
