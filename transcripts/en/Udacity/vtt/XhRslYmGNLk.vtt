00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.210
There's about a 50% chance that you'll pass either

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.510
the dominant or the recessive allele on to the

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.700
next generation. Let's just look at this for a

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.870
second. If one germ cell produces four gametes, ultimately,

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.730
and there's random segregation of these alleles; out of

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.530
four possible gametes here, one had the dominant, one

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.740
had the recessive, another had the recessive, and another

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.420
had the dominant. That's four possible combinations. And two

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.580
out of those four were the dominant ones. And two out of the four were

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.501
recessive. Two out of four is one half. One half is the same as 50%.
