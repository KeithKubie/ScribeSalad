00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.840
There is nothing worse
than having a song stuck

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.290
in your head that don't get out.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.560
Cue the rage in three, two--

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.360
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.390
Hey everyone, Laci
Green here for D News.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.280
I'm very ashamed to admit
it, but every time I

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.450
hear that song "Timber"
on the radio it just goes

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.070
around and around and around
in my head like a broken record

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.570
player.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.189
This is, of course,
not the first time

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.730
a dumb song has been
stuck in my head

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.590
and it probably
won't be the last.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.060
I've been asking myself,
"What the hey, brain?

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.080
What is going on up there?"

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.250
Here's what scientists have to
say about "earworms," or songs

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.640
that get stuck in your
head-- uh, well, they're

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.050
not entirely sure.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.620
That's the great
thing about science,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.430
you can always count on it to
admit what it doesn't know.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.110
Here's what we do know-- it
happens when you least expect

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.860
it or when you're zoning out,
doing chores, driving-- which

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.670
you shouldn't be zoning out
during, but hey, it happens--

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.216
or taking a shower.

00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:56.840
We also know that it
happens with songs

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.550
we've heard a bunch of times,
which explains why earworms are

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.880
often songs that are played
endlessly on the radio.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.670
We also know that
earworms are more

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.950
common with repetitive, upbeat
songs, especially those that

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.860
have some kind of
unexpected element

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.820
to a track that makes
it only slightly

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.910
different from other
similar melodies.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.940
Using MRI scans,
Dartmouth researchers

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.940
found that participants had
activated auditory cortices

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.940
while they listened to a
familiar clip of music.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.760
And then after the
clip ended, the cortex

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.310
remained lit up, the brain
essentially continuing

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.580
to fill in the gaps
and sing on its own.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.470
This was especially
true in individuals

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.760
with high levels of neuroticism.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.100
The researchers believe
that a song's melody may by

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.780
summoned not only by repetition
but by something subconsciously

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.140
related to it or perhaps
hearing another song that

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.440
has a similar few notes.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.110
Pair this with high levels
of neuroticism and your brain

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.320
is much more likely
to catch the earworm.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.780
Another theory
posed by researchers

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.270
at the University
of Cincinnati is

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.770
that earworms are
a way for the mind

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.220
to occupy itself while
it's idling, hence

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.130
being more prone while
you're zoning out.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.830
And while most people
describe earworms

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.210
as a neutral or positive
experience, having

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.760
one that just won't get
out of your freaking head

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.015
can be really annoying.

00:02:02.015 --> 00:02:04.261
I find that it's not
very positive for me,

00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:06.260
but maybe that's just
because it's usually songs

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.650
that I don't like.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.780
If you're like me, try
listening to another song

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.950
or occupying
yourself in some way.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.360
Just don't think about the song,
which I realize kind of makes

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.700
you want to think about it more.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.158
So you really gotta
commit yourself

00:02:19.158 --> 00:02:21.090
to fully engaged distraction.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.940
Another technique is
listening to the song

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.330
all the way through.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.470
Apparently, just giving
that itch a good scratching

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.910
is all it takes for some people.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.490
So folks, what song
gets stuck in your head?

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.300
Let me know down below and
may the massive triggering

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.364
of earworms begin.

00:02:34.364 --> 00:02:36.072
Thanks for joining
me, we'll be back soon

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:37.929
with more science updates.
