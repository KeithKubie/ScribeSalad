slowdown in economic growth that we've
 

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:38.389

latter half of 2010 I would have argued

latter half of 2010 I would have argued
 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:52.069
latter half of 2010 I would have argued
that the economy would still be

that the economy would still be

that it is and I think the reason for

with me point number two is now going to
 

00:11:46.549 --> 00:11:47.580
with me point number two is now going to
take you down

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:47.590
take you down
 

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.220
take you down
take you down yeah I know you're down

take you down yeah I know you're down
 

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.500
take you down yeah I know you're down
already I I i should say two things

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:52.510
already I I i should say two things
 

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.900
already I I i should say two things
first of all I run the risk of taking

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:54.910
first of all I run the risk of taking
 

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.120
first of all I run the risk of taking
you too low because I've taken audiences

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.130
you too low because I've taken audiences
 

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.910

so far down I can never get them back up

00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920
so far down I can never get them back up
 

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.530
so far down I can never get them back up
so I'm going to work really hard not to

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:01.540
so I'm going to work really hard not to
 

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.240
so I'm going to work really hard not to
do that the second thing is I am an

economist you got to keep this in mind

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:04.630
economist you got to keep this in mind
 

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.480
economist you got to keep this in mind
and even when I'm speaking

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:06.490
and even when I'm speaking
 

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.400
and even when I'm speaking
optimistically it doesn't sound that way

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:08.410
optimistically it doesn't sound that way
 

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.330
optimistically it doesn't sound that way
so you have to account for that bias

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:11.340
so you have to account for that bias
 

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:19.590
so you have to account for that bias
point number two the next 6-9 perhaps 12

my response I'll respond in two ways
first is I do not think that there will

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920
first is I do not think that there will

know it does make me a bit nervous in
 

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:42.620
know it does make me a bit nervous in
the context of the risks that we face

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:42.630
the context of the risks that we face
 

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:44.630
the context of the risks that we face

could could help support the recovery
 

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:50.870
could could help support the recovery

your question is what could he do that
 

00:42:55.080 --> 00:43:00.010
your question is what could he do that
would be of substance going forward in

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:00.020
would be of substance going forward in
 

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.050
would be of substance going forward in
my view

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:02.060
my view
 

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.350
my view
it would be if he was very courageous

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:05.360
it would be if he was very courageous
 

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:09.400
it would be if he was very courageous
and took a step outside of his own party

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:09.410
and took a step outside of his own party
 

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:12.790
and took a step outside of his own party
and led the way let me give you a case

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800
and led the way let me give you a case
 

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:17.290
and led the way let me give you a case
in point George Bush number one the

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:17.300
in point George Bush number one the
 

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.280
in point George Bush number one the
president 1990 said I'm not going to

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:21.290
president 1990 said I'm not going to
 

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.650
president 1990 said I'm not going to
raise taxes his no no read my lips

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:23.660
raise taxes his no no read my lips
 

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:26.170
raise taxes his no no read my lips
pledge and he broke that pledge she

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:26.180
pledge and he broke that pledge she
 

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.640
pledge and he broke that pledge she
raised taxes and in my view that

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:29.650
raised taxes and in my view that
 

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:33.940
raised taxes and in my view that
courageous event led led the way and

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:33.950
courageous event led led the way and
 

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:37.720
courageous event led led the way and
grew laid the groundwork for a decade of

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:37.730
grew laid the groundwork for a decade of
 

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:41.740
grew laid the groundwork for a decade of
fiscal restraint discipline that led to

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:41.750
fiscal restraint discipline that led to
 

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:43.690
fiscal restraint discipline that led to
a budget surplus by the end of the

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:43.700
a budget surplus by the end of the
 

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.780
a budget surplus by the end of the
decade now clearly President Clinton

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:45.790
decade now clearly President Clinton
 

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:48.550
decade now clearly President Clinton
followed on he was courageous in his own

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560
followed on he was courageous in his own
 

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.300
followed on he was courageous in his own
way and followed through with President

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:52.310
way and followed through with President
 

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:55.210
way and followed through with President
Bush but President Bush gave up his

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:55.220
Bush but President Bush gave up his
 

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:58.720
Bush but President Bush gave up his
second term in many respects because he

00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:58.730
second term in many respects because he
 

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:00.990
second term in many respects because he
did that and I think if President Obama

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.000
did that and I think if President Obama
 

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.420
did that and I think if President Obama
did the same thing it took that chance

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:04.430
did the same thing it took that chance
 

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:06.430
did the same thing it took that chance
he may very well well win the election

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:06.440
he may very well well win the election
 

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.010
he may very well well win the election
because in my view the economy in 2012

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:09.020
because in my view the economy in 2012
 

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.330
because in my view the economy in 2012
is going to be very different than the

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:10.340
is going to be very different than the
 

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.390
is going to be very different than the
economy in 1992 the economy is going to

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:13.400
economy in 1992 the economy is going to
 

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.920
economy in 1992 the economy is going to
be a heads back it's not going to be in

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:14.930
be a heads back it's not going to be in
 

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:17.350
be a heads back it's not going to be in
his face as it was this year or was as

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:17.360
his face as it was this year or was as
 

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.480
his face as it was this year or was as
it was in 1992 but if he took that

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:19.490
it was in 1992 but if he took that
 

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.250
it was in 1992 but if he took that
chance it would really lay the

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:21.260
chance it would really lay the
 

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.610
chance it would really lay the
groundwork for him doing something very

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:23.620
groundwork for him doing something very
 

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:27.820
groundwork for him doing something very
substantive in actually hitting my bogey

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:27.830
substantive in actually hitting my bogey
 

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:30.340
substantive in actually hitting my bogey
in 2013 and doing in making those

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:30.350
in 2013 and doing in making those
 

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:31.810
in 2013 and doing in making those
changes that I think we need to make and

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:31.820
changes that I think we need to make and
 

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.600
changes that I think we need to make and
in fact I'll say this I didn't mention

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:34.610
in fact I'll say this I didn't mention
 

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:36.610
in fact I'll say this I didn't mention
President Obama but I think he's up to

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:36.620
President Obama but I think he's up to
 

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.650
President Obama but I think he's up to
it and I think in fact he will we'll go

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:38.660
it and I think in fact he will we'll go
 

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:40.480
it and I think in fact he will we'll go
down that path that he will do something

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:40.490
down that path that he will do something
 

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:44.860
down that path that he will do something
that is outside the box for him and for

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:44.870
that is outside the box for him and for
 

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:48.160
that is outside the box for him and for
his party and that will lead the way and

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:48.170
his party and that will lead the way and
 

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:49.900
his party and that will lead the way and
show the we need a leader we need

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:49.910
show the we need a leader we need
 

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:51.700
show the we need a leader we need
leadership now and that will be the

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:51.710
leadership now and that will be the
 

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:53.890
leadership now and that will be the
leadership will need to really make the

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:53.900
leadership will need to really make the
 

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.360
leadership will need to really make the
changes and get to the optimistic

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:55.370
changes and get to the optimistic
 

00:44:55.370 --> 00:45:00.420
changes and get to the optimistic
outlook that I particularly

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:00.430
 

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:03.729
and if he does that I'm going to I'll

00:45:03.729 --> 00:45:03.739
and if he does that I'm going to I'll
 

00:45:03.739 --> 00:45:05.829
and if he does that I'm going to I'll
certainly help mr. Bloomberg but I will

00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839
certainly help mr. Bloomberg but I will

certainly also help mr. Obama because
 

00:45:07.759 --> 00:45:10.019
certainly also help mr. Obama because

they invest those funds in the United

China in particular they began buying
 

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:09.309
China in particular they began buying
Treasury bonds right and then they moved

Treasury bonds right and then they moved
 

00:46:09.319 --> 00:46:11.530

on to buying mortgage securities and in

in my view we should do everything we
 

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:18.400
in my view we should do everything we
can possibly do to foster that because

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:18.410
