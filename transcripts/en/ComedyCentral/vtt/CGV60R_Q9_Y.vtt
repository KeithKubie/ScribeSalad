♪ Why do you do... 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.685
- Thanks for coming to
the OCD support group,

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:22.121
next up is the bipolar group.

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:24.891
I know we have a lot
of overlap, thank you.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.528 size:88% position:44%
- Hi, I'm Myra by the way.

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:31.598
- Oh hi, I'm Gina.

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:32.899
- Nice to meet you.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.701
Are you staying for the
next one by any chance?

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:37.236
- Probably.

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:38.771
- I really like what you had
to say about picturing your

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:40.739 align:start size:97% position:3%
bubbie's breasts every time
a guy goes down on you.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.241
I totally relate.

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.477
As you might have heard, I have
some issues with my grandpa.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:45.744
- Incest OCD?

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:48.048
- Yeah, that's just the
one I can talk about.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.083
- I feel you there.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:55.121 align:start size:97% position:3%
And like, I'm at this dog
shelter, and for some reason,

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.891
like, the only thing I can
even picture in my head--

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:58.725
- Bestiality stuff?

00:00:58.725 --> 00:00:59.959
- Yeah, exactly.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:00.893
- And sometimes it's
like the ugly dogs

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:01.894
that smell the worst, right?

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:03.229
- It's always the worst dogs.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.630
I never, I would love
to be attracted to

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.566 align:start size:84% position:16%
like, a good looking
dog, just once.

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:10.903
- I love that part
of your head so much,

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:12.071
I don't know what I
would do without you.

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:13.406
- Aw, thanks.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.240
(phone chiming)

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.141
Oh, sorry.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.581
Oh that's cool!

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:24.116 align:start size:97% position:3%
Um, I just got invited to this
feminist talk in New York.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:25.751
They want women of
all different ages

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:28.354 align:start size:97% position:3%
to discuss female circumcision
for an all male audience.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:30.856 align:start size:88% position:13%
I think it's gonna be
like, super cool, honey.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:32.358
- When do you leave me?

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:35.862
- Oh, I don't know, probably
like, a week or something?

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:36.796
- And for how long?

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:39.799
- Five days?

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.101
I mean there's a lot
to see in New York.

00:01:42.634 --> 00:01:44.504
- A lot can happen in five days.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:48.608
(intense static)

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.179
- Bye, sweetie.

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:57.350

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:14.200

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:31.751
(crying) Ow!

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:32.585
Why Gina?

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:35.989
Gina...

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:38.391
Gina!

00:02:39.892 --> 00:02:42.494
(door opens)

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:45.531

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:47.733
- I just missed you so much.

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:48.868 align:start size:84% position:16%
Can you please
just make me dinner

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:50.670 align:start size:84% position:16%
and tell me
everything'll be okay?

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.775
(cries)

00:02:57.543 --> 00:02:58.378
Please?

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:00.280
Just make me dinner.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.016
(birds chirping)

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.053
- Alright, well it's getting
late and I have to go to work.

00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:09.588
- No, don't leave.

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:10.856
- I have to.

00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:12.258
We're talking to
preschoolers today

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:14.894 align:start size:88% position:13%
about sexual harassment
in the classroom.

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:16.529
It's an issue.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.631
Alright, well I'll
see you later, okay?

00:03:19.932 --> 00:03:20.767
- No.

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:23.535
No.

00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:24.270
- [Gina] Can you let go please?

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.104
- [Myra] No.

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:26.306
(thud)

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:28.041 align:start size:81% position:19%
Don't leave, I
need you too much.

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:31.110
- Can um...

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.944
- No!

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:33.212
- Can I get up please?

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:35.481
- Please no, you can't.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:38.284
You can only get up if
you promise to not leave.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:39.752
- I need you to let go.

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:41.220 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Myra] No I'm in love
with you, you have to stay.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.154
- I need you to let go.

00:03:42.154 --> 00:03:43.556
- I'm not letting go.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:44.556
- Let go!

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:46.292
- I have an iron grip of love.

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:48.060
Please don't.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.895
Gina, no.

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:52.398
Stop, you're hurting my arms.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.999
No, you can't leave me.

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.667
Please don't leave me.

00:03:55.667 --> 00:03:57.570
- If you don't let go
I'm calling the police.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.572
- I'll call the cops and
tell them to stay away.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.940
I don't care!

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.477
(handcuffs clinking)

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:06.412

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:07.247
