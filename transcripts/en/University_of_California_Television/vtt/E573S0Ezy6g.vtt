(logo whooshing)

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:05.348
(mouse clicking)
(computer beeping)

00:00:05.348 --> 00:00:07.765
(soft music)

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.960
- Hello, I'm Harry Kreisler,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.650
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.800
Welcome to Conversations with History.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.870
Our guest today is Dr. Jennifer Doudna,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.469
who is professor in the
Department of Chemistry,

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.350
in the Department of
Molecular and Cell Biology

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.350
at UC Berkeley, and Li Ka
Shing Chancellor's Professor

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.430
in Biomedical and Health Research.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.150
She is also the director

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.150
of the Innovative Genomics
Institute at Berkeley.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.210
Jennifer, welcome to our program.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.448
- Thank you for having me.

00:01:09.448 --> 00:01:12.985
- What led you to go
into science as a career?

00:01:12.985 --> 00:01:16.760
- I grew up on a small island
in the middle of the Pacific,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.040
the island of Hawaii, and it was there

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.690
that I think I really gained my desire

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.890
to study the chemistry of life.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.290
I was fascinated by the
evolutionary process

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.840
that led to all of the
diverse animals and plants

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.240
that we see in that environment,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.820
and I wanted to understand
how they got there.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.660
- And neither of your
parents were scientists.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.570
- No, no, my parents were academics,

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.180
but they were in the humanities.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.930
My dad was a American literature professor

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.270
at the university in Hawaii,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.260
and my mom was a history lecturer.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.857
- And your father, at some
point early in your life

00:01:52.857 --> 00:01:56.250
gave you a copy of The Double Helix.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.240
- He did, yeah.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.900
I was probably 12 years old.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.840
- My god, and you read it.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.762
- Eventually.

00:02:01.762 --> 00:02:03.654
(both laughing)

00:02:03.654 --> 00:02:05.373
- Oh, a secret revealed.

00:02:09.097 --> 00:02:14.097
What led you to want to
focus on biochemistry

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.720
and the structure, biological structures?

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.420
- I got very excited about
chemistry in high school.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.620
I had a wonderful chemistry
teacher, Miss Wang,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.700
who showed us kids that science

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.727
was about the process of discovery,

00:02:29.727 --> 00:02:32.420
and I somehow got fascinated with the idea

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.440
that you could understand the details

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.590
of molecules in living systems,

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.403
and that's what I wanted
to do for my career.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.407
You were educated, your
undergraduate work was at--

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.530
- Pomona.
- Pomona.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.780
And where did you do your doctorate?

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.520
- So, from Pomona, I went to Boston.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.180
I went and worked at
Harvard Medical School,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.770
where I was in the Department
of Biological Chemistry

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.070
and Molecular Pharmacology,
a big mouthful,

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.480
but it was a wonderful place

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.980
that had a lot of classical biochemists

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.975
as well as people thinking
about the chemistry of life

00:03:09.975 --> 00:03:12.223
in biomedical settings.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.150
- And I read it in your
book that at some point,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.270
you, looking back at
your own life, you saw

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.270
that the common thread was
correcting defective genes?

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.050
Is that a fair statement, restatement?

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.883
- Not exactly.

00:03:30.883 --> 00:03:33.700
I think the common thread always, for me,

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.860
has been understanding
the evolution of the,

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.110
sort of the fundamental
molecules that we see

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.540
in modern biology, and that's
a big topic, obviously.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.600
But for me, it was always about thinking

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.310
about life's origins, and
what can we learn about

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.470
the history of life on our planet

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.410
from studying how things work today.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.270
And I've always been fascinated

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.880
by the flow of genetic information,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.310
again, kind of stemming from the story

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.310
described in The Double Helix, actually.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.190
- And who did you work under
at the Harvard Medical School?

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.080
That's really kind of the first step

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.373
in the trajectory of your education

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.840
toward the discovery you were to make.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.240
- Yeah, well, I worked
with three scientists

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.337
in the first year I was
there, as typically happens

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:32.700
in graduate programs like that,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.470
we had rotations that we did as students.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.900
So we were working in
several different labs

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.930
to get a flavor of
different kinds of science.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.450
So I worked in, first, for a professor

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.580
named Roberto Kolter,
who studies how bacteria

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.590
produce toxins that poison other bacteria

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.750
in their environment, so
that was a fascinating

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.010
sort of introduction to the biology

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.070
of what's happening out in,
sort of, in the environment.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.924
Second, I worked with a
guy named Richard Kolodner,

00:05:01.924 --> 00:05:05.240
very well known for his work on DNA repair

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.660
and actually, interestingly,
that came back

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.350
to me later, in my later work.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.660
And third was Jack Szostak, whose lab

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.960
I actually ended up
joining and worked under

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.070
for my PhD, who also, at that time,

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.310
was studying the process of DNA repair.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.220
But in his lab, I actually
took on a new project

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.180
to understand how RNA molecules
might have played a role

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.910
in the origin of life.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.441
- And so this is where, the
origin of your focus on RNA?

00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:35.630
- [Jennifer] Yes.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.960
- And was that a hot topic at the time?

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.610
Was that, initially, it was thought

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.510
that RNA didn't do much, right?

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.310
That it was primarily a messenger,
is that a fair statement?

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.810
- I think that's a fair statement.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.483
Certainly, when I was
going through school,

00:05:54.483 --> 00:05:57.312
RNA seemed like the least interesting

00:05:57.312 --> 00:06:01.175
of the major macromolecules
in living systems.

00:06:01.175 --> 00:06:04.640
Proteins were exciting because they do

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.020
a lot of interesting things in the cell.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.600
DNA, of course, is the
important repository

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.830
of genetic information and responsible

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.950
for passing it on to future generations,

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.360
and then RNA was, we were sort of taught

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.570
that it was an intermediary
and a messenger,

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.680
and maybe not a molecule
playing an active role

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.240
in biology, and what was happening,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.680
when I was in grad school, and my advisor,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.280
Jack Szostak, was a big player in this,

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.670
was the fundamental change in thinking,

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.970
across biological scientists that in fact,

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.770
RNA molecules do a lot of very active

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.130
and important things in cells,

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.460
and they can also give us hints

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.130
about how life might have come to be.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.130
- And so, your focus
initially was on biochemistry,

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.330
and what sorts of things did you look at

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.840
beyond what your mentors were doing?

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.940
- Well, in my graduate
work, I was studying

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.110
how RNA molecules might be
capable of self-replication,

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.280
in other words, making
copies of themselves,

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.660
something that we think is a
fundamental definition of life

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.390
is having, organisms
are able to replicate,

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.495
they're able to divide and
make more of themselves.

00:07:22.495 --> 00:07:26.010
And so I was investigating
that at a molecular level

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.983
by studying RNA molecules that
have some of those properties

00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:32.990
that we can investigate in the laboratory.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.820
But beyond that, I think I really learned

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.820
from my graduate advisor,
Dr. Szostak, that science is,

00:07:41.131 --> 00:07:44.120
he was so passionate about his work,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.680
and he was a very big thinker.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.670
He was always, I'd go into his office

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.680
in the afternoon, and he would
be reading journal articles

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.740
about applied mathematics,
things like that.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.870
So the things very far afield
from what we were researching

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.740
in the laboratory, but
he had so many interests,

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.520
and that was really infectious,

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.499
to see such a wise person who was working

00:08:04.499 --> 00:08:07.920
on very detailed problems
in his research lab,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.420
but had such broad based interests.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.670
- So this raises an important
point about science.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.850
A lot of it is interdisciplinary.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.900
- It is, yeah.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.920
- And you learn from each other's,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.880
and not just the others
in your particular--

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.922
- Absolutely, yeah.

00:08:23.922 --> 00:08:27.000
- And I read somewhere
that you learned from him

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.060
how to identify the
problem and focus on it

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.822
and how, therefore, to
frame the right questions.

00:08:34.822 --> 00:08:38.390
- Well, I admired that greatly
about him, I have to say.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.090
When I, and this was something I observed

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.420
when I was a student in his lab,

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.700
and I couldn't imagine how he did it,

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.824
but somehow, he seemed to always be asking

00:08:46.824 --> 00:08:49.840
the right question, and he could frame

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.590
these very big questions, like,

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.300
how did life evolve on earth?

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.410
That sounds like a huge problem.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.700
How would you ever
investigate it in the lab,

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.840
but he had the ability
to frame that question

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.056
in a way that you could
actually break it down

00:09:03.056 --> 00:09:07.392
as a studiable problem
that you could investigate

00:09:07.392 --> 00:09:09.370
with experiments, and I thought

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.420
that was an incredible skill that he had.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.820
- Does one learn to do that from a mentor,

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.830
or do you self-teach
yourself as you go along?

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.930
- I think it's a combination.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:28.040
I think when I was a
student in Szostak's lab,

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.590
of course, I learned a lot from him

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.151
and watching him in
action, and also directly

00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:36.070
through his mentorship, but frankly,

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.925
he had, he put together
a lab of brilliant people

00:09:39.925 --> 00:09:41.730
who were colleagues of mine,

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.320
and every day in the laboratory,

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.280
we would be talking about experiments

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.070
and about questions that
we were investigating,

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.110
papers we were reading,
things we just wondered about,

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.300
and so it was a really exciting

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.950
sort of intellectual melting pot

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.620
of people from different backgrounds

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.770
who were interested in similar questions.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.350
- And this is a theme that
recurs again and again,

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.670
sort of, groups of
scientists and of students,

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.210
actually, interacting on a regular basis,

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.120
and each sharing where they were going.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.010
- Right, right.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.280
And I think that's a theme

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.960
that I've always enjoyed in science.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.270
It's not, honestly, it's
not something I imagined

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.320
would be a part of my
professional life as a scientist

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.210
back when I was first being trained,

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:30.210
because I imagined sort
of the media presentation

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.040
of scientists as being
people in white lab coats

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.630
with black-rimmed glasses and very geeky

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.617
and working, maybe, in isolation.

00:10:39.617 --> 00:10:42.770
And I discovered in graduate
school that it's very,

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.940
science is a very different
process than that.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.513
It's actually all about people.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:53.350
- You then went to Colorado
to fill in your knowledge

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.720
about the world you wanted to explore.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.010
What is it you wanted to do there?

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:05.010
Study the how, the structure of RNA?

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.460
- Exactly, so when I
was in graduate school,

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.400
and as I was wrapping
up my research there,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.410
I realized that to really understand

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.500
how these RNA molecules
I was studying operated

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.810
in a biological setting,
we really had to understand

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.380
their three-dimensional shapes,

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.517
because that would explain
the kind of chemistry,

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.730
and the chemical reactions
that they could be involved in.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.420
And so, at the time,
there was only one type

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.650
of RNA structure, molecular structure

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.085
that was known, and in fact,

00:11:36.085 --> 00:11:39.809
nobody had really seriously
investigated RNA structures

00:11:39.809 --> 00:11:43.216
for about 10 or 12 years at that point.

00:11:43.216 --> 00:11:48.216
And I decided that I needed
to, I wanted to go after that

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.150
as a next direction in my work,

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.620
and to do so, I decided I would pick

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.030
the very best RNA biochemist
that I could find,

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.100
and that was Tom Cech, who was a professor

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.530
at the University of Colorado Boulder.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.530
- So what's interesting here
is that you were on a path

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:11.530
of understanding RNA
in its many dimensions,

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:16.620
but you encountered
problems, plus curiosity,

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.913
which define the next step.
- Yeah.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.200
Yeah, exactly.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:28.070
- And so as a result of
your work in Colorado,

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.400
you were then positioned to think

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:39.060
about the structure of
RNA and how it interacted

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.440
with the biochemistry, is
that a fair way to state that?

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.930
- Yeah, I think that's very fair, yeah.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.210
Yeah, looking at, I
mean, it's sort of like

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:54.210
thinking about form, sort
of establishing function.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.900
And we think about this,
and it's a principle

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.500
in architecture, for example, right?

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.740
Well, it's very similar all the way down

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.560
at the molecular level
that form, basically,

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.920
establishes function and you
can, form follows function.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.890
And so by understanding
the shapes of molecules

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.930
and how they're put
together, you can understand

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:16.910
a lot about their functions

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.590
and purpose in biological settings.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:23.530
- So you go back to
Yale, or you're at Yale,

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.280
now after Colorado, continuing this work,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.400
but then you come to Berkeley.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.770
- Yeah, yep.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.550
So I got hired, my first job was at Yale.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.130
I got hired there as a professor in 1994.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:39.530
I was stunned that they
would hire me, but they did,

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.960
and it was a remarkable experience

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.930
to go to the Molecular, Biophysics

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:47.334
and Biochemistry Department at Yale,

00:13:47.334 --> 00:13:48.390
where it's some of the most eminent people

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.550
in the country, probably in the world,

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:55.550
working on molecular structures
and properties of molecules

00:13:55.697 --> 00:13:58.690
and some of the most
fundamental pathways in biology,

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.413
were researching there,
doing their work at the time.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.600
But then, eight years later,

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.580
I made the very, kind
of bittersweet decision

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.880
at the time to move to UC Berkeley,

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.970
and why did I do that?

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.210
Well, I was offered a
position at Berkeley,

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.500
and although I had been
extremely happy at Yale

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.490
and very well supported
there, I could also see

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.730
exciting opportunities that
would be special to Berkeley.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.440
For example, being embedded

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.750
in a much larger university system,

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.910
adjacent to a national laboratory,

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.600
right across the Bay from an
outstanding medical school

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.860
and Stanford right down the street.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.790
It just seemed like a wonderful
intellectual environment

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.560
in the Bay area, and it didn't hurt

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.700
that it's a pretty nice place to live.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.347
- That's true, and to raise a family.

00:14:44.347 --> 00:14:45.979
- [Jennifer] And to raise a family.

00:14:45.979 --> 00:14:49.230
- Right, so you're working here now.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.210
You've established your
credentials in RNA,

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:57.207
and then one day, you
get a call from professor

00:14:57.207 --> 00:15:00.390
in another department, I believe,

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:04.438
and what does she tell
you, and how does that lead

00:15:04.438 --> 00:15:08.170
on a trail to your discovery?

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.400
- Well, I was, when I
moved the lab to Berkeley,

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.183
we started studying something
that I had not worked on

00:15:13.183 --> 00:15:17.980
up until that point, which
was how very small pieces

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:22.080
of RNA in mammalian
cells, even human cells,

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.830
are able to control how and
when certain proteins are made.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.310
And we were fascinated by that process,

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.210
how had it evolved and how did it work,

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.200
and we were studying
the molecules involved

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.413
in that pathway, which is called
RNA interference, or RNAi,

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.070
and then, I was sitting
innocently in my office one day

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.550
at Berkeley, and Jillian Banfield,

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.490
a professor here in earth
and planetary science

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.550
contacted me and she
said that she had seen

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:56.070
my work on RNA interference
and she wanted to meet

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:59.637
because she had an interesting
observation in her work

00:15:59.637 --> 00:16:02.960
about the possibility that bacteria

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.870
were also using an RNA
interference kind of mechanism,

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.820
but with entirely different
molecular machinery.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.090
And of course, I was fascinated.

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.276
- And she googled you.
- She did.

00:16:14.276 --> 00:16:19.276
- Right, and it was clear
that your background

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.253
and what you were working on related.

00:16:24.468 --> 00:16:28.360
So this, together with a meeting you had

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:33.360
with your co-discoverer
on a walk at a conference

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.670
in San Juan--
- Right.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:39.113
- And she was, essentially,
working on the same problem,

00:16:39.113 --> 00:16:42.590
Emmanuelle Charpentier.
- Yeah, exactly.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:43.860
Yeah, Emmanuelle Charpentier.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.293
So, and this is another
great instance of how,

00:16:47.293 --> 00:16:50.870
there's an interesting
serendipity in science.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.870
So Emmanuelle Charpentier
and I met for the first time

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.750
at a meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico,

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.040
and we recognized that we were working

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.480
on different aspects of
the same bacterial pathway,

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.880
a bacterial immune system known as CRISPR.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.660
And at that conference,
we decided to team up

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.470
to investigate a particular protein

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.630
that's part of that pathway,
that Emmanuelle's lab

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.420
was starting to investigate at the time,

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.639
a protein called Cas9.

00:17:18.639 --> 00:17:23.639
- And there was some sense
in the broader community

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:28.330
that something was going on, but no one,

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:32.449
with Cas9, but no one had yet figured out

00:17:32.449 --> 00:17:37.449
exactly what it did, and how it did it.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.290
- Right.
- Okay.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:44.290
And so the discovery
that was revolutionary

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:51.970
by you and your collaborator
and your teams was what?

00:17:54.224 --> 00:17:56.870
- Well, it was fundamentally figuring out

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:01.870
how this protein, Cas9,
uses an RNA molecule

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:07.270
to identify the segment
of DNA and cut it, right?

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.260
So it's just, you can imagine it like DNA

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.230
is sort of like a ropy
molecule in the cell.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.130
You got this very, very, very long rope

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.190
that encodes all of
the genetic information

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.710
necessary for the cell to function,

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.410
and what Cas9 does is to
find a place in that rope,

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:27.230
which is put together by
letters of the DNA code,

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.810
so it's a programmable kind of code,

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.090
and what Cas9 does with its RNA guide

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:39.090
is to find a place in that
coded sequence and make a break.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.430
And why was this so exciting?

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.091
Well, first of all, we
had set out to figure out

00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:48.280
how to, sort of a,
somewhat modest question,

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.910
how does this protein function as part

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.540
of a bacterial immune system.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.560
And what our work revealed
was that in bacteria,

00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:00.430
this protein is programmed
with molecules of RNA

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:05.430
that give it the information
to find and cut virus DNA.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:10.450
So it's a way that bacteria
can destroy virus particles

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.700
that might try to infect the cell.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.540
But in the course of doing
that fundamental research

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.950
and answering that
question of how it works,

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.140
we realized that it could be harnessed

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.800
for a different purpose,
because of its ability

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.630
to easily find and cut
any sequence of DNA,

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.040
and because we knew how it worked,

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.220
we could reprogram it
in the laboratory to,

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.760
for example, cut a gene that leads

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.700
to cystic fibrosis
development and trigger cells

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:43.070
to make a change in the
DNA sequence at precisely

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.700
that place that could correct

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.980
a disease causing mutation like that.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:52.980
- So in effect, your teams
were identifying the scissors,

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:01.000
so to speak, and then also the GPS system,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.160
which is the tracer RNA,
if I have this right,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:10.160
which together make
this revolution possible

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:16.470
in understanding how the
place in the DNA is found,

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.400
how it's cut, and it's
replaced with something else.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.610
And what, when Banfield called you,

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:27.790
she was saying, well,
we're looking at this DNA,

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:32.073
and there are these strips, pieces, of RNA

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.683
in the DNA, what is this?

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.180
We don't understand.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.440
And you were the one who
was positioned, in a way,

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.600
because of the work we just discussed,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.550
to begin the analysis of that.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.630
- Well, just a little,
a little revision there

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:52.463
to what you just said.

00:20:52.463 --> 00:20:55.650
So what Banfield had found
was that there's no RNA

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.580
directly in the DNA,
but the important thing

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.230
that she identified was
that there was evidence

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:06.230
from her research that bacteria
had a programmable system.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.080
So they had this GPS,
as you're alluding to.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.350
And the question was, how does it work.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.310
She suspected that it might
be an RNA-based system,

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.130
which was the reason she googled me

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:21.080
and contacted me, and that's
exactly what we figured out,

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.720
was that it's an RNA-guided system

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.380
that can be reprogrammed easily,

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.900
once you understand how to program it.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.610
You can do that in the laboratory,

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.060
it can be introduced into
different kinds of cells,

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.040
where it then functions as a tool

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.570
that scientists can use to
reprogram the DNA in cells.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.720
- And you've, team, figured out a way

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.600
to combine these two functions
in one unit, is that?

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.640
- Yes, so yes, so this is kind of getting

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.370
a little bit into the
weeds about how it works,

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.120
but it's actually
important, so it turns out

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.720
that in nature there are
two separate molecules

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.890
of RNA necessary to create the GPS,

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.670
right, that do the actual
programming of the Cas9 protein,

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.240
and our team figured out
how you could combine them

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.130
into one single piece of RNA

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.580
that could be easily reprogrammed

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:15.230
by scientists anywhere
to target DNA sequences

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:19.160
in animals, plants, fungi,
basically any kind of cell.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.660
- And so, briefly, the revolution here

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:28.660
is what this discovery means
is that it can be applied

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:34.850
across the board in all sorts
of living things and domains.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.863
So biomedicine, agriculture,

00:22:42.666 --> 00:22:47.260
where changes that are very precise

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:52.260
can be made in the DNA to
create a positive revolution,

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.740
but also possibly, a negative one.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.160
- Exactly, yeah.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.540
So it's a very powerful technology

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:03.480
that is widely applicable across biology,

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.818
as you just described, and importantly,

00:23:05.818 --> 00:23:10.160
it became very quickly
adopted by labs globally,

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.330
and the reason was that it was easy.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:13.570
It was easy to use.

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:17.100
We found that we could have
students come to the laboratory

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.940
over the summertime,
and within a few weeks,

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.200
we had them using Cas9
to edit human cells.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.320
Imagine, it's just sort of,
incredible opening the door

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.970
of opportunity for scientists,
and I think what's happened

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.200
over the last six years is that we've seen

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.250
increasing applications of
this technology, as you said,

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.230
and for biomedical
purposes, in agriculture,

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.370
in what we call synthetic biology.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:44.400
And so there's been a tremendous increase

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.820
in the pace of science, and
just the number of publications

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.850
that are coming out in
the scientific literature

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.715
because of this tool that's so enabling.

00:23:52.715 --> 00:23:57.715
Now, importantly, as we've
looked at your career

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.941
and the problems that
you were interested in,

00:23:59.941 --> 00:24:03.720
you weren't going for this result.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:08.064
You were following a
path of pure research.

00:24:08.064 --> 00:24:12.840
Your curiosity was leading
you to the next problem,

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:17.293
and then, wow, you came upon this insight

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:24.650
that has all sorts of
revolutionary implications.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:29.630
Now, let's move to the whole realization

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.640
which then, you turn into
something of a public advocate

00:24:36.893 --> 00:24:41.893
to help all sorts of
constituencies understand

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.008
the implications of this.

00:24:46.008 --> 00:24:48.930
Because it has policy implications,

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:51.990
it has ethical implications,

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.930
it has potential national
security implications.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:56.290
- Correct, yeah.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:25:00.510
So it's been a profound evolution for me,

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:04.230
over the last few years,
recognizing that this project that,

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.508
as you said, began as a
fundamental research project,

00:25:07.508 --> 00:25:09.820
kind of a very focused question

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.520
that we were asking in our work,

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.390
but once this technology was born,

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:19.563
it really quickly was clear
that this was going to be,

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.747
first of all, kind of revolutionary,

00:25:22.747 --> 00:25:26.160
and secondly, that it would
have a lot of implications

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.000
beyond scientists working in their,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.540
sort of sequestered away
in their laboratories.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.680
And so I had to make a decision

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.280
about how I would manage that,

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.930
and I have to tell you that initially,

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:42.410
I felt very uncomfortable with
the idea of speaking publicly

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:44.570
about some of these broader implications,

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.360
because like many scientists, I felt,

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.910
first of all, that I'm not
trained, professionally

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:52.600
in bioethics, and so who was
I to be speaking about this,

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.950
and secondly, that I had a lab to run

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.390
and I had classes to teach, and
I had a pretty full-time job

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:03.470
at Berkeley, but I really came to see

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.970
that I had to step up
to the plate on this,

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.920
because I had been involved in the genesis

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.890
of this technology, and it came

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.605
with a lot of responsibility.

00:26:13.605 --> 00:26:17.290
- There's a sense here that this has

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:22.290
to have a profound effect on
the way we train students.

00:26:22.793 --> 00:26:27.793
So in the future, science students

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:32.890
may have to think about the
implications of the work,

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.390
on the one hand, although
they want to go for discovery,

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:38.790
they wanna fulfill their curiosity,

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.566
but also, students in the social science

00:26:41.566 --> 00:26:44.370
or in policy studies are
gonna have to know some

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.020
of the science, because we've
got ethical issues here,

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.270
we've got policy issues.
- Right, yeah, yeah.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.372
No, I agree.

00:26:52.372 --> 00:26:57.372
- And do you see that as
part of your advocacy role,

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:00.987
to say, hey, let's think
about our curriculums?

00:27:00.987 --> 00:27:04.050
- I do, and maybe I should be,

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.031
I'm feeling a little bit guilty

00:27:06.031 --> 00:27:07.650
when I hear you saying that,
because maybe I should be doing

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.759
more of that, but I would--

00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:10.761
- [Harry] You're doing enough.

00:27:10.761 --> 00:27:13.340
- I would say at the
moment, I'm probably leading

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.130
more by example than anything else.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:19.150
I have not put in place particular policy

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.270
or curriculum changes, for example,

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.633
here at my university, at Berkeley.

00:27:23.633 --> 00:27:27.230
But what I definitely do is I feel

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:30.090
that a lot of the kinds
of speaking engagements

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:31.780
that I have right now are, frankly,

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:35.050
with groups of students, often
they're younger students,

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:38.480
even high school students,
and what I try to do

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.190
in those forums is to tell students

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:45.570
that my experience exemplifies
what can happen in science,

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.670
where you start off
with one particular goal

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.190
or set of questions, and science,

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:53.120
being the kind of process that it is,

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.130
it goes naturally in
unexpected directions,

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:57.900
and that we all have to be prepared

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.220
for the broader implications of our work

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.120
and be prepared to step out of the lab

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.030
and discuss the implications,
the significance of our work,

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:11.122
and explain how that
affects societal decisions.

00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:13.775
- And there's an
education role here, also,

00:28:13.775 --> 00:28:17.860
for the general public,
and I should point out

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:22.860
that you have co-written a
book, A Crack in Creation,

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:28.320
where you talk about the
evolution of your science

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:35.010
and of your thinking about this set

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.970
of problems we're addressing.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:39.630
Now, let's talk a minute about some

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:43.510
of the negative consequences of this,

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:47.040
'cause there's, in
genetics, there's a history

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:52.040
of going down the wrong
path in the early history

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.210
of that discipline, going toward genetics.

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:59.346
In the case of what you've discovered,

00:28:59.346 --> 00:29:04.346
one can envision states
using this technology

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.910
with the hope of creating a super race,

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:13.611
on the one hand, or eliminating
populations on the other.

00:29:13.611 --> 00:29:15.670
Talk a little about that.

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:17.270
- Well, it sounds pretty scary

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:18.740
when you describe it that way.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.540
I think the reality is that
both of those scenarios,

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.900
right now, remain in the
realm of science fiction--

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.520
- Thankfully.
- Thankfully, right?

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:32.520
For many reasons, but what I do think

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:37.120
is now on the table,
frankly, is the potential

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:41.430
to alter individual
human beings genetically,

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:45.070
and to do that, not just
in a way that affects

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:47.710
an individual, but in a way that affects

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:51.490
that individual and all
of their future children

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:53.120
and grandchildren and so, in other words,

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.330
it creates a heritable change to DNA.

00:29:56.330 --> 00:30:00.780
And that really is a profound
thing when you think about it,

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.850
because it means that
we now have the power

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:07.400
to control evolution,
as our book discusses.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:12.140
And not only of other
organisms in our environment,

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.860
but of ourselves, and
so that really makes us

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:19.210
have to think very hard
about, first of all,

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:22.510
whether to do that, and I
think the answer will be yes,

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.560
whether we want it to be or not.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.530
I think there will be people
that want to use it this way,

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:31.440
and then we have to ask
how and when and why

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.700
would one want to do this, and I think

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.277
most people would say, well,

00:30:35.277 --> 00:30:37.540
if there's an unmet medical need

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.888
that necessitates correction to DNA,

00:30:40.888 --> 00:30:42.910
there might be an argument to be made

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:45.530
that we should actually do that in people

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:48.750
so we could remove a
disease-causing mutation

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:50.530
from maybe an entire family.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:51.800
And you could imagine that could be

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.600
very beneficial from a health perspective.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.230
There's also, though, the potential

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:57.890
for what we call enhancements,

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:02.070
and changes to be made to
DNA that are maybe perceived

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:05.582
to be desirable in some way,
but don't actually impact

00:31:05.582 --> 00:31:08.920
someone's health directly, so.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.900
- We should make an
important distinction here,

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.640
as part of our public education role here,

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.610
between a somatic cell and a germ cell.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:18.550
- Yes.
- Do a brief--

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.420
- Yes, and we talked about
this in Elberg Lecture, right,

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.480
but you raise a very important point,

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.700
and that is that when we edit,

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:30.350
when we use genome editing,
this technology CRISPR-Cas9

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:32.180
in what we call somatic cells,

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.270
that means we're making changes to cells

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:36.230
that are fully developed.

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:39.850
They're not cells that can
lead to a new organism,

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:42.360
whether it's a human being
or a plant or anything else,

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.400
right, so it's, somatic
cell changes affect

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:50.320
just an individual and not their progeny,

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.420
but if we make changes in germ cells,

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.930
whether that's in the form of embryos

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.075
or eggs or sperm, those genetic changes

00:31:58.075 --> 00:32:00.320
can become part of an individual

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.470
and be passed on to future generations,

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:05.600
so that's a much more
profound kind of editing.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.550
- One of the ways for getting the world

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:15.550
to think about how we should
regulate the implications

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:21.460
of all of this is the notion
of the international community

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.850
of scientists, so in this recent incident,

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:29.770
where a Chinese scientist did work

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:32.620
that affected the germ line and seemed

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:36.600
to not know what he was
doing, he presented this

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.870
at an international conference,
but there was really

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:44.320
an uproar from the scientific community

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:49.320
that this was a step too
far, without careful thought.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:51.960
- Exactly, yeah, that's
right, that's right.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.220
And I think what you're referring to

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.430
is an announcement from last November,

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:00.725
November of 2018, by a Chinese scientist

00:33:00.725 --> 00:33:03.344
at a meeting in Hong
Kong that was, actually,

00:33:03.344 --> 00:33:06.916
a meeting organized, I was
on the organizing committee,

00:33:06.916 --> 00:33:10.100
organized to discuss human genome editing

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.910
and this issue of human germ line editing.

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:15.410
And what was announced
there was that in fact,

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.700
a team of scientists had done this already

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.140
and not in, just in a research setting,

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.230
but they had actually
implanted edited embryos

00:33:25.604 --> 00:33:28.990
to achieve a pregnancy
and children, twin girls,

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:32.150
had been born with
reported edits to the DNA.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.390
So this really, I think, shook up

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:37.100
the international scientific
community profoundly,

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.770
because it emerged, as the details

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:44.700
of the work were unveiled,
that the particular edits

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.068
that were made to those two girls

00:33:47.068 --> 00:33:52.068
were, in fact, changes to DNA
that had never been observed

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.790
in humans, and in fact,
never been tested in animals.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:59.445
So it really had the
feeling of doing research

00:33:59.445 --> 00:34:03.170
on people, and without appropriate consent

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:06.260
or a plan for following
their health in the future.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.033
So it was really quite
shocking, I would say.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.113
- Another constituency, it seems to me,

00:34:13.113 --> 00:34:17.110
that needs to be educated
are our political leaders,

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:21.050
because they're gonna have to define

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:25.490
the rules, the legislation, the laws

00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:30.490
that, on the one hand,
regulate, moderate, control,

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:37.730
without interfering
with the work of science

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:41.770
and the creativity that will
lead to great discoveries.

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:45.950
Any thoughts on that,
besides reading your book,

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:47.848
which they do.

00:34:47.848 --> 00:34:51.960
- Well, I think that, I've
been actually very pleased

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.901
that there's been quite a lot of interest

00:34:53.901 --> 00:34:55.910
on the part of various governments,

00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:57.460
including here in the United States,

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.820
but also in other countries.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.360
And over the last several years,

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.940
I've had the opportunity to visit

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.560
with a number of government delegations

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.710
who have been on fact-finding missions,

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.970
trying to understand what's
happening on the research front,

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:14.640
and how they should be
addressing any regulatory needs

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.580
that are arising due to new technology,

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.470
including genome editing.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:23.330
So there's attention being
paid to this, for sure.

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:25.580
I think the devil is in the details.

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.400
How do we think about this?

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.850
And it's almost a rhetorical question,

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:32.740
because, and I'd love to
hear your thoughts on it too,

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:36.160
because there's no easy
answer, in my opinion.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.060
I don't think that we
would want a situation

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.610
where non-scientists are
placing a large number

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:47.630
of regulations on the scientific community

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:52.340
that might, frankly, impair the ability

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.200
to develop new ideas and creative work

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.890
that will solve real
problems and help people

00:35:58.865 --> 00:36:01.090
with their healthcare and
other kinds of situations

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:04.510
that they're facing, I feel
very deeply about that.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:07.870
But at the same time,
one does not want to see

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:10.500
technologies being
utilized, as we observed

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.870
in this announcement from last November,

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.134
where people are being experimented on,

00:36:15.134 --> 00:36:18.480
perhaps without their real understanding

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.090
of what's happening,
and certainly, in ways

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:22.120
that I would consider to be unethical.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.226
- It's interesting, 'cause it strikes me

00:36:24.226 --> 00:36:27.797
that, although the science
is moving very quickly,

00:36:27.797 --> 00:36:32.797
that you almost have to do
this on a case by case basis,

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:38.330
and that the case of
the Chinese scientists,

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.051
there clearly was a mobilization

00:36:41.051 --> 00:36:45.830
by the scientific, the
international scientific community

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:47.870
about the implications of this,

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:52.870
because some of this
seems to be about alerting

00:36:52.927 --> 00:36:57.358
the political leaders
and alerting the public

00:36:57.358 --> 00:36:59.330
about the implications.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:03.050
I think of nuclear weapons
and the important role

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:07.900
that things like Pugwash, these
meetings between scientists

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:11.040
on both sides, and how it shaped

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.071
the actual political negotiation

00:37:14.071 --> 00:37:19.071
with regard to the control
of nuclear weapons.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:23.490
Unfortunately, the one caveat here is,

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.190
goes back to a point you
made in your lecture,

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:31.190
which is, the tool we now have
is one of democratization.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.028
Anybody can do it.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:37:34.028 --> 00:37:36.240
That's both a blessing and a curse.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.320
- Well, one last question.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.761
If students were to
watch this and look back

00:37:41.761 --> 00:37:46.761
at your career, what should they learn

00:37:47.021 --> 00:37:51.420
about creativity in science

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.100
and the road to great discoveries?

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.460
- I think keeping an open
mind is very important,

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.170
and I also think that it's very valuable

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:03.730
to follow your passions, and pay attention

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.430
to what each of us finds exciting.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:09.170
What I've learned over the
years from my students,

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:11.930
my many students that have
worked in the lab with me,

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:15.270
is that each person that
comes to the laboratory

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:18.820
comes with their own cultural background,

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:23.050
their own intellectual
interests, their own skillset,

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.220
and I think for each of us,

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.690
we have to discover about ourselves

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:31.520
what kinds of questions
we most want to answer

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.680
in science, and for me, it's always been

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.690
about paying attention to
that kind of inner voice,

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.927
things that I find real
exciting and interesting,

00:38:39.927 --> 00:38:44.810
and coupling that with working
with people smarter than me,

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:47.950
just trying to find people
that are really going

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:51.470
to help build a team
that can ask questions

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:52.810
and do science in a way

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:56.010
that's both intellectually
stimulating and fun.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:39:01.010
- And this path is a vehicle
for building self confidence,

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:05.440
which, I think I've read
you feel is very important.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.930
- Very important. I often think back

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.270
to a story, I can't remember if I told it

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:12.390
in the book or not, but I was a,

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.720
I think I was a second-year
graduate student,

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.750
and I had joined Szostak's lab at Harvard.

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:23.360
It was very clear that I
was working for somebody

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.210
who was kind of a creative
genius in the lab,

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:29.430
and I was so amazed that
he would have accepted me

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:30.740
into his lab, and I remember one day,

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:33.270
I was sitting at my desk
and I was planning out

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:34.960
an experiment that I
was gonna do that day,

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.250
and he came down the hall
and he came over to me,

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:39.244
and he said, "Hey,
Jennifer, I've been thinking

00:39:39.244 --> 00:39:42.807
"about an idea for an experiment,

00:39:42.807 --> 00:39:44.297
"and I wanted to bounce it off of you

00:39:44.297 --> 00:39:45.877
"to see what you think, and see

00:39:45.877 --> 00:39:47.440
"if you think it's a good idea."

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.620
And I can't tell you how stunned I was.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:53.380
This brilliant professor is asking for my,

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.180
little second-year
graduate student's opinion

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.410
about his idea, and it was
that kind of interaction

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:00.920
that I had with my, a number of mentors,

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.660
but certainly with Szostak over the years

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.570
that I think helped me really build

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:06.570
my confidence in the beginning.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.929
- Well, on that positive note,

00:40:08.929 --> 00:40:11.305
thank you very much, Jennifer.

00:40:11.305 --> 00:40:16.110
Being with us, and sharing the trajectory

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:18.540
of your career with us, and leading

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.680
to this wonderful discovery, thank you.

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.040
- Thanks so much for hosting me.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.470
- Yeah, and thank you
very much for joining us

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:28.248
for this Conversation with History.

00:40:28.248 --> 00:40:30.665
(soft music)
