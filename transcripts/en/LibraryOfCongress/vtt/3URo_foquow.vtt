00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.460
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: Good evening.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.100
I'm Anne McLean from the
library's music division.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.420
Tonight we are very
pleased to presenting --

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.510
to be presenting the first

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.760
of two concerts features
the musicians from Marlboro.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.070
And as you'll hear in a
conversation, the Marlboro Festival

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.910
and its extraordinary
musicians are very much a part

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.910
of our concert history here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.910
With these two concerts, we're
celebrating the 65th anniversary

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.200
of the festival, founded in 1951
by legendary artist presented here

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.910
in the Coolidge many, many
times in the past century.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.140
Adolf Busch and his brother Hermann
Busch, Rudolf Serkin, Marcel Moyse

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.040
and his wife, Blanche Honegger
Moyse and their son, Louis.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.070 position:56%
And I'd like to introduce three
wonderful artists who are continuing

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.600 position:56%
to Marlboro tradition, cellist Marcy
Rosen, who's appeared her a number

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.520
of times and violinist, David
McCarroll and Emilie-Anne Gendron.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.760
Also with us is a good friend
and colleague, Michael Wilpers,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.320
who is a performing arts
programmer for the Bill

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.480
and Mary Meyer Concert Series

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.140
at the Smithsonian's Freer
and Sackler Galleries.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.110 position:56%
We are really delighted that Michael
had been very interested with us

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.300
in the idea of a joint presentation

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.310
for the Marlboro concerts
this season,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.100
which has a particular resonance
for our 90th anniversary.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.880
We had the idea to join forces
this very informal talk,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.910
inspired by all the warm
relationships that grew

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.390
out of the founding artist
friendships and connections.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.080 position:56%
And we'd like to talk about how so
many Marlboro influences have helped

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.120
to shape the practice and the
performance of chamber music

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.270
over the past six and
a half decades.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.810
In fact, that story of
Marlboro is really the story

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.650
of chamber music in America.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.390
Something the library and the Freer
both have a long perspective on.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.650
And both our organizations
have been a part

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.970
of that story since its beginning.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.330
The first concert sponsored here
in Washington by our founder,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.120
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge,
were presented

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.130
at the Freer in February 1924.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.210
Before we look at some
of this history,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.110
including the American debut by
Serkin and Busch here in 1933,

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.120
we wanted to talk with the artists
and set the scene a little bit

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.320
about the current Marlboro life
and talk about your experience.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.320
Michael, you had a
question on this for them.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Wilpers: Well, one
of the things, I had a chance

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.960
to visit Marlboro finally a couple
summers ago and I discovered

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.850
that for me, it felt so much more
like a retreat than a festival

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.680
in the conventional sense
because it's so far away

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.350
out in the mountains and the woods.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.040
And it -- what came to life for
me were quotes I had already read

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.240
on the anniversaries of Marlboro
by so many of the artists --

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.670
was the unique opportunity
for some of the young artists,

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.700
not knowing how unique it was, to
spend very extended lengths of time

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.540
on individual pieces in rehearsal.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.340
There's often reiterated quote
in some of the literature

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.220
by a young artist who went
to Marlboro and thought,

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.050
"I've made the right
career decision.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.720
This is wonderful, we get to work
on pieces for weeks and weeks

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.590
and then perform them in public,
only when they're perfect."

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.770
And only after leaving Marlboro
and then finally launching

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.620
onto a music career, getting
invited to a symphony orchestra

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.610
to play a concerto, found out
that he gets one rehearsal

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.520
and then we go onstage.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.000
And this was somewhat of a
crushing disappointment and a slap

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.190
of reality, but it's -- everyone
at Marlboro speaks about the --

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.920
the richness in interpretation
and insight into a piece,

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.800 position:56%
shared insight perfection of a piece

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.140
through all the time that's
spent together on them.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.900
So I was hoping that each of you
might reflect on some of the ways

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.640
of which that much time on a piece

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.340
with such great musicians has
created memorable insights

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.050
and routinely gives you a
much, much deeper knowledge

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.530
and awareness of a piece.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.870
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: Well,
I guess I'll start.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.900
First of all, nothing's
ever perfect.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.210
But we do have an incredible
luxury of time to spend there

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.530
and through -- when you -- and I
have a saying that I like to say,

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.710
which is that when you
learn something at Marlboro,

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.770
you know it for your lifetime.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.960
And that's true of any piece
that I worked on there as a --

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.280
as a student starting
back many years ago.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.180
And the things and the pieces
that I've explored in the time

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.270
that I've come back and
been one of the old people,

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.640
it's been really incredible.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.810
David and I have spent a
lot of time together there.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.640
We have the luxury of working on
two of Beethoven's late quartets,

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.590 position:56%
the Opus 130 with the fugue and then
the next summer we did Opus 131.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.840
And we spent seven weeks
on each of those pieces

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.080
and we had an incredible time
exploring that and learning that,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.910
and being inspired not just
by our own work with it,

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.730
but by input that we got from other
people that were at the festival,

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.530
like Michael Tree and
Arnold Steinhardt.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.800
And so we had great lessons
with those people and I think

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.200
that the idea of sharing ideas
is what Marlboro is really about,

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.880
also learning how to
vocalize your own ideas.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.980
And I think that's
really the main gift

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.250
that we're given at
-- at the festival.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.930
And so, it's -- it is called
a festival, it is a retreat,

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.430
we all live together, we all eat
together, we all get crazy together

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.190
and we all get really
grumpy together, a few.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.780
So everybody -- you have to learn
to live with the moods and you --

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.090
and live in close quarters and now
we have the outlets of computers

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.080 position:56%
and cell phones, which when I was
there as a kid, we didn't have that.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.440
There was one payphone in each dorm
and I -- we used to write letters.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.970
Remember how we used
to write letters?

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.300
Yeah, such a luxury, that's also
something that we don't do anymore,

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:33.810
but it's a -- it's a great place to
-- to be nurtured in a musical way.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.110
&gt;&gt; David McCarroll: As
Marcy said everything

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.410
so beautifully, it's hard to add.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.310
But one thing I would
add is just the --

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.700
the place itself, the nature I
think is very important to it,

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.420
that it's not -- you don't
realize the hectic pace of life

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.430 position:56%
that you know is going on, you know,
for seven weeks at the same time,

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.650
but you're just so
far away from that.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.140
And that, you know, I often think
about this, that life is sort

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.150
of getting a, you know,
faster and faster pace,

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.170
almost uncontrollably so.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:08.670
And it's just -- obviously when it
was founded 65 years ago, probably,

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.380
you know, Serkin could
never even imagined how --

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.550
how valuable it is today to
have seven weeks just away

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.380
from everything, just
to focus on music.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:25.100
You don't even have to worry
about food or anything, you --

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.250
you know, get up in the morning,
you walk to rehearsal, you have --

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.440
have meals with your colleagues
and friends and then you go back

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.950
to rehearsing and this just happens
over and over for seven weeks.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:41.530 position:56%
And so, inevitably something special
comes out of that -- that process.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Emilie-Anne Gendron: Yeah, I
mean, all these things I fully agree

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.690
with and yeah, the only thing
I guess I could add is --

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.600
well, I guess a couple things.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.930
First of all, Michael,
you mentioned the --

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.900
the hypothetical case
of the young person

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.780
who has the slap in
the face of reality.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.670
And, you know, after having spent
such luxury of time of working

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.710
on pieces and, it's
funny, I think about that

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.560
because my experience coming
to Marlboro was actually kind

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.050
of the opposite of that
because I was sort of --

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.500
well, my time at Marlboro was spent

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.750
like in my -- my late
20's basically.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.870
So I'd already sort of been out
of school and, you know, working

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:30.690
and doing concerts and, you know,
I -- by the time I was at Marlboro,

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:35.090
like in my daily life during
the year, I knew pretty well how

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.350
to put something together
pretty quickly and to, you know,

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:42.540
create the illusion that I knew
it as well as I possibly did.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.920
But -- but it was actually
kind of an enlightening

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.360 position:56%
and completely shattering experience
for me to have these years --

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.180
these summers at Marlboro where
I didn't have to feel that,

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.420
like I was constantly under
the gun of having to, you know,

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.430
put something together
really quickly and just sort

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.090
of like make the product.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.270
It -- it wasn't about that, it
was really just about the exchange

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:08.430
of these ideas and how to
vocalize them, as Marcy said.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:14.030 position:56%
And, you know -- yeah, the luxury of
time, it really taught me something

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:20.760
about what it means to approach
music just -- not as a vocation,

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.250
but as a thinking musician
who, you know,

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.210
lives these pieces
time and time again.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:32.240 position:56%
And that's actually one of the big
privileges of having pieces selected

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.050
for these musicians from
Marlboro tours that, you know,

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:40.970
we had the luxury of spending
such time on them, so much time,

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.810
you know, in a past summer and
then we have time away from it for,

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.780
you know, well, in this
case, like two years.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.660
And then we came back to it and
the insights and the things,

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.980
at least for myself,
that I -- that I --

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:58.910
that came forth when I sort of
studied it a second time, you know,

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.680
that was also like very
eye-opening to just have --

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.140
yeah, the luxury of time, but
then also time away from it.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:12.040
And then, I'm speaking specifically
about the Penderecki piece,

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.490
which will be featured tonight.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.850
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: The tours are
always set up around a work

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.620
that gets what supposedly is
an extraordinary performance

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.770
at the festival, so we don't like
to think that we do things that --

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.400
on that level all the time.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.220
But, so we -- we did a nice
performance of the Penderecki

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.710
at Marlboro and Mr. Penderecki
was there and we worked with him.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.800
And it's a -- actually a really,
incredibly wonderful piece,

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.480
which I know you'll enjoy.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.180 position:56%
It's very atmospheric, very --
well, Emilie describes it very well.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.990
She'll -- she'll talk about that
later, but it's a really beautiful

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.180
and very accessible piece
with gorgeous textures

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.010
and colors, so it's moving.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:59.950
And I think the program that we
built around it also enhances that,

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:04.060 position:56%
so the program's -- the program fits
together in a really lovely way.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.690 position:56%
But actually none of the pieces ends
with a big loud chord, everything --

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.030 position:56%
everything ends softly, so that's --

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.450
that's something actually
-- I actually really like.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.130
It requires a different attention

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.170
and a different reaction
from -- from all of you.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Wilpers: If I could
follow up with one more question

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.000
about the experience at Marlboro.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.820
One thing you learn when
you're visiting there,

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:30.240
spending time there is
egalitarian philosophy.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.050
There -- there are words
I used when I was there

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.550
that I learned quickly not to use

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.100
and I wish I could
remember what they were.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.620 position:56%
It might have been, you know, master
musician and student or faculty

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.640
and student, certain words like
that, but those are really --

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.260
you leave them at the door,
maybe senior artists' use --

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.910
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: We're called
senior members, but --

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Wilpers: --
senior members, yes.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.540
But I was going to -- what
I was going to get to is

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.400
when you're rehearsing,
you know, [inaudible],

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.620 position:56%
many of us have probably seen master
classes where there's no question,

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.940 position:56%
in fact, that's the whole point that
the master is putting the student

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.530
in their place at many --
in a lot of -- often enough.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.230
But I wonder if in these long
-- long weeks of rehearsal,

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:20.190
how you negotiate between the
musicians who have been around

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.710
and played the piece for decades,
and young musicians coming

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.680
in who are extremely talented, but
don't have that depth of experience

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:32.090
and yet, the ideal is you share
reflections and input equally.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:36.530
So I just wonder if you
could tell a few anecdotes

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:41.030
or make some generalities about
how that plays out over the weeks.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.780
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: Well, I think
it's -- I mean, I'll speak --

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.080
I can only speak for myself,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.070
but I think it's different
with each senior.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:51.900
I -- you know, everybody runs
their groups a little differently

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.200
and I can tell you in --

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.060
in the years that I was
there with what people

00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:00.010 position:56%
that I consider my mentors, I pretty
much did everything they told me

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.620
to do.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.840
And -- and I really learned from
that and I wanted to do that,

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.270
I wanted to hear Felix
Galimir tell me what to do.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:13.550
And I wanted to take in his --
and I wanted to soak it up and --

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:19.810
and in fact, the soaking up of
the knowledge and the education

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:25.000
that I had from Felix Galimir and
Philipp Naegele and Pina Carmirelli

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.940
and [inaudible] and Rudolf
Serkin and Sasha Schneider

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.530
and Mischa Schneider and all these,
you know, the list is humongous.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.590
And I was privileged to
get to work with them,

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:39.080
that's the whole reason I went
back was because I felt I wanted

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.260
to pass their -- I didn't want
their knowledge to die and I wanted

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.760
to pass it -- pass it on.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.450
And so I'm like the next
step to keeping some

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:49.760
of those traditions alive.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.850
And I want those traditions to be
carried on and so I tried to --

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.690
I don't teach in these things,
but you know, I think just that --

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:03.720
just sometimes I'll say
something that will inspire people

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:09.150
or the idea will come out in a
good way and that's all its doing.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.170
I think we're just all working
together, but believe me,

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:17.170
it's a privilege for me to work
with Emilie, and David, and Danny,

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:22.880
and Anthony, who I also knew
when he was much younger

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.630
and it keeps you on your toes.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:30.610
I mean, I have to play my
best to play with these guys

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.760 position:56%
and it's -- it's really a privilege.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.320
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: I think another
thing that you guys always touch

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.920
on is the Marlboro tradition of
being faithful to the work itself.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.350
And I was reading to --

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:48.440
reading about Serkin
learning this from Schoenberg.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:53.880 position:56%
He was involved with Schoenberg's
Society for Private Music in Vienna,

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:59.080
but they had a very close
affinity for study of the text.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:03.110
And maybe this is a -- we could
segue and look at a couple

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:08.160
of items here, see if
our PowerPoint works.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.550
Serkin was -- was 17
when he met Adolf Busch

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:17.480
and later married his daughter,
Irene -- that's correct.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.780
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: Irene.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: Irene -- and they
came to the United States very early

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:27.040
in -- our association was in
1933, but let's see if we can pull

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.830
up just a quick bunch of images.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.050 position:56%
We'll flip through them and then we
have a picture of the first program.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:33.350
Oh, we already have
this one on there.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.650
Okay, great.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:35.950
Well, these are the founders.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:41.000
This photo shows one unidentified
man, but there's Moyse,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.530
a woodwind guru, flutist
and these are --

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.780
as you say, these were artists
who knew many of the composers.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.710 position:56%
Moyse, for example, knew [inaudible]
and a lot of famous artists.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.720
Felix Galimir played with
Ravel and, you know, this --

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.530
this lore, as you say, was
passed on a great deal.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.740
His wife, there's Hermann Busch,
the cellist and conductor,

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.330
who was also part of
Busch's string quartet,

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.760
which played here very early on.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:17.880
Let's see, just some quick images
of Serkin, the animating spirit,

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.860
that they say, of Marlboro.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.790
This is a CD which you can
buy, it's on the open market

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.500 position:56%
and it has some wonderful recordings
from our archives that they --

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.310 position:56%
some -- and some from other sources,

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:33.870
but some from our archives
too, which is great.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:40.210
Moyse in rehearsal.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.280
David Sawyer, yeah.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:49.630
The Casals, maybe you
want to say anything

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.680
about the Casals tradition
at Marlboro?

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.990
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: Well, unfortunately
he died just before I went,

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.100
so I never had any exposure to him.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.560
But certainly the Schneider's
kept his -- his way of --

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.300
way of doing things alive
for a long, long time.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.610
And there is a long history
of Casals doing master classes

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:13.510
and teaching and conducting
and so, that -- that --

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.540
some things have evolved
and gone on.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:22.640 position:56%
And so, unfortunately Casals was a
little bit back in the 70's now and,

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.630
you know, it's -- it's
sad, but true,

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.640
you can still find wonderful
videos and stuff of him.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.900
They have -- there's a whole
collection of his master classes --

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.200
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: And recordings.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.500
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: -- at Marlboro.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.800
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: Yeah, I think
-- were they part of the collection

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.100
on Bridge where I think
a couple [inaudible] --

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.400
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: I think so, yeah.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.960
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: -- the 50th
anniversary release on Bridge.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.950
And I remember reading a comment
about Casals saying that he worked

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.360
with orchestras to teach
them to play repertoire

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.040
as chamber music pieces
-- interesting.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:58.180 position:56%
Mitsuko Uchida and Richard Goode,
the two co-directors for awhile now.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.370
Mitsuko is the main
director, sole director.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.260
This is just a fun,
beautiful little illustration.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.850
It's a great article, <i>The Music
Mountain </i>, an Alex Ross article

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.240
if you'd like to read
more about Marlboro.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.870
These are -- yeah, from the --

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.510
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: Thank goodness I'm
not wearing the same thing tonight.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:20.410
[ Laughter ]

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:24.140
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: And
formal nice things.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.050
Sam Rhodes from the
Juilliard Quartet.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:29.560
That's another thing we could talk
about a lot is how the influence

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.890
of Marlboro percolates out
through so many ensembles,

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:34.680
even for example, your quarter.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.920
You want to say something
about the Momenta Quartet

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:42.280
and you studied the Koussevitzky
work that you mentioned earlier?

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.780
&gt;&gt; Emilie-Anne Gendron: Oh yeah,
well, we were emailing before,

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.140
today, and -- yeah, I just -- well,
I was just thinking in my head,

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.120
what is, you know, what are
the connections that I --

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.220
that I know of between like --

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:59.000
yeah, just Marlboro and
the Koussevitzky legacy.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.470
And, I mean, first of all
like if you look down --

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.950
if you just like skim
the list of, you know,

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.830
all of the Koussevitzky
commissions that have been awarded,

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.390
it's like every major
name of the 20th

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.620
and 21st Century compositionally.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:16.100
And some of the greatest
works of our time have come

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:21.820
out of the Koussevitzky commission
and -- yeah, my quartet --

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.880
Momenta Quartet, we
have had the great honor

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.310
of having two Koussevitzky
commissioned pieces written for us.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:34.530
One by Kyung Chung, who is a
Malaysia-based composer and one

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:38.410
by Augustine Fernandez, who
is a Bolivian composer based

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.210
in the U.K. now.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:47.900
And yeah, I was thinking just,
you know, about what are some

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.430
of the other pieces, you know,
that I know of chamber wise

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.050
that are Koussevitzky related and I
immediately thought of [inaudible]

00:19:54.050 --> 00:20:00.380 position:56%
which is one of the cornerstones of
the 20th Century quartet literature.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.330
It's an amazing work
and I realized that --

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:08.530
my quartet plays it a lot now and
I realized that I got my start --

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.950
the reason I really love
this piece is because I spent

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.090
like six weeks working
on it at Marlboro

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.770
like four or five years ago.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.820
And it's -- yeah, well,
that's an amazing piece.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.840
But there is so much amazing
music that has come out --

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.940
that has percolated out of, you
know, the Koussevitzky legacy

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.220
and a lot of these
composers have been studied --

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.050
these composers and these works
have been studied for many,

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:36.190 position:56%
many weeks of -- on end at Marlboro.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.600
So, it's a nice connection.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.530
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: You know,
one of the things that we talked

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:45.780
about a little bit was how people
don't think of modern music so much

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.790
at Marlboro as I think
of the great masters,

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.590
but I think that's really wrong.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:53.580
I think you guys have studied
a lot and the tradition

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:58.160
of studying these scores, I mean,
is a major part of your tradition.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.840
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: We have a
composer in residence every year.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:06.240
I mean, I'm -- I'm
often involved in --

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.270
in those pieces, I don't
know why, but I am.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.570
They make me [laughter].

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:14.700
But [inaudible] has been
there a couple of times,

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:20.150
Mr. Penderecki was there,
[inaudible] has been there.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:24.190 position:56%
Next year, Sofia Gubaidulina is
coming, which is kind of incredible.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.490
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: Nice.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:27.060
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: She never goes
anywhere, yeah, really like,

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.170
she literally never goes anywhere.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.800
So it's really like a -- I think --

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.370
I think they're like going to
like put her in a little box

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:41.030 position:56%
and preserve her and bring her over
because she's 90 something, or yeah.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:44.860
We hope that she is in
good health for the summer.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.500
So there's a huge, huge -- and it's
-- and it's becoming more and more.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.890
We do -- we do more things.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.500
Thomas Ades was there and --

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David McCarroll: I just wanted to
add, also one of my best experiences

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.140
at Marlboro was actually
working with Sam Rhodes

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.300
on Carter, clarinet quintet.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.920
Which -- well, I feel of
course, any of the music we work

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.940 position:56%
on in Marlboro warrants that sort of
time, but you know, with that piece,

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.250 position:56%
you literally cannot put it together
in much less time than that.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:17.530
So it was -- yeah, and also
to learn it with Sam who --

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:21.700
who worked with him for decades
in the Juilliard Quartet.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.020
That's the sort of experience that,

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:28.380
I don't know where you would
have anywhere else, actually.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.680
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: Let's
see what else we --

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.470
we'll move on from
there, just a second.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.500
That's a classic photograph
that you see a lot, Van Cliburn

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.510
and James Levine at age 12.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:43.530
[ Laughter ]

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.430
Alexander Schneider.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:46.730
&gt;&gt; And Casals.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.490
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: And
Casals, look at in the back.

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:52.750
And back to quartets for a minute,
here at the library, of course,

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.530
we have -- we are a quartet mecca
really and so many of the quartets

00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:00.560
that had been associated with
the Marlboro legacy have passed

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.860
through here.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.520
For example, Alexander Schneider's
own quartet, he had a quartet

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.920
for a number of years and Hermann
Busch was part of that actually.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.570
And of course, the
Juilliard and the Emerson

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.410 position:56%
and many other quartets have had one

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:17.690
or more members learn their life's
history and work and calling

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.970
from these great artists.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:22.360
So let's see, a couple more.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.970
Blanche Honegger Moyse --
did you ever go to those --

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.270
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: Oh, sure.

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: Yeah, I was going
to say what their tradition was.

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:33.160
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: She did a Bach
Cantata concert every summer,

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.110
which was -- it's actually the --

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.780
the Marlboro players
didn't -- didn't do them.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:43.020
She brought in her own orchestra
mostly because we didn't have time

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.770
to devote to what she
wanted the time --

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:50.120
but the singers would all sing
and really inspirational to hear,

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.540
the Bach Cantatas in that
setting and anywhere.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:58.600
But she -- she did
it very beautifully.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: Rehearsal images.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:02.110
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: That's
the -- that was Felix.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.470
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: And this is very
nice, this is a project you did

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:08.600
at the Greene Space WQXR in
New York, a beautiful venue.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.250
One of the touring
ensembles from Marlboro.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:17.470
Michael, when did you start
presenting the Marlboro group?

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:23.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Wilpers: We
started in the fall of 1993,

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:27.070
the Meyer family had long history

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:30.160
with Marlboro musicians
and the festival.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.300
And the director of the museum
at the time, Milo Beach,

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:39.300 position:56%
was good friends with both Katherine
Graham and Elizabeth Meyer.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.850
And as long as we're looking
at those older pictures,

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:45.610
I was going to mention
that Elizabeth Meyer,

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.870
the wife of Eugene Meyer, former
owner of the Washington Post,

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.950
former first head of
the World Bank and Chair

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:57.590
of the Federal Reserve
and a financier earlier.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:03.450
She and -- and Eugene
Meyer collected Chinese art

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.480
with Freer back in the
very early 20th Century.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:17.350 position:56%
And after Freer died and years
later during the war, Agnes Meyer --

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.400 position:56%
according to Frank Solomon, let's --

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.770
who I was told just all about
this a couple summers ago --

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:28.040
when Serkin and the
Busch's had left Germany,

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.900
in the middle of the war
and gone to Switzerland.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.870
I think, were eager
to get out of Europe

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:39.520
and Agnes Meyer went personally
to the state department to lobby

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.680
for getting their Visa's
put through.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.370 position:56%
And that's how they finally got to
the U.S. permanently during the war.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:52.450
And then their -- one of their
sons, Bill Meyer, became --

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:56.630
and his wife became supporters
of Marlboro and went regularly.

00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:02.130
So when the Meyer Auditorium
reopened in 1993, after renovation

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.950 position:56%
with funds from Katharine Graham and
the Meyer family, it was renamed,

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:07.060
the Eugene and Agnes
Meyer Auditorium.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.160
And the grandchildren of Eugene

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.460
and Agnes helped start the Meyer
concert series on the provision

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.110
that it regularly include the
musicians from Marlboro every year.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:22.010
And we -- Milo Beach [inaudible]
had no trouble agreeing to that

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.140
and so we've had Marlboro
there every year

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.280
for the last 20 some years.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.060
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: And it
is a wonderful segue from us

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.300
and this is part of the history
that Michael and I talked

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.300
about when we first had this
idea to share the project

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.910
for your anniversary year.

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:40.660 position:56%
And our anniversary too, was that
we began presenting Marlboro in 1980

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:43.960 position:56%
with great pleasure for something
we call the Saturday Series and then

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.050
when -- with I think, the first
performers were Hiroko Yajima

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:49.090
and Andras Schiff, among others.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:50.390
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: Gary Hoffman.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:51.690
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean:
Gary Hoffman, exactly.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.410
Boy, you have a memory,
a great memory.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.800
And then we had to shut down
our operation as many of you

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.670
in the audience remember because we
had the whole building renovated,

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:03.350
so there was an eight year, nine
-- eight and half, nine year period

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.460
when we could do no
concerts and thankfully,

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.940
you were able to -- to take it on.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.720
Let's see, let's amp this
part, oh, that's a nice one.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:16.900 position:56%
Let's see if we can get out of this.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.800
[Inaudible] -- yeah
[inaudible] and Isidore Cohen,

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.530
one of my favorite people.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:23.970
I got a kick out of reading in
your bread book that it said,

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.530
Mr. Cohen would look at the
musicians very carefully

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.650
and he's say, "Well,
what do you think?

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:30.260 position:56%
Should there be a [inaudible] here?"

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:38.270
Okay, so end that and we'll
escape and then minimize.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:46.370
Now one more thing I was looking
forward to showing you and that is

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:56.200 position:56%
down at the bottom, this is the
image of the first Marlboro program.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.550
This is the -- it's so sweet
that it says the first appearance

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:03.860
in America, but it's just very,
very heartening to see this.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.450
And one thing that's
interesting back to our ideas

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.530
about modern music,
Mr. Busch insisted

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:11.960
that there be some hot
off the press music.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.750
So for example, he included
[inaudible] and then also

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:21.020
in another program he had a
brand new, [inaudible] piece

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:25.830
which was literally -- literally
hot off the press, it was 1933

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:29.300
and the concert date was 1933.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.380
And in the letters back
and forth to our --

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:35.600
our managers, he stressed
that he wanted

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:42.810
to have a modern music element,
which is really interesting to see.

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:46.510
What other things about the
current experience that --

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:47.810
would you guys like to talk about?

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:51.000
And then we can move also into
the music for tonight too.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.170
What -- are there new projects for
Marlboro, like this whole thing

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:59.350
at QXR was kind of
fascinating to see that happen.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:00.650
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: I was there.

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:05.120
Were you there -- well,
actually what that concert is

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.700
when this year is the
50th anniversary

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.670
of the touring program -- 65th
anniversary of the festival

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.550
and the 50th anniversary
of the touring program.

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:17.810
And so, it was celebrating
the touring program

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.480
that we did a nice concert there.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.020
It was broadcast and so just
to getting generating some --

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:29.070
some hoopla among the celebration,
so that's basically what it's --

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:30.590
what it was for and we --

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:35.130
Anthony played and I
played with Jonathan Biss.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.520
We did -- and Robin Scott,
we did a Mendelssohn trio.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.720
And so, it was a -- it
was a wonderful event

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.910
as almost every event that we
do for Marlboro is wonderful.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:45.210
This is wonderful.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:47.010
We played at -- we
played at Carnegie Hall

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:48.860 position:56%
on Monday night, that was wonderful.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.330 position:56%
We played in a funny little library
on Sunday in Greenwich, Connecticut,

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:53.660
but that was wonderful too.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.600
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: And we
have all your archives here,

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.480
at least many decades worth.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.040
We don't have the recent
ones, so we need to get those.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.530
Any -- is there any chance
of you guys moving to MP3's

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:08.870
to distribute now or
what's your current thinking

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:15.370
about your recording projects
online -- distribute of any kind?

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:16.700
No.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.880
&gt;&gt; Emilie-Anne Gendron:
I'm sure that will --

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.920
that's its whole dedicated
department at Marlboro.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.220
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean:
It really is, yeah.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.520
&gt;&gt; Emilie-Anne Gendron: Like
they have a team of, you know,

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.570
audio engineers and archivists

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:30.020
and they probably have a
lot of that in the works.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.990 position:56%
They're probably thinking ahead,
but -- but we don't know personally.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.290
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.550
Wasn't Paula [inaudible]
part of that in --

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.820
for a long time and
then Mischa Schneider?

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:43.010
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: Mischa
Schneider was the sort of head

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:44.830
of the Marlboro Recording Society.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.870 position:56%
And so, recordings that were made --

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.170
and there hasn't been

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:51.770
as many in-studio recordings
done in the last years.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:56.030
I hope we'll get back to that,
I don't know what's going

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:59.690
on with that, but we used to make
recordings of some of the pieces

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:01.310 position:56%
that we would perform in the summer.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.740
And Mischa was the -- was the
producer, so he did that and --

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.040
[inaudible] I think funded it.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Wilpers: I think the --

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.640
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: --
I think funded it.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Wilpers: -- the audience
here might be interested in knowing

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:14.730
that the -- Marlboro did launch a
pretty ambitious online recording

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:18.640
resource and you can hear a lot of
historic recordings from Marlboro

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:23.530
and it's completely indexed
by performer and composer.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:27.040
And you can -- it's -- and it's
always being added to every year.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.340
In fact --

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.640
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean:
On their website, or?

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Wilpers: Yeah.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.240
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: I didn't know you
could listen to recordings on that.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.540
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean:
I didn't know that.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Wilpers: I don't know
what -- which recordings they have,

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.250
I believe they're form the
festival, but [inaudible] daughter,

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:42.700
who's on the local board
of Marlboro, was very proud

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.800
of this and informed me of it.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.250
And so I -- and she asked me
to announce it before a concert

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:49.890
of Marlboro's just
a couple years ago.

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:55.120 position:56%
So it's a -- and it's always growing
and they're very happy about it.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: Before we move
to the talking more about the music,

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:00.840
anybody want to comment
about napkin throwing?

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.270
It's something you read about,
but you are the experts.

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:07.980
&gt;&gt; Emilie-Anne Gendron: I
mean, I remember the first --

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.630
like after my first summer there,

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:17.660
like it was like definitely a good
month -- it was like late September

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.600
and I found myself at a
restaurant, like you know, with --

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:27.150
in public and I had taken my napkin
and just instinctively was starting

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:30.580
to create a napkin ball
like under the table.

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:35.130
And then I realized this is not
the place, I'm not at Marlboro.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:36.690
That's the only comment I have.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:37.990
There's --

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.430
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: It's
a time honored tradition.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:44.800
All -- all ages, all backgrounds,
all instruments apparently,

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.080
you know, even Mr. Serkin.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.600
&gt;&gt; David McCarroll: Yeah, no it
really -- really does happen.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:55.310
I couldn't quite believe it before
I got there, but it -- it does.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:56.610
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: There's a --

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:58.400
or somebody that had to be
shielded with an umbrella.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.700
There's this --

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.430
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: That's
a very funny story.

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:08.590
There was the -- when -- after Mr.
Serkin died, the very beginning,

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:12.930
there was a -- there was a
trio of artistic directors.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:17.240 position:56%
And one of those artistic directors,
who I don't think I'll name,

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.100
they wanted to do away
with the napkin balls.

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:25.850
It was not something that
he appreciated and he felt

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:29.600
that he shouldn't have
to be bombarded by this.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:35.740
So a napkin free zone was set up
[laughter] in the dining hall,

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:39.320
it was a -- it was like there
was a row of music stands

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:42.500
on which there were signs
that said, "Napkin free zone,"

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:46.760
which is just really like,
asking people to -- to do it.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:51.750
And -- and we have this
wonderful librarian, her --

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.140
who's name I can mention,
her name was Shirley Weekly.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:59.080
She had been also a fixture, a
Marlboro fixture for 40 years

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.020
and she was also the
librarian at Curtis.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:07.840
A lovely lady, she had some -- she
didn't like -- she loved the --

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.800
well, let's say, she didn't
like the napkin balls either,

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.850
so she hadn't eaten in
the dining room for,

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:16.060
I don't know, 20 years or more.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.890
She always took her tray and ate

00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:20.570
in another room off the
-- off the dining hall.

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:26.230
So, this night that -- of this
inaugural napkin free zone,

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:30.960
Shirley Weekly came back into the
dining hall, thinking she was safe

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.730
and at one point, and I --

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:35.410
and I believe I know who
engineered the whole thing.

00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:39.260
And I -- as it happens, the
person who -- who was --

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.090
who was initiating this happens
to be a close friend of mine.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:46.410
Then I -- it was -- I was not in
favor of this things, but I --

00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:49.350
was sitting and having dinner with
-- with them on that side of the --

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:52.900
the other side of the barrier.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:59.690 position:56%
The entire other side of the room in
unison , got up and threw napkins.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:03.850
And Shirley Weekly never at
in the dining hall again.

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:08.200
And -- and that artistic
director also didn't stay

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.870
around for a very long
time, that was unfortunate.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:14.990
Not -- I don't know if
it was because of that.

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:16.440
It was not a good beginning.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Wilpers: Well,
I think hearing this

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.140
and seeing how much fun the
musicians have at Marlboro,

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:28.220
helped me realize where the
spirit comes from that I had seen

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.640
on stage for so many years.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.500 position:56%
Where the -- these musicians clearly

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.100
and unmistakably enjoy
what you're doing.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.220
I mean, even if some music is --

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:41.440
is very serious, it's
done in a certain manner

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.070
that is a real passion,
that comes across.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:49.280
I think it's cultivated in part
by the festival atmosphere.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:54.870
It is the farthest thing from
workman like or drudgery.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.720
And I think it says -- it may sound
frivolous, these kind of games

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.160
and antics and things,
but it definitely works.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.950
I mean, it makes the groups
that come out of Marlboro stand

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:10.790
out for the sheer enjoyment of
-- of what it is you're doing.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:14.440
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: Before we, sort
of [inaudible] give you a chance

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.370 position:56%
to -- a chance to go back and warm
up, do you want to talk a little bit

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:20.350
about the music and maybe
about the Penderecki.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:23.490
Emilie, you were saying
that you had some thoughts

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:26.430
on the texture and everything.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:31.340
&gt;&gt; Emilie-Anne Gendron: Oh, well,
ultimately -- ultimately, you know,

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:36.120
the music will more than speak
for itself, but you know,

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:42.000
the Penderecki is sort of an
incredible work of just in the kind

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.370
of atmosphere that
it creates and the --

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:48.590 position:56%
the gamut of moods that it explores.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:52.410
As many of you may know,
Penderecki -- his --

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:57.330
Penderecki's music figured into
some of the big film scores

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:59.560
of the past few decades,

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:04.500
such as <i>The Shining </i>or
even <i>The Exorcist </i>and --

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.970
and numerous other films.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:09.930
He's written -- he sort of made
that leap into pop culture.

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:12.840
I learned he even has an
asteroid named after him,

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.980
which must be like a great honor.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:20.230
But like the thing about --
yeah, I think maybe because he's

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:26.350
so effective writing for
film is that he's so adept

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:32.150
at creating just an all
encompassing mood, you know,

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.760
whatever that mood might be.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:37.940
And the piece itself is -- it's
quite short, its four movements,

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:40.530
three of them are attacka
[phonetic], they go consecutively.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:47.130
You can't really hear
when they stop and start.

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:49.620
And each movement is
sort of a tip of the hat,

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:54.600
in a way to different
composers of the past.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.440
You can -- you'll see
in your programs,

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.740
the movement titles
are very evocative.

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:04.560
There's a ironic waltz,
serenade that reminds you

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.620
of something you might hear
in a [inaudible] Schoenberg.

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:12.040
The last movement, for instance,
is -- entitled Abscheid,

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.760
which means farewell in German.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:18.630
That's a very strong Beethoven
[inaudible] reference built in.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:24.440
And so, yeah, and as Marcy
said, it really captures some

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.620
of that same sort of
a autumnal feeling

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.500
that you get in the [inaudible].

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.180
It -- they're very similar
and they're kindred spirits

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:36.660
in many ways, so hopefully this
will enhance your listening of --

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:39.140
of all the pieces in the program.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.980
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: Wonderful, and
also, so you mentioned [inaudible],

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.570
these musicians, the
touring ensemble

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:50.210
from Marlboro will be coming
back in May, again with Michael

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:52.860
as co-sponsor and they'll
be doing that work here

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.880
for then -- for that concert.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:00.650
Any questions for the
musicians and Michael -- Roger?

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:08.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yes, the publicity mentioned that
Penderecki was influence -- was --

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:14.020
that there's a relationship to
the Schubert c major quintet,

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.500
and that's one of my favorite
things, so I'm wondering

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.900
if you'd like to talk about that.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.410
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean:
Yeah, I looked that up.

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:24.440
I think it was more again,
with this sort of idea

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:28.180
of [inaudible] to Vienna
in some way.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.300
I don't think that it's -- it's not
actually, explicitly referencing it

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.940
in any way, except for maybe
that like some of the moods

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.920
that it creates that are
so untouchable sometimes.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:44.840
I sense some of the same
depth in both the pieces,

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.890
but I think it's more abstract,
you know, on an abstract level

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:52.540
that it pays almost to that piece.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.020
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: Anybody else?

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:00.270
About, let's see -- oh, and
while we're just thinking one --

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:01.750
maybe one more question.

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:04.590
Any comments on the Brahms
that you're -- for tonight?

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:07.840
This is a kind of a
great, great classic work.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.500
Have you done this before in --

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:12.100
&gt;&gt; David McCarroll:
Well, I have, but it's --

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.010 position:56%
I mean, I think we all feel the
same, it's just a great honor to get

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:19.790
to play such a piece six times
in a row and to work on it.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:24.820
There really is no other piece
like it or quite with that depth

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.530
of feeling or special
place in his life

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:32.630
and also what it expresses,
so we're enjoying it.

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:40.020
&gt;&gt; I'm curious about
[inaudible] -- oh, sorry.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:43.550
I'm curious about
cross-fertilization between seniors

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:47.810
who may be wind players,
vocalists, string players --

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:50.880
to what extent do they
extend their --

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:56.560
their nuances to other
groups of players?

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.530
That is, with a woodwind
player, a flutist, a singer,

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:03.600
[inaudible] string
group on some occasion.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.900
Yeah.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.610
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: No [laughter].

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:09.010
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean:
Interesting question, yeah.

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:11.320
&gt;&gt; Marcy Rosen: No, but
we would coach them.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:26.130
No, that's -- I'm totally getting
silly because we have a concert

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:29.210
in -- no, what -- certainly
[inaudible] was a great influence

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:31.860
on a lot of people at Marlboro.

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:39.520
And Charlie Neidich is a -- is a
current influence on lots of people

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:43.320 position:56%
in both because of his character and
because he's a really interesting

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:46.370
and very intelligent
musician that has --

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:48.920
he has a whole well of knowledge

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.450
that you just are shocked
by all the time.

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:58.230
And, you know, certainly
Benita Valente is there as a --

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:02.470
as a singer for -- as a coach for
the singers, but if you're working

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:05.820
with a singer in a chamber music
work, she is at your rehearsal.

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:09.670
So she does have some cross
fertilization in terms of working

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:14.450
on Schoenberg second quartet, for
instance, that has soprano in it.

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:21.040 position:56%
Or last summer, we did a [inaudible]
piece with -- for soprano.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:25.170
It's like basically a concerto
for soprano and cello, and done --

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:29.250
does have an orchestra part,
but she wrote a piano version

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:31.200
of it, so we did it as a trio.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.220
But so, Benita was there listening
to all of those rehearsals as well

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:37.790
and it was certainly very
helpful to have her there.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:41.730
So, there is definitely, you know,
we don't -- we don't, you know,

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:44.400
segregate -- even -- we even talk

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.840
to singers all during --
all during the summer.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:51.070
We've really considered them as
normal people [laughter] that --

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:54.730
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: Well, that
might be a good note to end on.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:58.510
Okay, well, thank you very, very
much in music and [inaudible].

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:03.260
[ Applause ]

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.910

of the Library of Congress.
