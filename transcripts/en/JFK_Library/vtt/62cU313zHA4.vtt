00:00:01.082 --> 00:00:04.862
- But the New Frontier of which I speak

00:00:04.862 --> 00:00:08.963
is not a set of promises,
it is a set of challenges.

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:19.305
- As his family, we're
proud what he stood for

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:20.300
and his continuing power.

00:00:32.488 --> 00:00:34.113
- He had the courage to plainly admit

00:00:34.113 --> 00:00:37.039
America's own shortcomings,
to then lay out bold plans

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:39.748
to address those problems and
to ask his fellow Americans

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:41.758
for help in solving them.

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:44.094
And in doing so, he inspired a generation

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:45.000
to enter public service.

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:56.162
- Kennedy symbolized a set
of values and attitudes

00:00:56.162 --> 00:01:00.329
about civic life that made
it such an attractive calling.

00:01:01.787 --> 00:01:05.399
The idea that politics
could in fact be a noble

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.918
and worthwhile pursuit, the
notion that our problems,

00:01:08.918 --> 00:01:12.000
while significant were
never insurmountable.

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:17.761
- It sums up not what I intent
to offer the America people

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:21.383
but what I intend to ask of them.
