00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.420
This is a thinker who helps us understand
why our lives and relationships are full of

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.980
so much confusion and pain. He tells us why
life is hard, and how to cope.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.740
His own life incurred a lot of anxiety. Sigmund
Schlomo Freud was born to a middle-class Jewish

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.820
family in 1856.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.260
His professional life was not an immediate
success. As a medical student, he dissected

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.199
hundreds of eels in an unsuccessful attempt
to locate their reproductive organs.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.299
He promoted cocaine as a medical drug, but
it turned out to be a dangerous and addictive idea.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.520
A few years later he founded the discipline
that would ultimately make his name.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.120
A new psychological medicine he called

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.499
PSYCHOANALYSIS

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.119
The landmark study was his 1900 book The Interpretation
of Dreams.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.899
Many others followed.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.779
Despite his success, he was often unhappy.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.440
During some particularly strenuous research
he recorded, “The chief patient I am preoccupied

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.990
with is myself…” He was convinced he would
die between 61 and 62 and had great phobias

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.780
about those numbers. (Although he actually
died much later, at age 83.)

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.770
Perhaps because of his frustrations, Freud
achieved a series of deep insights into the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.100
sources of human unhappiness.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.579
He proposed that we are all driven by the:

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.229
Pleasure Principle

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.360
which inclines us towards easy physical and
emotional rewards:

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.880
and away from unpleasant things like drudgery
and discipline. As infants we are guided more

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.600
or less solely according to the pleasure principle,
Freud argued.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.399
But it will, if adhered to without constraints,
lead us to dangerous reckless things:

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.869
like never doing any work
eating too much

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.450
or, most notoriously, sleeping with members
of own family.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.179
We need to adjust to what Freud called

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:50.670
THE REALITY PRINCIPLE

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.240
Though we all have to bow to this reality
principle, Freud believed that there were

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.480
better and worse kinds of adaptations. He
called the troublesome ones

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.920
NEUROSES

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.030
Neuroses are the result of faulty negotiations
with –or in Freud’s language, repression

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.470
of–the pleasure principle.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.650
Freud described a conflict between three parts
of our minds: the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.190
ID

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.959
driven by the pleasure principle, and the

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.180
THE SUPEREGO

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.680
driven by a desire to follow the rules and
do the right thing according to society.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.950
and the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.010
EGO

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.390
which has to somehow accomodate the two.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.739
To understand more about these dynamics, Freud
urged us to think back to the origins of our

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.340
neuroses in childhood.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.800
As we grow up, we go through what Freud termed:

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.180
THE ORAL PHASE

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.060
where we deal with all the feelings around
ingestion and eating.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.760
If our parents aren’t careful we might pick
up all kinds of neuroses here: we might take

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.959
pleasure in refusing food, or turn to food
to calm ourselves down, or hate the idea of

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.060
depending on anyone else for food.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.980
Then comes

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.830
THE ANAL PHASE

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.470
which is closely aligned with what we now
call “potty-training”.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.030
During this period, our parents tell us what
to do--and when to go. At this phase we begin

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.650
to learn about testing the limits of authority.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.939
Again, if things go wrong, if we don’t feel
authority is benign enough, we might, for

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.239
example, choose to withhold out of defiance.

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.810
Then, as adults, we might become “anally
retentive”; in other words, not able to

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.299
give or surrender.

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:23.860
Next comes:

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.239
THE PHALLIC PHASE

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.069
which goes until about age 6. Freud shocked
his contemporaries by insisting that little

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.280
children have sexual feelings. Moreover, in
the phallic phase children direct their sexual

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.689
impulses towards their parents, the most immediately
available and gratifying people around.

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:42.930
Freud famously described what he called

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.230
THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.750
Where we are unconsciously predisposed towards

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.280
“being in love with the one parent and hating the other.”

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.920
What is complex is that no matter how much
our parents love us, they cannot extend this

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.909
to sexual life and will always have another
life with a partner. This makes our young

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.689
selves feel dangerously jealous and angry
– and also ashamed and guilty about this

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:10.111
anger. The complex provides a huge amount
of internalised worry for a small child.

00:04:10.111 --> 00:04:14.460
Ultimately, most of us experience some form of confusion around our parents

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.480
that later ties into our ideas of love.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.090
Mum and dad may both give us love, but they
often mix it in with disturbed behaviour.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.330
Yet because we love them, we remain loyal
to them and also to their bizarre, destructive

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.810
patterns. For example, if our mother is cold,
we will be apt nevertheless to long for her.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.470
And as a result, however, we may be prone
to always associate love with a certain distance.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.480
Naturally, the result is very difficult adult
relationships. Often the kind of love we’ve

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.000
learned from mum and dad means we can’t
fuse sex and love because the people we learnt

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.130
about love from are also those we were blocked
from having sex with. We might find that the

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.220
more in love with someone we are, the harder
it becomes to make love to them. This can

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.630
reach a pitch of crisis after a few years
of marriage and some kids.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.940
Freud compared the issues we so often have
with intimacy to hedgehogs in the winter:

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.760
they need to cuddle for warmth, but they also
can’t come too close because they’re prickly.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.380
There’s no easy solution. Freud says we
can’t make ourselves fully rational, and

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.240
we can’t change society, either. In his
1930 book Civilisation and its Discontents,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.000
Freud wrote that society provides us with
many things, but it does this by imposing

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.840
heavy dictates on us: insisting that we sleep
with only a few (usually one) other, imposing

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.810
the incest taboo, requiring us to put off
our immediate desires, demanding that we follow

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.090
authority and work to make money. Societies
themselves are neurotic–that is how they

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.250
function - and it’s why there are constant
wars and other troubles.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:51.560
Freud attempted to invent a treatment for
our many neuroses: psychoanalysis. He thought

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:55.930
that with a little proper analysis, people
could uncover what ails them and better adjust

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.040
to the difficulties of reality.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.960
In his sessions he analysed a number of key
things.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.480
He looked at people’s dreams, which he saw as expressions of

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.060
WISH FULFILLMENTS

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.940
He also looked at

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.900
PARAPRAXES

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.840
or slips of the tongue.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.340
We now call these revealing mistakes

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.250
FREUDIAN SLIPS

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.990
Like when we write ‘thigh’ when we wanted
to write ‘though’.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.130
He also liked to think about jokes. He believed
that jokes often help us make fun of something

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.860
symbolic like death or marriage, and thus
relieve some of our anxiety about these topics.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.479
There’s a temptation to say Freud just made
everything up, and life isn’t quite so hard

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:35.880
as he makes it out to be. But then one morning
we find ourselves filled with inexplicable

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.940
anger towards our partner, or running high
with unrelenting anxiety on the train to work,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.440
and we’re reminded all over again just how
elusive, difficult, and Freudian

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.500
our mental workings actually are.

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.700
We could still reject his work, of course.
But as Freud said,

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.820
“No one who disdains the key will ever be able to unlock the door.”

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.620
We could all use a bit more of Freud’s ideas

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.040
to help us unpick ourselves.
