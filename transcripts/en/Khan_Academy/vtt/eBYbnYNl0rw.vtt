00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.760
In the last video we saw that
it's not just an issue of one

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.440
bank failing.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.380
Because maybe one bank
does fail, some of

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.690
its loans come due.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.530
In this case, Bank A
had some loans from

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.170
Bank B that come due.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.770
It couldn't liquidate
these assets.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.640
And then it couldn't liquidate
these CDOs for enough money to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.660
pay for this loan.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.780
So Bank A had to go
into bankruptcy.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.230
Then we saw that could create
a whole chain of events.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.750
Then this loan that Bank B had
made to Bank A, the one that

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.340
actually precipitated
the event, that had

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.200
to be written down.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.440
Because then Bank A is going to
go into bankruptcy and you

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.740
don't know how much you're
going to get

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.820
back for that loan.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.210
And of course, everybody who
had loans to Bank A, maybe

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.270
Bank D had loans to Bank A.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.640
So maybe this asset right here
was also a loan to Bank A.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.980
Everyone with loans to Bank A
all of a sudden gets afraid.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.860
They might have to write
down their assets.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.110
And now, on top of the CDO
problem that we were all

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.920
talking about, these smelly
assets that no one wants to

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.920
value correctly, on top of that
you have this issue of

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.420
these loans that I made to this
other bank, now all of a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.050
sudden those are impaired
assets.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.890
These are assets that probably
aren't worth what I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.240
thought they were.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.390
And so you have this
situation.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.110
One, Bank A was the
last one to fall.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.230
But maybe everyone starts
looking at Bank C next.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.500
And it's usually reflected
in the stock price.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.970
People start shorting the stock,
the stock go starts

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.820
going down.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.170
And then Bank C has a situation
where it has some

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.560
loan to Bank F, it comes due.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.800
And because its stock price is
going down, no one wants to

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.210
lend it money because they say
oh you're just another Bank A,

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.230
I'm not going to
lend you money.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.590
No one wants to jump in and give
them equity, no sovereign

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.050
wealth fund.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.620
Because you're just going to
go to zero, why would I buy

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.250
any stock for even $1 a share
when it's going to go to zero

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.550
because your liabilities are
greater than your equity.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.270
So no one wants to
save them either.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.750
And so now, you have this chain
reaction occurring, this

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.540
cascade of negative events.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.830
All the banks are afraid to
lend to any other bank.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.650
And you've probably read
articles that the Fed is

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.940
injecting liquidity.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.810
What the Fed was doing was, they
were saying, OK, we'll

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.260
take some of these assets
that Bank C has.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.490
We'll take them as collateral
and we'll lend you money.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.460
And even if this was horrible
collateral, the Fed just got

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.500
very nervous and just started
lending money to anybody.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.580
Anybody who was allowed to
borrow from the Fed.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.050
And I don't know if you
remember, but the

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.750
Fed extended it.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.280
Normally, it's just
commercial banks.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.480
But at the beginning of the
credit crisis-- or actually

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.080
after the Bear Stearns collapse,
the Fed allowed

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.910
investment banks and other
people to start borrowing from

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.590
the Federal Reserve directly.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.590
Normally, when the Federal
Reserve lends money to

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.100
someone, that person borrows
that money, keeps some of it,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.670
and lends the rest
to someone else.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.620
And so that money enters
the system.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.420
And it allows the actual money
supply to increase.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.250
But what's been happening now
is when banks use this money

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.720
to borrow from the Fed or to
borrow any money, they used

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.500
these assets as collateral,
they just sit

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.240
tight on that cash.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.980
Because they're like, I don't
know what my assets are worth.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.860
I don't know what other of my
assets are going to fail.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.210
When these loans come
due that I owe, I

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.330
better have some cash.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.120
Otherwise, I'm just going
to be another Bank A.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.900
So people were borrowing from
the Fed, or borrowing in

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.730
general, but they weren't
lending out again.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.310
So that money just kind of
went into a black hole.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.880
So everyone was just sitting
tight on top of their money.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.030
So what's the problem here?

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.600
Well clearly, one bank
failure can lead to

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.770
multiple bank failures.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.280
Especially if no one's willing
to lend them more money.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.980
So you can say, oh well the only
problem is all of these

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.180
banks just fail and who knows
the world might be

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.030
better off for that.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.160
Because you won't have all
these people who frankly

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.540
aren't making anything.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.280
Although, I don't want
to say that.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.020
Because there is a use for the
financial services sector.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.190
But to some degree a lot of what
happened in the last five

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.160
years, they weren't creating
value, they were just

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.950
leveraging up and increasing
the risk in the system.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.420
But anyway, let's
put that aside.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.060
So you might say, OK,
worst case, these

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.510
banks all go bankrupt.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.820
They get restructured.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.270
But they come back.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.550
The only negative of that
will be that the current

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.180
shareholders lose
all their money.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.720
But that's OK, no
risk no return.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.440
There was risk.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.640
And the risk was that your
stock goes to zero.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.760
But then the banks will come
back with new equity.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.040
And then they'll
be back in five

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.870
years under new ownership.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.800
You might say that's OK.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.280
What the problem is maybe all of
these banks, there's just a

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.160
cascade, they go under.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.820
But not all of these loans
that they make out are to

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.180
other banks.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.850
Some of these loans they make
out to the real economy, what

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.640
everyone is calling
Main Street now.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.500
Some of these loans they're
making out are to a company

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.990
that makes tractors.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.400
Or company maybe it's an
agricultural company that

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.650
needs loans to buy seeds for
the next year's crop.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.040
So these are loans that are
actually funneled into the

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.790
real economy.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.870
And if every bank is just
sitting on their money, then

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.190
these loans aren't going to be
made into the real economy.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.040
Those real companies aren't
going to be able to make

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.650
investments, to buy seeds, or
to make a loan to build a

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.090
factory for a product that's
actually doing quite well.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.080
And so everyone will
be starved off.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.380
And we'll go into this
massive recession.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.590
Because even though there is
good uses of capital, if you

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.700
were to give someone a loan,
they could use that loan to

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.210
actually create value by
planting seeds, or

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.640
by building a factory.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.220
Those loans aren't available.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.770
Those factories won't
get built.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.510
Those seeds won't get planted.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.130
The farmers will
lay off people.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.340
The factories will
lay off people.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.080
And you could imagine,
we'll go into this

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.750
economic down cycle.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.560
So that's what Paulson and
the Federal Service

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.390
are concerned about.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.070
Although, some people would
debate that they're more

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.250
concerned about the banks
than the real economy.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.220
And they're just using the
real economy as kind of a

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.040
sideshow or the rationale.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.750
So what are they arguing
that they want to do?

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.930
Well they said the crux of this
issue is, if these $2

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.090
billion in CDOs, whatever the
CDOs at any of the banks are

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.200
holding, if only the people
could realize the value.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.570
If only this $2 billion that
they have on their books could

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.230
be turned into $2 billion
of cash, this

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.410
wouldn't be a problem.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.180
Because when these loans come
due, if you believe this $2

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.520
billion, then all of these banks
have positive net worth.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.780
They all have positive equity.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.110
And then this whole chain
reaction won't happen.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.350
So when the bailout plan first
came out and they said we'll

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.340
create this $700 billion
fund to buy some

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.830
of these toxic assets.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.500
and at first they said we'll
buy them at a discount and

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.070
we'll hold them to maturity
and then we

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.010
might even make a profit.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.250
I said, well that might sound
good, but how's that going to

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.040
solve this situation?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.260
Because if you were to go to
this bank and buy the CDOs,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.920
you'd be an idiot to pay $2
billion for them if the market

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.390
is only giving, instead
of $2 billion, only

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.720
$100 million for them.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.960
Why would you pay $2 billion?

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.270
In fact, these $2 billion are
actually based on assumptions

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.350
from 2006 when housing prices
can't go down and everyone was

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.590
paying off their mortgages.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.880
And everything was rosy.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.120
Those are maybe the assumptions
that drove this $2

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.200
billion price.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.710
So if you paid $2 billion for
this asset, sure, you would

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:12.990
save Bank C.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.030
But you would essentially be
buying something that's worth

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:15.660
a lot less.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.970
And even if you held it to
maturity, you're not going to

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.600
ever see a present value
of $2 billion.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.280
So when I first read the bailout
proposal, I said

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.310
they're going to pay some
discount on that, but that's

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.550
not going to help
the situation.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.510
Because let's say these
are only worth

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.730
$0.10 on the dollar.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.620
If they paid 10%
of $2 billion.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.530
If the the Fed came in and paid
$200 million for this.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.840
And it's not even clear that
it's worth $200 million, maybe

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.620
the market is only willing
to pay $100 million.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.490
But let's say the Fed comes in
and pays $200 million for it.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.700
They would have to mark this
down to $200 million.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.200
So that's $1.8 billion
writeoff.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.910
Something that was worth
$2 billion is

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.780
now worth $200 million.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.280
So if you write out $1.8
billion, then you're going to

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.610
have minus $800 million
of equity.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.590
Or $0.8 billion of equity.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.970
And then you would still
go bankrupt.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.860
In fact, it would just
force the issue.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.520
If the Fed were to go in and
buy at what they're calling

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.250
now fire sale prices,
but it's actually

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.470
probably an accurate price.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.470
Even if they were to buy
slightly above that, but still

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.680
at a discount, it would
force this bank to

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.970
write down this asset.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.890
It might have to then realize
negative equity.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.930
And it would still create this
whole chain of events.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.050
And so this is what the
Fed actually said.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.670
They actually said no we
don't want to buy it

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:29.920
at fire sale prices.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.700
I think Bernanke's exact words
were that, we're not going to

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.900
buy at fire sale prices, we're
going to buy at hold to

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.200
maturity prices.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.980
So to me, what the Fed is
saying, we're going to pay

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.680
enough money for these assets so
that these banks still have

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.740
positive equity.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.555
And so the these banks can still
pay off any liabilities

00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:50.010
that come due.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.000
Well you might say, well hey
Sal, that's not a bad idea.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.370
And I say, that's
a horrible idea.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:58.470
Because if these are really
worth $100 million, and you're

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.440
paying $2 billion for it, you're
essentially writing a

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.420
government check,
$1.9 billion.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.740
Let's say this is really
worth minus $0.8.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.610
Let's say that they're
really worth zero,

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:16.490
just to simplify things.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.240
Let's say these are actually
worth zero and the government

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.150
pays $2 billion for it.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.150
The government is essentially
writing a $2 billion check to

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.250
the equity holders
of this company.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.540
The real equity is worth
minus $1 billion.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.880
But the government is going to
essentially write them a $2

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.150
billion check so they can get
their billion dollars back.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.330
And it's also going to benefit
the bond holders.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.160
Because if this is worth zero,
not only will these guys get

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.980
wiped out, but then these guys
are only going to be able to

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.190
capture back some of
these $3 billion.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:49.000
So these liabilities are going
to be written down.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.800
These guys that are owed $4
billion are only going to be

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.230
able get $3 billion back.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.560
So if the government were to pay
$2 billion for this, it's

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.700
essentially writing a $1
billion check to the

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.110
shareholders and a $1 billion
check to the bond holders or

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.880
the people who lent this
company money.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.080
And essentially, those are
the worst people to be

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.870
writing a check to.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.350
Because these are the people
who essentially lent money

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:09.630
that shouldn't have been lent.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.020
These are people
who took risk.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.650
They took all the reward over
the last five years and now

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.960
when the risk hits, the
government is essentially

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.680
having welfare for the
private sector.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.000
So that in my mind is
the worst idea.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.500
The government is arguing, I
know it's bad, and these are

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.310
the people we don't want to
reward, but by doing this, we

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.390
save the real economy.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.690
Because by doing this,
we prevent this

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:32.990
cascade from happening.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.590
And hopefully, these banks will
still lend to the farmer

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:43.200
and still lend to the the guy
who wants to build a factory.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.140
In the next video I want to show
you one, why that might

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.000
not be the case.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.250
That even if they were to do
this, as much as I disagree

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.010
with it, if it worked
maybe it's worth it.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.230
But one, I'll argue that
it probably won't work.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.950
And two, there are better
ways to do this.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.470
More equitable, more fair
ways to do this.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.780
And we'll show you that
in the next video.
