00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.580
We are asked to find the
cube root of negative 512.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.460
Or another way to think about
it is if I have some number,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.740
and it is equal to the
cube root of negative 512,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.040
this just means that
if I take that number

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.900
and I raise it to the third
power, then I get negative 512.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.960
And if it doesn't jump out
at you immediately what

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.120
this is the cube
of, or what we have

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.320
to raise to the third
power to get negative 512,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.530
the best thing to do is to just
do a prime factorization of it.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.460
And before we do a prime
factorization of it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.840
to see which of these factors
show up at least three times,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.450
let's at least think about the
negative part a little bit.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.350
So negative 512, that's
the same thing-- so

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.850
let me rewrite the
expression-- this

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.170
is the same thing as the cube
root of negative 1 times 512,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.540
which is the same thing as
the cube root of negative 1

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.771
times the cube root of 512.

00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:06.770
And this one's pretty
straightforward to answer.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.770
What number, when I raise
it to the third power,

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.020
do I get negative 1?

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.440
Well, I get negative 1.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.560
This right here is negative 1.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.650
Negative 1 to the third power
is equal to negative 1 times

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.470
negative 1 times negative 1,
which is equal to negative 1.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.800
So the cube root of
negative 1 is negative 1.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.890
So it becomes negative 1
times this business right

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.172
here, times the
cube root of 512.

00:01:32.172 --> 00:01:33.630
And let's think
what this might be.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.500
So let's do the
prime factorization.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.019
So 512 is 2 times 256.

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:46.220
256 is 2 times 128.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.320
128 is 2 times 64.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.240
We already see a 2 three times.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.890
64 is 2 times 32.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.740
32 is 2 times 16.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.310
We're getting a
lot of twos here.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.930
16 is 2 times 8.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.539
8 is 2 times 4.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.960
And 4 is 2 times 2.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.010
So we got a lot of twos.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.966
So essentially, if
you multiply 2 one,

00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:19.290
two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine times,

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.184
you're going to get 512, or
2 to the ninth power is 512.

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:24.600
And that by itself
should give you

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.025
a clue of what the cube root is.

00:02:26.025 --> 00:02:27.400
But another way
to think about it

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.600
is, can we find-- there's
definitely three twos here.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.290
But can we find
three groups of twos,

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.480
or we could also find--
let me look at it this way.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.160
We can find three groups
of two twos over here.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.780
So that's 2 times 2 is 4.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.620
2 times 2 is 4.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.490
So definitely 4 multiplied
by itself three times

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.986
is divisible into this.

00:02:48.986 --> 00:02:50.360
But even better,
it looks like we

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.530
can get three groups
of three twos.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.365
So one group, two
groups, and three groups.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.600
So each of these groups, 2
times 2 times 2, that's 8.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.360
That is 8.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.790
This is 2 times 2 times 2.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.690
That's 8.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.400
And this is also
2 times 2 times 2.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.410
So that's 8.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.710
So we could write 512 as being
equal to 8 times 8 times 8.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.600
And so we can rewrite
this expression right

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.940
over here as the cube
root of 8 times 8 times 8.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.400
So this is equal to
negative 1, or I could just

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.090
put a negative sign
here, negative 1 times

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.652
the cube root of
8 times 8 times 8.

00:03:36.652 --> 00:03:37.860
So we're asking our question.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.650
What number can we multiply
by itself three times,

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.950
or to the third
power, to get 512,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.270
which is the same thing
as 8 times 8 times 8?

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.770
Well, clearly this is 8.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.000
So the answer, this
part right over here,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.680
is just going to simplify to 8.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.800
And so our answer to this,
the cube root of negative 512,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.580
is negative 8.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.727
And we are done.

00:03:59.727 --> 00:04:00.810
And you could verify this.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.012
Multiply negative 8
times itself three times.

00:04:04.012 --> 00:04:04.970
Well, let's just do it.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.190
Negative 8 times negative
8 times negative 8.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.310
Negative 8 times negative
8 is positive 64.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.690
You multiply that times negative
8, you get negative 512.
