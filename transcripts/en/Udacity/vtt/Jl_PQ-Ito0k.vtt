So now that we know a bit more about Model, View, and

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.260
Controller, I want you to pick your favorite app from the app store.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.510
This can be any app.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.710
Google Maps, Pinterest, or even the Udacity app.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.870
For that app, I want you to try and

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.150
identify what goes under Model, View, and Controller.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.400
I encourage you to draw pictures using a pen and

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.630
paper and then upload those images on the discussion forum.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.930
So here is your question one more time.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.750
