The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,020
Have you seen at a Chopin weird Al
Yankovic trapped at a drive through?

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,570
No, it's really good. No,

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,600
it's the same length as
our Kelly's trapped in the
closet and it's the same and

5
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:19,620
it's all about being trapped
at a Mcdonald's drive
through because the person in

6
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:22,520
front of miss taken too
long and it's like I can,

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,600
the fact that he did the whole side
is respect, respect, commitment.

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:33,150
I made it to, it's all cartoons
animated. Oh my God. That's hilarious.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,770
Which one is, this is weird.

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,980
Al has been around for a
long time, man. Yeah. I mean,

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,420
I remember when Michael Jackson's beat
it came out and he had eat it. Eat it.

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,530
Yeah. I mean that was and said, I'm
mad. It was, I'm fat. Yeah. Yeah.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,380
What year was that?
That's going to be in the A's.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,280
It's gotta be late eighties early now.
Yeah, it is. How late it is. Real. Real.

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,040
How old is here? Weird. Al's
gotta be 85 years old take,

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,850
so 59 what? Yeah, 59 was he 12 back then?

17
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,510
His first song aired in 1976 yeah.

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,710
He was a big on Dr Demento
six. Yeah. That's insane. Huh.

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,450
So he was really young. Dr Demento,
Dr Demento, God, I run my head.

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,600
I remember listening to I
was a kid, but that's, uh,

21
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,640
they played all these weird
goofball, nerdy songs. Yeah.
And he was the king of it.

22
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,170
He has a huge following now.
He's like, he'll, he'll sell
out places. Weird al. Yeah.

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,460
That makes sense. Yeah.
We just got some big

24
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,890
giant body of work. Yeah. I like
his hair too. He's got the hair.

25
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:42,510
He's a super nice guy too. Yeah.
And smart. I've heard. Yeah. Yeah.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,260
But everyone's smart. What else can
we say about these things? Yeah.

27
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,100
He's a good dancer too. Accepts
his gender. You don't also like,

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,090
he's not trifling. That's one that's
definitely not trifling. Yeah.

29
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,620
That's a word that's like,
there's certain words like that one.

30
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,750
You just seem so ridiculous.
If you tried to use it.
