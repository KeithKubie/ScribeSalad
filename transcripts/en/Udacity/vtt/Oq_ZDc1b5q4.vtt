00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.335
So, let's look at the solution to our

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:06.954
MOVZ/MOVN QUIZ. We have this code. And we want

00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:09.234
to do if conversion of it, so that we

00:00:09.234 --> 00:00:13.010
get a branch-free code that does the same work.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.530
If conversion amounts to doing the work of

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.590
both paths, both the not-taken and the taken paths.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.270
And then selecting between the two and correcting the

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.360
results so that only one of them is active.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.520
So, what we have done is, these two

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.328
instructions are already doing the work of the

00:00:31.328 --> 00:00:35.239
not-taken path. Is just that instead of in

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.956
R2, which would permanently modify R2, we're putting the

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:45.830
result in R4 and here the taken path R3 and 1 are added, then we put the result

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.640
in R5 instead of R3. So what now needs to happen is, if this was

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.622
the correct path to take, then R2 should get the result

00:00:56.622 --> 00:01:01.610
of R4. Otherwise, R3 should get the result from R5.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.500
This is a branch on equal 0, R1. So

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.080
if R1 is not equal 0, meaning

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.690
MOVN on R1 used as a condition. We're going to be moving R4 into R2.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.098
If the branch is branching, then R1 is zero, and in that case

00:01:31.098 --> 00:01:37.130
we want to be moving R5 into R3. And this is our if converted

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.280
code that has four instructions worth of work, but no branches in them.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.416
In contrast, the original code has three instructions

00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:50.200
worth of work, in this path, and two instructions

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.150
worth of work in this path. But, it

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.320
has this branch that might be difficult to predict.
