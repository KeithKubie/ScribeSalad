JODY KENT LAVY: Hi.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:04.446
I'm Jody Kent Lavy.

00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:06.320
I'm the director of the
Campaign for the Fair

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.220
Sentencing of Youth.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.279
We are a nonprofit
based in Washington, DC.

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:12.070
And we are working to
end the United States

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.550
practice of sentencing our
children to life in prison

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.610
without the
possibility of parole.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.130
Many people ask us
what does it mean

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.970
to sentence a kid
to life in prison

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.620
without the
possibility of parole?

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.286
Doesn't life in prison
mean that they'll

00:00:23.286 --> 00:00:25.345
get out after 15, 20, 25 years?

00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:27.370
And in fact, life
without parole means

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.700
that these are children who've
been told that they'll never,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.520
ever see a second chance.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.870
They'll never have an
opportunity for review.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.110
And for context, Charles
Manson from the great state

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.230
of California has come
up for review 12 times.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.380
But these kids never will.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.740
In the United States, there
are more than 2,500 people

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.680
who've been sentenced
to life without parole.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.460
And they are concentrated
in five states.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.210
The vast majority of
them are concentrated

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.020
in just five states,
California being one of them.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.580
Everyone always guesses
Texas, but that's actually

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.120
not one of the top five states.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.030
Texas actually banned life
without parole for children.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.260
Michigan, Pennsylvania--
Pennsylvania

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.060
leads the nation in
this practice-- Florida,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.580
and-- did I get them all--
California, Pennsylvania,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.734
Louisiana, Michigan,
and Florida.

00:01:16.734 --> 00:01:17.410
Is that five?

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.910
Yeah.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.220
OK.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.392
So in the last few years since
our organization was launched,

00:01:24.392 --> 00:01:26.850
there's been a tremendous amount
of progress on this issue.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.170
In fact, in California,
just since 2012, there

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.586
have been a number
of reforms that

00:01:31.586 --> 00:01:34.860
has made it possible for these
young people who are serving

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.280
time in prisons across the
state to come up for review

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.620
and prove that they're
eligible or should be

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.630
eligible for a second chance.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.450
The US Supreme Court
has now stepped

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.120
in several times to the limit
the practice of sentencing kids

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.490
to life without parole.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.033
And in doing so,
they've relied a lot

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:53.210
on adolescent development
research, which

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.960
shows that kids
are fundamentally

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.350
different than adults
and that as a result

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.560
of those unique characteristics
of children, things that all

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.970
of us know having been teens--
that they tend to be more

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.428
reckless the adults, that they
are more susceptible to peer

00:02:05.428 --> 00:02:08.639
pressure, that they don't
think through the consequences

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.550
of their actions the same way
adults do, and they're also

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.460
uniquely capable of change
and rehabilitation--

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.290
so relying on that science
and relying on that research,

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.497
the Supreme Court has
stepped in to limit

00:02:20.497 --> 00:02:22.830
the practice of sentencing
youth to life without parole.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.940
So what the campaign does is
we organize a national movement

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.810
to take these Supreme
Court decisions

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.705
and to educate policymakers
around the country

00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:36.587
to help them recognize these
differences between kids

00:02:36.587 --> 00:02:38.170
and adults and to
make sure that we're

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.920
holding our young people
accountable in age-appropriate

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.420
ways and that we're
never sentencing

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.080
them to die in prison.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.940
And a really critical
component of our work

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.340
has been just in
the last few years

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.640
to demonstrate through a lot
of different sort of techniques

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.950
involving public education,
legislative advocacy,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.624
and litigation just who
these young people are

00:02:59.624 --> 00:03:01.290
and what they're
capable of when they're

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.060
given the right opportunities.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.487
And so one of the
leaders in this work--

00:03:05.487 --> 00:03:07.070
probably the leader
in this work-- who

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.230
has been the face of
shifting this narrative

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.240
in a lot of venues
around the country

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.490
is my colleague,
Xavier McElrath-Bey,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.570
who you're going to
hear from in a minute.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.900
I just want to say that
just in the last five years,

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.250
we have nearly doubled the
number of states that ban

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.670
juvenile life without parole.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.772
That said, the
majority of states

00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:31.730
still allow this sentence
for our young people.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.850
We're the only
country in the world

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.974
that does this to our kids.

00:03:33.974 --> 00:03:35.930
So we have a long way to go.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.040
We have momentum with us.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.570
There are Republicans
and Democrats alike

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.820
who are working with
us who are really

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.390
championing these reforms.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.770
And I think really the
underlying motivation often

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.880
comes from the stories
of the people who

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.526
are directly impacted who
are key partners in our work.

00:03:52.526 --> 00:03:56.275
And one of them is here with
us today to share his story.

00:03:56.275 --> 00:03:59.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.540
XAVIER MCELRATH-BEY: I'm
very happy to be here.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.790
I'm a Chicago native.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.970
I'm really excited to
be in San Francisco

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.850
to see the wonderful work
and creativity of Google.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.880
And I have to say that my life
has been shaped by Google.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.230
And people may not have an
opportunity to talk about that.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.990
But I actually base
a lot of my work

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.110
by using a lot of the tools
that provided by Google.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.160
And for that, I want
to thank all of you.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.050
And to give one funny
example, when we have quoting,

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.740
we have annual reports.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.220
And one thing that we
had to do most recently

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.750
was provide a recap in the
past year of some of our work.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.050
And one of the tasks
for me and being

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.170
able to execute
that expectation was

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.290
to identify all the media
that I can and the Campaign

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.380
for the Fair Sentencing
of Youth has generated

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.510
and through our particular
national network.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.340
And I may have came across as
quite organized and efficient.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.510
But the fact of the
matter is I went to Google

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.630
and I put in the search tools.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.910
I put in the past year
and I clicked All.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.885
And voila, I got my results.

00:05:12.885 --> 00:05:14.940
And it was quite easy.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.440
So I had to tell them myself.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.960
Sorry, Jody.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.340
But I'm really happy to be
here, and most importantly,

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.450
because I was able to visit
with some individuals yesterday

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.410
at San Quentin Prison.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.540
Walking in for me
personally is always

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.260
a challenge when I go
into a secure facility

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.600
because to be quite honest with
you, up until 13 years ago,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.020
I grew up in secure facilities
throughout the state

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.110
of Illinois.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.240
I was convicted at
a very early age--

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.520
at the age of 13 years old--
for first degree murder.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.220
I was guilty.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.040
I was responsible.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.990
And I plead guilty.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.020
But at that age, what was
mostly unspoken in my life

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.650
was the fact that not
only was I someone

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.240
who had a very unfortunate
track record of repeated arrests

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.480
and convictions, but I
was also a child that

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.417
had endured some very
horrific things early on which

00:06:06.417 --> 00:06:09.000
sort of manifested itself in a
very devastating way-- in a way

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.800
which I had landed
in the justice system

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.060
with a 25-year sentence of
the age of 13 years old.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.610
I was fortunate to have a
public defender, [INAUDIBLE] who

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.020
recognized my youthfulness first
and foremost-- something that

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.370
at that time in the late 1980s,
unfortunately, was not being

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.630
recognized for many children.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.500
When I stood in that
sally port waiting

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.950
to be transferred over
to the Cook County Court,

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:38.790
I wasn't alone.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.622
There were many other kids that
were shackled alongside me.

00:06:41.622 --> 00:06:44.080
And I remember being transferred
over into the adult court.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.640
And I remember when we
walked into the tunnel,

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.160
we went into the tunnel
of the Cook County Court.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.900
We went up a very grim
and dark elevator.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.430
When we got to the
courthouse level,

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.590
we had to walk
past some bullpens.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.720
And when we went
past the bullpens,

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.120
they were populated with
a bunch of individuals

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.220
who were awaiting trial
who had just been arrested

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.480
or being processed
into their division.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.140
And I remember hearing a
lot of the guys yelling out

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.990
of the cracks in the bars
saying, man, that's messed up.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.820
And they're saying all these
things-- a little profanity,

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.630
but expressing something that it
took me a while to catch on to.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.590
But what they were expressing
was their anger and how upset

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.870
they were that us,
that little children,

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.240
were being taken into
the same courtrooms,

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.340
being faced with the
same consequences,

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.450
that they were being faced with.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.470
And I think that looking
at that in retrospect,

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:44.380
it made me question our own
way of dealing with kids today.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.710
And if these individuals
who are deemed

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.460
as the worst of the
worst in our society--

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.270
if they can have the humanity
and compassion to recognize

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.110
that these were
just children, why

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.030
can't others individuals
who are involved in creating

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.471
these systems and designed the
treatment programs very early

00:08:01.471 --> 00:08:03.970
on-- why can't they recognize
the needs of our children, who

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.180
for most part have
been failed by so many?

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.040
And so not to make an
excuse for my past mistakes,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.710
but I would simply say
that I was not alone.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:12.820
There were many of us.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.950
We came from different
communities and cities

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:16.930
across the state.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.190
But for the most part, we
had some things in common.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:23.570
And those things were
trauma, first and foremost.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.830
Second of all, many of us
were living in households

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.530
that were very hostile, had
struggled mental illness,

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:30.220
substance abuse.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.400
We lived in poor
[INAUDIBLE] communities.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.650
We lived in environments
that were very toxic,

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.015
not nurturing,
and unfortunately,

00:08:37.015 --> 00:08:42.220
were producing some very
poor decisions on our behalf.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.052
As early as six years old, I
was placed in a foster care.

00:08:45.052 --> 00:08:46.760
And in fact, that was
the very first time

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.050
I was placed in a police
car for that transport.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.470
And when I got out of
the foster care system

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.120
two and a half years
later, I went back

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.744
to the same poor
[INAUDIBLE] community,

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:58.007
went back to the same
poverty, the same struggle--

00:08:58.007 --> 00:08:59.590
the mental illness
and substance abuse

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.260
that took place
to my home-- and I

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.680
wasn't able to rise above that.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.680
And I wasn't able to
escape the negative impacts

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.400
of those traumas very early on.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.110
And so I gravitated
towards a gang life.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.540
And what I think that
is often, I guess,

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.474
unspoken, as well, is that
these individuals, these kids--

00:09:16.474 --> 00:09:18.140
although they made
these poor decisions,

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.000
in their heart of hearts,
they're really not bad kids.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.110
And that's why our model
as a national network,

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.150
the Incarcerated Children's
Action Network, is no child

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.200
is born bad.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.450
It's not a coincidence that
the majority of these kids

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.582
are coming from these
type of upbringings.

00:09:31.582 --> 00:09:33.040
And so the age of
13 years old when

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.112
I was faced with 20
to 60 years in prison,

00:09:35.112 --> 00:09:36.820
I had a strong advocate,
as I mentioned--

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.090
my public defender-- who
fought very hard for me.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.520
And she convinced the judge
to give me a 25-year sentence.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.490
And I know that
may sound extreme.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.457
But under the old law,
that meant day-for-day,

00:09:46.457 --> 00:09:48.040
meaning for every
good day you served,

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.950
I would have a day
taken off my time.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.750
I would have an
opportunity in my mid 20s

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.367
to be able to come out, recreate
myself, and start a new life.

00:09:54.367 --> 00:09:56.700
And unfortunately, individuals
that I met with yesterday

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.030
in San Quentin don't
have that option.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.790
The individuals in San Quentin,
although they were in their 30s

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:07.210
and 40s, and one gentleman had
been in prison for 40 years

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.680
since he was a
teenager-- because

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.300
of the seriousness
of his offense,

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.390
he has been told repeatedly by
a parole board he would never

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.320
be free despite his
positive change,

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.930
despite the fact that he's
involved himself in programs,

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.750
has helped to build a
sweat lodge on campus,

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.370
one of the first
ones in the state;

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.890
has helped to mentor young
kids coming into prisons,

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.485
at-risk youth who have been
brought into the prison walls

00:10:31.485 --> 00:10:33.610
to learn from those who
have made horrible mistakes

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.670
but who want to help
children make better ones

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.810
in their lives.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.960
And despite all this
positive change,

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.220
despite what's undeniable within
himself, and unfortunately,

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.110
within many of
those around him, he

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:48.130
would never be free unless we
bring about the type of reforms

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.302
that we're fighting for.

00:10:49.302 --> 00:10:51.760
And that's why I'm very happy
to be a part of the campaign.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.540
I'm very happy to be able to
lend my voice as someone who's

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.320
not exceptional, who's not
the exception to the rule,

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.410
but as someone
whose life is really

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.300
indicative of every child's
capacity for positive change--

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.200
that none of us are beyond
redemption, beyond repair--

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.230
and that at the very
young age of 18 years old,

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.530
after having been in
prison for five years,

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:17.250
that I was able to reach a
point of maturity and awareness

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.240
that made me reflect
upon my life.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.440
It made me desire something
bigger and better.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.720
It made me recognize that many
of the things that I had done

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.020
up until that point were not
really reflective of who I

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.210
really was inside,
but that, in fact, I

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.080
was a product of
my environment--

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.180
that, in fact, I was working
out of those untreated

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.900
traumas, those emotion
deprivations that made me

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.550
susceptible to
peer pressure, made

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.380
me more susceptible to do things
that are outside my nature.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.010
But at the age of a growing
sense of maturity and remorse,

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.040
I decided to take
control of my life.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.410
I decided to get myself
involved in the school,

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.620
to leave the gang that
I was associated with,

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.070
to get my life on track.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.270
And I had sort of envisioned
a parallel universe.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.170
I had envisioned my life--
as it was, obviously,

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.710
within the prison walls--
but how it would also look

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.650
had I never been incarcerated.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.240
And I told myself
at 17, 18 years old,

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.420
I would have finished
high school at that point.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.920
And because of that
mindset, I said,

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.045
well, I need to get my GED.

00:12:13.045 --> 00:12:14.840
And I knocked it out right away.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.989
And I said what
would I be at 21?

00:12:16.989 --> 00:12:18.780
And I said I'll have
my associate's degree.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.410
So I pursued my
associate's degree.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.510
Where would I be at 23, 24?

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.906
I would probably have
my bachelor's by then.

00:12:25.906 --> 00:12:27.280
And if I could
have, I would have

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.779
worked for my master's, but I
had to wait until years later.

00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:32.420
But I was able to enroll
myself into a bachelor's degree

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.960
program and get a bachelor's
degree in social science

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.740
with a 4.0 GPA, was inducted
into the Franklin Honor

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.620
Society for Outstanding
Scholarship,

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.390
and was really
excelling academically,

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.424
and was really
taking on this belief

00:12:43.424 --> 00:12:45.840
that I could do something
better in my life upon release--

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.810
a release date that
was within years away

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.290
and which enabled me to have
a greater hope for a better

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.180
future.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.319
Unfortunately, many people
don't have the light

00:12:55.319 --> 00:12:56.360
at the end of the tunnel.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.568
Many individuals like some
of the kids that I grew up

00:12:58.568 --> 00:13:00.602
with in the system
are still there today.

00:13:00.602 --> 00:13:03.060
And because of that, it is not
that I carry some survivor's

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.720
guilt, but I certainly
carry a responsibility--

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.800
a sense of responsibility
that tells me

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.140
that I should not
forget who they are

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.940
and that I should amplify their
messages and their stories;

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.940
that I should make known to
the world that not just myself,

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.540
but many others
within the system

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.960
have such great potentials,
for many unfortunately

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.750
their potential is
being wasted away.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.370
That such dreams and
hopes and even better

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.880
hopes and for our
communities are simply

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.770
languishing away there
behind prison walls

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:35.090
and costing millions of
tax dollars, unnecessarily.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:36.677
And so when we
talk about reform,

00:13:36.677 --> 00:13:38.635
we're talking about not
just a legal obligation

00:13:38.635 --> 00:13:42.690
and a moral obligation, but also
the most commonsense obligation

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.742
that we have to ourselves
and to our community,

00:13:44.742 --> 00:13:46.200
and not only that,
but to recognize

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.440
the needs of those
who have been harmed--

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.550
not just those who
have entered the system

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.200
and have experienced
traumas and made

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.070
poor decisions,
but also those who

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.170
have been impacted by violence.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.592
A great part of our work
as a national network

00:14:00.592 --> 00:14:02.300
is to address the
needs of the community.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.340
Many of us work in a capacity
as substance abuse counselors.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.500
Many of us work in a capacity
as youth development program

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.460
coordinators.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.730
Many of us work in a
capacity of employing

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.320
formerly incarcerated folks.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.500
And so this is the work
that we do in our own lives.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.280
And I often say the Incarcerated
Children's Advocacy Network,

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.696
which is a national network
reforming incarcerated youth--

00:14:21.696 --> 00:14:24.310
when they came to us,
they were already leaders.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.930
But had you met them
in a public space

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.389
or at a conference
or an event, you

00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:30.263
would have never known
that as children, they

00:14:30.263 --> 00:14:32.300
were all convicted of
homicide-related offenses.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.200
You would have never
known that many of them

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.800
were once sentenced to life
without the possibility

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.299
of parole.

00:14:36.299 --> 00:14:41.030
But because the pardons
and exonerations

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.410
and other legal interventions,
that they're now

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:47.670
able to be out to live a normal
life and to show the world

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:51.400
that they, too, were able to
recreate and start a new life.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.060
And so that is our
hope for many others

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.260
who are serving that time.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.250
We also hope that
individuals who are out

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.820
and who are formerly
incarcerated

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.111
will continue to work together.

00:15:00.111 --> 00:15:00.980
So we often convene.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.410
We convene annually.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.570
We train together.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.570
We work with each other.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.310
We're supportive of one another.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.560
We also come together
for workshops

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.540
that help us hone our
skills as advocates

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:16.080
to be better advocates for those
who we often in so many ways

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.250
try to represent.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.990
And so that is really
a big purpose of ICAN.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.000
But another big purpose
of our national network

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.550
is really to keep
those who are currently

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.990
incarcerated informed,
and then not only that,

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.940
but also to help them understand
that they're not forgotten.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.210
I understand how it
feels to be incarcerated.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:38.900
I understand in so many
ways the sad reality,

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.050
the existential nightmare of
being incarcerated and feeling

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.500
forgotten by society.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.270
And it's so easy
for many people not

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:52.060
to think of those who are
in prison since childhood.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.560
And in fact, many family
and friends often move on.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.330
But because of their big hearts
and the willingness of those

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.105
who are on the front lines
of reform and the desire

00:16:00.105 --> 00:16:04.560
and passion they have to help
see their release and life be

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.290
recreated, they've been
able to have something

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:10.190
to hold onto-- a hope to believe
in, something to look forward

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:13.320
to, an incentive
towards positive change.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.110
And a sense of that
in so many ways

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.770
has helped even
within the system

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.629
in terms of the prison stability
and preventing violence.

00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:21.670
And oftentimes, these are
the conflict mediators.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.010
Oftentimes, they are running
sort of justice programs

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:25.280
within the facilities.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.170
They're the trustees.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.660
They're the ones who are
entrusted with yesterday,

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:33.020
the place we went was
a building that was

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.056
unattended for the most part.

00:16:35.056 --> 00:16:36.430
But yet these are
all individuals

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.138
who are deemed as the
worst of the worst.

00:16:38.138 --> 00:16:40.770
But yet there was not a single
guard within that facility.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.230
And they're running their
own programs, programs

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.280
that have affected upon their
own sense of masculinity,

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.910
their own sense of how
to overcome their trauma,

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.550
who they are today,
what does empathy mean.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.470
These are questions
that we hardly even

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.140
entertain in free society.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.240
But yet they're digging
deep within themselves

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.820
to discover who they really are,
to discover their own humanity,

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.650
to find ways-- and
innovative ways,

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.940
in fact-- to give back
to their communities,

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.569
to have cancer awareness
marches within the facility,

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.700
to have events in
which they were

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.760
able to create origami
hearts for kids who

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.589
are in hospitals, to have events
where they're able to create

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:22.910
food can drives and food
drives to give to the homeless.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.010
And all this is taking place
within the prison walls.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:28.319
And yet when they
had to organize

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.400
an event, a
fundraising event, they

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.870
came to find that the
inmates and the families

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:34.480
gave more than the community.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.980
And that just goes
to show the level

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.274
of desire they have to live
out that eternal apology,

00:17:39.274 --> 00:17:41.440
to give back to the
communities, to sort of live out

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.390
the sort of penances
that we all carry

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.720
and a desire to make
amends with society.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.400
And so I hope that all of
you at Google in some ways

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.880
recognize the value of their
human potential, the value

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.210
of what they had to offer.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.293
And with that, I want to
turn it back over to Jody

00:17:58.293 --> 00:18:01.150
and give her an opportunity to
share about some possible ways

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:02.066
in which you can help.

00:18:02.066 --> 00:18:03.926
Thank you.

00:18:03.926 --> 00:18:06.094
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:06.094 --> 00:18:07.510
JODY KENT LAVY:
Thank you, Xavier.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.870
I never like to
follow his remarks.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.440
But anyway, here I am.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.450
I also want to just thank
Jonathan for having us

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:19.560
here at Google and
mention, as Xavier said, we

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.770
rely on Google daily, hourly.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:29.740
At our office, we actually
have all of our shared

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.450
files in Google Drive.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.460
And that's what we go
to, we really rely on.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.220
And I know it's donated to us.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.280
And we're incredibly grateful.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:45.960
We also being based in DC, the
way that we communicate weekly

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.190
for our staff meeting with
our colleague in Chicago,

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.170
with Xavier, is via
Google Hangouts.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.390
So we're really
grateful to what you all

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.760
have been able to create
that makes our work possible

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.610
and makes it possible
for us to stay

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.660
in constant communication
with one another

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.960
to strengthen our efforts.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.940
So as I mentioned,
the campaign is

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.610
involved in a lot of
different strategies

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:11.190
to end life without
parole for kids.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:14.780
We do advocacy, litigation,
public education,

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.440
and coalition building.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.930
We host an annual
convening in DC every year,

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.500
which we would
welcome you all to.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.070
It's a great opportunity
to learn about not

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:27.500
only the issues and the
challenges people are facing

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.430
and where you learn best
practices from one another,

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.873
but to learn from the
people directly impacted

00:19:32.873 --> 00:19:37.100
and to be in a room with them
to better understand their life

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.770
experiences, like Xavier's
and other ICAN members,

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.060
as well as victim
family members.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.160
Often times, people
are surprised to know

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.950
that we work with people
who've lost loved ones to youth

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.240
violence.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.630
But the reality is
that not all of them

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:56.850
want to see the system
throw these kids away.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:00.290
Many of them find it healing
to see the people who

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:04.047
killed their loved ones out and
doing well in the community.

00:20:04.047 --> 00:20:05.880
These are some of the
most courageous people

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.880
I've ever met.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.380
And they inspire us
in our work every day.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.080
And we're actually
in the year ahead

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.886
aspiring to launch a national
network similar to ICAN

00:20:15.886 --> 00:20:17.830
of victim family
members to make sure

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:20.990
that their voices are heard
because too often, it's only

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.660
the victims that are seeking
punitive policies and sentences

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:26.740
that we hear from.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.770
And so in the year
ahead, we are looking

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.640
to better connect
with those folks

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.020
and create a national network.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.660
So we welcome the
brilliance of Googlers

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.990
in figuring out how to
stay better connected

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.640
and using technology to do that.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:49.910
We hope that more than anything
that you'll share information

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:53.450
about this practice, you'll
share Xavier's story.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:57.090
We have a video that features
a number of the ICAN members

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.620
who worked in Nevada
last year and helped

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.900
to pass a bill
unanimously to ban life

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.030
without parole for children.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.507
We think that the
more people recognize

00:21:07.507 --> 00:21:09.590
that this is something our
country and our country

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:13.510
alone does to our kids, and
people who have kids or know

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.697
teenagers or were
once teenagers,

00:21:16.697 --> 00:21:18.280
when you start to
think about the fact

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:25.690
that kids are-- especially kids
who grow up in environments

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:29.610
that are oppressive
and do not provide

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.860
the kind of opportunities
that many of us

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:36.570
have had-- that the
circumstances really shape

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:40.650
young people and that when
they're given opportunity,

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.150
they can change and
do great things.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.200
And so I think when
people recognize that

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.450
and they know that this is
something that we're doing,

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.420
people want to get
engaged and involved.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:54.235
And so we'd welcome your
participation joining us.

00:21:54.235 --> 00:21:57.940
If you go to our website, you
can sign up for our newsletters

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.910
and stay involved
and stay posted

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:03.020
on the various developments
around the country.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.520
And if you go to
our website, you'll

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.040
see that we would also welcome
volunteers to help us even

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.110
improve our website.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:15.700
We certainly look to the
pros for that sort of thing.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:21.270
I always tell people if your
kid gets locked up, call me.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.190
And I'll look to
you for whatever

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.640
it is that you guys do best.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.030
And I know at Google, you guys
come with incredible ideas

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.010
and technology.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:33.780
And that's something that
we would value in partnering

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.090
with you guys in the future.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:39.420
So the other thing that
we think that is really

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.940
remarkable about the young
people that we work with--

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.910
and many of them
not young anymore,

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.740
but who are in the
inside-- is that they

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.570
have an incredible ability
to not only, like Xavier

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:53.180
was saying, reflect on
sort of what their life

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:57.130
experiences have been and how
they've overcome the traumas

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.980
and helped to really
rehabilitate themselves,

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.960
many of them have
incredible skills.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.167
Many of them are
artists we know.

00:23:05.167 --> 00:23:06.875
We get some of the
most brilliant artwork

00:23:06.875 --> 00:23:08.610
sent to our office.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.520
And so one idea we
had was wouldn't it

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.030
be great to have a Google
Doodle from a juvenile lifer

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.209
to demonstrate that this is the
potential of these young people

00:23:19.209 --> 00:23:21.250
that we've told are worth
nothing more than dying

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:24.360
in prison and to
people recognize

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.700
that this is a
population that continues

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.900
to live despite being
told that and continues

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.150
to hope for a second chance?

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.950
So those are a couple of things.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:38.080
We welcome your
ideas, as I said.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.220
I am just excited to be
here and for the opportunity

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.325
and to tap into the world
of ideas that you all bring.

00:23:46.325 --> 00:23:48.480
So thank you again, Jonathan.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:53.780
And thanks to everyone for
taking time to hear our story

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.750
and to learn about our work.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.800
[APPLAUSE]
