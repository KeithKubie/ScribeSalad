00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.560
- I hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.393
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:05.393 --> 00:00:06.226
I'm in Mexico City.

00:00:06.226 --> 00:00:08.453
And Mexico Cit is one of
the, I mean without a doubt,

00:00:08.453 --> 00:00:12.370
it's one of the capitals of
food in the entire world.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.970
I have an incredibly special
day to share with you today.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.190
I'm about to meet up with Lalo

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.443
who is from La Ruta de la Garnacha.

00:00:18.443 --> 00:00:19.552
He makes videos.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.836
He's a passionate food lover,

00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:24.302
and he's an expert on Mexican street food.

00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:25.994
And right now, he's gonna take me

00:00:25.994 --> 00:00:30.994
and you on the ultimate best
tacos tour of Mexico City.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.420
So get ready to eat the
best tacos in Mexico City.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.497
Okay, say hello to Lalo.

00:00:36.497 --> 00:00:39.264
- Yeah!

00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:41.847
(upbeat music)

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.780
- [Mark] Where are we going to first?

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.410
- We are going to eat,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.520
this is a taco, taco, the best
taco guide in Mexico City.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.730
So we are going to eat tacos de canasta.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.810
- [Mark] Oh, tacos de canasta.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.643
- It's for the morning.

00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:00.476
- [Mark] In the basket, right?

00:01:00.476 --> 00:01:01.490
- [Lalo] Yeah, in the basket.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.650
- [Mark] Oh, that's something
I haven't tried yet.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.310
- [Lalo] It's amazing taco.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.143
It's cheap.

00:01:05.143 --> 00:01:05.976
- [Mark] Awesome.

00:01:05.976 --> 00:01:10.492
- [Lalo] It's easy to get,
and it's very delicious.

00:01:10.492 --> 00:01:13.075
(upbeat music)

00:01:25.993 --> 00:01:28.470
- Are tacos de canasta
normally eaten in the morning?

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.303
- [Lalo] In the morning.

00:01:29.303 --> 00:01:30.150
- Or all throughout the whole day?

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.630
- No, no, no, only in the morning.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.950
It's more like seven to three p.m.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.783
- Ah, okay.

00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:37.820
There must be a couple
thousand tacos which are just

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.670
stacked up into that basket,
and they are steamed in there.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.870
And what's amazing about
these tacos de canasta

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.780
is that they remain warm

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.380
throughout the entire time
that they're selling there

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.889
because all of them kinda
hold their heat together.

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:52.345
They're stuffed within that
basket, so packed so tightly.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.420
And then what's also awesome

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.863
is they've got a blanket
to keep them warm.

00:01:56.863 --> 00:02:00.254
Oh, this will keep you
warm in the morning too.

00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:01.639
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:02.854
(Lalo speaks in foreign language)

00:02:02.854 --> 00:02:06.937
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:09.690
(Lalo speaks in foreign language)

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.669
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.836
(Lalo speaks in foreign language)

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.150
- [Lalo] Gracias, muchas gracias.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.193
What's up, man?

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:34.754
(Lalo speaks in foreign language)

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.240
- We're moving over here
to the salsa station,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.626
and they have a couple
of different salsas.

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:45.252
This particular salsa right
here, it includes chicharron.

00:02:45.252 --> 00:02:46.085
Oh, man.

00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:48.583
How could they think of
anything better than that?

00:02:48.583 --> 00:02:51.083
(Lalo laughs)

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.230
So we're gonna start with the
chicharron taco de canasta,

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.250
and we added salsa de chicharron onto it.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.710
So it's chicharron on top of chicharron.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.580
It's fried pork skin on
top of fried pork skin.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.080
That is all you could ask for.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.077
Oh.

00:03:18.077 --> 00:03:18.910
Oh, wow.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.480
Oh, that's insane.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.740
- [Lalo] So flavorful.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.573
- [Mark] Yeah.

00:03:23.573 --> 00:03:24.406
It's so soft.

00:03:24.406 --> 00:03:27.900
It's just absorbed all of
the flavor from the sauce.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.845
- Yeah, it's so flavorful.

00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:34.678
That chicarron,

00:03:34.678 --> 00:03:35.511
it's amazing.
- So good.

00:03:35.511 --> 00:03:36.344
Mm-hmm.

00:03:36.344 --> 00:03:39.040
- It's really big one, really big taco.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.530
You know, for me, I think that the taco,

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.400
it's the most delicious
thing in the world.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.233
Why?

00:03:47.233 --> 00:03:50.800
Because tortilla for the
Mexican, it's our plate.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.960
So we eat our plate.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.990
Taco, it's everything.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.750
You put it on everything.

00:03:58.817 --> 00:04:00.522
Sweet, so sweet.

00:04:00.522 --> 00:04:01.620
- Very sweet.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.510
Oh, really good.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.355
The next taco is the mole verde.

00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:09.150
You can see the green mole in there.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.640
You can see there's some meat,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.930
and then you can see potatoes in here too.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.430
So it's actually quite hearty.

00:04:17.962 --> 00:04:19.450
Mmm, oh.

00:04:20.363 --> 00:04:21.280
Oh, that's good too.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.280
- [Lalo] Good chicken.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.570
- So good.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.530
You can taste the, maybe
the green chilies in there.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.950
Then you can taste the potato
which is kind of creamy,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.880
and then also the shreds of
chicken throughout there.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.230
I think it would be even
better with some salsa.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.088
Awesome.

00:04:40.088 --> 00:04:43.400
Man, that salsa with the chicharron in it,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.420
that's a game changer.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.660
- Yeah, we need to close the video.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.580
That's it.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.413
- [Mark] That's it, man.

00:04:49.413 --> 00:04:50.440
- [Lalo] We end it.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.349
We end it and say the salsa is the best.

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:53.944
- The tacos are amazing.

00:04:53.944 --> 00:04:57.965
But with that salsa,
chicharron, it's unbelievable.

00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:00.548
(upbeat music)

00:05:23.755 --> 00:05:26.716
- The salsa chicharron, it's heaven.

00:05:26.716 --> 00:05:27.549
- It's superb.

00:05:27.549 --> 00:05:30.414
Now that I've tried all three of them,

00:05:30.414 --> 00:05:32.214
which one is your favorite?

00:05:32.214 --> 00:05:33.047
- Chicharron.

00:05:33.047 --> 00:05:33.964
- Yeah, for sure.

00:05:33.964 --> 00:05:35.840
- Way chicharron.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.136
- Without a doubt, that chicharron taco

00:05:38.136 --> 00:05:41.303
with the chicharron salsa is the best.

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.195
Wow.

00:05:47.195 --> 00:05:49.978
- The name is Tacos Joven,
Taco de canasta Joven.

00:05:49.978 --> 00:05:50.811
- [Man] Muchas gracias.

00:05:50.811 --> 00:05:52.262
- Muchas gracias.

00:05:52.262 --> 00:05:53.095
Hasta la huego.

00:05:53.095 --> 00:05:53.928
Muchas gracias.

00:05:53.928 --> 00:05:55.896
I couldn't think of a
better way in the world

00:05:55.896 --> 00:05:57.048
to start the day.

00:05:57.048 --> 00:05:57.881
- Yeah. (laughs)

00:05:57.881 --> 00:06:01.539
- That taco de chicharron,
that will change your life.

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:02.372
(Lalo laughs)

00:06:02.372 --> 00:06:06.046
With that salsa de chicharron, oh, man.

00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:08.629
(upbeat music)

00:06:22.962 --> 00:06:23.795
- Okay, this is the place.

00:06:23.795 --> 00:06:28.200
This was a really small place.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.970
But now, it's almost a corner.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:32.890
See that.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.240
- We're gonna eat carnitas.

00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:44.321
This is another meat palace.

00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:47.100
This is a huge production here.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.740
They have all sorts of
meats grilling over here,

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.340
but Lalo is taking me over here.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.087
The main reason you have to
come here is for the carnitas.

00:06:55.087 --> 00:06:56.880
- This is the place.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.770
- It's just like falling apart
in that glass cabinet there,

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.400
and they're just pulling it off.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.130
They're chopping it up.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.140
Oh, man.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.061
Oh, man.

00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:07.110
- You can order whatever you
want, the part of the pork.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.943
- [Mark] Okay.

00:07:07.943 --> 00:07:08.874
- If you want--

00:07:08.874 --> 00:07:10.782
(Mark mumbles)

00:07:10.782 --> 00:07:11.900
All of the pork are in carnitas,

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:15.235
so you can order whatever you want.

00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:18.985
(speaks in foreign language)

00:07:26.286 --> 00:07:27.938
(cook speaks in foreign language)

00:07:27.938 --> 00:07:32.105
(Lalo speaks in foreign language)

00:07:35.595 --> 00:07:37.377
Look at that.

00:07:37.377 --> 00:07:38.630
- Oh, they're huge.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.830
As they pull the meat out
of that tub of carnitas,

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.779
the whole thing shakes
because it's so soft.

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:44.612
- Yeah.

00:07:44.612 --> 00:07:45.630
- It wiggles.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.840
And then you see them
chopping up the meat,

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.350
so they chop up the meat really fine.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.948
Then they stop and they
put it in tortillas.

00:07:49.948 --> 00:07:51.019
They're double tortillas.

00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:52.110
- Double tortillas.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.190
- And then they add on
the, wow, they add on

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.440
the cilantro and onions.
- Cilantro and onion.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.660
And Mark, this is your gift from Mexico.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.689
- There's a little indented
hole on this plate.

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:04.858
We're gonna show you
what's that for very soon.

00:08:04.858 --> 00:08:05.691
Gracias.

00:08:05.691 --> 00:08:07.060
(waiter speaks in foreign language)

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.050
I got two different types of carnitas.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.753
One is a mix of meat and
fat, and then the other one--

00:08:12.753 --> 00:08:13.688
- [Lalo] Costilla.

00:08:13.688 --> 00:08:14.521
- [Mark] Costilla.

00:08:14.521 --> 00:08:15.354
- [Lalo] Yeah.

00:08:15.354 --> 00:08:16.187
- It's a whole rib.

00:08:16.187 --> 00:08:17.020
And you can see, in this taco,

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:17.853
there's a whole bone in there.

00:08:17.853 --> 00:08:18.686
And look at that meat!

00:08:18.686 --> 00:08:20.830
Oh, that just looks fall apart tender.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.570
Oh, that is unbelievable.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.120
It's gonna just slide off
the bone without a doubt.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.200
That style, man.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.250
That taco style, man.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.050
We've got our tacos.

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.120
We've added the salsa.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.570
And now, this is the most
genius plate you'll ever see.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.520
And it inserts just perfectly.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.120
- [Lalo] On Coke.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:49.953
- [Mark] Lalo, you're a genius.

00:08:49.953 --> 00:08:52.100
So you have hands free.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.810
We can be filming, we can be eating tacos,

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.320
and we can hold our drinks--
- I'm drinking.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.800
- [Mark] All at the same time.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:01.800
- And answer the phone.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.447
Hey, hi, mom.

00:09:03.447 --> 00:09:04.698
I'm eating tacos.

00:09:04.698 --> 00:09:06.000
(both laugh)

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
- I'm gonna squeeze on the
lime just to get that extra

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.050
citrus component which is a must in tacos.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.170
And I'm gonna go for this one first.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.830
This is the carnita with a mix of skin.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.090
You can see the chunks of skin down there.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.630
Wow, that's a lot of meat
stuck into a tortilla.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:29.643
Oh.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.150
Unbelievable.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.197
- [Lalo] The skin is soft.

00:09:38.197 --> 00:09:39.030
- [Mark] It si.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.863
- [Lalo] Yeah.

00:09:39.863 --> 00:09:40.990
- [Mark] It just sorta like melts.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.823
- Yeah.

00:09:41.823 --> 00:09:42.656
- It melts.

00:09:42.656 --> 00:09:44.299
- The salsa, it's a little spicy.

00:09:44.299 --> 00:09:46.882
(upbeat music)

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.201
- One of the things that's
amazing about this taco

00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:55.230
is it requires very, very little chewing.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.120
Chew twice and you can swallow
it because it's so soft.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.680
And it's just all,

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.400
it's melting together with
that meat, with that skin.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.600
The onions in there give it a crunch.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.630
You've got the refreshing cilantro.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.900
And then that salsa, and
then that squeeze of lime,

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.278
it just all comes together.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.861
(upbeat music)

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.820
I have never had a taco
or seen a taco like this

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.460
with a bone, an entire bone
rib in the taco before.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.840
So you can see, okay,

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.480
so there's onions and there's cilantro,

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.840
and then it's the whole bone
of pork in here, the whole rib.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.820
It's inside of the taco.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.260
So Lalo told me that you
can either take out the bone

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.650
right now or you can just start eating it

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.600
and just work your way around the bone.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.560
I think I'm just gonna work
my way around the bone.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.206
So you can pick up this entire thing.

00:10:45.206 --> 00:10:48.156
I mean the tortillas are jus
there to hold it all together.

00:10:59.854 --> 00:11:01.293
- [Lalo] Tortilla is so soft.

00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:05.100
I think that rib or
costilla, they have a lot of,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.745
a little more flavor because of them.

00:11:07.745 --> 00:11:10.328
(upbeat music)

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.790
- That's absolutely incredible.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.731
You can see the bone in there,

00:11:18.731 --> 00:11:21.970
so you just kinda work
your way around the bone.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.920
That was like eating a taco drumstick.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.143
Those carnitas were
absolutely spectacular.

00:11:33.143 --> 00:11:34.620
That one with the rib

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.834
was a total new taco experience for me.

00:11:36.834 --> 00:11:40.226
That's literally like a taco drumstick.

00:11:40.226 --> 00:11:41.919
It was amazing.

00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:44.502
(upbeat music)

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.060
Okay, we picked up Ying and Mica.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.010
They were sleeping before.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.510
They missed all the breakfast tacos

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.110
but now, they're coming with us.

00:11:58.205 --> 00:11:59.550
(Lalo chuckles)

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.690
Where are we off to next?

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.490
- We are going to El Pescadito.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.850
It's a fish taco.

00:12:10.656 --> 00:12:12.390
This is called El Pescadito.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.497
They are from Hermosillo Sonora.

00:12:14.497 --> 00:12:19.497
This is kind of restaurant I
know, but this is fish tacos.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.770
So I think that everything of the sea,

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.560
we need to give due respect.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.560
So this is kind, you
know, it looks like fancy,

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.920
but it's cheap, and it's great.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.730
And they make you the
tacos in front of you.

00:13:07.548 --> 00:13:11.715
(cook speaks in foreign language)

00:13:13.381 --> 00:13:14.795
- Muchas gracias.

00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:17.045
Wow, oh, man.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.860
Things are really starting
to heat up on this taco tour.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.044
I think I'm gonna have
to take off my jacket.

00:13:26.044 --> 00:13:26.877
(Lalo laughs)

00:13:26.877 --> 00:13:27.776
- [Lalo] And the belt.

00:13:27.776 --> 00:13:30.020
- I'm gonna loosen the belt, man.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.150
And we're gonna go season them
with the salsas over there.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.100
I'm just gonna load them up
and they'll be ready to eat.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.052
I can't wait.

00:13:40.052 --> 00:13:42.635
(upbeat music)

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.615
This is our third taco stop of the day.

00:13:51.615 --> 00:13:55.490
And still, I've never been
so excited in my entire life

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.220
to eat tacos, man.
(Lalo laughs)

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.369
Oh, man, these are beautiful.

00:13:59.369 --> 00:14:00.202
- [Lalo] And so much different.

00:14:00.202 --> 00:14:01.035
- [Mark] The colors.

00:14:01.035 --> 00:14:01.868
- [Lalo] You know.

00:14:01.868 --> 00:14:02.794
- [Mark] Yes.

00:14:02.794 --> 00:14:03.627
- [Lalo] Yeah.

00:14:03.627 --> 00:14:04.490
- Yeah, totally different.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.980
What I love about these
tacos is that they stuff

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.110
either cheese, we've got one
with cheese and one with fish.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.000
It's marlin?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.030
- Yeah, marlin.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.863
- Marlin fish.

00:14:13.863 --> 00:14:17.020
They stuff it into a jalapeno,
and then they batter it,

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.330
and then they deep fry it
so you get it all crispy.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.940
And then after that,
they assemble the taco.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.570
So they grab the tortillas.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.040
They chop up the jalapenos

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.105
with the cheese or with the marlin.

00:14:27.105 --> 00:14:28.270
They chop it up.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.040
They stuff it into the taco.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.750
Then they add on,

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.538
he adds on some of the
fried shrimp after that.

00:14:34.538 --> 00:14:39.009
And then you can top it with
all of your onions and salsas.

00:14:39.009 --> 00:14:42.670
This thing is just
exploding with ingredients.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.020
It's just bulging.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.640
They're massive.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.940
These are huge.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:47.773
- Huge tacos.

00:14:47.773 --> 00:14:49.420
- Okay, alright.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.820
This is gonna be a big bite.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.280
Oh, wow.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.069
- You hit it.

00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:08.470
I tell you. (laughs)

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.303
- Wow.

00:15:09.303 --> 00:15:11.840
That's almost like impossibly delicious.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.500
That's almost ridiculous how good that is.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.490
The fish is so soft and tender and moist.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.551
Then you get those deep fried shrimp

00:15:21.551 --> 00:15:24.850
which have a little bounce
to them, that bouncy texture.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.250
But they're covered and deep fried too,

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.820
so they're crunchy as well.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.140
And then you get all those onions,

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.450
the refreshing pickled onions.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.450
You've got the salsas in
there, the squeeze of lime.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.830
Oh, that's, that is, it's unbelievable.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.170
It will blow your taste buds.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.750
And not to mention it's
just absolutely huge.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.470
That's just a mouth explosion.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.530
There's so many ingredients in this taco.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.750
I don't even know how
it's being held together.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.110
It's just barely, barely holding on,

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.720
holding together with that tortilla.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.980
But the fillings are just
oozing out, just exploding.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.283
You've got the salsa splatter all over.

00:16:02.283 --> 00:16:03.163
(Lalo chuckles)

00:16:03.163 --> 00:16:05.746
(upbeat music)

00:16:09.006 --> 00:16:10.740
So one taco down, one to go.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.359
But these tacos are seriously monstrous.

00:16:13.359 --> 00:16:17.370
A normal size taco would maybe
be like a third this size.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.960
But actually, come to
think of it, pretty much

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.620
all the tacos we've eaten
today have been monsters.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.460
- I'm ready.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.457
- Yeah, this is a taco workout.

00:16:24.457 --> 00:16:25.760
(both laugh)

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.090
We are on a taco marathon today,
and we've only just begun.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.280
- Yeah.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.113
Actually, yes.

00:16:32.113 --> 00:16:32.946
- Actually, yes.

00:16:32.946 --> 00:16:34.200
(both laugh)

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.930
- This is only three kinds.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:36.763
- Yeah, we've only--

00:16:36.763 --> 00:16:38.080
- We're going to go to--

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.670
- I don't even know.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.380
I don't even know how many
we're going to. (laughs)

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.610
But if you can see below here,
you can just see all of that

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:49.970
melted cheese in there,
oh, melted fried cheese.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:50.803
Cheers.

00:16:50.803 --> 00:16:51.743
- Cheers.

00:16:51.743 --> 00:16:54.326
(upbeat music)

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:04.250
- [Mark] This is really good.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.097
It's rich.

00:17:05.097 --> 00:17:07.990
It's kinda salty.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.760
You can taste how it really
mixed well with the jalapeno.

00:17:13.223 --> 00:17:15.860
- [Lalo] The jalapeno is not as spicy.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.760
It's not as spicy.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.420
- Oh, oh, I got a shrimp in that bite.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.610
Okay, final bite.

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.130
I got a little cheese down left there

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:30.390
and also a half a shrimp.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.160
Absolutely insane tacos.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.796
So the cheese and the marlin,

00:17:38.796 --> 00:17:40.520
for me, the clear winner was the marlin.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.490
But both of them, they're
absolutely stunning.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.170
But when you come here, you cannot miss.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.770
It's the chile relleno de
marlin with the camarones,

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.480
with the shrimp, with everything.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.340
The works.
- The cheese.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.716
- With cheese.

00:17:53.716 --> 00:17:55.849
That's all you want in a taco.

00:17:55.849 --> 00:17:58.470
That's the life changer right there.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.144
- The name is taco tote.

00:18:00.144 --> 00:18:02.727
(upbeat music)

00:18:15.274 --> 00:18:17.170
- [Mark] We're on our
way to the next place.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:21.181
- It's called Tacos
Charly, the best suadero

00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:24.810
in all Mexico City for me, for my opinion.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.810
- That was about a 30-minute drive or so.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.690
So that gave us a little
bit of time to rest.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.020
This is the next place.

00:18:42.384 --> 00:18:43.338
It's a jacuzzi.

00:18:43.338 --> 00:18:45.866
It's a jacuzzi of bubbling suadero.

00:18:45.866 --> 00:18:47.198
And Lalo was telling me

00:18:47.198 --> 00:18:50.030
that's from the front part of the cow.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:50.863
- [Lalo] Yeah, cow.

00:18:50.863 --> 00:18:54.325
- And it's boiling in fat from the cow,

00:18:54.325 --> 00:18:56.900
and it's just bubbling away,

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.910
slow cooking to ultra tenderness.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.390
- In this taqueria, I love the suadero.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.790
That's, for me, the best tacos.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.980
- That suadero specifically.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:07.813
Okay.

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:08.990
They also have pastor here, al pastor,

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.400
but we'll be going to
another place for al pastor.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.621
So we came here specifically
to eat the jacuzzi (mumbles).

00:19:15.621 --> 00:19:16.788
- The suadero.

00:19:43.143 --> 00:19:45.726
(upbeat music)

00:19:50.616 --> 00:19:52.480
- The ultimate move that he pulls off

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.726
is he takes the tortillas,
he dips just a little bit

00:19:55.726 --> 00:20:00.160
into the bubbling fat so the
flavor coats the tortilla.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.120
And then he adds on just some
onions and some cilantro.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.260
And then there's a big bucket of salsa

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.810
which he just adds on
a little bit of salsa.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.430
And Lalo has told me that they
do have salsas over there,

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:14.235
but he says the meat is so good here

00:20:14.235 --> 00:20:17.130
so we're just gonna eat it as
is, as they give it to you,

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.550
as the chef hands it to you.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.860
These are like two or three
biter tacos as opposed to

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.350
the gigantic tacos that we've
been having so far today.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:29.350
- This is the original
way to close a taco.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:34.580
You put it one way, the other
way, forming like a belt,

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.930
and you put it three fingers.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:43.370
That's how don't spread all the meat.

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:48.080
Keep this little finger up
because that made you class.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.200
- [Mark] Taco holding
skills from an expert.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.120
You kinda wrap it like this,

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.130
and then you hold your fingers like that.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:55.660
- [Lalo] Exactly, and the little finger.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.160
- [Mark] The little pinky goes out.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:57.993
- [Lalo] That's it.

00:20:57.993 --> 00:21:00.520
- [Mark] That way, the meat
is encased into the tortilla.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.160
Your fingers remain clean.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.290
- [Lalo] Exactly, and give you class.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:06.123
- We're ready.

00:21:06.123 --> 00:21:07.086
Cheers.

00:21:07.086 --> 00:21:07.919
- Cheers.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.190
Wow.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.232
Oh, that meat.

00:21:20.232 --> 00:21:21.790
- [Lalo] Ah, but the sauce.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.510
- Yeah, the whole
combination of everything.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:29.220
But that meat, you can
like taste how oily,

00:21:31.168 --> 00:21:32.820
but that oil is pure flavor.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.653
- [Lalo] Exactly.

00:21:33.653 --> 00:21:34.883
That's the fat.

00:21:34.883 --> 00:21:36.150
- [Mark] You taste the cow.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.320
- [Lalo] Yeah, you taste the cow. (laughs)

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.220
- That is awesome.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.000
Just taco after taco of pure joy.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.139
- [Lalo] But you know, it's different.

00:21:54.139 --> 00:21:54.972
- [Mark] Totally different.

00:21:54.972 --> 00:21:57.860
- [Lalo] Every single taco,
they have a different flavor.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.930
They have a different recipe.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:01.130
Everything is (mumbles).

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.030
- No two tacos have been
even close to the same

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.600
that we've tried today.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.433
Another one.

00:22:09.433 --> 00:22:10.416
- Another.

00:22:10.416 --> 00:22:12.999
(upbeat music)

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.552
- That is meat heaven.

00:22:22.552 --> 00:22:23.385
Oh, man.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.943
Stunning.

00:22:30.943 --> 00:22:33.390
(upbeat music)

00:22:38.488 --> 00:22:41.061
This place is not that busy
now, but Lalo is saying

00:22:41.061 --> 00:22:43.445
that in a few hours, they would be packed.

00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:46.120
You can see the entire tub

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.920
is just full of meat bubbling away.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.562
That's all gonna sell out by today.

00:22:49.562 --> 00:22:51.680
And you know why it's gonna sell out,

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.550
because it is outstanding.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.730
I'm outside now and
it's looking kinda dark.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.050
It looks like it's about to rain.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.497
Oh, I just felt a drop.

00:22:58.497 --> 00:23:03.030
(Lalo speaks in foreign language)

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.200
- Now it's tacos de tripa.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.033
- That's good.

00:23:06.033 --> 00:23:07.351
That's coming up next.

00:23:07.351 --> 00:23:09.934
(upbeat music)

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.300
It started downpouring on the drive

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.750
to the next taco
restaurant, but we made it.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.700
This place is famous for tripa.

00:23:33.863 --> 00:23:36.430
There are just poofs of steam just wafting

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.020
through this entire restaurant
and along the sidewalk

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.570
and throughout the street here.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.395
And you can smell the organ meats.

00:23:42.395 --> 00:23:45.840
So they specialize, okay,
Lalo has been (mumbles).

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.180
I mean again, they have all
sorts of different tacos here,

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:51.709
but the taco to eat here is
tripa which is the intestines.

00:23:51.709 --> 00:23:55.280
And they have another massive vat

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.380
just full of the wrinkly, curly intestines

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.724
just slow simmering away
in their juices again.

00:24:02.724 --> 00:24:03.924
Yes, you know I love it.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:13.600
The meat steam bath at this
restaurant is just insane.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:56.763
Wow.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.460
These guys are absolute taco wizards.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.690
They chop up that meat and
they chop up that intestine

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.210
so fast, and they rip it
up, chopping on the board.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.620
He gets the tortillas in his hands.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.095
He just covers it and like
scoops it up with the tortilla.

00:25:11.095 --> 00:25:12.670
The most magical part

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:14.890
is when they sizzle it on the hotplate,

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.170
and they bring it up
and it's just sizzling.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:19.840
- I like your way to say he's a wizard.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.673
- [Mark] Absolute beauties.

00:25:20.673 --> 00:25:24.320
You can just see how
crunchy everything is too.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.153
Cheers.

00:25:25.153 --> 00:25:26.560
- Cheers.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.820
Taco de tripa.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:45.860
Crunchy on top, but soft in the middle.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.120
- [Mark] That is on another level.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:47.953
- Yeah, yeah.

00:25:47.953 --> 00:25:48.786
- It's crunchy.

00:25:48.786 --> 00:25:49.840
It's soft.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.470
- At the same time. (chuckles)

00:25:56.877 --> 00:26:01.044
(Lalo speaks in foreign language)

00:26:06.962 --> 00:26:07.795
- Yeah.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.528
The beauty of tripa is
how it's crunchy and gooey

00:26:13.528 --> 00:26:18.528
and soft and tender, all
textures in your mouth at once.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:26.833
Oh.

00:26:30.426 --> 00:26:31.498
Muchas gracias.

00:26:31.498 --> 00:26:32.659
Gracias.

00:26:32.659 --> 00:26:33.550
Muchas gracias.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.200
Those are one of those foods

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.470
that it really is not the
most pleasing to look at.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.440
They're kinda ugly, to be honest with you,

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:44.500
those wiggly, curly
intestines just sizzling.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.440
But when they prepare it that way,

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.510
the flavor that comes out
of them and the textures,

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:53.770
the diversity of textures,
oh, it'll blow your mind.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:55.921
Okay, we still have more tacos to eat.

00:26:55.921 --> 00:26:58.504
(upbeat music)

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.250
We've just pulled up to another taco.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.160
This is a street food stall.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.680
Oh, this is the lengua spot.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.513
- Exactly.

00:27:07.513 --> 00:27:10.140
This is one of my best
favorite tacos in Mexico

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.820
because this is a real street food.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:17.200
If you came here, you can
order whatever you want

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.830
and it's going to be
one of the best tacos.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:20.663
I love it.

00:27:20.663 --> 00:27:21.750
I really love it.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.139
This is called Los Juanes
because sir is Juan,

00:27:25.139 --> 00:27:28.889
and another is Juan, so
all of them are Juan.

00:27:36.814 --> 00:27:40.981
(Lalo speaks in foreign language)

00:28:31.199 --> 00:28:32.760
Gracias.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.670
- Again, they have a mix
of different tacos here,

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:36.700
but we went with tacos de cabeza

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.060
which is from the head meat,

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.170
and then tacos de lengua
which is the tongue.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.543
- Yeah, a big one.

00:28:43.543 --> 00:28:46.080
- I have to tell you something.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.698
When I was in university
and I would eat tacos a lot,

00:28:48.698 --> 00:28:51.992
in Arizona, both of these two tacos,

00:28:51.992 --> 00:28:56.129
especially lengua, was one of my top taco.

00:28:56.129 --> 00:29:00.040
So it's one of my favorite tacos of all.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.684
Okay, we're starting with the
head tacos, tacos de cabeza.

00:29:02.684 --> 00:29:05.880
These are just like,
they're like cone shaped.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.030
They're just sprouting.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:18.703
- It's so soft.

00:29:18.703 --> 00:29:23.680
- Just taco after taco
of extreme deliciousness.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.390
- For me, I need to say

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:28.790
that I need more head tacos to pull me.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.176
I don't know why, but it's like okay,

00:29:31.176 --> 00:29:34.240
I need more and then more and then more.

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:41.940
- You know, I mean head
tacos are one of those tacos

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.240
that a baby could eat
because they're so soft.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.880
- [Lalo] It's really huge.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:47.713
- [Mark] A beautiful thing.

00:29:47.713 --> 00:29:48.546
- [Lalo] Yeah.

00:29:48.546 --> 00:29:50.441
- It's a whole slice of tongue.

00:29:50.441 --> 00:29:52.188
They give you a tongue steak in this taco.

00:29:52.188 --> 00:29:53.610
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:54.930
- It's just bulging with tongue.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:55.763
- It's a lot of tongue.

00:29:55.763 --> 00:29:56.596
- Yeah.

00:29:56.596 --> 00:29:57.429
Oh, okay.

00:29:57.429 --> 00:29:58.841
- I think that this is the best part

00:29:58.841 --> 00:30:00.140
of (mumbles) tacos, head tacos.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.150
- Yeah.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:01.983
- This is the best.

00:30:01.983 --> 00:30:03.540
- Yeah, yup, okay.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.580
Oh, yeah, we have to toast this one.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.270
Oh, yeah.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:17.550
That is just ultra
tender, ultra flavorful.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:19.985
Dude, you still kept your fingers.

00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:22.920
Lalo is an extreme expert.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.666
Look at those clean fingers.

00:30:24.666 --> 00:30:25.930
- [Lalo] Look at that.

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:27.520
- [Mark] Look at that pinky.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.261
Look at my, there's like 25
different salsas on my fingers.

00:30:31.261 --> 00:30:33.100
(Lalo laughs)

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.000
I think some more taco practice.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.385
- And the class.

00:30:36.385 --> 00:30:38.968
(upbeat music)

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.110
Thank you very much, Mexico.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:52.066
Thank you very much.

00:30:52.066 --> 00:30:52.899
- Gracias.

00:30:53.999 --> 00:30:55.660
Muchas gracias.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.000
Something that I love about them

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.050
is that it's just a
really small production.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:03.830
There's just five guys
that are cooking tacos.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:05.350
It's not a commercialized--

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.420
- [Lalo] It's like a family.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:07.630
- [Mark] It is, yeah.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:11.190
- And the customers are like
family too, just relatives.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.880
- And even as we were just
sitting here or standing here

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.990
in the street watching the customers come,

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:18.062
you see people come
from all walks of life.

00:31:18.062 --> 00:31:19.914
I mean they're just coming from like

00:31:19.914 --> 00:31:22.139
their condos right up here.

00:31:22.139 --> 00:31:23.620
They walk down.

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:27.010
People come in their
pajamas, come to get tacos.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.710
There's no hate here.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:32.360
It's whatever you wanna
do, you come to eat tacos.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.800
They serve you tacos.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.633
They're honest.

00:31:34.633 --> 00:31:35.800
They're so friendly.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.180
This is an awesome spot.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.410
This is the type of place
that I love to see succeed.

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:40.243
- Exactly.

00:31:40.243 --> 00:31:42.610
- Yeah, they're good guys, such good guys.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.800
- And the funny thing is that

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.900
they are just front of the gym.

00:31:49.798 --> 00:31:50.631
- Of the gym.

00:31:50.631 --> 00:31:51.800
I will save the gym for tomorrow.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.340
- [Lalo] It is ultimate tacos tour.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.310
- [Mark] Yeah, how are you feeling?

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:57.620
- [Lalo] I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.270
- I'm feeling amazing.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:04.030
- But the next place,
it's the star of that.

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:06.435
Tacos al pastor is one of the best tacos

00:32:06.435 --> 00:32:08.584
all around the world.

00:32:08.584 --> 00:32:11.090
Because the really--

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.950
- The grand finale.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.320
- The grand finale, exactly.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.760
- [Mark] This has been
a mission impossible,

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.630
but we are gonna complete the mission.

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:17.542
- [Lalo] Of course.

00:32:17.542 --> 00:32:18.375
- [Mark] We're not giving up.

00:32:18.375 --> 00:32:20.016
We're putting in the taco fight today.

00:32:20.016 --> 00:32:21.166
(Lalo laughs)

00:32:21.166 --> 00:32:23.749
(upbeat music)

00:32:33.876 --> 00:32:35.770
- This is El Vilsito.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:38.231
The history about this
place that I like it,

00:32:38.231 --> 00:32:41.408
in the morning, it's a mechanic shop.

00:32:41.408 --> 00:32:42.241
- [Mark] That's awesome, that's awesome.

00:32:42.241 --> 00:32:45.110
- But at night, they open a taqueria.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:46.530
So that's amazing.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:50.040
I love the pastor here and the salsa roja.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.630
It's so spicy and
really, really (mumbles).

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:54.710
- One thing to know about al pastor

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:56.860
is that it's on the vertical spit.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.980
Al pastor is the heavyweight
of tacos in Mexico City.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.480
It's the number one taco, right?

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.313
- For me, it's the number one for Mexico.

00:33:03.313 --> 00:33:04.146
- It's everywhere.

00:33:04.146 --> 00:33:04.979
It's everywhere.

00:33:04.979 --> 00:33:05.812
It's so popular.

00:33:05.812 --> 00:33:08.710
But what's interesting about al pastor,

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:10.180
the method of cooking was brought over

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:11.800
by Lebanese immigrants, right?

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.732
- Exactly, exactly.

00:33:12.732 --> 00:33:14.890
- So it's,

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.746
I'm getting water dripping on me. (laughs)

00:33:19.746 --> 00:33:20.800
- It's raining now.

00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:25.142
(upbeat music)

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.630
- My favorite part of him making it

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:48.110
is when at the final end,
he reaches up to the top,

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.884
there's a whole pineapple.

00:33:49.884 --> 00:33:51.870
He slices off a little piece of pineapple

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:54.570
directly into his handheld tortilla.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:58.190
This guy is the absolute al pastor master.

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:00.220
He just flies on that knife.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.270
He's been shaving the
meat and making tacos

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:04.360
for over 18 years.

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:09.170
So 18 years to perfect his
skill, and he does it flawlessly.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.581
We are ordering something
that Lalo has just told me

00:34:11.581 --> 00:34:13.020
is gonna blow my mind.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.290
It's called a gringa.

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:16.060
And what they do is they
take a flour tortilla,

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.868
they put cheese on it, and
they actually flip it over

00:34:18.868 --> 00:34:23.868
so that the cheese kinda
caramelizes on the hot griddle.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.400
Once that browns and
once that's caramelized,

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.100
they take that tortilla,
he puts it in his hand,

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.740
and he shaves off the al
pastor on top of the cheese,

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:34.390
into the tortilla, a bunch,

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:35.904
and then it's like triple the size.

00:34:35.904 --> 00:34:38.654
(dramatic music)

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:52.611
And that is a gringa.

00:34:52.611 --> 00:34:53.444
Gracias.

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:00.980
It's the grand finale.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.980
This thing is taco perfection.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:04.980
- This is a gringa.

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:05.813
Why?

00:35:05.813 --> 00:35:09.068
Because the tortilla, it's made by flour.

00:35:09.068 --> 00:35:10.700
And then they put a cheese,

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.549
and then they put meat of the al pastor,

00:35:13.549 --> 00:35:17.680
pineapples, cilantro,
and onion, and that's it.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.750
That's beauty.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:19.794
- [Mark] That is, yeah.

00:35:19.794 --> 00:35:23.920
I mean I've just been impressed
all day with the different

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:28.430
tacos that we've been eating,
but this, oh, man, it's like--

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:29.425
- [Lalo] Mona Lisa.

00:35:29.425 --> 00:35:30.258
- [Mark] It's another level.

00:35:30.258 --> 00:35:31.091
This is another level.

00:35:31.091 --> 00:35:31.924
- [Lalo] Like the Mona Lisa.

00:35:31.924 --> 00:35:33.510
- He has so much skill.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.007
It is time.

00:35:35.007 --> 00:35:37.502
You can already tell it's just gonna be

00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:42.390
a messy just overflowing taco.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.391
Look at the size of that.

00:35:44.391 --> 00:35:47.160
There's so much meat in there.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.800
Oh, wow.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.440
- It really was a nice day.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.273
- An amazing day.

00:35:51.273 --> 00:35:52.106
- An amazing day.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:10.920
- Wow.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.470
- [Lalo] Tacos al pastor is amazing.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.580
The pineapple is so sweet.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.470
It combines and mix with the meat.

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:20.210
- The meat has a little bit
of sourness from that vinegar.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.964
You taste the cheese on the
bottom of that tortilla.

00:36:24.964 --> 00:36:27.720
- [Lalo] It's completely
different with a corn tortilla.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.660
- [Mark] Yeah.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.540
- [Lalo] Completely different, gringa.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:33.230
- That is absolutely as good as it looks.

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.400
- Mark, do you want a really spicy salsa?

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.427
- Yeah, I'd love it.

00:36:41.427 --> 00:36:42.260
- Great.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.677
- Yeah, for sure.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.540
- [Lalo] This is chile (mumbles).

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.150
It's only for the people that...

00:36:54.874 --> 00:36:57.374
That's it, really.

00:36:58.767 --> 00:36:59.600
- [Mark] Okay.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.433
- [Lalo] Really?

00:37:00.433 --> 00:37:01.340
- [Mark] Is it gonna be spicy?

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:03.183
- Watch this, watch this.

00:37:03.183 --> 00:37:04.430
- I'm up for it, man.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.970
Oh, yeah.

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:18.690
Oh, that's awesome.

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:19.523
That is spicy.

00:37:19.523 --> 00:37:20.660
It's awesome.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.240
- It is so spicy.

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:29.300
- [Mark] We have come to the
end of this ultimate best tacos

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.610
in Mexico City, Mexican food tour.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.270
This is the last bite.

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:34.103
Salud.

00:37:34.103 --> 00:37:34.936
- [Lalo] Salud.

00:37:35.816 --> 00:37:38.566
(dramatic music)

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.060
- We don't need to say anything else.

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:16.019
That's it.
- Yeah, what can I say?

00:38:16.019 --> 00:38:16.852
It's like.

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:29.712
- We have come to the end of this

00:38:29.712 --> 00:38:33.012
ultimate best tacos tour of Mexico City.

00:38:33.012 --> 00:38:35.560
A taco is just one of the greatest foods

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.764
in the entire world, without a doubt.

00:38:37.764 --> 00:38:39.620
You cannot argue that.

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:43.720
It's like a gift to humankind.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.910
Tacos are insanely amazing,

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:50.300
and we ate so many different
types of tacos today.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:51.477
I can't even,

00:38:51.477 --> 00:38:54.440
the tacos that we ate for this morning

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.266
seems like it was yesterday.

00:38:56.266 --> 00:38:57.300
(Lalo laughs)

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.730
We ate so many different types of tacos.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:01.970
- We loved the chicharron,
with chicharron.

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:03.530
But now, these.

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:04.363
- Oh, man.

00:39:04.363 --> 00:39:05.250
Oh, yeah.

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:06.399
You can't decide.

00:39:06.399 --> 00:39:07.232
You can't decide.

00:39:07.232 --> 00:39:09.060
It depends on what mood you're in

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.490
what taco would be the best for that time.

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:14.160
They were all absolutely incredible.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.265
So I have to say a huge thank you to Lalo.

00:39:16.265 --> 00:39:17.372
- No, no, no, thank you.

00:39:17.372 --> 00:39:18.650
It's an honor and a pleasure--

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:19.483
- It was an honor, man.

00:39:19.483 --> 00:39:20.316
It was an honor.

00:39:20.316 --> 00:39:21.520
You gotta check out Lalo.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.508
He is La Ruta de la Garnacha on YouTube.

00:39:24.508 --> 00:39:26.400
He makes awesome videos.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.670
He loves to eat.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:30.259
And he's just such an
awesome, awesome guy, man.

00:39:30.259 --> 00:39:31.245
- Thank you very much, man.

00:39:31.245 --> 00:39:32.078
- So thank you very much, yeah.

00:39:32.078 --> 00:39:34.258
- And garnacha means street food.

00:39:34.258 --> 00:39:35.156
- Oh, awesome.

00:39:35.156 --> 00:39:37.970
- Yeah, it's kind of the
street food in Mexico City,

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:40.650
so that's why I take that name.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:41.715
- The route to the street food.

00:39:41.715 --> 00:39:42.655
- The route of the street food.

00:39:42.655 --> 00:39:43.488
- Cool.
- Yeah, it is.

00:39:43.488 --> 00:39:47.150
- So yeah, he is the man for
street food in Mexico City.

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:48.620
And thank you all for watching the video.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:50.160
Please remember to give it a thumbs up.

Thanks again for watching.

00:39:56.187 --> 00:39:58.470
Goodbye from Mexico City.
