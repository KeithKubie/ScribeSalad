00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:08.149
At the height of their power,

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.120
infamous Caribbean pirates like Blackbeard
and Henry Morgan

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.438
commanded as many as ten ships 
and several hundred men.

00:00:16.438 --> 00:00:21.289
But their stories pale next to the most
successful pirate of all time.

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.701
Madame Zheng commanded 1800 vessels,

00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:26.980
made enemies of several empires,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.619
and still lived to old age.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.910
Madame Zheng began her life as a commoner

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.100
working on one of the many 
floating brothels, or flower boats,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.850
in the port city of Guangzhou.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.200
By 1801, she had attracted 
the attention

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.159
of a local pirate captain named Zheng Yi,
and the two soon married.

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.899
Guangzhou’s fishermen had long engaged 
in small-scale piracy

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.919
to supplement their meager incomes
in the offseason.

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.899
But a successful peasant uprising in 
neighboring Vietnam

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.371
at the end of the 18th century
had raised the stakes.

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:02.720
The victorious Tây Sơn rebels 
had unified their country

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.749
only to face a Chinese invasion

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:09.310
and ongoing maritime battles with the 
Vietnamese rulers they had overthrown.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.149
So they commissioned Guangzhou’s pirates 
to raid the coast

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.030
and join the fight against their enemies.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.530
Serving their Vietnamese patrons 
turned the Zhengs and other pirates

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.179
from ragtag gangs aboard single vessels

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.371
into professional privateer fleets

00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:26.930
with dozens of ships 
able to hold their own at sea.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.819
In 1802, the Tây Sơn were overthrown

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.929
and the pirates lost 
their safe harbor in Vietnam.

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:34.449
But instead of scattering,

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:38.580
the Zhengs met the crisis by uniting 
the rival Cantonese pirate groups

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.669
into a formidable alliance.

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:44.300
At its height, the confederation 
included 70,000 sailors

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.130
with 800 large junks

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.747
and nearly 1,000 smaller vessels.

00:01:48.747 --> 00:01:53.309
Those were organized into six fleets 
marked by different colored flags.

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:56.661
The Zhengs were unlike many other 
historically-known privateers,

00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:58.920
such as Henry Morgan or Barbarossa,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.801
who acted on behalf 
of various naval powers.

00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:04.411
Instead, the Zhengs were now true outlaws,

00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:08.029
operating without support or approval 
from any government.

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:11.170
Zheng Yi met an untimely end in 1807,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.278
but his widow didn’t hesitate 
to secure their gains.

00:02:14.278 --> 00:02:16.179
Through skillful diplomacy,

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:18.529
Madame Zheng took 
charge of the confederation,

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:22.918
convincing the captains that their best
interests lay in continued collaboration.

00:02:22.918 --> 00:02:27.215
Meanwhile, she appointed Zhang Bao, 
the young protege of her late husband,

00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:31.660
as the commander of her most 
powerful squadron, the Red Flag Fleet.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.919
Zhang became not only her right-hand man,
but her lover and, soon, her new husband.

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.248
Madame Zheng consolidated her 
power through strict military discipline

00:02:40.248 --> 00:02:43.079
combined with a surprisingly 
progressive code of laws.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.841
Female captives were theoretically 
protected from sexual assault,

00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:49.020
and while pirates could 
take them as wives,

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.269
mistreatment or infidelity towards 
them was punishable by death.

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.880
Under Madame Zheng’s leadership,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.943
the pirates greatly 
increased their power,

00:02:56.943 --> 00:03:01.497
with 200 cannons 
and 1300 guns in the Red Flag Fleet alone.

00:03:01.497 --> 00:03:07.690
Within a few years, they destroyed 63 of 
Guangdong Province’s 135 military vessels,

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.029
forcing their commanders 
to hire more than 30 private junks.

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:15.219
Madame Zheng was so feared that Chinese 
commanders charged with apprehending her

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.080
spent most of their time ashore,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.180
sometimes sabotaging their own 
vessels to avoid battle at sea.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.654
With little to stop them,

00:03:22.654 --> 00:03:25.226
the pirates were able to mount successful
—and often brutal—

00:03:25.226 --> 00:03:29.261
raids on garrisons, villages, 
and markets throughout the coast.

00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:31.018
Using her administrative talents,

00:03:31.018 --> 00:03:34.570
Madame Zheng established financial offices
in cities and villages,

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.049
allowing her pirates to extract regular 
protection payments on land and sea alike.

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.350
This effectively created 
a state within a state

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.569
whose influence reached 
far beyond the South China Sea.

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.221
At the peak of her power,

00:03:46.221 --> 00:03:49.399
Madame Zheng’s confederation drove 
five American schooners

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:51.229
to safe harbor near Macao,

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:52.599
captured a Portuguese brig,

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.919
and blockaded a tribute 
mission from Thailand

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.909
—all in a single day.

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.720
But perhaps Madame Zheng’s greatest 
success lay in knowing when to quit.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.300
By 1810, increasing tension
between the Red and Black Flag Fleets

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.549
weakened the confederation from within

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.640
and rendered it more vulnerable 
to attack from without.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.603
So, when the Chinese government, 
desperate to stop the raids,

00:04:13.603 --> 00:04:16.348
offered amnesty in exchange 
for the pirates’ surrender,

00:04:16.348 --> 00:04:20.929
Madame Zheng and Zhang Bao agreed,
but only on their own terms.

00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:25.490
Their confederation was successfully 
and peacefully dismantled in April 1810,

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.600
while Zhang Bao was allowed to retain 
120 junks for personal use

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.111
and became an officer in the Chinese navy.

00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:33.799
Now fighting pirates himself,

00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:36.769
Zhang Bao quickly rose through 
the ranks of military command,

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:40.769
and Madame Zheng enjoyed all 
the privileges of her husband’s status.

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:42.998
After Zhang Bao died in 1822,

00:04:42.998 --> 00:04:46.368
Madame Zheng returned with their 
eleven-year-old son to Guangzhou,

00:04:46.368 --> 00:04:49.769
where she opened a gambling house 
and quietly lived off the proceeds.

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:54.259
She died at the age of 69—an uncommonly
peaceful end to a pirate’s life.
