all right I want to talk a little bit
 

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:02.210
all right I want to talk a little bit
about what happens when you have

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220
about what happens when you have
 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.889
about what happens when you have
multiple parties and gerrymandering

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899
multiple parties and gerrymandering
 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.349
multiple parties and gerrymandering
combined this is a quick review in the

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359
combined this is a quick review in the
 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.059
combined this is a quick review in the
main video we had this situation where

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069
main video we had this situation where
 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.830
main video we had this situation where
there are 15 voters eight of which are

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840
there are 15 voters eight of which are
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.540
there are 15 voters eight of which are
Buffalo seven of which are Jackalope and

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550
Buffalo seven of which are Jackalope and
 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.640
Buffalo seven of which are Jackalope and
depending on how you draw the district's

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650
depending on how you draw the district's
 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.829
depending on how you draw the district's
you can get any result that you want you

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839
you can get any result that you want you
 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.420
you can get any result that you want you
can either have the buffalo win four to

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430
can either have the buffalo win four to
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.130
can either have the buffalo win four to
one or you can get the Jackalope win

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140
one or you can get the Jackalope win
 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.290
one or you can get the Jackalope win
three to two

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300
three to two
 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.460
three to two
now this is not a good situation but it

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470
now this is not a good situation but it
 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.810
now this is not a good situation but it
gets worse if you add more political

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820
gets worse if you add more political
 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.550
gets worse if you add more political
parties so we're going to add in turtle

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560
parties so we're going to add in turtle
 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.589
parties so we're going to add in turtle
to the mixture here I need to make the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599
to the mixture here I need to make the
 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.849
to the mixture here I need to make the
voting population a little bit bigger to

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
voting population a little bit bigger to
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.080
voting population a little bit bigger to
show you the effect so now we're going

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090
show you the effect so now we're going
 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.569
show you the effect so now we're going
to have a twenty five member population

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579
to have a twenty five member population
 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.520
to have a twenty five member population
there are six turtle voters nine

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530
there are six turtle voters nine
 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.560
there are six turtle voters nine
Jackalope voters and ten buffalo voters

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570
Jackalope voters and ten buffalo voters
 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.389
Jackalope voters and ten buffalo voters
and you can see on the right-hand side

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
and you can see on the right-hand side
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.709
and you can see on the right-hand side
that we have a pie chart showing the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719
that we have a pie chart showing the
 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.840
that we have a pie chart showing the
overall proportion of the population the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
overall proportion of the population the
 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.100
overall proportion of the population the
best situations you can get with this

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
best situations you can get with this
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.049
best situations you can get with this
group is if you have one turtle district

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059
group is if you have one turtle district
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.420
group is if you have one turtle district
you get two Jackalope districts and two

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430
you get two Jackalope districts and two
 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.520
you get two Jackalope districts and two
buffalo districts and then the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
buffalo districts and then the
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.930
buffalo districts and then the
percentage of the representatives and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
percentage of the representatives and
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.069
percentage of the representatives and
the percentage of the voters match

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079
the percentage of the voters match
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.500
the percentage of the voters match
pretty closely but as you expect if you

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510
pretty closely but as you expect if you
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.790
pretty closely but as you expect if you
gerrymander these districts around a

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
gerrymander these districts around a
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.319
gerrymander these districts around a
little bit you can change the results

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
little bit you can change the results
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.930
little bit you can change the results
quite dramatically first we can have

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940
quite dramatically first we can have
 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.610
quite dramatically first we can have
buffalo win an additional seat so they

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
buffalo win an additional seat so they
 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.470
buffalo win an additional seat so they
get a majority in the house so they have

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480
get a majority in the house so they have
 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.210
get a majority in the house so they have
three districts against turtles one and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
three districts against turtles one and
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.030
three districts against turtles one and
Jackalopes one you can completely push

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
Jackalopes one you can completely push
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.399
Jackalopes one you can completely push
the turtles out so Jackalope gets two

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409
the turtles out so Jackalope gets two
 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.410
the turtles out so Jackalope gets two
representatives and Buffalo gets three

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420
representatives and Buffalo gets three
 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.690
representatives and Buffalo gets three
representatives you can set it up so

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
representatives you can set it up so
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.490
representatives you can set it up so
that Jackalope who's a minority party

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
that Jackalope who's a minority party
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.020
that Jackalope who's a minority party
they actually end up getting the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
they actually end up getting the
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.090
they actually end up getting the
majority in the house with three seats

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100
majority in the house with three seats
 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.399
majority in the house with three seats
two buffaloes two and in the weirdest

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
two buffaloes two and in the weirdest
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.020
two buffaloes two and in the weirdest
situation you can end up getting two

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
situation you can end up getting two
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.789
situation you can end up getting two
turtle representatives to three

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799
turtle representatives to three
 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.740
turtle representatives to three
Jackalope representatives and Buffalo

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750
Jackalope representatives and Buffalo
 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.880
Jackalope representatives and Buffalo
who's actually the largest section of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890
who's actually the largest section of
 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.929
who's actually the largest section of
the population they get no

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939
the population they get no
 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.569
the population they get no
representation at all I think part of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579
representation at all I think part of
 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.100
representation at all I think part of
the the trouble in actually explaining

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110
the the trouble in actually explaining
 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.960
the the trouble in actually explaining
gerrymandering and plurality voting is

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
gerrymandering and plurality voting is
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.280
gerrymandering and plurality voting is
because on an individual case-by-case

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290
because on an individual case-by-case
 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.649
because on an individual case-by-case
basis and each of these districts kind

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659
basis and each of these districts kind
 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.179
basis and each of these districts kind
of make sense and if you just take a

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
of make sense and if you just take a
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.440
of make sense and if you just take a
look at one for example right there's

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450
look at one for example right there's
 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.270
look at one for example right there's
three turtle voters there - buffalo

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280
three turtle voters there - buffalo
 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.920
three turtle voters there - buffalo
voters so it makes sense well this

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
voters so it makes sense well this
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.840
voters so it makes sense well this
district gets a turtle representative

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
district gets a turtle representative
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.330
district gets a turtle representative
while on a nationwide scale right you

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
while on a nationwide scale right you
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.889
while on a nationwide scale right you
might not get results that you want for

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
might not get results that you want for
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.780
might not get results that you want for
each individual case it's kind of hard

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
each individual case it's kind of hard
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.300
each individual case it's kind of hard
to argue against but the situation gets

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
to argue against but the situation gets
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.740
to argue against but the situation gets
much more complicated if you add more

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
much more complicated if you add more
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.050
much more complicated if you add more
parties so if we add in gorilla voters

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
parties so if we add in gorilla voters
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.730
parties so if we add in gorilla voters
and wolf voters here right now this

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
and wolf voters here right now this
 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.230
and wolf voters here right now this
district is no longer a turtle district

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
district is no longer a turtle district
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.910
district is no longer a turtle district
it's now a buffalo district because

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
it's now a buffalo district because
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.980
it's now a buffalo district because
buffalo has the most voters right under

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
buffalo has the most voters right under
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.630
buffalo has the most voters right under
first-past-the-post slash plurality

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
first-past-the-post slash plurality
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.150
first-past-the-post slash plurality
that's all you need to actually win you

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160
that's all you need to actually win you
 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.559
that's all you need to actually win you
don't need a majority of the population

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569
don't need a majority of the population
 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.790
don't need a majority of the population
you just need the large

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
you just need the large
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.550
you just need the large
number of voters but this can quickly

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560
number of voters but this can quickly
 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.320
number of voters but this can quickly
lead to some pretty horrific Leon

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330
lead to some pretty horrific Leon
 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.110
lead to some pretty horrific Leon
representative results so we go back to

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120
representative results so we go back to
 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.390
representative results so we go back to
our 25 population if we turn a bunch of

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
our 25 population if we turn a bunch of
 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.250
our 25 population if we turn a bunch of
those Jackalope and turtle voters into

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260
those Jackalope and turtle voters into
 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.620
those Jackalope and turtle voters into
third party voters we can take a look at

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630
third party voters we can take a look at
 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.060
third party voters we can take a look at
the overall population on that pie chart

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070
the overall population on that pie chart
 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.950
the overall population on that pie chart
you see again Buffalo is the plurality

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960
you see again Buffalo is the plurality
 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.370
you see again Buffalo is the plurality
of voters with 40% but you have 60% of

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380
of voters with 40% but you have 60% of
 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.740
of voters with 40% but you have 60% of
voters represent some other party but

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750
voters represent some other party but
 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.990
voters represent some other party but
under this districting situation none of

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000
under this districting situation none of
 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.910
under this districting situation none of
them get representatives except for the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920
them get representatives except for the
 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.130
them get representatives except for the
Buffalo who win every single district

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140
Buffalo who win every single district
 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.080
Buffalo who win every single district
because they have two votes that are

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090
because they have two votes that are
 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.850
because they have two votes that are
concentrated versus three votes that are

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860
concentrated versus three votes that are
 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.250
concentrated versus three votes that are
separated and this is why if you have

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260
separated and this is why if you have
 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.350
separated and this is why if you have
districting and gerrymandering and

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360
districting and gerrymandering and
 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.670
districting and gerrymandering and
you're using first-past-the-post voting
