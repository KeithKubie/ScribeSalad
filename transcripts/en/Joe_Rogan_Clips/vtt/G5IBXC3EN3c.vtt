1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.320
Oh,
negative shit.
Oh yeah.
Well,
how long will we find that die?

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.070
Give out his Instagram and you were going to die in this.
You know what I did?

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.340
I just blocked him is like,
Oh man,
you're going to get knocked the fuck out.

4
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:14.610
You're going to do this.
I'm just like,
oh my God.
Like Bro,
really?

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.150
You literally took your dead time out of your day.
Let's sit here today.

6
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:22.960
Just knocked on his door and he saw your face.
Imagine,
Oh my God,

7
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.290
I wish we could do that.
And He,
and he gets you answers the door.

8
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:30.040
It's Ben [inaudible].
He looks like

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.250
just fucking belly out.

10
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:39.030
Like this is never traded day in his life is you think of the Robbie Lawler

11
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:43.950
fight with Ben.
Oh Man.
Like I mean,
come on.
They got to run that back by,

12
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.610
I was thinking when it was over that herb dean made a mistake,

13
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.600
but the more I watch it,
the more I think he didn't.
I think what happened was,

14
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:56.430
I think Robbie went out.
I think his arm dropped and I think when herb came over,

15
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.770
this is what Ben says too,

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.120
but he loosened up the choke a little bit and Robbie came back to it and Robbie

17
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:05.770
probably doesn't even know because Robbie's such a fucking savage.

18
00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:08.650
She probably didn't even know he went out.
Yeah,
okay.
Yeah.

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.030
This is the argument and this is why it has to be ran back.
Yeah,

20
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.160
it's a good arguments.
You know,
this is the argument because first of all,

21
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:20.460
when when when Robbie ran that truck through Ben's face,

22
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.210
like he was out.
It's funny way of putting it.
He was out and welcome.

23
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.710
He recovered.
I mean he got hit with some fucking bombs,

24
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:30.720
but we're freaking wrestlers you,

25
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.800
the one thing about wrestlers at the elite level is you can be out of it,

26
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.910
but your body will naturally go through certain motions,
grab a leg,

27
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.580
pull up the names out.
Bobby was bombing on him.

28
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.750
Robbie ran a Mack truck through his face like that was under it,

29
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.780
like pull that fight up truck through his face.
Like,

30
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.110
I feel like Robbie knocked him out,
walk him up,
knock him out.

31
00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.150
Like Robby was just savage mode and that's the one thing about Ra and knowing

32
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.460
that Robin now,
because I trained with him is Robbie such a different guy.

33
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:09.710
Like he's so nonchalant and well he,
you know,

34
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.620
he handled the loss was classy.
But that's Robbie man.
That's classy thing.

35
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.900
And the explanation,

36
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:18.840
this was the thing with the explanation is you can argue that fight should have

37
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:21.960
been stopped when Robbie was bombing on him.

38
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.090
You could argue that for sure.

39
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.100
But at the same time where Robbie explains it is Robbie has so much experience

40
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:32.280
and it was a bulldog.
It's like big brother choke.
So you know,

41
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.690
it could have not been doing anything but Robbie explained it as I put my hand

42
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:39.750
down because this wasn't doing shit.
Chill,
relax.
You know,

43
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:42.240
cause I don't want to panic.
Robbie has that much experience.

44
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:45.150
He should know what to do.
They maybe that's what he was doing good.

45
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:48.630
But the way he put his arm down,
it looked like it was out.

46
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.550
But then when rob,

47
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.710
when herb dean came to check on him her while he was given a thumbs thumbs up,

48
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.470
herb dean didn't really give him a chance to put the thumbs up and stops the

49
00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:01.540
fight right and there.
But as far as,
oh I loosened the choke.

50
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:04.630
That's why he came to know the fucking lead on loosen the choke until this,

51
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.320
the ref pulls you off of him or you pop his head off.

52
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.440
He said he lightened up when herb came over because he thought that her was

53
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.450
going to stop the fight cause he felt Robbie go limp.

54
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.000
You don't lighten up because you think someone's going to stop a fight.

55
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.520
You don't,
you don't,
you don't lie.

56
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:21.820
You know because you think you squeeze harder because you want to make him stop

57
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:22.330
the fight.

58
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.890
I see a point and also there is a difference between squeezing someone out and

59
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:28.420
beaten on them when the is coming,

60
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:32.890
if the referee comes and you stop punching because guys out.
Yeah that's one.

61
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.240
That's one thing but you don't,

62
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.990
you have them in a bolt ear here in survival mode.

63
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.200
You can't like really?
You are in survival mode.
That's that time.

64
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.610
But boltok chokes are legit,
man.
I mean,
they really do work.

65
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.130
Yeah,
I'm not gonna.
I'm not gonna,
you know.
Listen,

66
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:50.670
I'm not going to say titch lost the title.
Yeah.
Lips.

67
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.470
I'm not going to suit and caught him in a bulldog choke.
Remember that?
Yeah.

68
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:55.660
I'm not going to say that.
Don't work.
I'm not going to say that.

69
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.940
I'm not going to do you know,
he could have been out.
He could have Naaman out,

70
00:03:57.941 --> 00:04:02.830
but the only way to to put that alter rez is to run it back.

71
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.330
But what,
what kind of sucks is when you're like,
no,
I pass.
I,
I mean I,
my pass.

72
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.930
What?
Do what?
Come on Bro.
Relax.

73
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.020
He said he didn't want to fight them in the first place.
Well,
no,
Shit.
Yeah,

74
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.030
we'll Robbie looks sensational.
Robbie looks like a fucking Saturday.

75
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.550
We're going to watch it right now.
Here we go.
We're going to watch this shit.
Ben,

76
00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:24.910
look at the body on
you laughing.

77
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.840
[inaudible]
study.

78
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.640
That's the ideal combat sports body like it did,

79
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.190
but it is amazing that he's able to get ahold of Robbie.
I was stunned.
No,

80
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.140
I knew he was going to get a hold of rob and I talk,

81
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.040
but right away this sat out was crazy.
Boom.
Not eat that.
Eat that.

82
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.780
Eat that.
These are big shots.
Ah,
go to sleep.
Go to sleep,
go to sleep.

83
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:54.580
I'm out.
Oh to see you still there ma'am?
No evidence that he's out.

84
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.280
Nobody has no,
no,
I don't think so.

85
00:04:57.281 --> 00:05:00.010
I think he's eating the shot and then he's got the clinch.

86
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.840
I don't think he was ever out.
No,
they,
there were certain moments he was,
he was,

87
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.490
well,
he definitely ate some big shots,

88
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:09.760
but I don't think there's any evidence at all that indicates to me that he was

89
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:12.880
out.
This is the thing,
like,
ban is tough as shit though.

90
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.200
Like I give credit where credit was gay as tough as hell.
Man.
He's tough as hell.

91
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.590
And right now he's just drunk driving right now.
He's drunk driving.

92
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:24.320
He's a truck drive.
These are way to put it,
bro.
He's just driving right.

93
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.280
I look at this drunk driving but now Ravi books free.

94
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.180
See I forget the actual strip scramble that led to the bulldog choke.
Yeah.

95
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.770
It happens from when Robbie tries to get up cause he does get the take down.

96
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.980
Oh look he's drunk driving.
Oh my God man.
A lot of blood.

97
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.170
You caught them on the nasty lefthand there.
Yeah,

98
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:46.171
like ramen just looking for looking for a bomb and Ben is just moving forward

99
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:50.200
like a Zombie.
He still grabs a hold of them.
It's interesting.

100
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.780
Interesting that he was able to grab a hold of him because I would've thought

101
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:54.930
that Robert would have avoided that shit at all costs.

102
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.510
But that's why he's able to grab a hold of someone when someone is so you know,

103
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:02.440
worried about you grabbing them and then they,

104
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.020
it's kind of shuts them down in a little bit.
It needs the body there by Robbie.

105
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.943
Yeah.

106
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.560
I think you did in the tire and fight those fucking body shots.
Good Lord.

107
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.630
I was trying to take that home.
You hit him with so many right.
Hands to the body.

108
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.360
So here we see Ben clench.
Yeah,
he's doing a good job here.
He's trying to,

109
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:27.130
he's trying to come to it.
He's trying to,
you know,
recover,
doing a good job,

110
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.190
keeping the close.
Now you can't get really get hit with big shots,
you know?

111
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:34.130
And he does get the take down at some point.
Yeah.

112
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:38.090
I do not remember how it happened or what was it?
Here it is.
Here it is.

113
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.230
He reaches down.

114
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.500
So he's got them in the clinch here.
He's got the under hook and the left side

115
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.120
and so some,
okay.
Grabs the leg.
I do.
Is this interesting?

116
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:54.080
I don't remember this.

117
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.880
All I remember is the open exchange and then the final exchange.
Yeah,

118
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.140
two,
two on one.
Right now he's trying to go to on one.
Yes.
Good job.

119
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.800
So he's got the single single Robbie doing a good job.

120
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.240
Now he's going to dance class together.

121
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.880
It's amazing to me how good of a wrestle here is.

122
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.390
I'm going to be honest with you that,

123
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.010
but it's just funky because it's like not really muscles there.
Yeah.

124
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.690
It's just like Gumby,
but you know,
it's not going anywhere,
but it's tricky.

125
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.380
Yeah.
Very tricky.
Yeah,
very,
very sneaky.
Very tricky.

126
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:28.670
Them down and now Robbie's on his back is since,
yeah,

127
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:31.340
sort of inside control.
Okay,
so now he's got an arm.
Yeah.

128
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:35.060
Typical Robbie [inaudible].
Robbie's just chilling.
Boom.
Circles.
Owl.

129
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.920
He's got the headlock.
Okay,
now he's got the headlock and now watch that.
Right.

130
00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:44.560
See this position,
this position.
She Robbie puts it down.
Yeah,
it's moving.
Yeah.

131
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.770
Yeah.
Nope.
Yep.
See changed my mind again.
Yeah,
like see that's,

132
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.320
that's what's tricky about that since that's what's tricky about that.

133
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.660
I changed my mind again.
I don't think he was out.
No.
See,

134
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.650
because you first get up to just to the arm going limp because the thing about

135
00:07:57.651 --> 00:08:00.170
the arm going limp is the way it went.
Limp looked.

136
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.550
It really looked like he was out.
Okay.
But this is,

137
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.730
this is what I'm saying right here is initially in the situation.
Wait,

138
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.910
wait till he turns.
Wait till he turns when,
right.
Right.

139
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.290
Wait to pull his arms out.
Boom.
Right here.
See,
this is uncomfortable.

140
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.140
This is very uncomfortable.
Yeah.

141
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.550
You're spread out here and the guy's choking on your neck.

142
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.660
You got to bring one down to relieve pressure I that one down or take this one

143
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:24.950
inside.
Yeah,
he was.

144
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.780
So Robbie did the approach right thing or the arm fell down whether he was out.

145
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:34.400
So man,
it's a tough goal man.
One more time.

146
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:37.010
Let me see that arm drops his back it up just a little bit here.

147
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.920
See the way it drops,
he'd like nobody moves.
It moves it immediately.

148
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.970
It means yet.
But it's so hard to know.
Yeah.

149
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:47.090
He might've just been dealing with the choke.
Yep.
Nope.
And that changed my mind.

150
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.660
And it's a typical Robbie man cause Bobby says,
Robby says,
man,
yeah experience.

151
00:08:51.661 --> 00:08:54.950
He said,
man,
I knew that that was uncomfortable.
So I just put my arm down,

152
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.160
chill in.
Yeah,
that's,
and that's it now.
Now I'm on your side.

153
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.910
Fuck Bro.
Like this is the wrong,
there's only one.
You have to run that back.

154
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.800
I would say,
I would say so,
but the,
how much can the UFC tell him what to do?

155
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.030
Like what could the UFC,
he said to Ben Aspirin,
listen,

156
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.090
this fight has to happen again.
That's like,
that's the sport we're in.

157
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.980
UFC,
the judge,
the jury,

158
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.260
and if they want the execution,
what did Ben,
what did,
uh,

159
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.930
Dana white say after the fight?
He said he wanted Ben to fight him again,
right?

160
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.190
Yeah.
Dana said,
we're gonna run that back.
And Ben is like,
not pass,

161
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.350
man.
I don't know.
