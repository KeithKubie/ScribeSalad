00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:09.766
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Do you know
where Chicago is?

00:00:09.886 --> 00:00:10.726
&gt;&gt;All: Yes.

00:00:11.146 --> 00:00:16.956
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yes, oh
wonderful, where is Chicago?

00:00:17.056 --> 00:00:19.316
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the past few
years, hundreds of educators

00:00:19.316 --> 00:00:22.836
from around the country, like this
group of teachers from Chicago,

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:25.906
have made the pilgrimage to
Union City in New Jersey,

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:28.836
a predominantly Hispanic
blue collar neighborhood,

00:00:29.126 --> 00:00:30.936
just across the river from Manhattan.

00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:34.076
&gt;&gt;Teacher: See, she's got a folder
on the server and she would save it.

00:00:34.116 --> 00:00:35.786
These are all the projects
that she's done.

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:38.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Visitors come
here to check out elementary

00:00:38.426 --> 00:00:41.626
and high school classes, to
talk with students and teachers.

00:00:41.886 --> 00:00:43.096
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Do you have
sound effects on yours?

00:00:43.446 --> 00:00:43.656
&gt;&gt;Student: Yes.

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:45.066
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Can I see?

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:47.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They experience
first hand this minor miracle

00:00:47.986 --> 00:00:51.776
of public education, a school system
that was on the brink of being taken

00:00:51.776 --> 00:00:53.646
over by the state, and is now one

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:56.046
of New Jersey's top
performing districts.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:58.506
&gt;&gt;Fred: The reason we got in
trouble in nineteen eighty-nine was

00:00:58.506 --> 00:01:02.216
because we had some of the
lowest test scores in the state.

00:01:02.216 --> 00:01:05.596
They began to improve
almost immediately

00:01:05.826 --> 00:01:07.186
with the changes that took place.

00:01:07.856 --> 00:01:12.426
Right now, among New Jersey's cities,
we have the highest test scores.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:15.706
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The changes that drove
the district's stunning turnaround

00:01:15.706 --> 00:01:17.976
included a focus on early literacy.

00:01:18.086 --> 00:01:19.886
&gt;&gt;Student: This story's
about a girl named Jenny--

00:01:20.076 --> 00:01:22.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A shift away from
drills to project based learning.

00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:23.966
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Or you can feed it out--

00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:26.176
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And the
infusion of technology

00:01:26.176 --> 00:01:28.066
in every facet of the curriculum.

00:01:28.746 --> 00:01:31.546
&gt;&gt;Computer: Buzz, buzz, said the fly.

00:01:32.286 --> 00:01:34.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These initiatives grew
out of the faculty's core belief

00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:37.706
that all education should
center on the child.

00:01:37.976 --> 00:01:40.996
&gt;&gt;Man: The initial plan called
for beginning with kindergarten

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:45.926
and first grade teachers, with a
recognition that they already were,

00:01:46.136 --> 00:01:49.036
by nature, child-centered
because of the age

00:01:49.156 --> 00:01:50.626
of the children they
were working with.

00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:53.246
&gt;&gt;Lorraine: We want to
do all upper case, okay.

00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:57.296
&gt;&gt;It's more student centered,
as opposed to teacher centered,

00:01:57.606 --> 00:01:59.976
so the children are pretty
much running the show.

00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:03.486
We serve as facilitators,
and help them and get them

00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:04.846
through whatever questions they have.

00:02:05.576 --> 00:02:08.256
They are also taught
to work with each other

00:02:08.676 --> 00:02:11.066
and technology is wonderful
also, 'cause we incorporate

00:02:11.136 --> 00:02:12.546
that into the curriculum.

00:02:13.106 --> 00:02:15.696
The children know so much.

00:02:15.996 --> 00:02:22.366
&gt;&gt;Computer: Frog's eyes grew
big, "Mmm, lunch," said Frog.

00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:26.696
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Like other districts,
Union City has budget constraints.

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:30.526
At Hudson Elementary, cafeteria
workers share a basement space

00:02:30.526 --> 00:02:31.756
with the reading lab cluster.

00:02:32.356 --> 00:02:35.506
But the district has received
some significant technology grants

00:02:35.506 --> 00:02:37.966
and they've learned to
maximize their resources.

00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:45.046
&gt;&gt;Fred: None of this happens without
money, but a lot of that can be

00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:49.336
and should be a restructuring
of how money is expended.

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:53.246
Sometimes you actually
can do more with less.

00:02:53.876 --> 00:02:56.116
We expend very little
money on textbooks.

00:02:56.736 --> 00:03:01.406
We spend a lot of money on children's
literature and resource materials.

00:03:01.506 --> 00:03:03.286
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Cecilia, continue reading.

00:03:04.186 --> 00:03:06.606
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Starting the techno
revolution in the early grades

00:03:06.606 --> 00:03:09.456
by spending money on
computers instead of textbooks,

00:03:09.826 --> 00:03:13.636
the district moved toward a project
based curriculum, with research done

00:03:13.636 --> 00:03:17.346
on the web, and in the process,
it created a committed band

00:03:17.346 --> 00:03:20.396
of change agents, a crop
of students who thought

00:03:20.396 --> 00:03:22.096
about education in a new way.

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:25.696
&gt;&gt;Fred: The first students coming
up didn't remember the old way.

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:28.256
So when they came into
the high school en masse,

00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:32.026
that was very helpful, because when
teachers would try to return them

00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:36.876
to roles and the old fashioned way,
the kids just didn't understand,

00:03:37.106 --> 00:03:40.006
and were extremely uncomfortable,
and began to say, "Well,

00:03:40.116 --> 00:03:42.386
we've always had more independence,
we've done it differently.

00:03:42.386 --> 00:03:44.116
We've been able to do
internet research,"

00:03:44.646 --> 00:03:47.916
and they became a force for change.

00:03:48.356 --> 00:03:51.416
&gt;&gt;Ela: How did you do this
effect around the photographs?

00:03:51.416 --> 00:03:52.846
&gt;&gt;Andrea: I feathered five percent.

00:03:53.456 --> 00:03:56.176
&gt;&gt;If you have to research something,
instead of spending numerous hours

00:03:56.176 --> 00:03:57.796
in the library and going
through encyclopedias,

00:03:57.926 --> 00:04:01.266
you can just research something
online, and it's more interactive.

00:04:01.336 --> 00:04:03.236
All of our classes use technology,

00:04:03.236 --> 00:04:05.766
no matter whether it's
science, gym, math.

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:08.456
We all use technology
somehow, it's all incorporated,

00:04:08.806 --> 00:04:11.026
and it helps us learn,
'cause it makes it easier.

00:04:11.026 --> 00:04:13.976
&gt;&gt;Ela: Did you try testing
this in IE to see how it looks?

00:04:14.786 --> 00:04:16.386
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Even though
they had participated

00:04:16.386 --> 00:04:18.406
in designing the new
web based curriculum,

00:04:18.706 --> 00:04:22.306
many teachers were surprised by
the impact of wired classrooms.

00:04:22.746 --> 00:04:25.406
&gt;&gt;Marjorie: I was a very
traditional teacher.

00:04:26.046 --> 00:04:28.976
I stood up in the front
of my room, at my lectern.

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:30.636
I had my prepared notes.

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:33.826
I knew what I wanted them to
have, and I gave it to them.

00:04:33.896 --> 00:04:37.566
The internet just broke down
the walls of my classroom.

00:04:37.566 --> 00:04:40.206
We could go anywhere, we
could look up anything.

00:04:40.686 --> 00:04:44.336
It was no longer a, "That's a
good question, I'll come back

00:04:44.336 --> 00:04:45.406
with the answer tomorrow."

00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:46.546
Well, why tomorrow?

00:04:46.546 --> 00:04:48.076
We'll get the answer right now.

00:04:48.076 --> 00:04:50.136
&gt;&gt;Ela: What you're
creating is a movie.

00:04:50.136 --> 00:04:50.346
&gt;&gt;Student: Right.

00:04:50.346 --> 00:04:52.396
&gt;&gt;Ela: But you could also
create it in a QuickTime format.

00:04:52.496 --> 00:04:57.466
&gt;&gt;When I first began, I used the
old method of blackboard and chalk,

00:04:57.926 --> 00:05:02.696
which I'm allergic to anyway,
and as the years evolved,

00:05:02.696 --> 00:05:04.376
we moved more into technology

00:05:04.376 --> 00:05:09.256
and really facilitate not only my
teaching, but my record keeping

00:05:09.256 --> 00:05:13.326
and contacting parents and keeping
abreast with the students' work,

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:18.376
and more online and more on
task, and more interactivity

00:05:18.466 --> 00:05:22.026
between the students, the
home and me, the teacher.

00:05:22.126 --> 00:05:25.646
&gt;&gt;Student: I need a
flat head, small one.

00:05:25.776 --> 00:05:26.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Emerson High School,

00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:30.496
the student tech team teaches
teachers how to use software,

00:05:30.776 --> 00:05:32.736
and repairs the school's hardware.

00:05:32.736 --> 00:05:36.256
&gt;&gt;Student: That's in, and I
just put the keyboard back.

00:05:36.256 --> 00:05:39.016
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Another group of students
is building websites to be used

00:05:39.016 --> 00:05:41.746
by teachers in presenting
various class subjects.

00:05:41.996 --> 00:05:44.446
&gt;&gt;Student: We're each working
on like individual websites

00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:47.286
that will tie with other classes.

00:05:48.046 --> 00:05:51.716
We're doing it with our
history class and I'm doing it,

00:05:51.796 --> 00:05:52.836
my website's over there,

00:05:52.836 --> 00:05:55.526
on the Industrial Revolution,
and he's doing it on--

00:05:55.526 --> 00:05:55.996
&gt;&gt;Another world.

00:05:57.006 --> 00:05:58.146
&gt;&gt;Discovery of the New World.

00:05:58.826 --> 00:06:00.106
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While another
group is working

00:06:00.106 --> 00:06:03.236
on a national project exploring
technologies of the future.

00:06:03.466 --> 00:06:08.156
&gt;&gt;Ela: They're researching, how
would internet two be utilized?

00:06:08.156 --> 00:06:10.356
How would virtual reality
be utilized?

00:06:10.826 --> 00:06:13.016
And so his graphic is all original.

00:06:13.326 --> 00:06:14.926
It's tremendous skills.

00:06:14.926 --> 00:06:20.216
As a matter of fact, this is his free
time, and he chooses to come here,

00:06:20.986 --> 00:06:23.996
instead of eating or
doing something else.

00:06:24.466 --> 00:06:26.336
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A program
that provided laptops

00:06:26.336 --> 00:06:29.896
for seventh graders had a profound
impact not only on students,

00:06:29.926 --> 00:06:31.306
but on their families as well.

00:06:31.306 --> 00:06:35.206
Ana Calles still remembers the
day her son brought the first

00:06:35.206 --> 00:06:36.056
computer home.

00:06:36.636 --> 00:06:38.196
&gt;&gt;Ana: I never touch
a computer before.

00:06:39.216 --> 00:06:43.686
You know, for me, that was amazing
to see how the computer work.

00:06:44.336 --> 00:06:47.246
And my children, they were so happy.

00:06:47.246 --> 00:06:52.276
Even my husband-- in reality,
there was a big party at home,

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:58.406
and from that day,
Juan started changing.

00:06:58.896 --> 00:07:01.086
&gt;&gt;Juan: I was more of
a mediocre student,

00:07:01.086 --> 00:07:04.056
a little bit apathetic
towards my studies.

00:07:04.496 --> 00:07:09.136
But once the computer was implemented
in the curriculum and in my house,

00:07:09.586 --> 00:07:13.376
I discovered that, you know this
is a tool for me to use in order

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:17.336
to get me interested into my
studies, and I did just that.

00:07:18.186 --> 00:07:21.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Today, Mrs. Calles
is enrolled in a BA program

00:07:21.006 --> 00:07:24.086
at Montclair University,
while Juan is a senior

00:07:24.086 --> 00:07:26.306
at the New Jersey Institute
of Technology.

00:07:26.906 --> 00:07:31.186
&gt;&gt;Juan: Last year, I worked at IBM
and I worked in the VLSI department,

00:07:31.186 --> 00:07:33.106
the very large scale
integration department.

00:07:33.816 --> 00:07:38.686
And I would like to think that
the curriculum at Union CD served

00:07:38.686 --> 00:07:41.476
as a catalyst for me to
make the decision to go

00:07:41.476 --> 00:07:43.136
into the field of technology.

00:07:43.406 --> 00:07:47.946
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Ah, neat, it seems like
something right off of a web page.

00:07:47.946 --> 00:07:49.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the
end of their visit,

00:07:49.956 --> 00:07:52.556
the teachers from Chicago
got a chance to see the kind

00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:54.906
of work Union City High
School students produce.

00:07:55.566 --> 00:08:00.566
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Now you also set
up the speed that it's moving.

00:08:00.566 --> 00:08:02.126
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The timing
that it's refreshing.

00:08:02.126 --> 00:08:03.096
&gt;&gt;Student: The timing, yeah, yeah.

00:08:03.096 --> 00:08:03.756
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This is great.

00:08:03.756 --> 00:08:06.456
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And the experience
confirmed their impressions

00:08:06.456 --> 00:08:08.206
about this extraordinary district.

00:08:08.436 --> 00:08:09.686
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And you
came up with these?

00:08:09.806 --> 00:08:12.406
&gt;&gt;Student: From what I
discussed in my English class

00:08:12.406 --> 00:08:15.626
and what I can write with my--

00:08:16.046 --> 00:08:20.666
&gt;&gt;Student: I can say that when I came
as a freshman, I was all shy and,

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.436
you know, I guess that
was my personality.

00:08:22.566 --> 00:08:25.796
But once you become a part of
something, and then, you know,

00:08:25.846 --> 00:08:28.646
you're trusted with a project or
something, then you start to open up,

00:08:28.646 --> 00:08:30.836
and then all of a sudden,
you blossom,

00:08:30.836 --> 00:08:33.476
and then you could be a team leader.

00:08:33.476 --> 00:08:35.976
And that's what's good
about all these programs.

00:08:36.506 --> 00:08:39.536
&gt;&gt;Kareem: I want to take back
their enthusiasm for learning.

00:08:39.866 --> 00:08:42.406
I've asked many of the
students, how do they feel

00:08:42.406 --> 00:08:43.626
when they come to school?

00:08:43.626 --> 00:08:46.386
When they're away from school, how
do they feel about the projects

00:08:46.386 --> 00:08:48.096
or the assignments that
they're working on?

00:08:48.466 --> 00:08:50.356
And they feel wonderful about it.

00:08:50.356 --> 00:08:54.496
They have a very positive attitude
towards it, and these children feel

00:08:54.496 --> 00:08:57.706
that this is something that's very
much a part of their character,

00:08:57.706 --> 00:08:59.276
and this has been instilled in them

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:01.856
at a very early age,
in elementary schools.

00:09:01.856 --> 00:09:05.016
And they really believe in
what they're being taught,

00:09:05.016 --> 00:09:06.756
and the freedoms that
they've been given,

00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:11.136
and I applaud that tremendously,
and I feel very proud of them.

00:09:11.406 --> 00:09:14.496
&gt;&gt;Student: I know something
about it, 'cause I went there

00:09:14.496 --> 00:09:18.416
and I saw how they treat everything,
but I think I need some more--

00:09:18.416 --> 00:09:20.146
a little bit more to learn.

00:09:20.146 --> 00:09:21.996
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It's great,
I'm impressed, man.

00:09:21.996 --> 00:09:22.926
This is really nice.

00:09:24.796 --> 00:09:27.756
