00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.560
Hey guys,

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.200
so I haven't done a lot of collaborations

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.020
in my whole Youtube career,

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.000
so today is a very exciting day!

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.820
Ahh!

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.220
If you remember, a while ago I asked you

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.640
to send me an insult, a feeling, an adjective

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.360
et cetera,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.000
so that we could make this collaboration happen.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.360
So Skype actually brought this all together,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.580
thank you Skype.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.420
Brizzy voices; does the VOs,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.020
BananaJamana does the animation,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.440
I do the narration, and you provided the words

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.800
So thank you, thank you

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.220
Now, enjoy

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.180
this harrowing tale of middle school torment.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.080
When I was in middle school, I lived in constant fear

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.860
of a girl named *gunshot*

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.900
one standout moment of torment was when

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.460
she made fun of me for singing out loud in class.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.120
*scoffs*

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.600
A moment that made me scared to sing in public

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.060
for years to come.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.840
Let me just say that calling her a bully

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.020
would be the understatement of the century.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.200
To me, she seemed more like the spawn of zombie cats.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.580
*Zombie cat noises*

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.840
You know, she was little in size,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.740
but she was always pushing me around

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.020
with her superhuman strength,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.120
calling me an island toad.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.020
It got to the point where, rather than

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.960
risk bumping into her and her little gang, that would

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.400
hang out near the trash bin everyone smokes at,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.320
I would eat my lunch in the bathroom

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.000
and stay there 'til class.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.120
Fear of her pretty much ruled my world

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.540
when I was in middle school.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.300
But all that changed one day.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.920
I was hiding behind corn

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.540
while avoiding her and her friends

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.960
There was something different about her though.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.340
She didn't look as scary and as confident

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.980
and evil as she usually did.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.920
In fact, she kind of looked a little...scared, herself?

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.980
And when she got into the DeLorean her father was

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.200
driving, it all started making sense.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.920
"Hey, how was school?" said her dad.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.380
- "It was okay."

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.440
- "Did you learn anything? Anything at all?"

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.340
- "Uh, I mean, yeah..."

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.680
- "Oh what, like how smart you aren't?"

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.000
I couldn't believe it.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.760
I felt both smug and sad for her at the same time.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.360
My family was amazing, interesting, supportive.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.220
I never realised that a parent

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.700
could be so cruel to their own kid.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.840
After that I paid no attention to Angela's insults.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.020
Whenever she called me an incompetent buffoon,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.300
I would just smile at her and quietly send her love.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.120
'Cause I knew she wasn't really being mean to me,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.500
she was just following her father's unfortunate example,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.200
and taking back some of the power

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.200
he took from her on a daily basis.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.940
So wherever you are, I hope that you're happy,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.080
and I don't mean that sarcastically either;

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.180
I really, truly, hope that you are happy,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.180
and that you proved your dad wrong.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.260
Just like I proved you wrong.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
Oh yeah, 'cause I've been taking singing lessons,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.120
and I discovered that my voice is actually pretty great.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.940
Boom!

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.940
Don't forget to check out Brizzy's and Jamie's videos

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.460
and thanks again Skype for introducing me

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.460
to these super talented, awesome women.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.240
I didn't know they existed!

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.240
*whispers* And now they're my friends.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.240
Now they're my friends...

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.420
I'm Anna Akana, but you're not Gotham.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.820
Your video didn't freeze.
