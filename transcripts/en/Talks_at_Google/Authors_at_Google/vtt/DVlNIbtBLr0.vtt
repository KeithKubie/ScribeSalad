[MUSICAL SOUND EFFECT]

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.630
SPEAKER 1: All right,
let's get started.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.260
So today we're really excited
to welcome Shalane Flanagan

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.435
and Elyse Kopecky.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.690
From being college
roommates at Chapel Hill,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.650
they both went on to some
very fascinating careers.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.670
Shalane has set a lot
of records for running.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.797
She has run in four
Olympic Games now,

00:00:21.797 --> 00:00:23.130
winning the bronze medal in one.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.900
And just a few weeks
ago, she won sixth,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.590
leading the American team.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.310
She holds a record for the
3,000-meter and 5,000-meter

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.470
indoors and for 10K
and 15K road races.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.940
It's fascinating
to me, personally,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.106
how long she's been able
to stay on top of her game,

00:00:36.106 --> 00:00:39.630
since so many athletes peak
or only do a single Olympics.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.690
Elyse works for Nike Running
doing digital marketing

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.670
after she graduated, and
then did a career change

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.666
and went to culinary
school in New York City.

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.040
So when we look
at this cookbook,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.960
we know that the authors have
serious chops, both in knowing

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.252
running and in knowing cooking.

00:00:54.252 --> 00:00:56.710
So it's no wonder it made "The
New York Times'" best seller

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.600
list.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.030
Please welcome
Shalane and Elyse.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.418
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:04.115 --> 00:01:05.740
ELYSE KOPECKY: Thank
you so much, Pete,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.030
for having us here at Google.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.430
It's such an honor to be here.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.650
For me, I always admired
Google as a company.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.119
I worked in digital marketing
at Nike for almost 10 years.

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.660
And if I hadn't been
working at Nike,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.826
I probably would have wanted
to come work at Google.

00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:22.780
So it's awesome to be here and
see what an amazing campus you

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.950
guys have.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.290
And today, we've been
traveling all over

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.630
as part of our book tour.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.450
We've had a chance to go to
some awesome running cities

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.380
and speak to runners and
athletes of all levels.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.020
And for us, this is
an opportunity for us

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.930
to spread such an important
message to athletes.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.660
And what we're teaching people
is there is more to healthy

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.845
eating than just kale juice.

00:01:44.845 --> 00:01:46.796
Health food is a juicy burger.

00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:49.049
We want to teach people
that healthy food doesn't

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.215
have to be bland and boring.

00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:53.210
It can be really nourishing
and really flavorful,

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.970
and keep you satisfied so you're
not reaching for junk food.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.462
So I'm going to dive into that.

00:01:57.462 --> 00:01:58.920
But first, I know
you guys probably

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.520
want to hear some stories
from Shalane, since she's just

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.992
returned from an
incredible race in Rio.

00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:05.950
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.130
So about a couple weeks ago, I
ran a little race down in Rio.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.980
And it was an
incredible experience.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.770
It was my fourth, but I
never take it for granted,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.080
getting to wear USA
across my chest.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.780
There's so much pride
and honor behind that.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.530
And the race itself--
I had high expectations

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.660
hoping to land on the podium
and wear a nice, little necklace

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.200
around my neck after the
race, but that didn't happen.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.250
I placed sixth.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.380
But we had the highest finish
for an American team ever.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.876
We won sixth, seventh,
and ninth, which was huge.

00:02:38.876 --> 00:02:41.930
We have definitely
a tough challenge,

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.330
where the East Africans seem
to dominate the distances,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.104
so it was quite an
accomplishment for us.

00:02:47.104 --> 00:02:49.540
But I did have to
overcome a lot of fear,

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.655
actually, for this last race.

00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:55.530
My Olympic trials to qualify
for the marathon was in LA.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.000
And if any of you have
run in the heat before,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.450
the heat can be pretty
taxing and arduous.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.390
And so I'd never
run a heat marathon,

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.780
except for in LA at
the Olympic trials.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.244
And that's, obviously,
kind of a tough race

00:03:11.244 --> 00:03:13.160
because you're trying
to make the Olympic team

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.880
and you have to
finish top three.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.360
And I ended up having
a really hard race.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.450
And the final three
miles, I barely finished,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.540
but I hung on for third.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.590
And so I created a lot of fear.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.420
First time I'd ever had to
receive an IV after the race.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.310
And it kind of scarred me, that
experience running in such a

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.922
deprived dehydration state.

00:03:32.922 --> 00:03:35.130
And you think at this level,
I would know everything,

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.767
but clearly I don't.

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:39.350
So I had a lot of
fear going into Rio.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.290
Because again, it was going
to be a hot and humid race.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.070
So I had to overcome a lot
of fear going into that.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.430
I reached out to a lot of
resources to overcome that fear

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.535
and got a hydration plan.

00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:56.200
I relied on my best friend
to help me come up with that.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.930
And then, a lot of research.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.470
I went to Olympic
Training Center

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.520
and did a hydration analysis.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.615
And apparently, they classify
me as an aggressive sweater.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.650
So I had to probably
drink three times more

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.620
than the rest of the
athletes out there,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.868
but I was able to do that and
had a successful marathon.

00:04:17.868 --> 00:04:21.070
But beyond that,
I talk about fear.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.910
Elyse and I completely made
career changes a little bit

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.410
and collaborated on
this beautiful cookbook.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.210
And three years ago,
that idea started just

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.030
at my kitchen table while we
were eating a delicious meal.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.060
And Elyse had made
some career changes,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.770
and I had made the goal to
make a fourth Olympic team.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.099
And we came up,
basically over this meal,

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:45.390
the idea of writing a cookbook.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.283
And sharing the
knowledge that she gained

00:04:47.283 --> 00:04:51.050
and how I felt kind of
deprived and just a burden

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.940
with my own diet as an athlete.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.590
And I wanted to make sure
that I was fueling properly.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.580
So that's how it began.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.960
And Elyse will share a
little bit more of the story.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.230
ELYSE KOPECKY: Great.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.000
So thanks.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.950
So it's been such an honor
for me to write this cookbook.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.180
We've known each
other for 16 years,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.860
so to get to write a cookbook
together has been a lot of fun.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.080
We were college
roommates and teammates,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.140
and then we both had
the chance to move west

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.840
after graduating from UNC.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.950
And then, working for Nike
in different capacities.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.120
I worked in a cubicle while
Shalane was down below

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.519
on the fields running laps.

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:26.060
And I always would
look out my window

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.320
and wish I was down
there on the field, too.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.835
And anyways, the
cookbook came to be.

00:05:31.835 --> 00:05:33.790
We hadn't seen each
other in a couple years.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.860
And I had the chance
during my career

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.230
in marketing to work abroad.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.240
I worked in Geneva, Switzerland,
for a not-to-be-named video

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.529
game company.

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:47.320
And during that time,
I got really inspired

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.270
by the food culture
in Switzerland.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.360
My diet changed drastically
when we moved over there from--

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.630
and I had suffered in college.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.780
I suffered from a
lot of injuries.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.196
And I thought I
was healthy eater.

00:05:57.196 --> 00:05:58.900
And what I had been
eating in college

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.780
that led to stress
fractures and led

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.546
to me suffering from
athletic amenorrhea,

00:06:03.546 --> 00:06:05.462
it went away as soon as
I moved to Switzerland

00:06:05.462 --> 00:06:06.970
and changed my diet.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.329
My diet changed from eating
white meat chicken breast

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:10.370
to whole roasted chicken.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.510
And from veggie burgers
to grass-fed ground beef.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.650
And from processed, fake
butter spreads to real butter.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.450
And all these
decadent foods that we

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.240
had learned to label in
our country as unhealthy

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.980
actually made me healthier,
and happier, and stronger

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.450
than ever before.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.370
And so I had this
realization that I

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.980
had been depriving myself
of these amazing foods that

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.870
not only tasted great, but were
also helping my body absorb

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.100
vitamins and nutrients
so much better than what

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.920
I had been eating running
at a high level in college.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.160
And I decided that I wanted
to be able to inspire

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.530
other athletes of all levels.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.940
And so we moved
back to the US and I

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.810
went to study culinary nutrition
at a top school in New York

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.680
City.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.510
And after that, wasn't really
sure what I was going to do

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.350
and how I would get my
message out to athletes.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.550
But we had the
chance to have dinner

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.960
together and be reunited.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.400
We hadn't seen each other.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.200
So that night, we were
talking and sharing stories

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.300
from college and catching
up on good times.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.160
But soon our conversation
got more serious

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.640
and we talked about how
many athletes we had seen

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.340
suffer at every level, from
our own teammates in college

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.720
to a lot of young
female athletes

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.980
suffering due to eating
mostly processed foods diets,

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.550
and counting
calories, and feeling

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.770
like they had to follow a
prescription way of eating.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.115
And seeing food just as
fuel instead of seeing it

00:07:35.115 --> 00:07:37.420
as indulgent nourishment.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.260
And so that night I said to
Shalane-- Shalane told me

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.970
how she always felt while she
was marathon training, drained

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:45.890
and hangry.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.139
And she just felt
depleted all the time.

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:50.555
And I told her that night,
maybe you just need more butter

00:07:50.555 --> 00:07:51.600
in your life, too.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.210
So we quickly started
revamping her diet.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.160
And we thought, maybe we should
write a cookbook together

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.170
some day so we can
get this message out

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:05.134
to thousands of runners across
the country and athletes.

00:08:05.134 --> 00:08:08.620
And I never actually thought
we would get our courage up

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.840
to write the book,
but a whole year

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.590
went by with a lot of text
messages back and forth,

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.470
and more dinners together.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.635
And finally-- it
took my daughter

00:08:18.635 --> 00:08:21.840
being born for me to realize,
like this is what I need to do.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.280
And I quit all my other projects
to write our book proposal

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.420
full time and just went for it.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:33.230
And I tried to channel Shalane's
energy and competitive edge

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.179
as much as possible.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.970
And I poured everything
into our book proposal.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.730
We sent it out not knowing
if anyone would ever

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.940
want to publish our book.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.419
We said, well, if nobody
wants to publish it,

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.100
we'll publish it ourselves.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.010
So we sent it out to publishers
and we ended up with eight bids

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:49.700
for our book.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.810
So we got to pick
our first choice

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.122
publisher, which was Rodale.

00:08:54.122 --> 00:08:57.870
And they've done an amazing job
of making the beautiful book

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.910
that we had envisioned.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:03.370
And sticking to our nutrition
philosophy, which is-- we

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.670
came to call it
indulgent nourishment.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.460
And indulgent
nourishment, we wanted

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.060
to prove to people that
healthy food can be cool.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.000
It doesn't have to be bland.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.040
And you can eat
these amazing foods

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.330
and use local,
seasonal ingredients,

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.675
and top it with
olive oil and olive

00:09:21.675 --> 00:09:23.950
oil-based dressing
or buttery sauce.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.380
And by eating this way,
eating these real foods

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.050
and fueling yourself, you
don't have the cravings

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.490
anymore for the junk, and the
bars, and the packaged foods.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.830
So we are proud to have the
first cookbook for runners

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.030
that doesn't have calorie
counts or nutrition facts.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.770
And instead, we're
teaching people

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.205
to get back in
tune with listening

00:09:43.205 --> 00:09:45.150
to their body's needs.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.672
And we've been beyond excited
by the amount of media.

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:51.713
The media has been really
excited about our book.

00:09:51.713 --> 00:09:54.290
It's appeared in "Runner's
World" and "Women's Running"

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.660
magazine and "Outside"
magazine and "Food &amp; Wine."

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.660
And we were just a couple
weeks ago in New York City,

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.530
to be on "Good Morning America."

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.225
And best of all, like we
had this really high goal

00:10:05.225 --> 00:10:07.570
that people told us we
would never achieve,

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.930
which was to make the "New
York Times Bestseller" list.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.830
SHALANE FLANAGAN: We didn't
even know how that happened,

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:12.790
or [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:13.660
We're like, that's
the best, right?

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.076
We're going to
shoot for the best.

00:10:15.076 --> 00:10:15.976
ELYSE KOPECKY: Yeah.

00:10:15.976 --> 00:10:19.902
So Shalane's competitive, and
I channel her competitiveness.

00:10:19.902 --> 00:10:21.772
SHALANE FLANAGAN:
Whatever it is that we do.

00:10:21.772 --> 00:10:23.980
ELYSE KOPECKY: So we really
poured our heart and soul

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.170
into this book.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:31.480
And we want not only to inspire
people to get into the kitchen,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.090
but to inspire people
to seek out the best

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.250
ingredients for their body.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.830
To buy local, seasonal food.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.560
It's not only better for the
planet and better for you.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.862
It just is more
nutrient-dense, so it

00:10:42.862 --> 00:10:45.320
will leave you feeling
satisfied and more energized,

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.820
and not reaching for
a sugar fix and not

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.175
reaching for a coffee fix all
day, which I've noticed you

00:10:51.175 --> 00:10:52.883
guys have opportunities
for coffee fixes.

00:10:52.883 --> 00:10:56.830
Not that coffee's bad.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:03.780
And as part of that, we tried
to show people and prove

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.540
that dieting doesn't work.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.945
A lot of people in our
country are yo-yo dieting.

00:11:09.945 --> 00:11:12.200
And every year, it's a
different kind of diet.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.520
Whether that's a paleo
diet, or a low-fat diet,

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.610
or juicing, or any of
these extreme diets.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.390
And the science is there now
and we go into it in the book,

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.400
but diets just-- they're no fun.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.820
They cause your body to
have metabolism swings.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.677
And in the end, a lot of
people try these diets

00:11:30.677 --> 00:11:31.510
and they don't work.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.801
And they end up gaining weight.

00:11:32.801 --> 00:11:35.650
And instead when you
begin to eat real food

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.540
and take the time to get
in the kitchen and cook,

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.030
you'll feel so much
better than ever before.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.230
And one of the things
we tell that's kind

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:48.030
of our most important message
is the single greatest thing

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:52.350
you can do as an athlete
to improve your performance

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.740
and your health and happiness
is to learn to cook.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.449
And Pete was just
showing us how you guys

00:11:57.449 --> 00:11:59.448
have a kitchen here where
you can learn to cook,

00:11:59.448 --> 00:12:00.210
which is amazing.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.680
So I highly recommend
that you take advantage

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.280
of the cooking classes here.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.920
People often tell us, I
don't have time to cook.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.100
I have a full-time job and
I'm training and I have kids.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.990
And if Shalane can
go in the kitchen

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.530
and cook after a 28-mile
training run at high altitude,

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.120
and make homemade
sauce and homemade

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.260
meatballs and a
hearty grain salad,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.075
then I think the
rest of us can too.

00:12:24.075 --> 00:12:26.450
A lot of people think, well,
she must have a private chef

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.491
cooking all of her meals.

00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:29.290
SHALANE FLANAGAN: I wish.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.870
I'm going to hire you.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.470
ELYSE KOPECKY: In fact, she's
not only cooking for herself,

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:35.990
but often going
to training camps

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.640
and cooking for all
of her teammates, too.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.540
So it's pretty
impressive to see that.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.930
And I'll let her talk about
some of her favorite recipes

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.230
in the book here in a second.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:50.810
But the other thing I wanted
to share about the good fats.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.550
So all of our recipes
are full of flavor.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.450
And the reason
they're so flavorful

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.920
is because they're so rich
in good, healthy fats.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.209
And there's been kind of
ingrained in our culture

00:13:01.209 --> 00:13:03.750
over the years, since when we
were in high school and college

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.280
that fat is bad for you.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.440
And fat causes heart conditions.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.900
And fat causes weight gain.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.340
When in fact, the
opposite is true.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.360
Fat prevents weight gain.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.940
Fat helps regulate
your metabolism.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.390
It helps you feel energized.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:19.640
It's a great source of energy.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.320
Runners get so focused on
protein, protein, protein,

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.500
and carbo loading.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.130
And really, fat is a
great source of energy.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:31.210
It helps when you're eating a
salad or veggies, or something

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.290
hearty and healthy and
you put fat on top of it,

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.710
it helps your body absorb all
the vitamins and nutrients

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:36.290
better.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:40.050
Many vitamins are fat-soluble,
so you can't get the most out

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.010
of the foods you're
eating without having

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.210
the fat in your diet.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.070
And especially for
Google employees,

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.890
fat is so important
for brain health.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.690
So it keeps you smarter.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.590
It prevents depression.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.270
So anyone who
works here probably

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:57.239
had a mom that was cooking
good meals with healthy fats

00:13:57.239 --> 00:13:59.155
as a kid because that's
how you guys got here.

00:13:59.155 --> 00:14:01.300
It was good for
your brain health.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.970
I have a toddler
who's two years old,

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:08.820
and she eats this
incredible way of eating.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.570
I know it's really good
for her brain development.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.220
So especially for kids, where
their brains are developing,

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.300
they need the good
fats in their diet.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.010
We talk about butter
because we love butter.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:20.840
But it's not just butter.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.980
You have a range of fats.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.790
You have coconut
oil, and olive oil,

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:28.330
and even fat from really
good quality meat sources.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.340
So grass-fed ground
beef and eggs.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.670
And for us, we prefer dark meat
chicken over white meat chicken

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.660
because it's got more of the
good, nourishing fats in there.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.720
And also, more
vitamins and minerals.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.090
So there's lots of sources
of great, healthy fats.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.830
The ones you want to
avoid are the cheap oils

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.210
that are in packaged foods.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.395
And there is a lot of
packaged foods out there.

00:14:49.395 --> 00:14:50.770
When I say packaged
foods, people

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.770
think of chips and cookies,
but there's so much more.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:57.310
It's also the dressings, and the
sauces, and all the quick fixes

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:59.020
that we have in
our grocery store

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.520
to get dinner on
the table faster.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.540
But in our book,
we teach people how

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.580
to make dressings from
scratch, and sauces, and pesto,

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.501
and hummus.

00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:08.500
And when you're making
these foods from scratch,

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.320
you're able to use
really good oils.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.830
Whereas, if you're buying hummus
in the grocery store, which

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.840
sounds like healthy
food, it's often

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.090
made with cheap oils
and preservatives, which

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.090
aren't great for your body.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.550
So we really want to inspire
people to get in the kitchen,

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:25.310
and put on an apron, and
have fun with cooking.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.087
Make it an activity you
do on Sunday afternoon

00:15:28.087 --> 00:15:30.650
to prepare meals for
the week and to have

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.050
stuff prepared in advance.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.240
So I'm going to let Shalane
share-- talk about some

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.320
of her favorite recipes and how
these foods have helped her.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.195
SHALANE FLANAGAN: I'll
share the one favorite

00:15:39.195 --> 00:15:41.400
that's gained celebrity status.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.300
If we were to
measure our celebrity

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.140
status through Instagram at
least, one measuring tool.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.210
So these are our
superhero muffins.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.350
And as you can see,
they look delicious.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:55.502
You can make them with
chocolate chips or not.

00:15:55.502 --> 00:15:58.140
I support the chocolate chips.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.432
So these are great.

00:15:59.432 --> 00:16:01.890
Really satiating, because they
have some good butter in it.

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.920
And they also are made
with almond flour,

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.420
which is a little bit different
than your traditional flour.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.520
So they're very satiating.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.390
They stick in my stomach.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:12.930
And I feel like I don't
get hungry for hours

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:13.880
later, which is great.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.921
Because I don't want to
be running around hangry,

00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:17.535
as Elyse describes it.

00:16:17.535 --> 00:16:19.560
So I'll have these
for breakfast.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.960
I will have them as a snack.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.580
I'll have them for dessert.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.600
They're a staple.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.770
And people are cooking
these up like crazy.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.460
They're definitely different
because we're tricking people.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.820
They taste awesome, but they've
got zucchini and carrots in it,

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:33.990
too.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:37.700
These are what we classify
as a long Sunday run.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.205
"These muffins were designed
for superheroes like you.

00:16:40.205 --> 00:16:43.230
They're packed full of veggies
and sweetened with maple syrup

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.020
instead of refined sugar.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.150
In addition, almond meal
and whole grain oats

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.170
replace nutrient-stripped
white flour.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.660
These are my go-to
muffins, nourishing

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.180
and sweetly satisfying for an
easy grab and run breakfast.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.460
And do not fear the butter.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.460
Fueling up with healthy fats is
a great way to start your day.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.460
Fat helps transport
important vitamins

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.010
throughout your
hard-working body.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.450
Will help keep you
satisfied longer."

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.390
So yeah, I recommend--
these are a huge hit

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:15.890
for kids, for
husbands/wives, for parties.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:16.717
They're amazing.

00:17:16.717 --> 00:17:18.592
ELYSE KOPECKY: Do you
want to talk about some

00:17:18.592 --> 00:17:21.442
of the other foods that
you loved training for Rio?

00:17:21.442 --> 00:17:22.400
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.460
Let's see.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.484
So I pretty much
primarily-- a lot of people

00:17:26.484 --> 00:17:27.900
say, once you
create this cookbook

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.710
and you've already tested all
these recipes numerous times,

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:34.640
have eaten all of them, it
feels like 100 times each.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.870
But I generally don't
stray from the cookbook.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.270
I feel like I can
rely on this because I

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.550
know every ingredient is going
to have-- is power-packed.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.600
Everything I'm putting
in my body has a purpose.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.640
And I like knowing that.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.270
And I can control that.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.060
I always say in
athletics, you control

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.351
what you can control because
there's a lot of variables

00:17:53.351 --> 00:17:54.120
you can't control.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.120
So I try to control what
I'm putting in for fuel.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.850
I'd say another favorite food
is our high-altitude bison

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:02.350
meatballs.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.810
These are also a huge hit.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.890
I had 10 teammates go to the
Olympics this summer in Rio,

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:12.110
and I mad these up probably
once a week for them.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.620
And bison, we eat
quite a bit of bison

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.650
because it's really
rich in iron,

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.173
which is really important
for endurance athletes.

00:18:19.173 --> 00:18:20.910
Because for an
endurance athlete,

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.430
especially if I train
at high altitude,

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.015
I need the red blood
cell production.

00:18:25.015 --> 00:18:26.280
And that gives me energy.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.180
It transports the
oxygen. So there's

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.820
thought and stories behind
each one of these recipes.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.920
And on top of being healthy
for me, they're delicious.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.200
I crave them.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.700
So I think in the
past, I used to just

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.110
eat super-bland and boring.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.970
And I wasn't excited
to eat my food.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.780
And I just felt like this
burden, like I was describing.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.040
And counting calories.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.950
And worrying about getting
to this race weight,

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.700
which is optimal
for performance.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.325
And I used to stress about it.

00:18:54.325 --> 00:18:56.900
And now I feel like I can
indulge in these great foods

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.820
and not have to worry
about my race weight.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.180
I find it comes naturally
now without all the stress

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.250
of counting.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.390
I think it was actually
counterproductive.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:09.530
So I'm just hoping that
these recipes can really

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.510
enhance whatever goals
you have, athletically

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.370
or just health-wise.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.020
ELYSE KOPECKY: A lot
of people ask us--

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.700
we're going to have
some time for questions,

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.575
but I'll go ahead and
ask the question that I

00:19:20.575 --> 00:19:22.060
know we're going to get asked.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.580
Everyone asks us at every
stop, every city, well,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.980
I don't run 100 miles a week.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.210
Can I eat these foods?

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.560
And really, this is--

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.100
SHALANE FLANAGAN: So I run 120.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:32.575
ELYSE KOPECKY: Sorry.

00:19:32.575 --> 00:19:34.430
SHALANE FLANAGAN: A lot
of people are like, whoa.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:35.596
Well, I don't run that much.

00:19:35.596 --> 00:19:37.210
So do these really apply to me?

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:38.320
Can I really eat that?

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.960
And the answer is yes.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.415
ELYSE KOPECKY: This is
for anyone of any level.

00:19:42.415 --> 00:19:45.260
Whether your marathon
is a 12-hour day

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.990
at Google, or chasing after
a toddler is your running.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:49.910
My running is three
to five miles.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.090
And often with a stroller
and not every day.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.180
It really varies.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.350
And when you eat this way,
this is good food for anyone.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.940
When you eat this
way, you're just

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.890
so satisfied and so
energized that you're

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.900
going to want to get out
there and do these adventures

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.580
on the one hand.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:07.840
And then, just real food
doesn't cause weight gain.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.270
It's all the sugars
and processed foods.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.820
So if you really
make a commitment

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.219
to sourcing good
ingredients and getting

00:20:14.219 --> 00:20:16.010
in your kitchen and
cooking, then, yes, you

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.710
can eat this way, too.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:20.840
So yeah, if anyone
has questions,

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.700
we have time for answering.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.200
SPEAKER 1: So we have a mic set
up right here for questions.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.950
Please form a line and
ask your questions.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.094
AUDIENCE: I actually
have a couple questions.

00:20:35.094 --> 00:20:36.510
The most important
question for me

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.550
is, how do you source the--
what do you call it, good food?

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.840
Like for example, beef.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.900
So I have tried
different kinds of beef

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:48.000
before and there is
only one source of beef

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.060
I had that was really good.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.990
But that's from Hawaii, and
it's really hard to get to.

00:20:55.094 --> 00:20:56.510
ELYSE KOPECKY: You
guys are really

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.210
blessed with access in Seattle
to incredible ingredients.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.030
So I would really
highly recommend

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:06.110
getting to know your farmers
at your local farmers' market.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.335
And buying direct
from a farmer is

00:21:08.335 --> 00:21:10.840
going to give you the
best source of beef.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.456
When you go to
the grocery store,

00:21:12.456 --> 00:21:16.186
you have the options of organic.

00:21:16.186 --> 00:21:18.694
Some higher-end grocery stores,
like natural food grocery

00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:21.135
stores, will also have
a grass-fed option.

00:21:21.135 --> 00:21:23.679
So I always choose
the grass-fed option.

00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:25.220
Organic labeling is
a bit misleading,

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.930
because it's gotten to be so
mainstream that now you have

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.597
mass-produced organic foods.

00:21:30.597 --> 00:21:33.650
So any time that you can get
your food closer to the source.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:36.075
And in Seattle, you
have amazing access

00:21:36.075 --> 00:21:37.317
to local farmers' markets.

00:21:37.317 --> 00:21:38.150
That's the best bet.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.430
If you can, make a commitment
to go to a farmers' market

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:42.120
once a month.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.990
But even if you don't have time
to go to the farmers' market,

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:48.530
a lot of farms will
deliver direct.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.470
So even where I live
in Bend, Oregon,

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.650
there's a CSA, which is
a Community Supported

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.430
Agriculture or farm share.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:56.830
And they will deliver.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.038
I don't know if Google has
deliveries direct to here.

00:21:59.038 --> 00:22:02.505
But in Bend, you can have
produce and meat delivered

00:22:02.505 --> 00:22:05.366
direct to your office
or to your home, which

00:22:05.366 --> 00:22:07.260
is an awesome opportunity.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.940
And a lot of the food labels
are really misleading.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.469
You see grass-fed and
cage-free and all of this.

00:22:12.469 --> 00:22:14.385
But when you're buying
direct from the farmer,

00:22:14.385 --> 00:22:16.343
you don't have to stress
when you're getting it

00:22:16.343 --> 00:22:17.604
from small, local farms.

00:22:17.604 --> 00:22:19.020
They're the ones
who are committed

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.728
to taking care of
their land because they

00:22:20.728 --> 00:22:23.880
want to be able to pass their
farm down from generations.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.150
We have a great source,
a farmer we love.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.470
It's Pine Mountain
Ranch in Bend, Oregon,

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.080
just outside of where I live.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.610
And they have a website,
Pine Mountain Ranch.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:37.325
And you can order
amazing bison and yak

00:22:37.325 --> 00:22:41.664
and have it delivered-- mailed
with ice packs and [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:41.664 --> 00:22:42.580
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Yak?

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:43.080
Ew.

00:22:45.561 --> 00:22:47.810
ELYSE KOPECKY: My daughter
loves yak, my two-year-old.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.900
AUDIENCE: Did you
say Pine Mountain?

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.194
ELYSE KOPECKY: Pine
Mountain Ranch.

00:22:52.194 --> 00:22:53.688
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Washington.

00:22:53.688 --> 00:22:57.174
So they deliver to Google,
but they don't include meats.

00:22:57.174 --> 00:22:59.664
They only have
vegetables and fruits.

00:22:59.664 --> 00:23:02.244
[INAUDIBLE] good.

00:23:02.244 --> 00:23:04.160
AUDIENCE: I don't want
to just keep on asking.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.730
But I do have another question.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.760
So you mentioned
dark meat chicken.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.106
So what does that mean?

00:23:10.106 --> 00:23:11.564
I have never heard--

00:23:11.564 --> 00:23:13.510
ELYSE KOPECKY: Chicken thighs.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.730
So when I buy chicken,
I buy a whole chicken.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.850
And I get it from a
good, reputable farmer

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:20.760
or reputable grocery store.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.407
Even like Whole Foods, you
can buy the whole chicken

00:23:23.407 --> 00:23:24.460
and use every part of it.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.959
And that's the best
way to eat meat,

00:23:25.959 --> 00:23:30.300
because you get-- the dark
meat is the thigh and the leg.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.070
But also, I use every
part of the chicken.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:35.070
So we don't eat a lot of
meat, but we definitely

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.903
have meat every day.

00:23:35.903 --> 00:23:37.120
We eat it as like a side.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.000
So we have a lot of
vegetables, an then meat

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.084
is a smaller side dish.

00:23:42.084 --> 00:23:43.500
When you use every
part of it, you

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.090
can make bone broth,
which is an incredibly

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.496
mineral-rich, nourishing
tonic, which is great

00:23:49.496 --> 00:23:53.235
for fighting inflammation,
and for recovery,

00:23:53.235 --> 00:23:55.560
and for preventing-- we're
getting into flu season.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.458
So we have a recipe in
here for bone broth.

00:23:58.458 --> 00:24:01.474
And then you can make a chicken
stew, which is full of chicken

00:24:01.474 --> 00:24:04.110
and garlic and really good for
boosting your immune system.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:10.480
AUDIENCE: I also have a
question about-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:14.562
So there's meat.

00:24:14.562 --> 00:24:18.260
There's veggies, but we also
eat a lot of flour and rice.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.940
How do you source
those kind of things?

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.999
Like from Costco or
from Whole Foods?

00:24:22.999 --> 00:24:24.040
Where do you source them?

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.253
Because we need to use a lot
of them, like on regular basis.

00:24:27.253 --> 00:24:29.336
ELYSE KOPECKY: My favorite
source for whole grains

00:24:29.336 --> 00:24:30.980
is Bob's Red Mill.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.579
And you can find it
at a lot of-- even

00:24:33.579 --> 00:24:35.370
like a Safeway or
mainstream grocery store,

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:36.690
you can find Bob's Red Mill.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:40.930
They're based in Oregon and they
have all kinds of whole grains.

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.175
Like you can get
farro and quinoa.

00:24:43.175 --> 00:24:46.630
And you can get ground
flours, too, for baking.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.890
We have a lot of wholesome
treats in our book,

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.998
and they're made with
whole-grain flours.

00:24:51.998 --> 00:24:52.990
Rice.

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.380
I would say we like to stick
to short-grain brown rice.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.950
Brown rice is more nutritious.

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.050
I like short-grain
just for the texture.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.350
And you can find that
in the bulk section

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.650
at any health food store.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:07.135
SHALANE FLANAGAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:07.135 --> 00:25:09.750
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question about during

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.470
and post-workout nutrition.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.430
I find that it's
really hard, obviously,

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.827
while you're running and
then immediately afterwards.

00:25:15.827 --> 00:25:17.660
The last thing I want
to do after a long run

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.230
is stand in the kitchen for
20 minutes cooking something.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:23.270
Do you pre-make food, or
how do you handle that?

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:24.750
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:26.900
Concerning while you're running.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.459
Do you consume a
sports drink or gel?

00:25:29.459 --> 00:25:31.000
AUDIENCE: I've been
using power bars.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.930
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Power bars.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:32.025
OK.

00:25:32.025 --> 00:25:33.790
AUDIENCE: Not super-happy
with it, but [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:35.665
SHALANE FLANAGAN: We
have some treats in here

00:25:35.665 --> 00:25:39.410
that are great for while you're
running as well as post-run.

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:41.330
My favorite that
we have are banana

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:45.397
chews, which are
just natural bananas.

00:25:45.397 --> 00:25:47.230
But they're cooked a
little bit [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:48.180
They're chewy.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.490
You see a lot of
the sports gummies.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.620
So it replaces the
synthetic, kind of gummies

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.240
and the simple sugars that
are not as great for you.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.090
We also have what we call
giddy-up energy bars.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:03.212
And they're made with dates, and
a variety of dried fruit, and--

00:26:03.212 --> 00:26:04.045
ELYSE KOPECKY: Nuts.

00:26:04.045 --> 00:26:05.380
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Nuts in it.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:10.613
So dates and nuts are a
great source to fuel you.

00:26:10.613 --> 00:26:15.803
When I'm competing, I
just drink a sports drink.

00:26:15.803 --> 00:26:17.670
But that's necessary.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.380
There's time and
place where you're

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.190
drinking the sports drink.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:23.860
Otherwise, I'm drinking
usually like a coconut water

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.600
most of the time, or
just simple water.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.350
After a run, the last
thing you want to do

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.144
is get in the kitchen.

00:26:31.144 --> 00:26:33.060
So sometimes, I'll try
to prepare a little bit

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.150
and cook maybe
half my meal prior.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:37.940
But right after a run, I
usually have our beet smoothie.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:38.935
It sounds weird.

00:26:38.935 --> 00:26:40.760
It's delicious.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.940
So that really just gets
something in immediately.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.690
Because you have a little window
to refuel and it will make

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:46.641
you feel a lot better.

00:26:46.641 --> 00:26:48.140
And if you refuel
right away, you're

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.566
going to be a little bit
more motivated to get

00:26:49.566 --> 00:26:50.540
in the kitchen.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.580
My go-to, though, once
I get in the kitchen,

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.100
are just some veggies
and scrambled eggs.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.274
Really simple.

00:26:57.274 --> 00:26:57.774
Yeah.

00:26:57.774 --> 00:26:59.190
Elyse, do you have
anymore to add?

00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.800
ELYSE KOPECKY: Yeah.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.330
If you're not hungry
right after you

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:04.280
run because you're so thirsty,
a smoothie is a great solution.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.800
And especially if you're
putting other ingredients

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.221
in there besides fruits and
veggies to balance out--

00:27:09.221 --> 00:27:11.220
you don't want to just
have this big sugar rush.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.796
So putting almond
butter in there

00:27:12.796 --> 00:27:15.072
for the good fat and
whole-milk yogurt is amazing.

00:27:15.072 --> 00:27:18.330
You need a good, organic
whole-milk yogurt.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.050
Mixing that into your
smoothie is great.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:20.546
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:27:20.546 --> 00:27:21.046
Thank you.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.336
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:25.336 --> 00:27:28.820
I have a question,
your views on carbs.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.170
So on the one hand,
it's the fuel,

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.440
like we do carb loading
before a marathon.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.140
And probably,
during the training.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.970
And on the other hand, there are
a lot of views against carbs.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:43.960
I read the book from
[INAUDIBLE] and the "Big

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.865
Book of Endurance."

00:27:44.865 --> 00:27:48.590
That book have some extreme
views, but it does help a lot.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:52.170
They also have the
quick recipes there.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.150
He's totally
against using carbs.

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:58.010
And even against carb
loading before a marathon.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:01.980
And he also recommends
things like grass-fed beef

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.120
from local farms.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.338
So what's your view on carbs?

00:28:06.338 --> 00:28:08.837
SHALANE FLANAGAN: If I were to
just ask all the women that I

00:28:08.837 --> 00:28:11.030
compete against
men in the Olympics

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.640
who are running the
marathon, endurance athletes,

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.860
none of them would
not consume carbs.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:17.970
They need carbs.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:21.500
You need glycogen to
do an endurance event.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.430
That being said, I would
not do he no carbs.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:26.482
We're not really into
any trend at all.

00:28:26.482 --> 00:28:29.390
We just think that what
you eat on a daily basis

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:31.710
and weekly basis,
and in your training,

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.544
for example, is what you
should be fueling basically

00:28:34.544 --> 00:28:35.210
before the race.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:38.290
I will add in a little bit
of extra carbs the week

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:39.080
of the race.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.405
But I don't go hog wild.

00:28:40.405 --> 00:28:42.410
I don't go and sit
and have a giant bowl

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:43.750
of pasta the nice before.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.388
I think I would spend half
my race in a Porta-John.

00:28:46.388 --> 00:28:48.370
No joke.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:49.522
Everything in moderation.

00:28:49.522 --> 00:28:52.442
Anything extreme is
not what we're about.

00:28:52.442 --> 00:28:54.620
Everything is all
about moderation.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.830
So we find that it is important
to do the carbo loading,

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:00.710
but it's very small.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:05.890
So more my snacks throughout
the week will be carbo-oriented.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.920
But otherwise, I
eat exactly the way

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.844
I would eat through my training.

00:29:09.844 --> 00:29:15.495
AUDIENCE: But do I need to limit
carb intake to lose weight?

00:29:15.495 --> 00:29:16.370
SHALANE FLANAGAN: No.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:18.720
ELYSE KOPECKY: Processed carbs.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.000
There's a big difference
between processed carbs

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.150
and whole-food carbs.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:25.400
So you do want to avoid
the processed carbs,

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:30.230
like the white flour and
white sugar and breads.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.540
And all the packaged
foods out there

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.448
are made with really
highly processed carbs

00:29:35.448 --> 00:29:37.100
that have no nutrients.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.810
But the carbohydrates
we use in our books

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.894
are complex carbs, like sweet
potatoes, and whole grains,

00:29:41.894 --> 00:29:43.506
and all these things
that are going

00:29:43.506 --> 00:29:47.501
to be balanced energy versus
these unhealthy spikes that

00:29:47.501 --> 00:29:50.590
not only cause you
to not feel great,

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.305
but will also lead
to weight gain

00:29:52.305 --> 00:29:54.510
if you're eating
a lot of bad fat.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:57.107
So it is good to avoid
the processed carbs.

00:29:57.107 --> 00:29:57.940
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:06.180
AUDIENCE: Just for a little bit
more on that specific question

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.350
again on carbs.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.230
So you as an endurance
athlete, so you consume carbs.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:13.032
But wheat, not white carbs?

00:30:13.032 --> 00:30:14.989
So pasta, but like wheat pasta?

00:30:14.989 --> 00:30:15.780
ELYSE KOPECKY: Yes.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.764
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:30:16.764 --> 00:30:18.732
AUDIENCE: Not white
rice, but brown rice?

00:30:18.732 --> 00:30:21.684
SHALANE FLANAGAN: My favorite
carbohydrate is a sweet potato.

00:30:21.684 --> 00:30:24.819
So the night before I
run the Boston marathon,

00:30:24.819 --> 00:30:28.173
I'm loading up on
the sweet potato.

00:30:28.173 --> 00:30:29.256
And Elyse can explain why.

00:30:29.256 --> 00:30:31.721
A sweet potato is a great
source of a carbohydrate,

00:30:31.721 --> 00:30:35.065
as opposed to we were talking
about the stripped flours that

00:30:35.065 --> 00:30:37.715
really provide no nutrition.

00:30:37.715 --> 00:30:41.515
ELYSE KOPECKY: Wheat pasta is
kind of misleading packaging.

00:30:41.515 --> 00:30:42.890
Same with wheat bread.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:45.560
If it says whole wheat
pasta or whole wheat bread

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.810
on the outside of the package.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:49.268
If you flip to the back and
look at the actual ingredients,

00:30:49.268 --> 00:30:51.230
if the first ingredient
is just wheat flour,

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:52.750
it's not actually whole wheat.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.166
So when you're buying bread,
you want the first ingredient

00:30:55.166 --> 00:30:57.830
to be whole wheat flour,
not just wheat flour.

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:59.621
And there's a lot of
other things like that

00:30:59.621 --> 00:31:02.059
with misleading packaging.

00:31:02.059 --> 00:31:02.600
We eat pasta.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.290
We're not gluten-free,
but we don't

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:06.250
eat like a big mound of pasta.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.650
Instead, we will have a
small serving of pasta

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:09.970
with a lot of sauce.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.700
The sauce is packed
with veggies and meat

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.710
and all the good stuff.

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:17.140
And then, other good
carbohydrates for runners

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.940
is brown rice.

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.350
Or Shalane's favorite
is wild rice.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:25.410
And we have a wild rice
salad in here that's amazing.

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.130
Or, farro or quinoa.

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:29.300
There's lots of
other great sources.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.050
But we're not going
to say don't eat pasta

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.500
because we love pasta, too.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.560
AUDIENCE: What about dairy?

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.090
Again, some authors
say don't consume

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:42.426
dairy-- yogurt, milk, cheeses.

00:31:42.426 --> 00:31:43.426
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Dairy?

00:31:43.426 --> 00:31:44.870
AUDIENCE: Dairy, yes.

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:45.370
Sorry.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:46.203
ELYSE KOPECKY: Yeah.

00:31:46.203 --> 00:31:47.720
So dairy is pretty
hard to digest.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.570
A lot of runners are
sensitive to dairy

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:51.384
and sensitive to gluten.

00:31:51.384 --> 00:31:54.330
A lot of runners
suffer from GI distress

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.510
because when you're
running, your blood

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:58.260
is flowing away from
your digestive system

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.420
and going to your
hard-working muscles.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.256
So dairy can be very hard
to digest because of how

00:32:03.256 --> 00:32:06.210
it's processed in our country.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:09.274
It's homogenized and
ultra-pasteurized.

00:32:09.274 --> 00:32:11.440
So they're heating it to
these extreme temperatures.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.010
So it's killing off all the
good probiotics and enzymes,

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:17.110
which makes it really
difficult to break down

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:19.740
the lactose in the dairy.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.165
In our book, we don't
use cream or milk.

00:32:22.165 --> 00:32:25.420
Instead, we use dairies
that are easier to digest,

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.320
like whole-milk yogurt,
which have probiotics in it.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.150
And aged cheeses, like Parmesan.

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:33.200
When they age the cheese,
it has the enzymes

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.180
and is a lot easier to digest.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.238
We also love goat cheese.

00:32:36.238 --> 00:32:37.654
It doesn't have
the lactose that's

00:32:37.654 --> 00:32:40.924
in dairy that a lot of
people have problems with.

00:32:40.924 --> 00:32:43.090
AUDIENCE: Shalane, you don't
drink coffee with milk?

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:44.010
SHALANE FLANAGAN:
Coffee with milk?

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:44.930
AUDIENCE: No?

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.300
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Oh, no, I do.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.420
But not a lot.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.210
I prefer actually almond
milk most of the time.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:54.190
I love my coffee.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:55.356
ELYSE KOPECKY: Loves coffee.

00:32:57.930 --> 00:32:59.810
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.749
You mentioned that you used
to count your calories a lot.

00:33:02.749 --> 00:33:04.790
And like, you wouldn't be
satisfied with the food

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:05.930
or happy with the food.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.800
And once you changed to
this diet-- not diet.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.181
I mean, way of eating,
it helped a lot

00:33:11.181 --> 00:33:12.680
and you don't change
your diet much.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.790
Can you elaborate
more on how much

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:17.200
you change your eating
close to a race,

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.262
or if you change at all?

00:33:18.262 --> 00:33:19.220
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:23.220
So Elyse helped me realize
that the way our culture

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:27.041
and how we grew up, it was
ingrained to have everything

00:33:27.041 --> 00:33:27.540
low-fat.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.456
In my fridge, there
would be low-fat yogurt.

00:33:30.456 --> 00:33:33.270
And I would have
fake butter spreads.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:36.200
Thinking this was all
healthy, mind you.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.380
I was thinking I was doing a
good job taking care of myself.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.490
But it always left me hungry
and not feeling satiated.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:46.840
I always felt like I was
constantly hungry and just

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.190
could never feel full.

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:49.430
And there was a reason why.

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:52.990
It's because I was eating
everything so low-fat.

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:56.850
And a lot of low-fat foods
just pump in a lot of sugar.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:59.309
So my body was just burning it
and just ripping through it.

00:33:59.309 --> 00:34:01.641
And so I was feeling hungry
all the time, which it's not

00:34:01.641 --> 00:34:03.125
fun to run around hungry.

00:34:03.125 --> 00:34:04.480
And I have a lot of training.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.070
I run close to--
sometimes, 20 miles a day.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:10.760
And that left me just
not in a good place.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.429
So I felt like with
counting calories,

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:17.570
and having to eat all
these bland, boring foods,

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.550
I was just felt unmotivated,
and uninspired to eat,

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.280
and uninspired to get
in the kitchen and cook.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.770
And once Elyse taught
me how to integrate,

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:29.480
like making my own salad
dressings with some really good

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.297
oils, eating chicken
thighs instead

00:34:32.297 --> 00:34:34.739
of all the white breasts.

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:38.507
Having nice, buttery
sauces on my pasta.

00:34:38.507 --> 00:34:40.590
I just started to feel
like it was more indulgent.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.165
I was enjoying my food more.

00:34:42.165 --> 00:34:43.581
And I just felt
like I didn't need

00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:46.389
to count calories because
my weight was naturally

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:47.760
finding a good place.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.114
And I didn't feel like I had
to stress about it anymore.

00:34:50.114 --> 00:34:50.989
And she told me that.

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:53.730
She's like, the only numbers
you should be concerned about

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:55.064
are what your watch is reading.

00:34:55.064 --> 00:34:56.855
And what your splits
are for your workouts.

00:34:56.855 --> 00:34:58.440
How many miles
you're running a day.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.010
Worry about those numbers.

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.830
Abandon the idea of
counting calories.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:04.230
And plus, on top of that,
I couldn't count calories

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:06.540
because all the foods I was
eating were natural foods.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:11.270
I don't know how many calories
are in each-- in an apple,

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.770
necessarily.

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:13.270
Every apple is different.

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:14.770
And when you're
eating whole foods,

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:17.255
there's no need to read
the nutrition label.

00:35:17.255 --> 00:35:20.831
So it just completely opened
up my way of looking at food.

00:35:20.831 --> 00:35:23.140
And it's been a huge relief.

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.589
And I have found that
here I am at age 35,

00:35:26.589 --> 00:35:28.008
and I feel rejuvenated.

00:35:28.008 --> 00:35:29.819
And I made my
fourth Olympic team.

00:35:29.819 --> 00:35:31.152
And that's hard to do at my age.

00:35:31.152 --> 00:35:33.020
There's not many
35-year-old Olympians.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:37.200
And I feel like it's because
I've changed my diet.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.650
Well, I shouldn't say "diet."

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:40.640
My way of eating now.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.280
AUDIENCE: I have a
follow-up to that.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.690
So sometimes, when
I'm heavy training,

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:45.773
I wake up hungry, like in
the middle of the night,

00:35:45.773 --> 00:35:46.819
like 4:00 or 3:00.

00:35:46.819 --> 00:35:48.110
Do you have this kind of stuff?

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:49.140
Or, do you change
your diet [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.556
SHALANE FLANAGAN:
Yeah, I used to.

00:35:50.556 --> 00:35:53.020
I used to always have
a snack by my bed.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.437
Because I would wake up,
and I'd be like, oh my gosh.

00:35:55.437 --> 00:35:56.020
I'm so hungry.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.186
I can't wait till breakfast.

00:35:57.186 --> 00:35:58.812
I have to grab a
snack right now.

00:35:58.812 --> 00:36:00.895
So I used to literally
have food on my nightstand.

00:36:00.895 --> 00:36:05.110
It was usually like a
packaged bar, or something.

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:08.265
Athletes, bars are always
pushed at you all the time.

00:36:08.265 --> 00:36:12.281
So now, I go to bed and I'm
full throughout the night.

00:36:12.281 --> 00:36:14.205
And I'm ready to
eat in the morning,

00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:16.129
but I'm not in the
middle of the night.

00:36:16.129 --> 00:36:18.422
The hunger pains
aren't waking me up,

00:36:18.422 --> 00:36:20.422
which would happen a lot
when I'm training hard.

00:36:25.462 --> 00:36:26.920
AUDIENCE: Before
I ask my question,

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.140
can I invite you ladies to sit?

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.168
You've been standing
while the rest of us

00:36:31.168 --> 00:36:35.960
have been-- so I
was kind of curious

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.940
because there's a lot
of trends out there.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:41.020
And one particular one-- I have
a friend who really got excited

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:42.680
at Soylent.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.162
What is your take on Soylent?

00:36:45.162 --> 00:36:46.106
ELYSE KOPECKY: Soy?

00:36:46.106 --> 00:36:47.410
AUDIENCE: Soylent.

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:49.030
It's-- never mind.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.890
The idea is that they're
sourcing a bunch of sugars

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.160
and fats from different
places, and then they put them

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.530
in a bottle or a powder.

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:03.260
So it's supposed to be
pre-balanced, all that stuff.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.620
ELYSE KOPECKY:
That's frightening.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:10.870
There's more to eating
than just the nutrients.

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:13.227
There's the act of eating
and sitting down to a meal,

00:37:13.227 --> 00:37:16.209
being part of the community
and the social aspect

00:37:16.209 --> 00:37:17.203
of eating food.

00:37:17.203 --> 00:37:21.179
Cooking wakes up your
digestive system.

00:37:21.179 --> 00:37:23.661
There's so much more to
eating than just drinking down

00:37:23.661 --> 00:37:24.161
nutrients.

00:37:24.161 --> 00:37:25.405
So those products scare me.

00:37:25.405 --> 00:37:28.375
They're also really highly
processed in the lab

00:37:28.375 --> 00:37:30.850
and it's not real food.

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:32.830
So again, not crazy
about that idea.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:34.621
SHALANE FLANAGAN: I
never even heard of it.

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:40.190
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
a non-food question?

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.690
Like just a couple of
questions to Shalane

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:45.665
about running mostly?

00:37:45.665 --> 00:37:47.290
My first question
was, can you comment,

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:51.772
like what is your opinion on
the recent amazing world record

00:37:51.772 --> 00:37:53.749
by [INAUDIBLE] for the 10K?

00:37:53.749 --> 00:37:55.040
Like what's your opinion there?

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.320
SHALANE FLANAGAN:
It's mind-blowing.

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.028
I can't even actually
even conceptualize.

00:38:02.028 --> 00:38:04.130
So he's asking about
in the Olympics,

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.225
in the 10,000
meter, which I have

00:38:06.225 --> 00:38:12.040
a bronze medal from Beijing,
China, in the 10,000 meters.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.590
But in Rio this summer, there
was a woman from Ethiopia

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.200
who ran the world
record in the race.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.605
And I couldn't believe
my eyes watching her.

00:38:22.605 --> 00:38:24.730
It's beyond my comprehension.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:28.772
AUDIENCE: And Shalane has
an American record for 10K.

00:38:28.772 --> 00:38:30.110
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:36.410
So she ran half of race faster
than I could run-- so at 5K,

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:41.770
or 5,000 meters, she's ran her
first 5,000 or her second 5,000

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:43.440
faster than I've run one.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.840
So I can't even conceptualize.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.625
It was just an
outstanding performance.

00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:50.130
Unfortunately with
athletics, sometimes

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:54.460
what seems unbelievable
is unbelievable.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.620
I don't know what to
think about it just

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.920
because, as maybe many of
you read over the summer,

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.030
there was a lot
of doping stories.

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:07.830
And with Russia being
extracted from the Olympics

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:08.960
and not allowed.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:13.260
So it's just hard to know
what is real or not real.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:16.190
However, I will say there's
not many 10,000-meter races

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:18.490
and opportunities
to run really fast.

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:22.530
So maybe she really
just is that good.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:23.780
But we'll find out.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:28.015
It was so impressive, yes.

00:39:28.015 --> 00:39:29.890
AUDIENCE: And can you
just talk a little bit,

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:31.659
what is next for you?

00:39:31.659 --> 00:39:32.325
More marathons--

00:39:32.325 --> 00:39:33.750
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Athletically?

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.209
AUDIENCE: Running-wise, yes.

00:39:35.209 --> 00:39:37.500
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Well, I'm
taking a nice, little break

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.290
on this book tour.

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:41.145
It's fun to do
something different.

00:39:41.145 --> 00:39:44.295
My lifestyle is
very monastic when

00:39:44.295 --> 00:39:46.050
I'm training for a marathon.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.700
It's three months of
a lot of dedication.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.180
It's run, eat, sleep.

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.730
Run, eat, sleep, repeat.

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:53.340
It's very much the same thing.

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.972
It's what I call Groundhog Day.

00:39:54.972 --> 00:39:56.430
If any of you have
seen that movie,

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:58.429
that's my life when I'm
training for a marathon.

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:00.250
It's not very eventful.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:03.910
So it's fun for me to do other
activities, engage with people.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:06.607
I feel like when I come out of
marathon training, I'm in shock

00:40:06.607 --> 00:40:08.315
and I don't know how
to even communicate.

00:40:08.315 --> 00:40:11.200
It's like, do I
even know English?

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.510
It's a little scary.

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:16.910
So it's fun to just be inspired
by my running community

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:18.810
and the cooking world.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:20.972
And it motivates me to
get back to my training

00:40:20.972 --> 00:40:22.720
by taking a break.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.330
So probably come
December and January,

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:28.960
I'll be back at the
grind of run, eat, sleep.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.120
And I have aspirations.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.726
My love affair with
running is in Boston.

00:40:34.726 --> 00:40:35.850
I love the Boston Marathon.

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:37.070
I grew up there.

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:39.360
So I may show up in
Boston next April.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.631
That may be part of my plan.

00:40:41.631 --> 00:40:43.104
But beyond that, I don't know.

00:40:43.104 --> 00:40:44.997
I'm taking one race at a time.

00:40:44.997 --> 00:40:46.830
A lot of athletes think
in four-year chunks.

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.430
But right now, I'm just
going to go month by month.

00:40:51.574 --> 00:40:53.490
AUDIENCE: So I want to
ask about morning runs.

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.670
And you may have the luxury
not to have to deal with this.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:57.630
But how do you deal when
you're trying to get

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:58.900
a long run in in the morning?

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.140
Do you wake up at 4:00 AM
to eat, and then go back

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.520
to sleep for a few hours?

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.395
SHALANE FLANAGAN: If
I'm just doing training,

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:05.850
like long-run training run?

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.378
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:41:08.378 --> 00:41:11.980
So I like to eat
about 90 minutes prior

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.620
to the start of a run.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:18.910
And I know that that may be--
it's like a luxury for me,

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.555
because that's my job.

00:41:21.555 --> 00:41:23.680
For example, if you were
wanting to start your run,

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.440
what, at like 5:00
AM, you're saying?

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.895
And you wanted to get
it in before work?

00:41:27.895 --> 00:41:28.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.990
Or, have family or
other commitments.

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.470
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.990
You're trying to
get it done early.

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:34.305
AUDIENCE: You want to do like
three hours at 7:00 AM, 6:00

00:41:34.305 --> 00:41:34.970
AM.

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.310
SHALANE FLANAGAN: Yeah.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:41.760
I mean, the key in the morning--
and this is maybe a little

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.040
bit too much information--
is to get up and get

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.484
moving so that you're not
going to have any GI issues out

00:41:46.484 --> 00:41:48.275
on the trail and having
to make a pit stop.

00:41:48.275 --> 00:41:50.270
So that's usually what
most runners are like,

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:53.215
let's get up an hour before
to try and get some food in.

00:41:53.215 --> 00:41:55.090
Make sure that you've
made your bathroom stop

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:57.190
and you can head out on
the trail, on the road,

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:59.730
and be good to go.

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:02.100
So I usually get up
about an hour before.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:06.440
But sometimes, that's hard
to do if it's dark and cold.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:11.540
But usually, on the ride
to-- if I'm going to go run,

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.550
to drive-- or drive
to go run, I will

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:18.020
take a smoothie or one
of our superhero muffins

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.521
and eat that right
before I get out there.

00:42:21.521 --> 00:42:22.020
Yeah.

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.228
ELYSE KOPECKY: If you don't
have time for breakfast--

00:42:24.228 --> 00:42:28.551
I run early before my
husband leaves for work

00:42:28.551 --> 00:42:29.675
and before I start working.

00:42:29.675 --> 00:42:34.904
So at that hour, at
6:00 AM, I'm not hungry.

00:42:34.904 --> 00:42:38.796
So I'll just get up and
have some coconut water

00:42:38.796 --> 00:42:41.805
mixed with water, like
diluted with water.

00:42:41.805 --> 00:42:44.870
And either coffee or
tea and a couple of

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:46.684
dates just for
some quick energy.

00:42:46.684 --> 00:42:48.100
But a three-hour
run is different.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.940
I usually run less than that.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.320
So you definitely want
to get some fuel in you.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.706
And dates can be a
good, quick glucose hit.

00:42:56.706 --> 00:42:57.580
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:58.350
That's end of our talk.

00:42:58.350 --> 00:42:59.940
We're going to have
a book signing over

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:00.730
at that table over there.

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:02.270
There's still some books
available for purchase

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.896
over here.

00:43:02.896 --> 00:43:04.270
And everybody,
please give a warm

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:05.810
thank you to Shalan and Elyse.

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:09.460
[APPLAUSE]
