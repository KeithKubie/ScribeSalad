00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.600
- Thank you, and welcome back.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.420
Our last panel of the day is one
I'm particularly excited about.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.080
In the morning and a little
bit earlier this afternoon,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.082
we talked a lot about
pathogens that cause disease.

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:19.540
This afternoon,
we're going to talk

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.960
about pathogenic
social processes that

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.420
also cause disease epidemics.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.520
To lead that panel,
we're honored

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.470
to have Dean Michelle Williams.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.530
She's Dean of Faculty at
Harvard T.H. Chan School

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.850
of Public Health.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.640
She's an internationally
renowned epidemiologist

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.610
and public health scientist,
an award-winning educator,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.400
and a widely recognized
academic leader.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.860
Before becoming dean, she
was professor and Chair

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.810
of the Department
of Epidemiology

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.700
at the School of Public Health.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.980
Her scientific work
focuses on integrating

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.340
genomic sciences and
epidemiologic methods

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.670
to identify risk factors,
diagnostic markers, treatments,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.190
and prevention
targets for disorders

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.280
that contribute to maternal
and infant mortality.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.370
She's published more than
450 scientific articles

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.300
and received numerous research
and teaching awards, including

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.820
President Barack
Obama's Presidential

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.860
Award for Excellence
in Science, Math,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.300
and Engineering Mentoring.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.240
Please welcome Dr.
Michelle Williams.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.480
- Thank you, Janet.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.560
Thank you.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.240
And good afternoon, everyone.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.450
It's really been
a pleasure for me

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.650
to be here to participate with
this panel, the last panel

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.540
of this wonderful day.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.340
In this panel, we're
going to explore

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.650
the social roots of epidemics.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.020
The contagion model
of infectious disease

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.320
is a very powerful
framework, as you've seen,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.390
one that we can
use to illuminate

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.000
far broader phenomena.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.930
This afternoon, we're going
to explore three of these,

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.870
all pressing public
health issues.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.490
They include the opioid
crisis, gun violence,

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.500
and the race and gender
aspects of mental health.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.980
The conversation we are
about to embark upon

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.230
is truly extraordinary.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.410
Our three panelists span
a range of disciplines,

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.060
as you will hear.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.990
Andrew Kolodny is a
physician and scientist.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.830
He comes to us from the
Heller School of Social Policy

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.650
and Management at
Brandeis University,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.600
where he is co-director
of opioid policy research.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.330
He's also executive
director of Physicians

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.750
for Responsible
Opioid Prescribing.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.950
We have on our panel
also Andrew Papachristos

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.320
who will speak
about gun violence.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.120
He is a professor of
sociology at Yale,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.580
where his research focuses on
social networks, neighborhoods,

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.840
street gangs, and
interpersonal violence.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.690
Also among us is
Daphne Watkins who

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.490
studies mental health
disparities over the adult life

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.210
course.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.150
She is an associate
professor of social work

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.750
at the University of Michigan
and an assistant professor

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.400
of psychiatry at the
university's medical school.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.470
So our panel this afternoon
includes opioids, guns,

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.190
mental health.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.510
How remarkable.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.830
What breadth.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.050
In a single session, we will
be able to think through,

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.960
to think about
all three of these

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.430
from such diverse perspectives.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.590
Actually, when you
think about it,

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.060
it's a testament to the
fact that the amplitude

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.760
of public health is so large.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.820
We draw on diverse data streams.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.560
Some of that, you
heard a discussion

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.840
about in the previous panel.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.480
These data streams
include biological data,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.290
behavioral data,
social network data.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.880
And we also have, in
this panel, a discussion

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.870
of how a robust set
of analytic tools

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.600
can be brought to use on these
rich and diverse data streams.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.060
It's layers on top
of layers on top

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.640
of layers, layers of richness.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.400
And it's a pretty exciting
and instrumental way

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.540
for addressing complex
public health problems.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.520
This afternoon, we're
going to explore

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.810
how we might translate and
transfer methodologies used

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.810
for complex disease
contagion models

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.760
to equally complex social
and environmental problems.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.550
Here is the cycle
of inquiry that

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.260
will frame our conversation.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.970
For example, we start with
surveillance, identification,

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.250
of the presence of an epidemic.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.310
Next, we come to risk
factor assessments.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.280
What populations are
vulnerable to the epidemic

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.290
that we have identified?

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.130
Why are they vulnerable?

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.380
It's based on this that
we develop interventions.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.100
Finally, we assess
these interventions.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.490
This entails
choosing and applying

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.010
an evaluation methodology.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.770
Here the possible
paths are many,

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.770
but the goal remains the same--

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.850
to determine the success
of any given intervention.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.460
Does it reduce risk factors?

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.140
And does this attenuate
the contagion?

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.240
Our answers then feed back into
an ongoing and unending cycle

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.390
of discovery and implementation.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.520
The most urgent issues of our
day are enormous and complex.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.610
They sprawl across
disciplines without regard

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.650
to academic silos.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.220
To address them, we
must talk to each other,

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.020
not briefly every now
and then, but often

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.610
and at length and with purpose.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.360
This is how we will leverage
our collective expertise.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.630
This is the way, and I
would argue the only way,

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.460
that we can hope
to find solutions

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.420
for these complex,
intersecting problems.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.810
This insight was beautifully
expressed very recently

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.570
in a New York Times
letter to the editor

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:29.190
by seven Nobel laureates
shortly after this year's awards

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.570
were announced.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.380
They wrote, and I quote,
"These landmark achievements

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.960
are rarely the work
of one individual.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.260
Collaboration across
disciplines and borders

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.430
lies at the heart of
scientific discovery."

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.360
This recognition, so elegantly
stated by the Nobel laureates,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.570
is also at the heart of
President Drew Faust's vision

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.280
of one Harvard.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.540
And it is at the very heart
of today's conversation.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.240
I don't need to tell you
that the issues we are now

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.420
turning to are among
the most critical

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.340
that we face in our society.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.250
The terrible
tragedy of Las Vegas

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.640
earlier this month was
yet another reminder

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.250
of how completely we failed
to address the gun violence

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.960
epidemic that has long
plagued this country.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.090
The opioid epidemic continues
to ravage our communities.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.090
Last June, The New
York Times reported

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.710
that drug overdose deaths
in 2016 most likely

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:46.510
exceeded 59,000, the largest
annual jump ever recorded

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.390
in the US's history.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.110
Drug overdoses have become
the leading cause of death

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.650
among Americans
under the age of 50.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.310
Less visible, but
no less pervasive,

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.940
is the national epidemic
of mental health issues.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.200
While mental health problems
occur throughout populations,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.410
risk factors vary
in kind and degree--

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.040
ethnicity, culture, age, gender.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.890
All of these come into
play as social determinants

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.570
of mental health.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.170
So with these remarks,
what I'd like to do

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.390
is that we now dive in.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.040
And I will ask our
first speaker--

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.020
and do we have a specific order?

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.600
Our first speaker to present.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.090
And that will be Daphne Watkins.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.495
Dr. Watkins.

00:08:39.495 --> 00:08:44.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.300
- So just as your
lunches are settling in,

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.520
I'm also hoping that
the coffee kicks in

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.210
and you will stay with me as
much as you can this afternoon.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:57.210
I'm really happy to begin
the social roots panel.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.960
And in many ways, I
would consider myself

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.640
an interdisciplinary
scholar, one

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.390
who studies men's mental health
from a variety of perspectives

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.340
and using pearls of
wisdom from a variety

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.690
of different disciplines.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.250
And in the spirit
of reflexivity,

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.290
I'll say that I was born female.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.600
And I identify as a
black woman who studies

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.500
black men's mental health.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.030
And this has involved everything
from community-based surveys

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:24.220
and qualitative interviews and
focus groups with black men

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.040
to interactions with black
men in psychiatric settings

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.650
and even more recently providing
a mental health education

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.550
and social support program
via Facebook that's

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.370
five weeks long that I will
speak about a little bit later

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.000
towards my talk.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.550
Now my work focuses primarily
on defining mental health

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.150
with black men and having
them define it for themselves.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.850
And then I use that definition
to improve mental health

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.240
for black men so that the
positive effects are really

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.570
experienced by them, their
families, and their communities

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.350
as a whole.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.530
So my 15 years of
studying gender

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.800
has taught me that the
gender epidemic is real.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.300
And it's an epidemic
that you really

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.460
wouldn't think is an epidemic.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.950
But in my world,
it truly exists.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.710
The gender epidemic is
a modern day epidemic

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.750
that often goes overlooked.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.410
And like most
epidemics, ignoring it

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.350
can be harmful to those
who are suffering.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.930
And it could even be deadly.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.770
But we will not truly understand
the gravity of the gender

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.380
epidemic until we realize
the role that we all

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:35.000
play in it, specifically, how
we are socializing our youth

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.750
and how we, as the adults, are
helping them make connections

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.480
from their past and their
present, their right

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.640
now and their soon-to-come.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.030
And I'm hopefully here,
today, to do this for you.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.330
And to do this, I'd like to
start with this statement.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.040
So men who adhere to traditional
definitions of manhood

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.600
have poorer mental
health than men

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.780
who adhere to more
progressive definitions.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.270
And to be honest with
you, this statement

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.600
is pretty much a hot
topic right now in the men

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.640
and masculinities literature.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.510
Specifically, my colleagues in
psychology and public health

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.270
and in gender studies have
known this for some time

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.600
and are working to understand
this in more depth.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.430
But what they're
trying to understand

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:23.240
is not necessarily how does
the overall, traditional

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.600
definitions of manhood play out
when it comes to mental health,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.680
but specifically how do certain
dimensions of manhood result

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.320
in poor mental health for men.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.170
And let me be clear that,
today, I'm talking about gender.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.970
I'm not talking about sex.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.390
And there is a difference.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.540
The terms are often
used interchangeably,

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.000
but there is a clear difference
between gender and sex.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.870
So sex is what we
assign babies at birth.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:52.010
The gender is who and what
those babies grow up to be.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:56.310
So the who and the what they
assign themselves, if you will,

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.760
which is often
influenced by society.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.690
And who are we really
kidding anyway?

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:01.190
Right?

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.790
Society does influence
who we are as people.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:09.050
Society really plays a role by
subscribing or making the rules

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.300
that we follow as men and women.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.040
And this is an
iterative process that

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.860
happens with children,
with young adults,

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.380
as well as with older adults.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.740
Society influences how people
interact with the world,

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.320
as well as how the world
interacts with people.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.470
So today, I'm talking
about gender, not sex.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:30.720
And specifically, I'm
talking about men.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.709
So looking at this statement
that I've placed here,

00:12:33.709 --> 00:12:35.250
I think in order to
really understand

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.170
my argument we're going
to need to pull out

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.690
some of the key terms
from this statement here.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.190
So if I'm saying
that men who adhere

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.110
to traditional
definitions of manhood

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.030
have poorer mental
health than men

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.160
who adhere to more
progressive definitions,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.170
I would say those
key terms are men,

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.270
traditional
definitions of manhood,

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.950
poor mental health,
and progressive.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:57.700
So let's discuss each
of these in turn.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.870
So it is no mystery that,
from the moment parents

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.140
realize whether they're
having a boy or a girl,

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.690
the gender socializing begins.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.240
We treat boys differently
because, well, that's

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.950
what we've always done.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.340
We dress them differently.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.740
We even relate to
them differently,

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.540
not just as children, but
as youth, as well as adults.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.240
For example, parents
tend to be less concerned

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.250
about the safety of
their boys compared

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.650
to the safety of their
girls because boys are

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:26.830
supposed to be tough anyway.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:27.330
Right?

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.760
They're supposed to be able
to fend for themselves.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.781
And our girls need a little
more coddling, cuddling,

00:13:32.781 --> 00:13:33.780
a little more nurturing.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.350
Right?

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.990
Of course, this is debatable.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.170
This even translates into
help-seeking behaviors

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.670
for boys and girls.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.340
Because when it comes to the
anticipated developmental

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.100
challenges with regard
to health and well-being,

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.520
boys are often discouraged
from seeking help.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.620
Even girls' interactions
with the health care

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.440
system tends to occur a
little earlier compared

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.720
to boys, particularly
around the time when

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.750
both reach developmental
milestones such as puberty.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.560
We often encourage girls
to seek health care

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.480
during that transition
into womanhood,

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.510
but we rarely encourage
boys to also seek

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.540
health care during their
transition into manhood.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.680
So gender, as we know it,
has a place in society

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.720
and has held this position in
society for a very long time.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.080
The implications of
gender tends to manifest

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.530
through behaviors like
masculinity and femininity.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.170
And just as there are
traditional definitions

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:36.040
of femininity, there are
also traditional definitions

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.890
of masculinity or manhood.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.540
Now these traditional
definitions

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.910
have answers to several
different names over the years.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.180
We've called them hegemonic
definitions of masculinity

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.030
or manhood,
mainstream, dominant.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.710
And by traditional,
though, here I'm

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.050
speaking of that
alpha man, right,

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.750
that poised, being
stoic, oftentimes,

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.240
the breadwinner,
the strong person,

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.150
excuse me, in the
relationship in the family.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.540
But at the root of
it all, masculinity

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:09.100
is a social construct that
outlines the shared experiences

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.550
and the shared expectations
about social and cultural

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.890
behaviors for both boys and men.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:18.610
Boys are taught how to
be men at an early age.

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.490
And it's expected that they
hold on to those definitions

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:25.030
throughout their life
transitions and trajectories.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.950
More than anything,
these definitions

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:30.460
are focused on not
who boys and men are,

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.000
but on what boys and men
do in their interactions

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.390
with their families, their
friends, and their communities

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.220
as a whole.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.290
For men and
masculinity scholars,

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:45.910
you know, we tend to refer to
masculinities in a plural form

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:49.630
because there are multiple and
multifaceted options that fall

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.610
along the masculinities
continuum,

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:52.990
which you see here
on the screen.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.100
From a social perspective,
the diagnosis is clear.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.650
Gender is problematic,
especially

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.360
when it comes to mental health.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.990
But I have to be honest, from
a more clinical perspective,

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.350
maybe men aren't
suffering as much as

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.240
much as we think they are.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.540
As you can see, these
statistics paint such a picture.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.150
You can see from these data
from the Center for Behavioral

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:24.260
Health Statistics and Quality
that past-year serious mental

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.040
illness among adults who are
18 years and older is higher

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.540
for women compared to men and
higher for whites compared--

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.860
I'm sorry-- and higher for
whites compared to blacks,

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.220
Asians, and Hispanics.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.500
So based on the
numbers, perhaps, men

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.160
should not get a lot
of our attention.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:41.660
Right?

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.130
Based on the
statistics, it looks

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.537
like men are doing just fine.

00:16:45.537 --> 00:16:47.870
But in actuality, they should
get a lot of our attention

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.000
right because not all
of these statistics

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.460
always capture the
kinds of information

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.440
that we hope that they
capture to give us

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.520
some direction for
how to move forward.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.360
First, there is
substantial evidence

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.950
on mistreatment and misdiagnosis
among black Americans.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:07.069
And studies also show
that people of color

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:09.500
are misdiagnosed
with more serious

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.920
psychological conditions, even
when they have similar symptoms

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.329
as whites.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:17.060
I also worry a little
bit about the measures.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.910
I wonder if we're asking
the right questions

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.550
to get the right answers
that we need in order

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:26.240
to take into consideration
things like race and gender

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.550
and sexual orientation even.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.100
So while I believe this
is a problem for men,

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.440
and specifically
black men, I can

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.260
admit that the numbers
say something differently.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.210
So you may be wondering,
given the numbers,

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.460
you know, why do I focus
my efforts on black men.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.650
Well, many black men in our
country experience injustices

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:49.470
related to police
aggression and brutality.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.240
And I believe that
we are failing

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.480
in helping to understand the
connection between these events

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.106
and their mental health.

00:17:56.106 --> 00:17:57.480
So research shows
that people who

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.300
report more of these
interactions with police

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.670
do experience more
symptoms of anxiety

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.430
and post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.520
Research also confirms
that few black men

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.190
seek mental health treatment for
their mental health conditions.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.710
And we know that
black men are less

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.860
likely to seek mental health
treatment due to stigma

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.930
associated with
mental health care,

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.140
the mistrust of the mental
health care providers,

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.440
or even a lack of more
gender-specific and culturally

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.340
relevant attention to their
mental health care needs.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.580
Studies also show
that black men often

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.460
experience the kind of
gender socialization

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.380
that may look very
different compared

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.990
to men of other racial
and ethnic groups.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.300
Oftentimes, black
men are socialized

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.450
to be more masculine or
hyper-masculine, if you will,

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:48.420
than men of other
racial and ethnic groups

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.960
so as to combat
racism and oppression.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.530
But what ends up happening is
these hyper-masculine behaviors

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.720
result in black men
acting out in ways

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.730
that are actually
counter to what

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:04.260
are genuinely healthy
and authentically human.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.320
And it would be remiss
of me not to acknowledge

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.590
that hyper-masculinity may
manifest in unique ways

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.470
among boys and men of other
racial and ethnic groups.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.560
And so while I often use the
term progressive to describe

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.400
more mainstream definitions
of masculinities and manhood,

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.440
here, I actually
want to talk about it

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.360
and contextualize
it as a way that we

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.170
think about our methods,
research methods to be exact.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.020
Because progressive, more
advanced research methods

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.880
are important in
research overall,

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.830
but especially in
research that we

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.860
conduct with our
under-represented populations

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.250
and underserved groups.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.540
Historically, and I'm sure
many of you in the room

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.660
can either agree or disagree
with this statement,

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.340
but researchers
typically choose a camp.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:50.840
Right?

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.910
Which a lunch table
where we want to sit.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:56.850
And it's often based on our
philosophical perspective

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:00.090
in how researchers determine
what is scientific truth.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:05.491
So quantitative researchers
tend to have a--

00:20:05.491 --> 00:20:05.990
there we go.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:09.500
Quantitative researchers tend
to have a valuable contribution

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.160
to science.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.550
They feel like they see
the importance of numbers,

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.890
large samples, and have
a hypothesis to test.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.790
Quantitative researchers
also acknowledge the value

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:22.850
of being objective and
generalizing their work so

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.380
that we can infer what they
uncover from the sample

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.440
to the larger population.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.860
But then on the other
side of the camp

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.440
or maybe on the other side of
the lunchroom, if you will,

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.660
are these qualitative
researchers

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.900
who make valuable
contributions to science,

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.200
contextualizing what they
find from smaller samples,

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.170
and going deeper into
their level of discovery

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.080
to unearth meaning from
their work with people.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.754
So just by a show
of hands, can I

00:20:49.754 --> 00:20:51.920
see how many people are in
the room sort of identify

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.750
as quantitative
researchers, definitely

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.010
in love with the statistics?

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.330
OK, nice group.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.190
How about my
qualitative researchers?

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.320
Oh, the hands shoot
up fast when I

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.450
ask about the
qualitative researchers.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:05.120
So I would argue that while
both types of research

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.200
are needed in scientific
inquiry, definitely,

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.800
I tend to sit right
in the middle.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.220
Because I would argue that the
combination and integration

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.250
of both qualitative and
quantitative research

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.990
has been around for some time.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:25.260
And we call that mixed
methods research.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.750
At its foundation,
mixed methods research

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.690
involves the intersection
of both qualitative

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.780
and quantitative methods
into a single study

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:38.470
to generate a more comprehensive
understanding of the topic

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.000
under study.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.550
It is the combining
of both qualitative

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.010
and quantitative
methods that expand

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:46.960
the scope of the research.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.900
There are several advantages
to mixed methods research,

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.030
but I'll just name
a couple here.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:56.020
First of all-- oh, wow, it
looks like my PowerPoint slides

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.310
are moving too quickly here.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.990
OK, pardon me.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.700
They must be on a timer.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.530
So let's get back to the
advantages of mixed methods

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:04.030
research.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.580
So mixed methods
research, it really

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:11.740
is about using both
methods together and really

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.590
using them so that
the strength of one

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.230
offsets the weaknesses
of the other.

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.030
And I think in order
to really unearth

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.770
the stories or the words
behind the numbers,

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.520
it's really important to
contextualize your work

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.040
and really think about
providing a language

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.560
for the true lives of the
people that you want to help.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.950
And in my case, that just
happens to be black men.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:37.390
So this brings us back
to where I started

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:40.300
that men who adhere to
traditional definitions

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.210
of manhood tend to have
poorer mental health

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:46.060
than men who adhere to more
progressive definitions

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.140
of manhood.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.930
Now, again, this is where
I started this talk.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.060
But the reason why I
wanted to start here

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:55.390
is because so much of
our research on gender

00:22:55.390 --> 00:23:00.460
and ethnicity and public
health and psychology

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.650
really kind of
highlights this idea

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.530
that there are behaviors that
result in certain mental health

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:06.800
outcomes.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.510
Now why this statement is
particularly important to me

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:13.480
is because we find that black
men, in particular, tend

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.680
to adhere to more traditional
definitions of manhood

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.810
when compared to men
of other racial groups.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:28.770
So if a socially rooted
construct is the problem,

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:32.400
then we have a sense for
the diagnosis if you will.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.670
But how should we go about
combating a problem like this?

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:39.600
How do we talk about resolving
or trying to remedy something

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.520
that is socially oriented?

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.410
And I definitely give
a nod to my colleagues

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.110
earlier who talked about
getting into the field

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:48.810
and certainly trying
to solve the problems

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.460
with these modern-day epidemics.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:55.560
But in my world, this socially
constructed epidemic of gender

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.960
is something that
I'm trying to combat.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.540
And the way that we
try to combat this

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.040
is we start somewhere.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.090
And so I choose to start
working towards changing

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:09.750
the narrative around
black men's mental health.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.940
I choose to work
towards reducing

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.430
the harmful effects of the
gender epidemic, at least

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.190
for young black men.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.030
And as with any
narrative change,

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.160
you have to really be
willing to put something out

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.040
into the world that you believe
in and hope that something

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.170
positive comes back from that.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.500
One of my contributions to
changing this narrative is

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.680
a program that I developed
called the YBMen Project,

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.740
which stands for the Young Black
Men Masculinities and Mental

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.300
Health Project.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.090
I conceptualized
this project in 2008,

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.730
but it was launched in 2013.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:44.980
And the YBMen
Project was created

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.490
to address the
masculinity, mental health,

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.550
and social support needs
of young black men.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:54.790
This age-specific,
gender-appropriate,

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:57.490
and culturally
tailored intervention

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.650
promotes mental
health education,

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:02.800
transformative
definitions of manhood,

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.200
and social support
for young black men.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.390
Now, in any way, this
is not e-therapy.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.760
So I always tell people
that I am not a clinician.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.720
I only play one on television.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.160
So I'm not trying to diagnose
men with this kind of work.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.310
But we find that men who are
interested in this particular

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.170
intervention are
usually the men who

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.330
may be less likely to
discuss their mental health

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:23.720
face to face.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.290
They may be the men
whose distress may not

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.360
have reached clinical severity.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.590
And they desire mental health
education and social support

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:35.830
in an internet-based setting.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:37.840
So to date, the
YBMen Project has

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.840
been implemented across
college and university campuses

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.010
in the Midwest.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.720
So this mental health
education program

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.080
is particularly attractive to
colleges and universities who

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.170
want to improve and maintain
positive mental health

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:53.560
and well-being for black
men by using popular culture

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.530
references and
leveraging social media.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:01.360
And our social media
of choice is Facebook.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.000
So this is a sample
six-week curriculum

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.950
for the YBMen Project,
as our intervention

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.820
can be as short as five weeks
or as long as eight weeks.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.760
The content is delivered through
a private Facebook group.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.710
And we use popular
culture references

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.040
to deliver the mental
health education,

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.170
progressive definitions
of masculinities,

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:25.890
and social support content to
the young men who participate.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.680
This is a screenshot
from a previous iteration

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.510
of the intervention.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.150
And what the YBMen
Project does is

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:35.370
it helps us
understand black men's

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:38.550
attitudes towards mental
health, masculinities,

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.170
and social support.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.440
Our participants think Facebook
is the most appropriate vehicle

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.310
for our work and that we provide
thought-provoking content

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.940
that open black men's eyes to
a range of issues they had not

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.950
really thought about before.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:56.160
Participants enjoyed the
exclusive and non-judgmental

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.770
space, as it provides
them with the opportunity

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.680
to process mental
health, masculinities,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.110
and social support in
the context of the world

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:07.960
around them and in the virtual
presence of other black men,

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.180
which is so key.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.400
Because when you think
about socialization,

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.000
you realize that, women, we
tend to be sort of taught

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.030
to socialize with girls nights
out and things like that.

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:21.270
But men are often not
socialized to convene

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:26.350
to get together and discuss
some of their life experiences.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.970
So quantitatively, our data
has showed promising results.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.490
We usually collect both
pre and post-test data

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:36.630
to measure change over time and
whether participants' scores

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:38.700
on their mental health
and masculinity measures

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.930
have changed.

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:43.440
And as you can see, depressive
symptoms did decrease for men

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.850
in our Facebook group.

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:46.860
And they did increase
ever so slightly

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.200
for men who did not
participate in our groups.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.110
We also have interview
data that helps

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.870
to demonstrate participants'
more progressive definitions

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:58.830
of manhood, more deliberate,
intentional considerations

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.120
for social support.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.760
And I have to be honest and
say that this is obviously

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.800
not a change that
happened overnight,

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.470
but rather men tend to
be more open to thinking

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.530
about various definitions
of masculinity

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:13.680
and the benefits of social
support in their lives post

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.490
intervention.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:17.580
So as I bring this
to a close, what

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.530
I want you to take away
from this presentation

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:22.290
is that gender is
a social construct.

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.050
Do men have privileges
that women do not have?

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:26.730
Absolutely.

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.227
But I would be
doing a disservice

00:28:28.227 --> 00:28:30.310
if I led you to believe
that men are not suffering

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.100
in some aspects of their lives.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.570
And a part of that
suffering does

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:37.950
happen when it comes to mental
health and mental health care.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.720
We have more power
in the development

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.320
of how we socialize boys
and girls than we may think.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.570
The moment that I
realized my power

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:48.450
in shaping the narrative and
the experiences of black man's

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.840
mental health was the moment
I realized my purpose.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.200
And you don't have to have a PhD
or an MD to do this, certainly.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.360
But you can actually do
more in your communities

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.610
around encouraging
those little boys who

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:03.450
may want to pursue careers
that may be women's work

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:05.190
or what could be
considered women's work,

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:08.550
like nurses and dancers, to
really have them do something

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.870
that makes them happy.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.450
So as I bring this
to a close, I'm

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.010
going to remind you
of the statement

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.900
that I showed you
at the beginning.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:20.340
And I do believe this is a hard
and fast statement right now.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.580
But I want to just leave
you with an edited version

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.140
of this statement
that I'm striving

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.990
to support in my own research
and that I hope to someday read

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:29.730
at the beginning
of a presentation

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:32.280
on how we together
combated the gender

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.280
epidemic during our generation.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.780
And with that, I thank you for
your time and your attention.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.732
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:50.570
- Thank you.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:53.030
We are definitely
launching this panel

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:54.840
with a lovely presentation.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.000
Thank you, Daphne.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.690
Now I'd like to ask Andrew
Kolodny to join me here

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:03.914
at the podium who will
present his remarks.

00:30:03.914 --> 00:30:05.330
- Your presentation
is down there.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:06.270
I apologize. this wasn't here.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:06.853
- That's fine.

00:30:06.853 --> 00:30:07.680
That's fine.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.510
So it's a pleasure to
have this opportunity

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:12.834
to talk with all of you about
our opioid addiction epidemic.

00:30:12.834 --> 00:30:15.000
I'm going to be helping you
better understand what's

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.090
happening right now with
prescription opioids, heroin,

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.200
and fentanyl.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.220
I'm going explain to you how
we got into this mess, which

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.560
I think is important for
understanding strategies

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.820
for bringing it under control.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.950
And I will go over, briefly,
some of those strategies.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:31.450
I have a lot I want to cover.

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:33.658
So I'm going to be going
very quickly because there's

00:30:33.658 --> 00:30:35.730
only 20 minutes.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.350
I have no financial
relationships

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:40.057
with any pharmaceutical
companies.

00:30:40.057 --> 00:30:41.640
After you hear my
talk, I think you'll

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.730
understand why no
pharmaceutical companies want

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.090
a relationship with me.

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:52.290
When we talk, well, actually,
when we use the term opioid,

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:56.610
the term opioid includes
naturally occurring

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.310
opioids that come from opium.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:03.570
And you know inside opium,
you have morphine and codeine.

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.530
Those are totally natural.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:10.270
Another term for the totally
natural opioids is opiate.

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:13.670
We also have
semi-synthetic opioids,

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:16.300
which are made from opium.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.950
And you treat the
opium chemically

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:20.530
to make them get to
the brain faster.

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:22.960
You're making them
more lipophilic.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.190
Some semi-synthetic opioids
that you may have heard of

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.100
include hydrocodone,
which is in Vicodin,

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.700
oxycodone, which is an
OxyContin, and heroin.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.810
Heroin is also a
semi-synthetic opioid.

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.390
Something many
people don't realize

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.970
is that the effects that
heroin produces in the brain

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.950
are indistinguishable
from the effects produced

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:47.740
by hydrocodone and oxycodone.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.150
An experienced heroin user
can't tell one from the other.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:56.800
And then, lastly, we have the
completely synthetic opioids,

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.050
which you don't need to start
with opium to make them.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.790
And that would include fentanyl.

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:04.630
Methadone is also a
completely synthetic opioid.

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:05.830
This is an old slide.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.230
I updated it with the
number of Americans

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.890
who died of a drug
overdose in 2016, which

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.890
the preliminary figure
is 64,000 Americans who

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:16.510
died of an overdose.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:19.300
Otherwise, it's an old
slide that the CDC came out

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.660
with in 2010.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.160
And there was a three-year
lag in the data.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.160
When the CDC put
out this slide, they

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.230
had started to use
the term epidemic

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:31.210
to describe our opioid crisis.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:35.110
And when they used the term
epidemic, they were criticized.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:37.480
The criticism was
really mainly coming

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.470
from pain organizations that
were getting funding from drug

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.000
companies that make opioids.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.120
s pain organizations
said to the CDC stop

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.470
calling this an epidemic.

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:49.030
It's not an epidemic.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.500
You're exaggerating.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.560
And by calling it an epidemic,
you're going to scare doctors.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.050
And they'll be afraid to
treat pain with opioids,

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:59.850
and you'll make the problem
of untreated pain worse.

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:00.940
So knock it off.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.180
Don't Stop calling
it an epidemic.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:08.250
And the CDC responded
by saying we're the CDC.

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:10.960
We don't use the term
epidemic lightly.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.610
This is an epidemic.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:14.100
And then they went even further.

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.437
They said not only
is this an epidemic.

00:33:16.437 --> 00:33:19.020
This is the worst drug addiction
epidemic in the United States

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:19.860
history.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.390
And that's the point that
we're making with this slide.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:26.706
So if you see the
box that says heroin,

00:33:26.706 --> 00:33:28.830
that's showing you the rate
of drug overdose deaths

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.960
during the height of the
heroin epidemic of the 1970s.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.600
And the box that
says cocaine, that's

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.360
the crack cocaine epidemic.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.940
And you're seeing that drug
overdose deaths are higher

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.790
today, far higher, than they
were at the height of those two

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:44.400
epidemics combined.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.939
And I mentioned this is old.

00:33:45.939 --> 00:33:48.480
So I'll show you what's happened
in terms of the rate of drug

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.540
overdose deaths since 2007.

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:59.800
In 2008, they went higher, 2009,
up again '10, '11, '12, '13,

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.800
'14, '15.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.610
And the preliminary data from
'16 is that it went up again.

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:08.070
Every year for
the past 20 years,

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:10.340
we've set a new
record for deaths

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.659
from drug overdoses
in the United States.

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:15.120
And then the next year,
we break that record.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.460
Not all of these deaths
are opioid overdoses.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.850
But what's really
driven the increase

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:24.070
are overdoses involving opioids.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:28.770
So these are some headlines from
just the past several weeks,

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:31.290
headlines from newspapers.

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.300
One year, drug overdoses
killed more Americans

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.929
than the entire Vietnam War.

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:39.449
44,000 Americans died in 20
years of the Vietnam War.

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:42.239
For opioid overdoses
alone, we may

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:46.530
have surpassed that figure,
more than 44,000, last year.

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.389
We're seeing a soaring
increase of infants

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:51.960
born opioid dependent,
children in foster care.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.929
Fentanyl deaths are
going up very rapidly.

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:58.410
And we're now-- we heard from
Janet Yellen a few months ago

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:02.100
that the opioid crisis is having
an impact on the workforce

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.990
and on our economy.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:05.130
What it is all of this?

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:06.630
What is the opioid crisis?

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:07.739
What's going on here?

00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:08.530
How do we frame it?

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.770
How do we understand it?

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:13.110
Well, let me start by
saying what it isn't.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:16.200
It is not a drug abuse crisis.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:22.620
It's not an epidemic of
prescription or heroin abuse.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.560
If you use the term abuse,
what that, I believe, suggests

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.230
is that the problem we're
dealing with is a lot of people

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:30.794
out there are behaving
badly, taking dangerous drugs

00:35:30.794 --> 00:35:31.710
because it feels good.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.750
And they're accidentally
killing themselves.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:35.550
And the challenge is
how do we stop people

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:39.110
from taking these dangerous
drugs and behaving badly.

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:40.510
That isn't it.

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:45.420
The opioid crisis is
an addiction epidemic.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.510
Once somebody becomes
addicted to opioids,

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.760
they're not doing
it because it's fun.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.820
Once you're addicted, you
have to keep using opioids

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:57.420
to avoid feeling awful.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.870
And while it's true some people
became addicted because they

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:03.900
were taking opioids
to enjoy the effect,

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.170
there are also many people who
became obese addicted taking

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:10.020
opioids as prescribed
by doctors.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.760
So the right way to
define the problem

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.680
is as an epidemic of addiction.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.480
And I'm going to show
you that happening

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.640
with a succession of maps.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:22.050
I believe our opiate addiction
epidemic began in 1996.

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:24.960
This is three years
into the epidemic,

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.390
and you're looking
at the rate of folks

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:29.700
showing up at state licensed
drug and alcohol treatment

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.790
programs saying that the primary
drug that they're addicted to

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.650
is a prescription opioid.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:37.050
And the states with the highest
rate of people showing up

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:38.910
addicted to
prescription opioids,

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:42.690
they show up as red
or maroon on the map.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:45.090
I want you to watch what
happens to the color of the map

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:47.460
as we go forward and
in two-year increments.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:37:04.120
So this is '99, 2001,
2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.680
What you can see is
that even by 2009,

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.610
in every state in
the country, we

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:11.860
had seen a sharp increase
in the prevalence,

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.470
the number of people with the
condition of opioid addiction.

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.330
And when you see
a sharp increase

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:18.700
in a disease over a
short period of time,

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.800
that is how you would
define an epidemic.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.760
This is interesting.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.970
This is the demographics
of those folks showing up

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:27.400
who are addicted to
prescription opioids.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.730
You see that it's, for
both males and females,

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:33.370
you see it tends
to be young adults.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.890
That doesn't mean that older
people aren't getting addicted.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:37.690
Older people are less
likely to wind up

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.070
in an addiction treatment.

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:40.960
But something that's
really interesting here,

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.760
I think striking, is
the racial breakdown.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.490
You're pretty much
looking at a blue line.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:52.870
If you try to find other
racial groups showing up,

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:55.210
African-Americans
would show up as red.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:57.742
You barely see it register
at the bottom of the graph.

00:37:57.742 --> 00:37:59.200
And if you're
thinking, well, maybe

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.300
that means that
African-Americans are less

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.200
likely to get
addiction treatment,

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.020
and that's why we
don't see them here,

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.340
that's not the explanation.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.860
This is data from the
state licensed system where

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.470
you tend to see
lower income groups

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:13.330
and nonwhite groups
overrepresented.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:15.700
If I showed you the
smoked cocaine slide,

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.980
you'd see a red line
bigger than the blue line.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.000
This is real.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.620
The racial differences are real.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.540
And if we have time
during the Q&amp;A,

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:25.450
I can share with you my
theory for why the epidemic is

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:27.320
so strikingly white.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.800
What caused our epidemic?

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.960
The CDC has been very
clear about the cause

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.030
of our opioid addiction
epidemic for a while.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:36.640
And this has been one of
their chief speaking points

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.770
about what's caused
our epidemic.

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:42.100
The green line on this slide
represents opioid consumption

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.130
in the United States, really
prescriptions for opioids.

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:49.270
The red line represents deaths
involving prescription opioids,

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:51.190
and the blue line
represents addiction.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.980
And what the CDC is saying is
that, as the green line went

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.840
up, the red line
and the blue line

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.512
went up, right along with
the increase in prescribing.

00:38:58.512 --> 00:39:00.220
They're saying this
is an epidemic that's

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:04.470
been caused by the medical
community over prescribing.

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:06.390
And their message to
us is perfectly clear.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:09.270
We may not be able to bring
the epidemic under control

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:12.304
until that green line
really comes down.

00:39:12.304 --> 00:39:14.220
It can't come all the
way down because opioids

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:17.320
are essential medicines
for palliative care.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.180
They also play an important
role when used for a few days

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.140
after major surgery.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.300
But the bulk of
our consumption is

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.540
for conditions where opioids
may be more likely to harm

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.550
a patient than help a patient.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.650
So the CDC is saying that
that green line really

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:34.376
needs to come down if we're
going to end the epidemic.

00:39:34.376 --> 00:39:36.000
I can tell you that
drug companies that

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.170
manufacture opioids
don't agree with the CDC.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:42.240
And I'm not just saying that.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.880
For a while, they
denied the association.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:48.630
They said, you know, you're
not accounting for pills that

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:49.980
get stolen from pharmacies.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.920
How do you know it's
doctor prescribing

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.040
that that's fueling this?

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.760
And they've stopped
denying the association.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.600
They now acknowledge
that these three lines

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.521
have gone up together.

00:39:58.521 --> 00:40:00.270
But what they're saying
is that if we make

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:04.616
the pills hard to crush
for snorting or injecting,

00:40:04.616 --> 00:40:06.240
so-called abuse
deterrent formulations,

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.390
and if we teach doctors to
monitor their patients more

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:11.550
closely, we can have
our cake and eat it too.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:13.274
The green line
can keep going up,

00:40:13.274 --> 00:40:14.940
and it should because
millions of people

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.680
have chronic pain
is what they'll say.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.240
But if we do the
right things, we

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.820
can make the red line and
the blue line go down.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.670
I don't think that will
work, unfortunately.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:26.130
Why did that green
start to go up?

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:30.210
In 1996, a multifaceted campaign
was launched, underwritten

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:33.780
originally by one pharmaceutical
company, Purdue Pharma,

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.370
the manufacturer
of OxyContin, when

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:37.260
it put OxyContin on the market.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.480
And ultimately, other
opioid manufacturers,

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.960
other drug companies, would
fund this campaign as well.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.260
But beginning in 1996,
the medical community

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.960
starts hearing that we've been
under prescribing opioids.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.630
We're allowing patients
to suffer needlessly

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.850
because of an overblown
fear of addiction.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:56.190
We start hearing that the
risk of addiction, when

00:40:56.190 --> 00:41:01.030
you put a patient on long-term
opioids, is much less than 1%

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:03.995
and that opioids are a
gift from mother nature.

00:41:03.995 --> 00:41:06.120
They should be used much
more for people with pain.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.160
And as I tell you this,
you may be thinking,

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.200
you know, how could
you guys be so stupid.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.610
You went to medical school.

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:12.990
How would you fall for this?

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:15.120
And what you have
to understand is

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.240
that we didn't hear this
just from a drug company.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.250
We were hearing it
from pain specialists

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:21.570
eminent in the field.

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:23.880
We were hearing it from
our professional societies.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:27.630
We were hearing it from our
hospitals and the accreditation

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:29.190
agency for our hospitals.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:33.240
We even heard from state
medical boards that told us

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.870
that the policies changed.

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:38.880
We started to hear
that you will not

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.640
be sanctioned based on the
quantity of pills that you're

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.920
prescribing or the doses
that you're giving,

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:48.270
but you will be sanctioned
for under-treatment of pain.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.010
Now I don't want you
to think that this

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.020
was all about drug
companies putting money

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:53.880
in people's pockets
and saying these are

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.140
the lies we want you to tell.

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.640
It really didn't
happen that way.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.640
The vast majority of people
involved in this movement,

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:03.630
and it really was a
movement, I think truly

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:06.690
believed what they were
saying, truly believed

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.460
that an overblown
fear of addiction

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:10.970
was leading to suffering.

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:12.720
So prescribing has
come down a bit.

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:16.440
We peaked around 2011, and
then it started to come down.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.240
This is oxycodone prescribing.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.550
The blue line is in the
United States consumption.

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:23.340
The red line is
consumption in Europe.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.380
And you can see despite
the fact that we've

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.710
come down a little bit, we are
still way higher than Europe.

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:29.820
And this is oxycodone.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.910
If I showed you hydrocodone,
which is in Vicodin,

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:35.130
the difference would
be even more striking

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:37.950
because the United States is the
only country in the world that

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:39.030
has Vicodin.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:40.830
In other countries,
if hydrocodone

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:44.100
is prescribed at all, it's
only in a cough syrup.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.167
So we've come down a bit.

00:42:46.167 --> 00:42:48.250
You're starting to hear
that there's a crack down,

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:51.450
and patients can't get
their pain medicine anymore.

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:55.180
Clearly, the data does
not support that view.

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:56.970
So here's what's
happening right now.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:00.060
You can see total opioid
overdose deaths are soaring.

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:01.890
Prescription opioid
overdose deaths,

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:05.850
the purple, dark blue
line, you see a flattening.

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:08.981
And heroin deaths have
begun to skyrocket.

00:43:08.981 --> 00:43:10.980
And because these trends
have occurred together,

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.396
the flattening of
the prescription

00:43:12.396 --> 00:43:15.780
opioids while we've seen
heroin deaths soaring,

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:19.380
there's a popular narrative to
explain this, which is wrong.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.620
What you're hearing is that
the crack down on painkillers

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.860
has led the drug
abusers to switch

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:29.550
from using the pills to heroin
and that the pain killer

00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:32.430
problem turned into a heroin
problem because of a crack

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:33.180
down on the pills.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.910
And it makes for a good media
story because, you know,

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:37.920
government tries to
tackle one problem

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.930
and inadvertently
creates another problem.

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:41.580
But that really isn't
what's going on.

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.050
There's a kernel of truth.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.540
The true part is
the switching part.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:49.770
But what's not true is that the
switching has started suddenly.

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.420
If you look at young
whites, ages 20 to 34,

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:54.430
which is the red
line on the left,

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:56.730
you'll see that heroin use
among young white people

00:43:56.730 --> 00:44:00.180
in the United States began
rising rapidly, actually,

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.020
in the late '90s.

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:02.809
This graph begins in 2003.

00:44:02.809 --> 00:44:05.100
But it's really, from the
beginning of the prescription

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.280
opioid crisis, young people
who are becoming addicted

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.440
to the pills, pills
that they were

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.110
taking either medically
or recreationally

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:14.460
or sometimes both--

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.790
a brief medical exposure for
wisdom teeth or sports injury.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:20.492
They don't get addicted from
the brief medical exposure.

00:44:20.492 --> 00:44:22.950
But they're basically getting
their first taste of the drug

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:24.620
from a doctor or a dentist.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.630
And if they like the effect, and
they're not afraid of the drug

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:30.450
anymore, a period of
recreational use may ensue.

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:32.374
So the young people,
once they get addicted,

00:44:32.374 --> 00:44:34.290
they have a hard time
maintaining their supply

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:36.166
visiting doctors.

00:44:36.166 --> 00:44:38.040
And again, it isn't that
doctors and dentists

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.990
don't like to give young
people lots of pills.

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.600
Unfortunately, we're too
comfortable doing that.

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.580
But doctors don't
like to give healthy

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:48.880
looking 25-year-olds a large
quantity on a monthly basis.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.475
Unless the doctor
is a drug dealer,

00:44:50.475 --> 00:44:51.600
they don't like to do that.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.652
So young people who
became opioid addicted,

00:44:53.652 --> 00:44:55.110
they'd wind up on
the black market.

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:56.970
The pills are very
expensive on the street,

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:58.678
have always been
expensive on the street.

00:44:58.678 --> 00:45:01.170
They didn't suddenly become
expensive in the context

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:02.970
of a crack down.

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:05.070
From the beginning, an
80 milligram OxyContin

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:07.230
sold for $80, $1 a milligram.

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:09.314
And that's still the price
today-- $1 a milligram.

00:45:09.314 --> 00:45:11.521
So if the young person was
in a region of the country

00:45:11.521 --> 00:45:13.290
where heroin was
available, they switched.

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:16.662
And what's happened steadily
over the past 20 years

00:45:16.662 --> 00:45:18.120
is we've seen heroin
move into more

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.450
regions of the country where
it wasn't previously available.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:23.280
Quaint New England
towns that did not

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.049
have a heroin
problem in the past

00:45:25.049 --> 00:45:27.090
now have a heroin problem
because it's flooded in

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:29.040
to meet the demand
for it by this growing

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.080
number of young people who have
become addicted to prescription

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:31.800
opioids.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:35.610
What about middle-aged people,
the green line, 45 years

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:36.540
and older?

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.710
You don't see heroin use rising.

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:39.210
Why not?

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:40.890
Does that mean
they've been spared

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:42.750
from the opioid
addiction epidemic?

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:45.120
Unfortunately, they
haven't been spared.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.437
But they don't have
to turn to heroin.

00:45:47.437 --> 00:45:49.770
The older group people in
their 40s up through their 80s

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:51.728
are developing opiate
addiction almost entirely

00:45:51.728 --> 00:45:53.670
through medical use.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:55.290
Sometimes, it starts
as an acute pain

00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:57.020
problem or post-surgical pain.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:00.150
And they're put on opioids,
and they never come off.

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:03.637
And we may call them a chronic
pain patient after that.

00:46:03.637 --> 00:46:05.220
And they're continuing
to get opioids.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.250
This older group, when they
become opioid addicted,

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:10.014
they don't have a
hard time continuing

00:46:10.014 --> 00:46:11.430
to get a large
quantity of opioids

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:12.840
from doctors on a monthly basis.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.180
Even if the patient
starts to come in early

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.070
and asks for higher
doses, and there

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:18.900
are signs that the
patient is addicted,

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.840
the doctor doesn't want to
put a label like addiction

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.499
on the patient.

00:46:22.499 --> 00:46:24.540
And since the patient is
attributing the behavior

00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.430
to a worsening of pain, when
they get referred anywhere,

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:27.810
it's to pain management.

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:28.986
And then it's hit or miss.

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:30.360
There are pain
management doctors

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:33.000
who do a phenomenal job of
working with these people

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.670
to get them off of the opioids
and to treat their pain

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:36.889
with other modalities.

00:46:36.889 --> 00:46:39.180
And when you can get these
people off of their opioids,

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.930
you'll often see that
their pain improves,

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:42.960
and their quality of life
and function improves.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.360
But there are pain
specialists out there as well

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.010
who have no qualms
about going even

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.484
higher and higher on the dose.

00:46:49.484 --> 00:46:51.150
Something that many
people don't realize

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:55.500
is that, up until recently, we
were seeing far more overdoses

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.012
in the older group that gets
pills more easily from doctors

00:46:58.012 --> 00:46:59.970
than we were seeing in
the younger group that's

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:01.060
been switching to heroin.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:03.720
This is data from 2010 to 2012.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.860
I can tell you it's changed
because of fentanyl.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.606
But in that time
frame, the age group--

00:47:09.606 --> 00:47:10.980
it was middle-aged
folks that had

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:14.040
the highest rate of opioid
overdose in the United States.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.650
If you look specifically
for heroin, the dark blue,

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:19.350
you'd see it was 25 to 34.

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:20.930
This has changed
because of fentanyl.

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:24.600
The younger group, as
of 2016, has caught up.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:29.190
We are now seeing more deaths
in heroin users because

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:30.990
of fentanyl that's
in the supply.

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:33.600
So the reason we're seeing
the soaring increase in deaths

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.670
in heroin users is
because of the heroin

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:37.920
supply became much
more dangerous.

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.500
Increasingly, it has
fentanyl mixed into it

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.420
or fentanyl sold as heroin.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:44.940
And fentanyl is 50
times more potent.

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.984
So it's very easy
to overdose on it.

00:47:46.984 --> 00:47:48.900
Something that's interesting
is you don't even

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:52.410
see a bar for people over 65.

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:55.710
When it comes to the
overdose deaths for seniors,

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:58.410
we're not really
finding very many.

00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:00.960
But that probably does
not mean that they're not

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.070
dying of overdoses.

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:05.070
When a senior dies
of an overdose,

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:07.472
they're very rarely
recorded as an overdose.

00:48:07.472 --> 00:48:09.180
If grandma doesn't
wake up in the morning

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.280
because she took
too much OxyContin,

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.532
and grandma had multiple
medical problems, even

00:48:14.532 --> 00:48:15.990
in a situation
where everybody knew

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:17.531
grandma had a problem
with her pills,

00:48:17.531 --> 00:48:20.010
nobody wants grandma to
have died of an overdose.

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:22.920
And what typically happens is
the patient's primary care doc

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.620
or geriatrician is called and
asked for a cause of death.

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.566
And that's what goes on
the death certificate.

00:48:27.566 --> 00:48:29.190
You can see in the
state of California,

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:31.830
the age group green
here, 65 and up,

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:34.320
you see is the age group with
the highest rate of people

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:38.310
showing up in emergency rooms
being treated for an overdose.

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:41.740
It's just when it comes to the
deaths, we don't see seniors.

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.140
We have three
groups of Americans

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:46.080
who are opioid addicted,
just to clarify,

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.792
that younger group that's
been switching to heroin.

00:48:48.792 --> 00:48:50.250
Then we've got the
middle age group

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:52.230
that I mentioned that
doesn't have to switch

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:54.175
and has been
overdosing on pills.

00:48:54.175 --> 00:48:55.800
And we have a third
group, which really

00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:00.210
became infected from a much
earlier epidemic in cities that

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:02.040
were hit hard with
heroin in the 1970s

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.050
is where you'll find them.

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:05.610
And in that group,
we're also seeing

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:08.050
deaths going up right
now because the heroin

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:09.369
supply is so dangerous.

00:49:09.369 --> 00:49:11.160
How do we bring the
epidemic under control?

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.830
The strategies are
similar to the strategies

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:16.890
for responding even to a
communicable disease epidemic.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:20.640
What would we do to
stop an Ebola outbreak?

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.410
Really two things,
you'd contain it

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:24.960
to preventing more people from
getting the Ebola infection.

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.550
And you'd see that the
people who are infected

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:28.008
are getting treatment
so they don't

00:49:28.008 --> 00:49:29.541
die from there Ebola infection.

00:49:29.541 --> 00:49:32.040
That's what we have to do for
our opioid addiction epidemic.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.248
We have to prevent more
people from getting addicted.

00:49:34.248 --> 00:49:37.260
More than anything, that's
cautious prescribing.

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.240
It's not just say
no, which is what

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.480
Donald Trump said yesterday.

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.435
You know, tell kids
just say say no.

00:49:43.435 --> 00:49:45.060
That isn't going to
get us out of this.

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.830
We need much more
cautious prescribing.

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:48.871
We have to see that the
millions who are addicted

00:49:48.871 --> 00:49:50.460
get access to
effective treatment.

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.870
And you know, the war on drugs
rightly has a bad reputation.

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:55.560
It led to mass incarceration.

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:58.260
But there is a role for making
pills and heroin and fentanyl

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:01.170
more difficult to access,
while making treatment easier

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:02.280
to access.

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.680
We haven't responded
appropriately because,

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.830
for many years, the opioid lobby
framed the problem this way.

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:10.230
This was a slide shown
at an FDA meeting

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:13.140
to argue against
closing a loophole that

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:16.230
had Vicodin in the
wrong category where

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:19.020
it could be prescribed six
months worth of Vicodin

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:20.010
at one visit.

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:22.230
And the argument
was made to the FDA

00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:24.840
that, if you put Vicodin into
a more restrictive category,

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.920
you'll be penalizing this pain
patient for the bad behavior

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.620
of these drug abusers.

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:32.490
And so, therefore, you
need to be balanced.

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:36.090
And for many years,
that's worked, the notion

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:39.000
that the harms were somehow
limited to so-called drug

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.740
abusers and that
millions of patients

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:43.380
were being helped by
aggressive prescribing.

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.700
Obviously we don't have
these two distinct groups.

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.270
There's tremendous
amount of overlap.

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:50.631
And it's not much less
than 1% of patients

00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:53.130
who are treated with long-term
opioids that become addicted.

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:54.750
We see that about
a third of patients

00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:58.110
who are on long-term opioids
meet criteria for addiction.

00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:00.510
And if you look at the
deaths and people who

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:02.832
are dying of the prescription
opioid overdoses,

00:51:02.832 --> 00:51:04.290
in the state of
Utah, in one study,

00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:06.750
they found that
92% of the patients

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:08.400
were receiving
legitimate prescriptions

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.860
from doctors for a
diagnosis of chronic pain.

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.500
The next of kin believed that
their loved ones were also

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.830
addicted, but these were
legitimate patients.

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:18.690
And I'm just going
to start to end here

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:20.490
by making a final point.

00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:22.830
This is the AIDS epidemic.

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:27.660
The AIDS epidemic
peaked in 1995.

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:29.447
It starts around 1980.

00:51:29.447 --> 00:51:30.780
And then you see deaths plummet.

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.060
And why did we see
deaths from AIDS plummet?

00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:36.660
We had the introduction of
antiretroviral therapies.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.210
We turned HIV infection
from a terminal disease

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:41.730
into a chronic disease.

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:44.940
And the trajectory for the
opioid addiction epidemic

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:48.284
is similar, only we've
surpassed deaths from AIDS.

00:51:48.284 --> 00:51:50.700
And it doesn't look like we're
turning the corner on this.

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:52.890
But I do believe we have
a medication that if there

00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:56.490
was better access to it today
we could turn the corner.

00:51:56.490 --> 00:52:00.120
I'm talking about buprenorphine,
which is also called suboxone.

00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.380
And I'm not just speculating.

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:03.357
In France, it was
released in the mid '90s

00:52:03.357 --> 00:52:05.940
without many of the restrictions
we have in the United States.

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:08.580
A fair amount was diverted
onto the black market.

00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:10.560
But it's a very
different type of opioid.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.480
Even when it's misused
on the black market,

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.080
even when it's injected, it's
quite difficult to overdose on.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.240
And it is a medicine
that if taken the way

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.310
it's supposed to be,
the way it's prescribed,

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:21.877
and many people
do, more than half

00:52:21.877 --> 00:52:23.460
of patients treated
with buprenorphine

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:25.170
have good outcomes.

00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:27.600
They have a good improvement
in their quality of life.

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.350
They can function.

00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:30.420
They can do well--

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:34.800
79% drop in overdose deaths
in France within six years.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.180
So I'm going to finish up here.

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.638
If you are interested in what
the federal government should

00:52:38.638 --> 00:52:40.650
be doing about the opiate
addiction epidemic,

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:44.040
I've got a paper in the
current issue of JAMA,

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:48.390
coauthored with Tom Frieden,
our former CDC director.

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:50.490
Donald Trump
mentioned-- actually,

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:52.470
he announced yesterday
that our opioid crisis

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:54.270
is a public health emergency.

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:56.040
What we didn't hear
from Donald Trump

00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:00.140
was a plan for addressing it,
and we haven't had a plan yet,

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:01.140
unfortunately.

00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:02.744
So in summary, the
United States is

00:53:02.744 --> 00:53:04.410
in the midst of the
worst drug addiction

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:05.760
epidemic in its history.

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.382
To bring the epidemic under
control, to bring it to an end,

00:53:08.382 --> 00:53:10.590
we have to prevent more
people from getting addicted.

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:12.660
We have to see that
those who are addicted

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.490
receive access to
effective treatment.

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:15.353
Thank you.

00:53:15.353 --> 00:53:17.285
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.340
- Thank you, Andrew.

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:30.620
I hope you're keeping
your questions,

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.150
you're getting your
questions ready,

00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:33.860
and that you are
recognizing some

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:37.040
of the very important themes
that have already been

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.580
expressed by our two speakers.

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:44.180
The next speaker, our final
speaker in this panel,

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:47.030
is Dr. Andrew Papachristos.

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:49.160
And we're going to
have an opportunity now

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:52.060
to hear about the emerging
epidemics in gun violence.

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:56.510
- Thank you.

00:53:56.510 --> 00:54:00.020
So just let's get into this.

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:03.704
Setting aside mass shootings,
which is hard to do,

00:54:03.704 --> 00:54:05.120
given sort of
recent events, there

00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:08.120
are two types of
violence, gun violence,

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:11.850
that occupy sort of center
stage right now in this country.

00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:15.320
The first is what I'm going
to call neighborhood violence.

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.090
And usually, by
this, what we think

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:19.100
about the staggering loss
of life in our cities,

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.110
mainly of young men of color.

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:22.880
And typically, in
presentations like this,

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:26.540
this is where I show you a
series of depressing figures

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:30.410
that point out to you the
massive inequalities associated

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:33.230
with being young, living in
a disadvantaged community,

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:35.100
being a person of color.

00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:36.920
And I'm not going
to do that, only

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:38.690
to say that tens of
thousands of lives

00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:40.504
are affected each year,
not only as victims

00:54:40.504 --> 00:54:42.170
of fatal and non-fatal
gunshot injuries,

00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:44.394
but those experiencing violence.

00:54:44.394 --> 00:54:46.310
So the other type of
violence that's on center

00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:49.790
stage these days is
police violence, which

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:52.310
also disproportionately
affects young men of color

00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:53.870
in particular communities.

00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:56.390
And each new case
of police violence

00:54:56.390 --> 00:55:00.200
reminds us that we are dealing
with different types of reality

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:02.900
in a post-Ferguson era, in
particular the re-invoking

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:04.670
of law and order
rhetoric and what

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:06.410
this will mean for
the future of policing

00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:09.230
in the current
political climate.

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:11.305
And we have lots of
us sort of that work

00:55:11.305 --> 00:55:13.430
in the criminal justice
domain trying to figure out

00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:15.500
what reform or what
types of policies

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:17.180
can look like in this domain.

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:19.100
But at times, when we
talk about these two

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:21.740
forms of gun violence,
they're often sort of pitched

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:23.360
as at odds with each other.

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:26.930
We count the number of bodies,
say, in a city like Chicago.

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:30.260
At the same time, we talk
about these dramatic acts

00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:32.574
of essentially sort
of state violence

00:55:32.574 --> 00:55:33.740
that happen in this country.

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:35.695
And we get sides
talking past each other.

00:55:35.695 --> 00:55:37.820
So we can see like Heather
Mac Donald on this side,

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:38.810
other people on this side.

00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:40.309
And are saying, oh,
they all matter.

00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:42.080
But they of course both matter.

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.540
Understanding neighborhood
violence and police violence

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:45.260
both matter.

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:47.720
And in particular, I'm going
to argue and have argued

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:51.260
in my work that they
actually both stem

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:54.140
from some of the
same social problems,

00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:56.810
in particular
inequality and power.

00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:57.310
Right?

00:55:57.310 --> 00:55:59.630
In this large
sociological sense--

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:02.120
I'm a sociologist by the way--

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:04.640
we're talking about inequality
in resources, access

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:07.105
to resources, opportunities,
wealth, health, education,

00:56:07.105 --> 00:56:08.300
and social capital.

00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:10.130
And when we talk
about power, we're

00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:13.560
talking about systems of
power and relationships

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:15.620
and who has power, who
doesn't have power,

00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:17.390
how these things play out.

00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:19.760
And I could give you a 20
minute lecture on this,

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.509
but that's not what
I'm going to do today.

00:56:21.509 --> 00:56:23.060
Instead what I want
to talk about are

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:26.800
the commonalities
in these behaviors

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.810
and the micro-level
human social behavior

00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:31.040
that I think contributes
to the patterns of violence

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.530
we see both in
neighborhood gun violence

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:36.410
and police-involved
gun violence.

00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:38.150
And I'm going to
argue, in particular,

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:41.910
that I think when we look at
human social relationships,

00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:45.080
the ties between yourselves,
your friends, your friends'

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:48.860
friends, your neighbors, that
that can tell us something

00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:51.890
about neighborhood violence and
police violence, which can help

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:54.950
us understand how they may or
may not be contagious and then,

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:58.640
importantly, what we might
be able to do about it.

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:01.930
So I'm going to argue that,
in fact, network science is

00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:04.500
one of these sets of tools,
especially how it's been used

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:06.820
in epidemiology, that
can help us unpack

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:08.680
these sorts of
issues, in particular

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:10.270
how gun violence works.

00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:14.560
So you've actually silently
been digesting network science

00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.870
all day with that
graphic with the nodes

00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:18.981
and talking about contagion.

00:57:18.981 --> 00:57:19.480
Right?

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:20.950
The nodes and the
lines, that's what

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:23.491
we're talking about when we're
talking about network science.

00:57:23.491 --> 00:57:26.260
If I say social network, some
people think social media.

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.210
And that's of course
a type of network.

00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:29.710
But what I'm going
to talk about are

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:32.440
they actual ties
among human beings--

00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:35.950
social relationships, neighbors,
coworkers, friends, partners,

00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:37.780
even your enemies, in fact.

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:39.460
And so network
science is the study

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:41.590
of how these social
relationships affect

00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:43.300
what you feel, think, and do.

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:44.580
They affect what you buy.

00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:46.090
They affect who you marry.

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:48.060
They affect the votes you cast.

00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:50.710
They affect how you get
a disease, whether you're

00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:51.700
susceptible.

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:53.170
They affect how
revolutions start.

00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:55.086
They affect how street
gangs fight each other.

00:57:55.086 --> 00:57:57.540
And there's lots of different
science for all those topics

00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:01.030
that I've mentioned that
I'm happy to point you to.

00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:03.520
So when we talk about gun
violence as an epidemic,

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.940
we're generally talking about
what I'd already mentioned,

00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:09.850
trying to explain these big
gaps in these graphs over time

00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:12.310
across populations
and across space.

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:14.140
And so sociologists,
criminologists,

00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:17.080
epidemiologists, have used
spatial diffusion models

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:20.890
to point out that gun violence
does indeed sort of spread

00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:25.090
through time and space with sort
of signatures of an epidemic.

00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:28.740
Here's what I want
to put in your head.

00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:32.280
Our models almost inevitably
model gun violence

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.560
like an airborne
pathogen, tracking

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:37.290
how rates go from a
high crime neighborhood

00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:38.670
to the next neighborhood.

00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:40.100
And if you believe
this, you catch

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:42.650
a bullet like you catch a cold.

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:45.630
Stray bullet
shootings are tragic,

00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:48.610
but they're not the majority of
gun violence in this country.

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:50.447
So all of these
deaths are tragic.

00:58:50.447 --> 00:58:51.780
But they're decidedly nonrandom.

00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:55.080
So if it's an epidemic,
what type of epidemic is it?

00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:56.350
How is it transmitted?

00:58:56.350 --> 00:58:56.850
Right?

00:58:56.850 --> 00:59:00.060
I'm going to argue that it's
transmitted more like an STI

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:01.780
than it is like a cold per se.

00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:02.280
Right?

00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:06.450
And I specifically want to look
at the types of behaviors that

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:08.400
connect people
that can facilitate

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.770
the diffusion of
neighborhood and gun violence

00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:12.270
within populations.

00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:15.480
As an aside, if we're
talking about gun violence,

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:18.630
you need something
like a gun and bullets

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:21.600
for that gun to actually
become infected as it were.

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.540
Even the language we use around
guns follow the language we use

00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:27.050
around needles-- clean
guns, dirty guns--

00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:28.430
so the same sorts of principles.

00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:30.450
So I'm basically
stealing all this stuff

00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:33.961
that we used sort of in HIV
research and Hep-C research

00:59:33.961 --> 00:59:36.210
and needle exchange and
trying to think about how this

00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:38.310
can help us understand that.

00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:41.910
So in your head, I want you to
think about a certain behavior

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:44.760
that 100 years of
criminology and sociology

00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:47.550
has told us is associated
with victimization, which

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:52.440
is risky behavior, doing
things that put you

00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:54.110
at risk with other people.

00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:56.610
I'm going to use largely when
I'm talking about neighborhood

00:59:56.610 --> 00:59:57.821
violence arrest records.

00:59:57.821 --> 00:59:58.320
Right?

00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:01.299
So Michelle and I
rob someone together.

01:00:01.299 --> 01:00:03.090
We're committing a
risky behavior together.

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:06.930
And then I'm going to link
individuals over time and space

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:09.580
through these sorts of
networks, sort of one by one.

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.694
So if Michelle and I
committed sort of a crime

01:00:11.694 --> 01:00:13.110
or offended together,
and then she

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:15.068
committed one with Daphne
and then with Andrew,

01:00:15.068 --> 01:00:16.080
we'd have like a chain.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:16.774
All right?

01:00:16.774 --> 01:00:18.690
And then we're going to
something very similar

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:22.050
when we talk about police and
their bad behavior by the way.

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:24.990
So for anybody who
wants to read anything,

01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:27.330
just Papachristos is
pretty easy to find.

01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:28.800
There aren't many of us.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.062
And these are the papers
that will put you to sleep.

01:00:31.062 --> 01:00:32.520
But visually, I'm
going to show you

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.730
something slightly different.

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:35.313
And I'm going explain
the first graph.

01:00:35.313 --> 01:00:36.910
And hopefully, it'll make sense.

01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:38.576
And then we'll move
to a much larger one

01:00:38.576 --> 01:00:40.000
that won't make sense.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.600
So one of our key findings
from all this research

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.400
is that all those
dramatic disparities

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:49.080
you've seen across populations
are worse within populations.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.050
So violence concentrates
just like an epidemic

01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:54.210
within populations.

01:00:54.210 --> 01:00:56.590
Our first study was actually
here in Boston-- well,

01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:58.173
I guess we're in
Cambridge-- was there

01:00:58.173 --> 01:01:00.030
in Boston, sort of in
the uppermost corner

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:01.765
area and Mattapan area.

01:01:01.765 --> 01:01:03.390
And what you're
looking at is a network

01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:08.190
of 763 largely young black
and Cape Verdean young men.

01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:10.770
Every one of those
dots is a human being.

01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:12.200
They're not a
statistical summary.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.410
They are a person.

01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:13.910
Right?

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:15.270
There are largely men.

01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:18.930
About 30% are members of
street groups or gangs.

01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:21.390
Those ties are those
links I described,

01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:23.760
tied to each other
in time and space

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.940
by a particular behavior that
was observed and recorded.

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:30.060
Those red dots, as
you probably guessed,

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:33.000
are the victims of fatal and
non-fatal gunshot injuries,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.220
excluding self-harm and
police shootings in this case.

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:41.730
So the nontechnical thing you're
seeing with all those red dots

01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:42.401
is clustering.

01:01:42.401 --> 01:01:42.900
Right?

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.060
Like my kid, probably
the 11-year-old,

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:46.770
took a handful of
Christmas ornaments,

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:49.020
threw it in the same spot
of the Christmas tree.

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.820
There's only one
instance that you

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:54.510
see in here of an
isolated gunshot victim.

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:55.170
Right?

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:57.630
More importantly, and here's
what I want you to remember,

01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:59.950
this is about 6% of the
community's population.

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:04.600
And it's 85% of all the fatal
and non-fatal gunshot injuries.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:09.390
The other 15%, does anybody want
to guess what type they are?

01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:12.346
Domestic and then actually
two stray bullet killings that

01:02:12.346 --> 01:02:13.470
occurred in that community.

01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:15.761
Right So domestic violence
follows a slightly different

01:02:15.761 --> 01:02:16.570
pattern.

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:18.750
So we're focusing right
now on those red dots.

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:20.100
But the other thing I
want you to focus on

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.516
are all the places
where there are

01:02:21.516 --> 01:02:23.760
no shootings in this
population that has all

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.150
of the aggregate risk factors.

01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:26.650
They all live in
the same community.

01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:27.810
They're largely young.

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:29.402
They're largely men of color.

01:02:29.402 --> 01:02:31.110
All right, there are
some women in there.

01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:32.568
But they have all
the risk factors.

01:02:32.568 --> 01:02:35.220
But even within this
population, your risk

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:37.260
of being in these
clusters is astronomical.

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:41.370
In this case, being in this
network, being part of the 6%,

01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:44.250
increases your risk
over 600% of being

01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:46.150
a victim of a gunshot injury.

01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:48.600
So this is Boston.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:49.710
This is Chicago.

01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:51.100
It's not a brain scan.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.280
This is a network
of some 107,000

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.570
individuals with all of the
same patterns we see in Boston--

01:02:57.570 --> 01:02:58.920
intense clustering.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.070
90% of the gunshot victims
in the city of Chicago

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:03.990
are in a single social network.

01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:05.640
It's a very big one.

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:06.360
Right?

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:09.330
But again, even within
populations with all these risk

01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:11.250
factors, we see this
intense clustering.

01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:14.490
Just a few more cities, here's
the city of East Palo Alto.

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.350
Again, you see sort of
a string of shootings

01:03:16.350 --> 01:03:18.960
going across the middle
almost like an equator.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.940
And in Newark, New Jersey, you
see very intense clustering,

01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:23.610
which is actually
the product of people

01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:25.485
who serve housing projects.

01:03:25.485 --> 01:03:27.360
We can talk about what
creates these networks

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:28.220
if there is time.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.970
Right, so you see this
intense clustering.

01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:31.200
That's the first
thing we've learned.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.810
The second thing we've learned
is that exposure matters.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.770
So we know exposure to
violence matters a lot.

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:37.319
It actually changes your brain.

01:03:37.319 --> 01:03:38.610
It affects all sorts of things.

01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:42.060
But it also increases your
risk of being a victim.

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.260
It makes sense.

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:44.470
How did we study this?

01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:46.320
So here's a
particular individual,

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.590
one of those 107,000 people
in the Chicago graph.

01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:52.150
This person has a certain
number of associates.

01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:53.730
Their linked to each other.

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:55.500
And some percentage
of those associates

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.210
have been gunshot victims.

01:03:57.210 --> 01:03:59.160
So we did this sort
of for everyone

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:02.190
in that big network I showed you
that looked like a brain scan.

01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:03.660
And here's what we found.

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:08.580
So the x-axis going from 0 to 1
is how many of your associates

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:10.830
were gunshot
victims, so exposure,

01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:12.360
crude measure of exposure.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:15.570
And the y-axis is your
individual probability

01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:19.590
of being a victim from 0
to essentially a coin toss.

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:22.170
And you can see it right
away, the baseline probability

01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:26.520
for a young, black gang member
in Chicago is about 11%.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:31.830
All right, and then once you
teeter over to the 40% area,

01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:35.060
your odds of being a
victim are about 20%.

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.650
And I was going to put this
in context of other epidemics,

01:04:37.650 --> 01:04:39.630
but I couldn't do the
math quite correctly.

01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:41.100
So let me give you
a different way

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:44.590
to look at this because 1 in
6 is pretty easy to calculate.

01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:47.280
So if you're a young, black gang
member who 20% of your friends

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.010
have been shot, you are
playing Russian roulette sort

01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:52.570
of in terms of
your level of risk.

01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:56.700
Finally, these things
cascade over time.

01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:57.680
So I get shot.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.960
Then my associate gets shot.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.080
Then my associate's
associates get shot.

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.740
So it looks something like this.

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:06.330
And in a recent JAMA study
with two students from Harvard,

01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:08.070
we did this for Chicago.

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:10.830
Here are three
cascades from Chicago--

01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:16.440
one with 12 victims, one with
34 victims, one with 64 victims.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.210
Now here's the thing,
if it's an epidemic,

01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:19.680
I want you to remember.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.950
Almost 2/3 of all shootings
in Chicago happened in one

01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:24.840
of these cascades.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:25.800
Someone gets shot.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:26.810
One of their friends gets shot.

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:27.893
Another friend gets shot--

01:05:27.893 --> 01:05:29.130
63%.

01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:30.990
The average time
between those shootings?

01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:32.670
83 days.

01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:34.750
So we know who's at risk.

01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:37.680
We know that timing,
essentially, between events.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.060
Looks like an epidemic to me.

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.530
What about police violence?

01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:43.660
What about police
misconduct and violence?

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:44.620
This is new research.

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.920
I don't have any
published papers yet.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.720
We're about six months in
on this and like six years

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.670
in on the other sort of work.

01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:57.270
But police, here's our theories
of police violence summarized

01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:58.310
in one slide.

01:05:58.310 --> 01:06:01.010
That person has a kid who's
seen the Lego Movie a bunch.

01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:06.200
We've got a bunch of bad apples,
or we've got a bad department.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.647
That's the patch that the
officers from the LAPD Rampart

01:06:09.647 --> 01:06:10.230
Division made.

01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:12.560
So when you start making
patches and t-shirts,

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.977
you're more than
a few bad apples.

01:06:13.977 --> 01:06:14.476
Right?

01:06:14.476 --> 01:06:16.100
There's some kind
of system involved.

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.920
So this is our theory--
bad apples, bad system.

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.901
And how we affect change
will matter dramatically.

01:06:21.901 --> 01:06:22.400
Right?

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.570
Weed out the bad apples.

01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:24.799
Change the system.

01:06:24.799 --> 01:06:26.840
By the way, the answer is
it's a network, in case

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.490
you wanted the punchline.

01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:30.460
But more importantly,
if we think

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.690
how police officers
learn, every cop

01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:35.090
hears this their first
day out of the Academy.

01:06:35.090 --> 01:06:37.460
Forget everything you
learned, and we're

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.860
going to show you what
real police is about.

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:42.612
And the first time I gave
this talk in a class,

01:06:42.612 --> 01:06:43.570
there was some student.

01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:45.320
She was texting away She
was nodding like this.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:45.830
Right?

01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:47.080
She came after me after class.

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.100
Turns out her dad
is an LAPD officer.

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.194
She showed me her phone.

01:06:50.194 --> 01:06:51.110
Her dad had said this.

01:06:51.110 --> 01:06:52.700
Look, it's not training day.

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:54.184
But yeah, that's pretty much it.

01:06:54.184 --> 01:06:55.100
That's how it happens.

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.100
That's how we learn this stuff.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:56.880
We learn it on the job.

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.130
We learn it from our partners.

01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:58.970
Right?

01:06:58.970 --> 01:07:01.490
So I took publicly
available data

01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:04.550
by the way from the
Chicago Police Department

01:07:04.550 --> 01:07:06.890
and every single complaint
filed against police officers

01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:08.056
during this six-year period.

01:07:08.056 --> 01:07:10.100
It's about 170,000 complaints.

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:14.030
We also looked at every
incidence of a police shooting.

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.920
And there are about
405 of them that we

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.704
can locate in the data itself.

01:07:18.704 --> 01:07:20.870
This is what the data looks
like because this is all

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.655
made available by the
Invisible Institute.

01:07:22.655 --> 01:07:24.170
It's fantastic work.

01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:25.900
I can click on any
police officer.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.180
Here Here's one who
had 36 complaints.

01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:31.070
You can see when and
where those complaints.

01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:33.440
But more importantly, from
the network perspective,

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.559
you can see who that
cop was with when

01:07:36.559 --> 01:07:37.850
someone complained against him.

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:40.250
So just like I
did before, we can

01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:42.530
look at how officers
are linked by doing

01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:44.970
risky things or bad things.

01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:47.144
So when we do that, I'm
going to zip through these

01:07:47.144 --> 01:07:49.310
and just let you know that
we're going to be looking

01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:52.550
at about 7,000 police officers.

01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:55.370
This represents basically the
demographics of the police

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:56.790
force of Chicago by the way.

01:07:56.790 --> 01:08:01.310
It's about 50% white,
20% black, 20% Hispanic.

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:03.970
And this is what the
network looks like.

01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:06.620
It's about 7,000 police
officers, about half

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:08.570
the Chicago Police Department.

01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:11.310
And those colors you
see are just clustering.

01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:14.570
So there's just clumps of
sort of groupings of officers

01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:15.170
if you will.

01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:16.670
So if you you're
all the same color,

01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:18.861
you have the same ties,
the same other peoples.

01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:21.319
So if Daphne and Michelle and
I are all tied to each other,

01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:23.209
we would all be
purple for example.

01:08:23.209 --> 01:08:25.250
And if you had ties to
each other, but not to us,

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:28.490
you'd all be a different color.

01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:32.990
Importantly, most officers
have one complaint.

01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:36.979
OK, so they have one complaint,
and then some officers

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:38.330
have 120 complaints.

01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:41.300
In fact, one officer
has 120 complaint.

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:44.479
The last complaint he had, which
were he was finally fired over,

01:08:44.479 --> 01:08:47.120
DNA evidence of a
suspect was recovered

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.920
on the barrel of his gun.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:52.580
He was acquitted and is now
suing the city of Chicago.

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:57.109
But the good news is most
police only have one complaint.

01:08:57.109 --> 01:09:00.170
OK, so this distribution
is something

01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:01.910
we can talk about as well.

01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:04.520
Here's the makeup
of a gang unit.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.760
Again, even within divisions
of the police department,

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.710
you see clumping,
which we see in sort

01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:11.640
of normal human social networks.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.920
This is the narcotics unit.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:17.800
And I could do this sort
of on and on and on.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.582
Here's where we're
going with this.

01:09:19.582 --> 01:09:21.540
We want to know where
these networks come from.

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.164
We're working on a
series of model that

01:09:23.164 --> 01:09:26.520
predicts why police officers
form these sorts of ties

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.560
and with whom they
form them with.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:31.340
We're already seeing
some very interesting age

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.270
and racial differences
within the network.

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:36.630
We're looking at what officers
co-offending careers look like.

01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:38.640
So the people that
have one offense

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.690
and don't do anything
again, that's good.

01:09:40.690 --> 01:09:41.189
Right?

01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:42.840
The people that
have 120, we want

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.850
to know how they got to be 120.

01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:46.960
We want to know, as
this title suggests,

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.189
is this bad behavior
contagious in and of itself.

01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:52.914
And just to show you
some descriptive ideas

01:09:52.914 --> 01:09:53.830
of where we're going--

01:09:53.830 --> 01:09:55.380
I don't have any numbers yet--

01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:58.230
I'm looking at only the
complaints made by citizens.

01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:00.000
So lots of complaints
are also made

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.850
about officers against each
other or sort of a superior

01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:04.590
making a complaint
against an officer.

01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:05.965
But the ones we
really care about

01:10:05.965 --> 01:10:08.910
are when citizens complain
sort of against officers.

01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:10.770
These are 6,000 officers.

01:10:10.770 --> 01:10:12.630
We put all of the gunshot--

01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:13.350
excuse me.

01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:15.183
Now this is slightly
different because we're

01:10:15.183 --> 01:10:17.320
talking about the
officers who shoot people.

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.530
So the red dots in this
case are the officers

01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:22.710
who shoot, pulled their
weapon and fired their weapon.

01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:26.820
And, you know, there's
some clustering, not quite

01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:29.490
as tight as we saw in the
neighborhood victimization one.

01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:32.970
We're looking at this right now.

01:10:32.970 --> 01:10:34.420
They're statistically
rare events.

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:36.660
So they're actually
pretty hard to model.

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:39.280
We're seeing some evidence
of contagion at the moment.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:42.210
We're looking to add in
non-fatal events like tasers

01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:42.820
as well.

01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.195
So hopefully, I'll
have some more

01:10:44.195 --> 01:10:47.960
to say on that sort of
in the years to come.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:50.560
So what does this mean
for violence prevention?

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.700
It means a couple of things.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:56.950
And as I was sitting
here today, I'm

01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:59.759
going to say a word that's
going to make you uneasy.

01:10:59.759 --> 01:11:01.300
But when everybody
else said it, it's

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:02.850
not going to make you uneasy.

01:11:02.850 --> 01:11:04.380
Surveillance.

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:04.930
Right?

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:07.180
All of y'all get to talk
about health surveillance all

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:08.690
the time, and
nobody bats an eye.

01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:10.898
And if I say surveillance,
people are like no no, no.

01:11:10.898 --> 01:11:12.820
It should make you
uncomfortable because

01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:15.362
of the hyper-surveillance of
essentially young men of color

01:11:15.362 --> 01:11:17.320
in this country and people
of color in general.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.111
That's actually not
what I'm talking about.

01:11:19.111 --> 01:11:20.716
And I should say
also, in general,

01:11:20.716 --> 01:11:22.840
everything I'm going to
tell you would be an effort

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.060
to remove this sort
of violence prevention

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:27.520
from the domain of police
and move it into a broader

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.830
public health or
even municipal system

01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:32.380
in which we can use
this information

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:36.730
to divert people and services
to those who are most at risk

01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:40.360
in between those 83
days from gunshot victim

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:41.770
to gunshot victim.

01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:44.630
And we know-- we know
stuff that works.

01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:46.330
How do we get a trauma
care specialist?

01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:48.038
How do we get a health
care professional?

01:11:48.038 --> 01:11:50.800
How do we get a priest, a
football coach, an educator,

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:54.220
and, yes, sometimes a cop,
into those networks when

01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:55.180
they're needed?

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:55.990
Right?

01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:58.750
So sort of a shooting-- let's
call it a monitoring system

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:00.460
if I can't use the
word surveillance.

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:02.740
And let me just say,
to go back to some

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:05.680
of the comments that were made
earlier, it should be local.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:06.700
It should be open.

01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:09.040
And it should be
responsive, which

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.710
will also help police
violence, which

01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:13.180
we'll talk about in a minute.

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:14.290
I will tell you this.

01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:16.720
On the policing side
of things, there

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:21.610
have been multiple studies
and systematic reviews that

01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:25.900
show you, if you have
focused policing efforts,

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:30.580
you can actually see
gun violence reduction

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.590
with fewer arrests.

01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:34.600
So if anything, when
we're talking about it's

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:39.010
application to policing, it
is not to broaden the scope,

01:12:39.010 --> 01:12:41.530
but rather to focus the scope.

01:12:41.530 --> 01:12:43.210
When we talk about
policing, I just

01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:45.481
want to say a couple of things.

01:12:45.481 --> 01:12:47.230
Do you know we actually
had another period

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:49.990
in this country when we reduced
police-involved shootings

01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:51.610
by more than 50%?

01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:54.790
Does anybody know when that was?

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:56.950
It was in the late
'60s, early '70s--

01:12:56.950 --> 01:13:03.040
Garner versus Tennessee, which
involved a very specific policy

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:03.600
intervention.

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.420
Anybody?

01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:09.640
Fleeing felon, fleeing
felon, not Miranda rights.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:13.060
Fleeing felon, before
Garner versus Tennessee,

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:15.850
police used to do two things,
which were really bad.

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:18.822
They used to fire
warning shots, not good.

01:13:18.822 --> 01:13:20.530
And they used to shoot
people in the back

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:22.070
when they were running away.

01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:27.710
All right, so policies reduced,
after Garner versus Tennessee,

01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:29.710
that basically diffused
through police agencies,

01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:33.190
saw a massive drop in
police-involved shootings.

01:13:33.190 --> 01:13:35.260
In New York City alone,
it went from about 100

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:39.100
to a year to about 10 a year
within a nine-year period,

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:42.670
simply by instituting two
internal sorts of changes

01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:44.842
within the police department.

01:13:44.842 --> 01:13:47.300
All that said, I want to close
on the thing I started with,

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:49.091
which is, look, you
didn't tell us anything

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:50.560
about inequality and power.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.800
Well, right, because that's
what creates the networks.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:56.850
You know what's
really hard to do?

01:13:56.850 --> 01:13:57.980
Change networks.

01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:59.680
It's really hard
to change networks.

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.910
It's like a highway system.

01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:02.481
Once you build it,
it's pernicious.

01:14:02.481 --> 01:14:02.980
It's hard.

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.480
You don't have an off ramp here.

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.616
You have one here.

01:14:05.616 --> 01:14:07.990
You can change the rules of
the road and the speed limits

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:09.370
and improve safety in vehicles.

01:14:09.370 --> 01:14:11.720
We talked about that as an
effort of public health.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:13.250
We can start there.

01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:15.940
But ultimately, we have to
think about the ways which

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:19.197
we can think about things,
again, about transparency.

01:14:19.197 --> 01:14:20.780
What do we know about
what's creating?

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:22.720
I mentioned Newark in passing.

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:26.170
Public housing projects are
really bad for creating really

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:27.880
dense networks
because people are

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.340
forced to interact with each
other and all other sorts

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:31.660
of things they're bad for.

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:32.290
Correct?

01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:34.039
I'm talking about
high-rise public housing

01:14:34.039 --> 01:14:35.100
projects in particular.

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.540
And Those were built in
particular times and places

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:38.740
for particular reasons.

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:41.590
I'm happy to go on about
some of these other dynamics.

01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:44.110
But really, we also have to
think about those big things.

01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:45.220
We have to think
about all the things

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:46.928
that aren't going to
help the victims who

01:14:46.928 --> 01:14:50.140
are in those networks today and
were the red dots, but in fact

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:51.220
sort of there other else.

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.034
And the last bit
with the new work

01:14:53.034 --> 01:14:54.700
we're doing in New
Haven, is, of course,

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:57.430
we're now going in there in
a mixed methods approach,

01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:58.970
not looking at
those who got shot,

01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:00.850
but those who seem
to be resilient.

01:15:00.850 --> 01:15:03.433
And we're doing a mixed methods
study where we're interviewing

01:15:03.433 --> 01:15:06.000
these individuals who by every
metric should have been shot,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.980
that are surrounded by
gunshot victims, and aren't.

01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:11.140
We're doing this with a
community based project,

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.782
working with interviewers
we've hired and trained.

01:15:13.782 --> 01:15:15.490
And they're helping
us develop questions.

01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:17.198
And we're going to
use that to then build

01:15:17.198 --> 01:15:20.380
sort of the next iteration
of gun violence in New Haven.

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:22.960
So thank you for my
collaborators, my funders,

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.967
and the panel.

01:15:23.967 --> 01:15:25.955
[APPLAUSE]

01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:35.530
- Thank you to our panelists.

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:38.230
We've just heard three
really fantastic,

01:15:38.230 --> 01:15:40.030
stellar presentations.

01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:44.020
And I want us to get
directly to our Q&amp;A session

01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:45.950
with you, the audience.

01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:48.850
But just quickly, I hope
that you appreciated

01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:53.080
from these presentations
where I started by describing

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:57.880
the richness and the layering
of research methodology,

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.610
qualitative and quantitative
research methodology

01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:02.770
hearkened by all
of our speakers,

01:16:02.770 --> 01:16:05.200
the richness and the
diversity in the data

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:09.700
streams that our presenters
deployed to tell the stories

01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:11.140
and share the
narratives with you

01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:14.080
today and also the
diversity and the richness

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.600
of the analytic
approaches that are used,

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:21.040
that are brought to bear to help
us understand complex, truly

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:25.420
complex, problems
of public health,

01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:29.380
population-level magnitude
that has characteristics

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:33.020
and features that include
social, behavioral,

01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:36.370
and environmental determinants
of these health outcomes

01:16:36.370 --> 01:16:37.670
and risk factors.

01:16:37.670 --> 01:16:40.240
And finally, what I thought
was really remarkable about all

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:45.340
of the talks was to begin
a truly informed narrative

01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:49.240
requires a framing, and the
framing in a public health

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:53.840
approach that opens up
pathways for identifying

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:57.740
vulnerable groups
and beginning to do

01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:02.420
what is necessary to develop,
to design interventions.

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:04.400
So with that, what
I'd like us to do

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:08.030
is to start with our
Q&amp;A session involving

01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:10.130
and engaging our audience here.

01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:13.040
And I'll just ask each
of you if you could just

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:18.540
tell us your name and then pose
your questions and comments.

01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:20.030
Thank you.

01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:21.000
- Marcia Castro.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.810
So Dr. Kolodny, could
you say a little bit more

01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:27.210
why the opioid epidemic
is mainly among whites?

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:30.420
- Sure, I'll share with
you my theory about why

01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:31.740
the epidemic is so white.

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:35.520
And I think I showed you the
data, treatment admissions

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:39.010
data, that showed you how
white the epidemic is.

01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:42.210
But if you look at the mortality
data, it's also very white.

01:17:42.210 --> 01:17:44.910
If you look at
hospital admissions,

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:47.670
every way you look at
this, it's striking

01:17:47.670 --> 01:17:49.770
how white the epidemic is.

01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:52.290
What I believe is happening--
and this is a theory,

01:17:52.290 --> 01:17:54.580
but it's based on evidence.

01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:59.610
Something we do know is that
doctors prescribe narcotics

01:17:59.610 --> 01:18:03.060
more cautiously to
their nonwhite patients.

01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:06.780
If a patient is
black, the doctor

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:09.289
prescribes opioids
much less frequently.

01:18:09.289 --> 01:18:11.080
It would seem that if
the patient is black,

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:14.250
the doctor may be more worried
about the patient becoming

01:18:14.250 --> 01:18:16.200
addicted, or maybe
they're more worried

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.960
about the patient
selling their pills.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.460
And if the patient
is white, they're

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:24.347
prescribing as if there's
nothing to worry about.

01:18:24.347 --> 01:18:26.430
And of course, we should
be prescribing cautiously

01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:27.610
to all of our patients.

01:18:27.610 --> 01:18:32.130
So that the black patient
is less likely to wind up

01:18:32.130 --> 01:18:34.350
getting addicted to
medicine prescribed to them,

01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:38.130
and the black household
is less likely to have

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:40.200
a highly addictive drug
in the medicine chest.

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.510
So what I believe
is happening is

01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:47.520
that racial stereotyping is
having a protective effect

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.220
on nonwhite populations.

01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:52.320
- If I may, framing
it another way,

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:56.280
is it possible then because the
argument the industry would use

01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:00.210
is that possible pain
management is not

01:19:00.210 --> 01:19:05.080
equally met, as well addressed
for nonwhite populations?

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:05.580
- Yes.

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:06.540
- Are there evidence?

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:08.160
- There is.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.920
And so, in fact,
some of the studies

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:15.300
that proved that doctors
prescribe narcotics

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:17.930
less frequently to
their nonwhite patients

01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:20.160
were sponsored by
pharmaceutical companies that

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.380
were trying to get the
prescribing to go up

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.280
for nonwhite populations.

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:27.090
So the argument has
been made that we're

01:19:27.090 --> 01:19:30.140
under treating
pain in non-whites

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:31.890
or African-Americans.

01:19:31.890 --> 01:19:34.630
The problem is that opioids
are very good medicines

01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:35.640
for palliative care.

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:36.990
And I think they are--

01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:40.060
I would hope that they are
prescribed more appropriately.

01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:43.535
If they're not prescribed
to black patients

01:19:43.535 --> 01:19:44.910
in palliative care
settings, that

01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:46.530
would be very inappropriate.

01:19:46.530 --> 01:19:51.000
And there is the
possibility that we

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.906
are under prescribing opioids
in cases where we should.

01:19:53.906 --> 01:19:55.530
But overall, I think
that's why they've

01:19:55.530 --> 01:19:57.290
been spared the epidemic.

01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:58.630
- Thank you.

01:19:58.630 --> 01:20:01.125
- Does any of our other
panelists want to comment?

01:20:01.125 --> 01:20:03.192
Well, let's go to the next.

01:20:03.192 --> 01:20:04.070
- Hi, there.

01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:05.280
My name is-- excuse me.

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:07.280
My name is Eric Mooring,
and I'm with the School

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:08.080
of Public Health.

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:11.110
And my question is
also for Dr. Kolodny.

01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:18.120
You mentioned how many people
who become addicted to opioids

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.380
never were using
opioids recreationally,

01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:24.390
that it was a result of
the medical interventions.

01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:26.370
But you also said
that, in some cases,

01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:28.560
there was an element
of recreational use

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:32.430
or a combination of medical
initial exposure followed

01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:34.680
by recreational use
followed by addiction.

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:40.120
And I wonder if you could
quantify to any degree

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:44.430
the relative proportion
going forward of or currently

01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:47.380
of incidence of
opioid addictions.

01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:51.100
What proportion do you
think recreational use

01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:54.570
plays some role?

01:20:54.570 --> 01:20:56.010
- I can't really.

01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:58.050
And you're asking a
few questions there.

01:20:58.050 --> 01:21:00.660
You know, there's the
question about what percentage

01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:02.950
of patients with repeated
use wind up getting addicted

01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:06.150
and how many don't.

01:21:06.150 --> 01:21:08.010
It's very difficult to say.

01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:10.530
What we do know is
the common pathway

01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:14.070
to becoming addicted to
opioids is repeated use.

01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:15.840
And it doesn't really
make a difference

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.690
if you're repeating
use because it's fun,

01:21:18.690 --> 01:21:20.760
or you're repeating
use because you're

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:23.550
self-medicating dysphoria.

01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:27.690
Maybe you're in a community with
a lack of economic opportunity,

01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:29.030
and there's despair.

01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:31.290
And it's making you feel better.

01:21:31.290 --> 01:21:34.985
Or you're repeating use because
a doctor told you to take it.

01:21:34.985 --> 01:21:36.360
It really does
make a difference.

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:39.500
Once you repeat use regularly,
you can become addicted.

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:42.984
And although we don't have
good data on the development

01:21:42.984 --> 01:21:44.400
of addiction with
repeated use, we

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.550
do have good data on the
development of long-term use

01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:48.840
in pain patients.

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:52.710
And we know that a patient
who takes an opioid every day

01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:57.240
for 10 days, 1 in 5
become long-term users.

01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.640
And if the patients are
prescribed opioids every day

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:04.640
for 30 days, about 40% are
still on opioids a year later.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:10.530
- Paul Bettinger from Tufts.

01:22:10.530 --> 01:22:12.160
This question is for Andrew.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.140
There is a very
recent publication

01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:18.370
about the total lack
of usefulness of body

01:22:18.370 --> 01:22:22.390
cameras for the police force.

01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:25.300
So the primary question is
how did they get it so wrong,

01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:30.180
given your available
information here on networks.

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:33.100
- I mean so it's
a good question.

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:36.470
You know, the one
report that I would say

01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:39.520
did that was because
they did it in a already

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.590
fairly progressive
police department that

01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:44.980
had taken lots of
steps to reduce

01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:46.360
these sorts of encounters.

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:50.260
Another way of putting this
is there are 18,000 police

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:51.850
departments in this country.

01:22:51.850 --> 01:22:54.220
The average size of a police
department in this country

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:55.150
is 43.

01:22:55.150 --> 01:22:57.910
And the mode is four officers.

01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:58.720
Right?

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.760
So the metro PD--

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:04.240
most of the police shootings
happen in the like 40 to 50

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:06.850
officer department range.

01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:08.410
There's no
standardized training.

01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:11.540
There's no standardized
sorts of licensing.

01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:13.130
It's all done by every state.

01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:16.300
And so going to the metro
PD and doing it is great.

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:18.280
That as a null finding
is not shocking.

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.050
The one they did in
Mesa, Arizona that

01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:24.040
had positive results
was also a city in need.

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.541
So you know one
study does not make.

01:23:25.541 --> 01:23:26.956
But I'll also say
one other thing.

01:23:26.956 --> 01:23:28.776
I don't think technology
is the answer.

01:23:28.776 --> 01:23:30.400
I don't think anybody
who sort of knows

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.770
the policing literature
thought that technology

01:23:32.770 --> 01:23:34.090
was going to be the answer.

01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:38.290
We thought it would actually
be more related to issues

01:23:38.290 --> 01:23:39.135
of transparency.

01:23:39.135 --> 01:23:41.260
The other thing that we
don't know from that study,

01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:43.300
of course, is officer
discretion of when

01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:45.010
the camera is on or
off, which is also

01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:49.000
a big deal in the meta-review
of these body camera studies.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.750
When officers have no discretion
about when the camera is on,

01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:53.750
we see positive effects.

01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:56.124
And we tend to see null effects
when they have discretion

01:23:56.124 --> 01:23:58.450
about when they can turn it
on or off or fudge with it

01:23:58.450 --> 01:23:59.330
a little bit.

01:23:59.330 --> 01:24:01.180
So that's my take on it.

01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:03.430
You know, I don't think one
study is going to make it.

01:24:06.106 --> 01:24:07.730
- Hi my name is Sarah
[? Altschuller ?]

01:24:07.730 --> 01:24:10.430
And I'm from Northeastern.

01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:16.316
I also have a question
for Andrew Papachristos.

01:24:16.316 --> 01:24:17.641
And I'll say I'm a humanist.

01:24:17.641 --> 01:24:19.640
So I'm wondering a little
bit about the language

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:22.460
and the kind of paradigms
that you're using and thinking

01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:24.820
specifically about--

01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:27.420
I understand that we
all speak in analogies.

01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:31.130
So I'm just wondering about
the use of AIDS and HIV

01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:33.980
as a paradigm and,
specifically, about the move

01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:37.010
to kind of think about
contagious disease

01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:39.770
as a paradigm, as a kind
of metaphor for thinking

01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:40.920
about gun violence.

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:43.100
And I understand the sort
of rhetorical efficacy.

01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:45.830
So I'm also asking about
what potential pitfalls are

01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:46.690
of doing that.

01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:50.300
- Well, the pitfalls, of course,
those other epidemics also

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:52.560
deal with super
vulnerable populations.

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:54.080
So I get that.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.287
What I'm actually trying
to work against is the--

01:24:57.287 --> 01:24:59.120
I don't want to say
baseless, but more empty

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.320
political rhetoric.

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:03.560
So if anybody is looking for a
master's thesis in this room,

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:06.350
March, there's going to
be a call for the National

01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:10.550
Guard in Chicago after the first
kid that's walking to school

01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:12.950
is sort of shot and killed.

01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:16.730
And in fact, what I'm trying to
do with the metaphors is really

01:25:16.730 --> 01:25:21.680
trying to make people understand
that the majority of victims

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:24.920
are not the kid going to school
or the grandma going to church,

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:28.016
but young men of color
who have criminal records.

01:25:28.016 --> 01:25:30.140
And the media needs to be
held accountable, as well

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:32.790
as the academics and the public
health officials and everybody

01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:33.290
else.

01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:35.990
But specifically, it's to
remove the discussion out

01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:38.470
of the criminal
justice language.

01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:40.800
And that's the big jump.

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.300
Right?

01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:43.280
Because we're not going
to arrest ourselves out

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:43.946
of this problem.

01:25:43.946 --> 01:25:46.100
And in fact, any police
chief in this country

01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:47.390
will tell you you're not
going to arrest yourself out

01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:49.080
of a gun violence problem.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:50.780
And so it's just
a conscious effort

01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:53.060
to try to move it more to
the public health problem,

01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:55.640
but also, from the data
analytics perspective,

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.710
to know that, as
we've seen here,

01:25:57.710 --> 01:26:00.770
we can use similar techniques
with highly vulnerable

01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:03.621
populations in ways that are
moral, in ways that are just,

01:26:03.621 --> 01:26:05.120
and in ways that
can be transparent.

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.770
It can also go horribly wrong.

01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:09.500
But there are ways we can reduce
Hep-C with needle exchange

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.840
programs or condom
distribution or working

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.870
with men who have sex with men
and drop rates of infection

01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:18.170
very dramatically and work
with these populations

01:26:18.170 --> 01:26:20.820
and treat them first
and foremost as victims.

01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:22.305
So that's my intentional use.

01:26:22.305 --> 01:26:23.930
But other pitfalls
I already mentioned.

01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:27.950
It clearly can also become
racialized or politicized.

01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:31.143
Like the word gun
itself is politicized.

01:26:33.801 --> 01:26:35.600
- Hi, my name is Mika Kunieda.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.350
I'm a Takemi Research
Fellow at the Harvard Chan

01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:39.720
School of Public Health.

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:41.790
I have a question
for all three of you

01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:44.350
and then one question
for Dr. Papachristos.

01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:49.150
- If I may, because we have just
about a minute and a half left,

01:26:49.150 --> 01:26:50.980
pick your top question.

01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:52.810
And we'll do our best
to answer briefly

01:26:52.810 --> 01:26:54.480
so we can get to our final.

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:59.020
- I heard very briefly at the
end a positive deviant example.

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:01.600
Is this not a sexy topic?

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.880
Or is it very hard
to find funding

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:07.270
for the studying
positive social norms?

01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:09.800
- Oh, it's next to
impossible to find funding

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:10.990
for positive social norms.

01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:13.450
I will say that the
resilience grant

01:27:13.450 --> 01:27:16.417
was funded by the NIH RO1.

01:27:16.417 --> 01:27:18.250
I'm not going to tell
you the horror stories

01:27:18.250 --> 01:27:21.430
we heard about it and that the
subsequent efforts were not

01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:23.320
funded, but it was
next to impossible.

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:26.620
We were one of the last gun
grants that got through,

01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:29.050
essentially, like by a day.

01:27:29.050 --> 01:27:31.150
Everything else was done
by private foundations

01:27:31.150 --> 01:27:31.720
to be clear--

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:35.140
MacArthur, Joyce,
others, very hard.

01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:39.070
- It's a very sobering and
very important point you make,

01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:46.140
Andrew, because when I think
about injury prevention centers

01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:50.910
across the United States over
the arc of my 25-year career

01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:54.990
as an academic in public health,
there's been an attenuation

01:27:54.990 --> 01:27:58.170
and a winnowing of these
centers just at the time

01:27:58.170 --> 01:28:00.820
as injury-related
deaths are going up.

01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:04.770
And it's a very unfortunate
set of circumstances

01:28:04.770 --> 01:28:07.142
that didn't happen randomly.

01:28:07.142 --> 01:28:08.600
And so your point
is so well taken.

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:11.370
And it reminds me of
just how important it is.

01:28:11.370 --> 01:28:13.020
Philanthropic
support for the work

01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:16.450
that we all are doing at this
table is critically important.

01:28:16.450 --> 01:28:19.560
But it does require the
leadership and the investment

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:22.080
from all sectors,
including our government.

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:23.970
With that, I'd like
to thank you all.

01:28:23.970 --> 01:28:26.400
I'd like to thank my
speakers for really

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.400
a set of stellar mini
lectures that packed

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.860
in a lot of information
and to the audience

01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:32.997
for your great questioning.

01:28:32.997 --> 01:28:33.830
Thank you very much.

01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:34.455
