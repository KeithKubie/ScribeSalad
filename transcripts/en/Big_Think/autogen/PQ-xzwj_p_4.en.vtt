so human computation the idea is that
there are problems the computers cannot

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120
there are problems the computers cannot
 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.950
there are problems the computers cannot
yet solve it's funny because there's

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960
yet solve it's funny because there's
 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.299
yet solve it's funny because there's
some of these some of these problems are

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309
some of these some of these problems are
 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.339
some of these some of these problems are
very simple problems seemingly for

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349
very simple problems seemingly for
 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.660
very simple problems seemingly for
example computer cannot tell you what's

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670
example computer cannot tell you what's

inside an image they can tell you some
 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.230
inside an image they can tell you some
things but it can't really quite tell

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240
things but it can't really quite tell
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.269

you there's a cat next to a dog and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279
you there's a cat next to a dog and
 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.950
you there's a cat next to a dog and
they're both running computer can't do

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960
they're both running computer can't do

that
 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.960
that
about humans we can do it super easily

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970
about humans we can do it super easily
 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.580
about humans we can do it super easily
and there are many things that computers

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590
and there are many things that computers
 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.060
and there are many things that computers
cannot do that humans can conversely

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070
cannot do that humans can conversely
 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.230
cannot do that humans can conversely
there are also things that computers can

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240
there are also things that computers can
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.939
there are also things that computers can
do that humans can't do I mean computers

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949
do that humans can't do I mean computers
 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.310

may be able to do it very slowly and

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020
may be able to do it very slowly and
 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.900
may be able to do it very slowly and
we're error-prone and so the idea with

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
we're error-prone and so the idea with
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.340
we're error-prone and so the idea with
human computation is to combine both

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
human computation is to combine both
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.010
human computation is to combine both
humans and computers together in a very

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
humans and computers together in a very
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.450
humans and computers together in a very
large scale to solve problems that

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
large scale to solve problems that
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.209
large scale to solve problems that
neither can solve alone my project that

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219
neither can solve alone my project that
 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.680
neither can solve alone my project that
has been used by most people is a

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690
has been used by most people is a
 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.049
has been used by most people is a
project called reCAPTCHA where the idea

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059
project called reCAPTCHA where the idea
 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.119
project called reCAPTCHA where the idea
with reCAPTCHA is that um we take a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
with reCAPTCHA is that um we take a
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.880
with reCAPTCHA is that um we take a
problem that neither humans nor

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
problem that neither humans nor
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.410
problem that neither humans nor
computers can solve by themselves which

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420
computers can solve by themselves which

is fully digitizing books the idea there

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180
is fully digitizing books the idea there
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.189
is fully digitizing books the idea there
is we would like to digitize books and

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
is we would like to digitize books and
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.870
is we would like to digitize books and
the way this process works is you start

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880
the way this process works is you start
 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.050
the way this process works is you start
with a book and then you scan it the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
with a book and then you scan it the
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.399
with a book and then you scan it the
next step in the process is that the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409
next step in the process is that the
 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.870
next step in the process is that the
computer needs to be able to decipher

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
computer needs to be able to decipher
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.810
computer needs to be able to decipher
all of the words in this picture it's a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820
all of the words in this picture it's a
 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.280
all of the words in this picture it's a
picture of words the computer needs to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
picture of words the computer needs to
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.480
picture of words the computer needs to
be able to decipher all of those words

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
be able to decipher all of those words
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.710
be able to decipher all of those words
the problem is that sometimes the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
the problem is that sometimes the
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.240
the problem is that sometimes the
computer cannot decipher these words

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250
computer cannot decipher these words
 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.999
computer cannot decipher these words
because for older books the ink has

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009
because for older books the ink has
 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.429
because for older books the ink has
faded a little and or the pages have

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
faded a little and or the pages have
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.690
faded a little and or the pages have
turned yellow so the computer cannot

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700
turned yellow so the computer cannot
 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.730
turned yellow so the computer cannot
decipher all of the words but humans can

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
decipher all of the words but humans can
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.429
decipher all of the words but humans can
so what we're doing with reCAPTCHA if

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439
so what we're doing with reCAPTCHA if
 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.440
so what we're doing with reCAPTCHA if

CAPTCHA and I was one of the people who

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
CAPTCHA and I was one of the people who
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.280
CAPTCHA and I was one of the people who
helped invent it and that thing the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
helped invent it and that thing the
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.630
helped invent it and that thing the
reason is there there's a primary

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
reason is there there's a primary
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.370
reason is there there's a primary
purpose which is to make sure that

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
purpose which is to make sure that

purpose which is to make sure that
you're a human another computer and it's

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180
you're a human another computer and it's
 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.389
you're a human another computer and it's
because humans can read these squiggly

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
because humans can read these squiggly
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.850
because humans can read these squiggly
characters but computers can't this is a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
characters but computers can't this is a
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.039
characters but computers can't this is a
security mechanism and it has been there

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
security mechanism and it has been there
 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.480
security mechanism and it has been there
for a while but at some point I realized

the second use which is helping to
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.380
the second use which is helping to
digitize books the idea is that some of

digitize books the idea is that some of
 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.880
digitize books the idea is that some of
these words nowadays some of these words

these words nowadays some of these words
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.290
these words nowadays some of these words
are words that are actually coming from

process and we're using what people
 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.789
process and we're using what people
enter to help us digitize the books so

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799
enter to help us digitize the books so
 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.110
enter to help us digitize the books so
that's the idea and so this is a project

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
that's the idea and so this is a project
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.110
that's the idea and so this is a project
where it's it's about 1.1 billion people

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120
where it's it's about 1.1 billion people
 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.610
where it's it's about 1.1 billion people
in the world have helped us digitize at

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620
in the world have helped us digitize at
 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.500
in the world have helped us digitize at
least one word out of a book using this

precisely the step that computers cannot
 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.050
precisely the step that computers cannot
do in the book digitization process this

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060
do in the book digitization process this
 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.369
do in the book digitization process this
this is a company that was bought by

this is a company that was bought by
 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.190
this is a company that was bought by
Google and by now Google is digitizing

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200
Google and by now Google is digitizing
 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.869

through CAPTCHAs all over the internet
 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.069
through CAPTCHAs all over the internet
so that's that's the idea of human

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079
so that's that's the idea of human
 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.290
so that's that's the idea of human
computation
