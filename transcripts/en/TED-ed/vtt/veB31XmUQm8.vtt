00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:10.360
The secrets of the X chromosome.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.897
These women are identical twins.

00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:14.568
They have the same nose,

00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:15.801
the same hair color,

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:17.487
the same eye color.

00:00:17.487 --> 00:00:20.410
But this one is color blind
for green light,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.512
and this one isn't.

00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:24.039
How is that possible?

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.801
The answer lies in their genes.

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:30.772
For humans, the genetic information
that determines our physical traits

00:00:30.772 --> 00:00:35.740
is stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes
in the nucleus of every cell.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.220
These chromosomes are made up of proteins
and long, coiled strands of DNA.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.141
Segments of DNA, called genes,
tell the cell to build specific proteins,

00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:48.599
which control its identity and function.

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:53.012
For every chromosome pair,
one comes from each biological parent.

00:00:53.012 --> 00:00:58.193
In 22 of these pairs, the chromosomes
contain the same set of genes,

00:00:58.193 --> 00:01:01.212
but may have different versions
of those genes.

00:01:01.212 --> 00:01:03.572
The differences arrive from mutations,

00:01:03.572 --> 00:01:05.589
which are changes to the genetic sequence

00:01:05.589 --> 00:01:08.892
that may have occurred 
many generations ago.

00:01:08.892 --> 00:01:10.983
Some of those changes have no effect,

00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:12.923
some cause diseases,

00:01:12.923 --> 00:01:16.023
and some lead to advantageous adaptations.

00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:18.521
The result of having two versions
of each gene

00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:23.426
is that you display a combination
of your biological parents' traits.

00:01:23.426 --> 00:01:26.163
But the 23rd pair is unique,

00:01:26.163 --> 00:01:29.885
and that's the secret behind
the one color blind twin.

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:34.763
This pair, called the X and Y chromosomes,
influences your biological sex.

00:01:34.763 --> 00:01:38.025
Most women have two X chromosomes

00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:41.765
while most men have one X and one Y.

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:46.214
The Y chromosome contains genes
for male development and fertility.

00:01:46.214 --> 00:01:48.235
The X chromosome, on the other hand,

00:01:48.235 --> 00:01:52.763
contains important genes for things other
than sex determination or reproduction,

00:01:52.763 --> 00:01:54.515
like nervous system development,

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:56.035
skeletal muscle function,

00:01:56.035 --> 00:02:00.035
and the receptors in the eyes
that detect green light.

00:02:00.035 --> 00:02:03.545
Biological males with 
an XY chromosome pair

00:02:03.545 --> 00:02:07.845
only get one copy of all these
X chromosome genes,

00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:12.235
so the human body has evolved
to function without duplicates.

00:02:12.235 --> 00:02:15.866
But that creates a problem
for people with two X chromosomes.

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:21.379
If both X chromosomes produced proteins,
as is normal in other chromosomes,

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.236
development of the embryo would be
completely impaired.

00:02:25.236 --> 00:02:28.797
The solution is X inactivation.

00:02:28.797 --> 00:02:32.787
This happens early in development
when an embryo with two X chromosomes

00:02:32.787 --> 00:02:35.256
is just a ball of cells.

00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:39.257
Each cell inactivates one X chromosome.

00:02:39.257 --> 00:02:42.499
There's a certain degree of randomness
to this process.

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:46.075
One cell may inactivate the X chromosome
from one parent,

00:02:46.075 --> 00:02:49.185
and another the chromosome
from the other parent.

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:54.255
The inactive X shrivels into a clump
called a Barr body and goes silent.

00:02:54.255 --> 00:02:57.784
Almost none of its genes
order proteins to be made.

00:02:57.784 --> 00:03:02.058
When these early cells divide,
each passes on its X inactivation.

00:03:02.058 --> 00:03:05.719
So some clusters of cells
express the maternal X chromosome,

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.008
while others express the paternal X.

00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:11.400
If these chromosomes
carry different traits,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.749
those differences 
will show up in the cells.

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:18.014
This is why calico cats have patches.

00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:23.105
One X had a gene for orange fur
and the other had a gene for black fur.

00:03:23.105 --> 00:03:28.318
The pattern of the coat reveals
which one stayed active where.

00:03:28.318 --> 00:03:31.538
Now we can explain our color blind twin.

00:03:31.538 --> 00:03:35.732
Both sisters inherited one mutant copy
of the green receptor gene

00:03:35.732 --> 00:03:38.389
and one normally functioning copy.

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.248
The embryo split into twins
before X inactivation,

00:03:42.248 --> 00:03:45.940
so each twin ended up
with a different inactivation pattern.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.131
In one, the X chromosome
with the normal gene was turned off

00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:52.333
in the cells that eventually became eyes.

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:54.062
Without those genetic instructions,

00:03:54.062 --> 00:03:58.538
she now can't sense green light
and is color blind.

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:02.343
Disorders that are associated
with mutations of X chromosome genes,

00:04:02.343 --> 00:04:03.562
like color blindness,

00:04:03.562 --> 00:04:05.013
or hemophilia,

00:04:05.013 --> 00:04:09.247
are often less severe in individuals
with two X chromosomes.

00:04:09.247 --> 00:04:13.333
That's because in someone with one normal
and one mutant copy of the gene,

00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:16.919
only some of their cells would be
affected by the mutation.

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.911
This severity of the disorder
depends on which X got turned off

00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:23.513
and where those cells were.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:27.595
On the other hand, all the cells in
someone with only one X chromosome

00:04:27.595 --> 00:04:32.565
can only express the mutant copy
of the gene if that's what they inherited.

00:04:32.565 --> 00:04:36.213
There are still unresolved questions
about X inactivation,

00:04:36.213 --> 00:04:40.184
like how some genes on the X chromosome
escape inactivation

00:04:40.184 --> 00:04:43.945
and why inactivation isn't always random.

00:04:43.945 --> 00:04:46.044
What we do know is that this mechanism

00:04:46.044 --> 00:04:50.634
is one of the many ways that genes
alone don't tell our whole story.
