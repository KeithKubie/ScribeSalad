00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.030
Disney films have always been rich territory
for conspiracy theorists. Ranging in legitimacy

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.320
from baseless accusations to full-on proof,
fans and critics love to discuss their new

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.820
findings with every new release. Talk of subliminal
messaging continues to sweep the internet,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.740
ruffling the feathers of anxious parents everywhere.
Some are right in your face, others need some

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.481
freeze framing to find… You might have seen
our other video entitled 10 Inappropriate

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:32.240
Scenes In Disney Films where we covered a
similar topic, but if you haven’t, stick

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.489
around until the end for a link to it! Here
is more of Screen Rant’s Dirty Disney: 10

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.870
Inappropriate Images in Disney Films.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.290
The Rescuers

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.590
While on assignment in New York City, Bernard
and Bianca scour the city for clues. The two

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.090
travel by albatross as they soar through the
maze of NYC high-rise buildings. However,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.790
some more astute viewers noticed something
a little extra in the background. In one of

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.180
the apartment windows, a topless woman faces
the audience. When played at normal speed,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.460
it’s almost impossible to see. But if you
slow it down, she’s clearly visible.&nbsp;Disney

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.990
issued a recall of the home videos in 1999,
but by that time, most of the tapes were probably

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.500
worn out in that spot anyway.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.990
The Hunchback of Notre Dame

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.490
After being locked in the bell tower by Frollo
his whole life, Quasimodo has a very personal

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.410
stake in his demise. Life isn’t all bad
for Quasimodo, though. His friend Esméralda

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.490
is a smart, beautiful gypsy who doesn’t
take crap from anyone. And she proves herself

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.010
to be a good friend, too. One of her scenes
made some parents take notice though. While

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.860
performing a dance in the flames, some argue
that her body is unnecessarily top-heavy.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.450
While others contend that her dress becomes
a little too invisible, and leaves nothing

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.140
to the imagination.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.140
The Lion King

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.420
The tale of Simba’s life from cub to king
is sure to tug on viewers heart-strings. But

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.100
there’s one noteworthy scene that makes
some people do a double-take. As Simba lays

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.961
down on a cliff’s edge, he stirs up a cloud
of dust that dissipates in the air. Where

00:01:55.961 --> 00:02:00.670
most saw dust drifting into the night sky,
some hyper-vigilant parents claim that Disney’s

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.640
animators had a more sinister motive. If you
look closely, you can almost make out a naughty

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.420
word hovering in the sky. When they say love
is written in the stars, we don’t think

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.080
this is what they meant. This was at the center
of a controversy in the 90’s and has never

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.540
been confirmed by Disney, other people say
it says SFX as in Special Effects… we’ll

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.430
let you decide if it’s real or not!

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.499
Tarzan

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:26.790
First impressions are important, and frankly,
the titular character from Tarzan makes a

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.359
bad one. Raised under the watchful eye of
a gorilla named Kala, he has some interesting

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.159
social quirks that come out when in the company
of other humans.&nbsp;When he and Jane meet for

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.889
the first time, he crosses the line in more
ways than one. Tarzan awkwardly fondles her

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:43.019
foot, peeks up her skirt, and buries his face
in Jane’s chest. What’s worse, she’s

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.419
clearly uncomfortable. His intentions may
be pure, but the whole exchange is kind of

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:49.419
creepy.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.239
The Little Mermaid

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.709
Given the meticulous nature of animation,
it’s pretty amazing that some of these other

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.779
scenes made it through dozens of rounds of
editing. But this image from the 1989 Disney

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:02.730
classic was found in the film’s cover art.
Just like an optical illusion, some people

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.910
see it right away, whereas others need a little
more time to figure out what’s… UP with

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.510
Triton’s castle. Apparently, the artist
completed the picture at 4 in the morning,

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.939
and didn't even notice the resemblance until
a friend mentioned the controversy months

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.279
later.

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:19.279
Toy Story

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:23.200
A benefit of using toys for characters is
that storytellers and animators can push the

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.249
envelope a little farther, and probably get
away with it too. In fact, there’s a whole

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:31.319
character built on a mature play on words.
The Hooker is a mash-up of sexy lady legs,

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.650
and a hook mechanism hanging off a long arm.
Toy Story 2 has it’s share of innuendo,

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.569
and shows Buzz Lightyear’s wings springing
to attention after Jesse, the new girl in

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.599
town, executes an impressive feat of acrobatics.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.769
Cinderella

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.489
Cinderella wouldn’t have gotten her happy
ending if it wasn't for her backup: a fairy

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.890
godmother, some birds, and a few mice were
her keys to salvation. Occasionally, the mice

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.799
have to do some lousy tasks in the name of
friendship, including threading beads onto

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.639
Gus’ tail. But as soon as one fan paused
the image at just the right moment, one of

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:08.780
the funniest, most adult images ever to appear
in a Disney movie was captured forever.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.780
A Goofy Movie

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.370
Toy Story isn't the only franchise incorporating
visual puns into it’s repertoire, A Goofy

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.389
Movie gets in on the fun as well. At one point
during the fishing trip, the fellas catch

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.480
Bigfoot. Luckily for them, his rage fades
and he quickly becomes distracted by some

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.340
knick-knacks in a box. He emerges from the
rubble with underwear covering his head, only

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.449
part of his face visible. He holds open a
gap in the briefs and peers out, while adults

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.250
are chuckling about the literal one-eyed monster
being depicted on screen.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.250
Bambi

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.580
While exploring the snowy woods one day, Bambi
and Thumper take to the ice. Swirling and

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.590
skating, the rabbit is clearly having a better
time than Bambi, who can barely stay upright.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.910
Like any good friend would, little Thumper
helps get his friend back on his feet. More

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.210
than once, we see him move around behind Bambi
and start by lifting his back end off the

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.080
ice, his legs following after. The positioning
is a little unsavory in certain frames. If

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.720
you watch with a skeptical eye, we’re confident
you’ll understand what we mean. We get that

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.780
it’s not obvious to animate such an action,
but we have to ask ourselves “why is Bambi

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:12.570
in THAT position and not another?!” That’s
why you should never pause a Disney movie…

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.770
Cars 2

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.379
Champion race car Lightning McQueen is on
a hot streak and headed to the World Grand

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:21.780
Prix with his partner in crime, Mater. Accidentally
embroiled in an undercover plot, Mater meets

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.060
some real nasty old guys. Referred to as “lemons”
the old, broken-down cars get together for

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.270
a party, and the lemon-themed decor has conspiracy
theorists drawing some pretty graphic parallels

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.389
- since a "lemon party" is also the term for
a... slippery fetish… Do yourself a favor

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:37.789
and DON’T Google that!

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:42.160
