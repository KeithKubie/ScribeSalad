00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.704
In 2004, my cousin Nadia was
having trouble with math.

00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:17.370
She was in New Orleans,
I was in Boston.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.240
I decided to
virtually tutor her.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.090
It worked out, so I said, oh,
let me tutor some other family

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.590
members.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.070
It became pretty
obvious pretty quick

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.210
that it was hard to
scale that, and it

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.590
was hard to schedule
it all the time.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.965
So essentially, I just started
putting videos on YouTube.

00:00:29.965 --> 00:00:32.700
In 2009, I started doing
Khan Academy full-time.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.980
In the fall of
2010, we got funding

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.880
from the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, and from Google,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.219
and now we're a
real organization.

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:41.760
Right now in a
traditional classroom,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.093
a teacher has to deliver
essentially a one-size fits all

00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:45.580
lecture, pretty
much guaranteeing

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.850
that some of the students
are going to be lost

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.850
or some are bored.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.710
Students have to do
problems in a vacuum.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.490
They come back.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.920
You kind of repeat that process.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.175
Then you get a snapshot exam.

00:00:53.175 --> 00:00:57.550
And then on that exam, whether
you get 70%, 90%, or 95%,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.210
you're moved onto
the next concept.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.966
And it's almost guaranteed to
leave gaps in your knowledge.

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.340
At some point,
your foundation is

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.548
going to be so weak that it
will essentially crumble.

00:01:06.548 --> 00:01:09.050
There's got to be a
better way to do this.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.310
Going through the high
school experience, when

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.325
we would train for
math competitions,

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:15.700
we had a completely different
way of teaching each other.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.866
Everyone was learning math
a lot better in this kind

00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.949
of extracurricular
setting where the peers

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:20.990
were teaching each other.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.656
Everyone was learning
at their own pace.

00:01:22.656 --> 00:01:24.444
It was really interactive,
really social.

00:01:24.444 --> 00:01:27.110
People were starting to make the
connections across subject area

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.318
because you had to have a
holistic understanding when

00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:30.570
you went to a competition.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.575
The ideal interaction is
one-on-one, you have a tutor,

00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:34.950
you have a student,
and the tutor

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.270
can kind of adapt
to the student.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.686
And the reason why that doesn't
exist in the school system

00:01:38.686 --> 00:01:39.882
is that that's not economic.

00:01:39.882 --> 00:01:40.840
How do you reduce that?

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.256
How do we give
them more resources

00:01:42.256 --> 00:01:43.860
so it's a lower
student-teacher ratio?

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.850
In my mind, the
relevant metric is

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.177
student to actual productive
time with the teacher ratio.

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:51.760
We see the Khan
Academy as essentially

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.739
the world's free virtual school.

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:55.780
We have the videos,
literally covering everything

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.430
from basic arithmetic all the
way through college-level math

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.710
and science and economics.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.950
The lecturer frees
up the teacher,

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.580
so that all of their
time is now spent

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.170
on these focused interventions.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.020
We have the software platform.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.960
And we have a way for students
and teachers and parents

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.730
to get data on what's happening.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.980
And for our students and
teachers and parents actually

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.170
communicate with each other,
and maybe actually even

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.878
teach each other.

00:02:17.878 --> 00:02:21.580
So we actually see it as a real,
virtual school for the world.
