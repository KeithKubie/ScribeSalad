MALE SPEAKER: I was on
Amazon.com looking for some

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.730
mindfulness meditation reading
and somehow I came across this

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.210
book called "Positive
Intelligence," written by

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.950
Stanford professor Chamine.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.960
And it was an absolutely
fascinating book because it

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.440
talked about what we could do
to impact our emotional

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.480
intelligence.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.040
And also, what are the limiting

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.470
factors in our career?

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.920
So without much further ado,
I'd like to pass it over to

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.350
Professor Chamine.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.104
SHIRZAD CHAMINE: Thank
you [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.440
Thank you.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.990
Thank you.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.090
It's an honor to be here at
Google because I don't know if

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.300
you know it, but you have
changed my life.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.790
Google has changed my life.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.280
My research on my book, and my
book, would be less than a

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.440
third done if it weren't
for you guys.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.450
So you have changed my life and
I'm here to reciprocate.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.110
And if you allow
me to, I will.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.990
And I'd like to start, in terms
of what the topic of

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.260
this work is, with a quote that
I consider heartbreaking

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.290
because on the one hand, it's
so tragic, and on the other,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.480
it's so true.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.080
"Most men lead lives of quiet
desperation and go to the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.070
grave with the song still in
them." Thoreau wrote this

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.380
quote about 150 years ago.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.500
And despite the tremendous
progress that we have made in

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.700
science and technology and all
sorts of other things, sadly,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.970
I think this quote is just
as true today as it

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.220
was 150 years ago.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.480
And the only thing we need to
change about this quote is now

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.350
he would say "most men and
women lead lives of quiet

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.340
desperation and go to the grave
with the song still in

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.530
them." So what this quote is
about is just two areas that

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.830
I'm passionate about
are two dimensions.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.780
And the two dimensions, the
first one is the dimension of

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.040
happiness, what he calls
quiet desperation.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.610
Now you may be looking
around and say, gee,

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.040
I'm not quite desperate.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.960
Maybe my neighbor is, the guy
sitting next to my left--

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.160
to my left or right.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.030
I'm not quietly desperate
but actually you are.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.320
Let me tell you how you
are quietly desperate.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.860
So the modern version of this
quiet desperation that too

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.390
many of us are leading it's what
I would call things such

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.860
as-- and see if that resonates
for you-- constant stress,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.550
constant anxiety, constantly
wondering if you're good

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.780
enough, if you have done enough,
if your career is

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.320
progressing well, what
tomorrow will bring,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.650
constantly disappointed with the
performance you have done,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.510
or the performance that
the others have done.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.560
So I take this collective
category of what I call

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.470
negative emotions, and I call
that category "general

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.610
unhappiness." And what I would
like to say is that based on

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.560
my research, we are just
as unhappy today as we

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.330
were 150 years ago.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.220
Its manifestation has changed.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.870
That's one dimension I'm very
passionate about changing.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.740
The second dimension that this
quote talks about is "going to

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.850
our grave with the song still in
us." What that dimension is

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.450
about is about performance,
is about achievement.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.240
Not any achievement or
performance, but meaningful

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.730
achievement and performance.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.840
Because I believe every single
one of us is born with a

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.250
unique, beautiful song in us.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.590
And most of us go to our graves
not knowing how to

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.490
manifest it and how
to bring it out.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.240
That's about achieving the
highest possibility of your

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.990
achievement--

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.530
reaching your true potential
for the difference you can

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.930
make in the world, for the
performance that you're

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.380
capable of, and what it is
that you can contribute.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.990
So my work is about how can we
have you be significantly

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.160
happier, and also significantly
more capable in

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.630
achieving your true potential.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.140
The reason that-- now as you
can imagine, you guys are

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.830
working really hard.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.843
You probably have read tons
of books that have been--

00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:06.520
hundreds of books written
since Thoreau wrote that

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.880
quotes about increasing your
happiness and increasing your

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.930
effectiveness.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.770
So how come we haven't made that
much progress in changing

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.470
that over 150 years?

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.360
And how come when you have tried
to become significantly

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.320
happier, significantly more
effective, using tools,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.610
technologies, books that you
have read-- how come the

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.110
results have been incremental
and have fizzled after a

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.150
while, not dramatic
the way that we

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.630
want it to be dramatic.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.500
And I just like to use an
example and tell you why.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.920
And the example is imagine that
there is this guy who

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.920
lives in a village.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.330
And he has--

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.940
his greatest possession, his
sole source of livelihood is

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.410
this huge tree that he
has in his garden.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.990
And this tree has hundreds of
leaves, and these leaves are

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.160
his source of livelihood.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.650
As he sells them, they need to
be big and strong and healthy.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.440
And imagine that this guy wakes
up every morning and

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.300
drags himself drudgingly to the
base of this huge tree,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.820
looks up, and with great
disappointment notices that

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.700
there are lots of leaves today
that are looking wilted and

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.240
looking dehydrated.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.750
And what he does, day after
day, is he painstakingly

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.960
climbs this very huge tree and
gets to reach these very hard

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.680
to reach branches and
painstakingly takes one leaf

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.690
after the other and polishes it
and sprays it with water so

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.800
that it's less wilted
and less dehydrated.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.360
And leaf after leaf after leaf,
until every minute of

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.590
the day is over, until every
spray of water that he has,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.440
every drop of water is gone,
and until every ounce of

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.610
energy is exhausted.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.600
It's the end of the day, and the
next day is going to start

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.220
on the same routine.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.150
Now you and I know-- we
look at him and you

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.160
say, you know what?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.560
And as we notice the fact, the
crazy fact that he never gets

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.290
to water the roots
of this tree.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.200
He's busy going up there and
dealing with the leaves.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.460
And the reason is he's left with
no time and no water at

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.480
the end of day to water
the roots of the tree.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.090
You and I look at that and say
this guy's kind of cuckoo.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.410
He's a little insane.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.850
Why doesn't he just water
the roots of the tree?

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.170
We feel kind of superior
thinking that, right?

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.550
We are much smarter
than that guy.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.730
But I hope you won't take it
personally, but I do believe

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.880
that that's exactly what you
do, day in and day out.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.990
And that the reason that we
still live lives of quiet

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.260
desperation after so many years
is that our attempts at

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.740
improving our happiness on the
one hand, and improving our

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:41.760
performance on the other hand,
are very analogous to us

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.730
dealing at the leaves level.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.550
We are busy polishing
the leaves and

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.800
spraying them with water.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.750
And we have forgotten--

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.540
we actually never learned
that we don't know how

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.700
to water the roots.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:58.860
And I'm here to tell you that
you can actually find a way

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.110
to, if you focus on what the
roots are, that you can find a

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.520
way to be dramatically more
effective in what you do, and

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.840
dramatically happier.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.870
And have time to actually lay
under the tree and enjoy the

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.690
shade, too.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.620
And that's how I believe that
this technology that I bring,

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.820
positive intelligence, can
actually change your life and

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.060
have me pay my dues back to
Google, because you have done

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.820
the same for me.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.190
And now the interesting thing
is that in the past 15 years

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.340
or so in particular, there have
been powerful pieces of

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.570
research in four different areas
of discipline that have

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.790
given us really wonderful clues
about what is at the

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.320
root level, what is at this
common root level for what

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.220
creates dramatic improvements in
happiness, and at the same

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.130
time dramatic improvement
in performance.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.610
There have been four areas of
science and research that have

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.880
had powerful insights to that.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.300
So I'd like to tell you what
those four areas are, and then

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.520
from that, figure out--

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.300
how to put these pieces of the
puzzle together about what is

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.400
the root level, and how do we
make sure that we tend to the

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.420
root level.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.960
And the first thing is the area
of positive psychology.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.940
And in positive psychology, my
colleagues have contributed a

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.190
very huge part of this puzzle
of what the root is.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.070
And one of the biggest
insights of positive

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.680
psychology is that after
centuries of thinking that the

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.740
way you can get to be happier
is by performing

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.220
and achieving higher--

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.730
perform and achieve higher so
that you can be happier--

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.630
positive psychology has turned
it on its head, and shown that

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.210
actually, higher achievement and
performance does not lead

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.659
to higher happiness.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.490
But higher happiness does lead
to higher performance and

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:41.429
achievement.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:44.830
A happier brain is a much
more capable, much more

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.310
resourceful, much more
creative brain.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.180
So that's a huge contribution
that positive psychology has

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.570
made to this puzzle--

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.230
what's at the root.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:58.105
Other contribution is that
actually 90% of the valuation

00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:01.650
in people's happiness from
one person to another is

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.820
explainable based on what is
happening inside of their own

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.610
head, not based on what's
happening in their life in

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:08.940
terms of wealth and possessions

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.460
or any of that stuff.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.930
Those are huge contributions
to the puzzle of

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.460
what's at the root.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.150
The other very important
discipline that has given us

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.550
great new insights about this,
about what's at the root, is

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:22.470
neuroscience.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.150
And what we know of neuroscience
is a few very

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.260
exciting things.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.710
With functional MRI,
neuroscience has shown us is

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.860
what areas of the brain, if
they are stimulated, can

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.320
actually have you feel all
these positive wonderful

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.960
feelings that collectively
create happiness.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.000
So there are areas of the brain
that if you stimulate

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.780
them, if you learn how to
activate them, you will be

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.380
feeling much happier, much
more positive feelings

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.570
regardless of what kind of
situation you're dealing with.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.130
And the second contribution is
that the brain is like a

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.620
muscle, and that with some
simple little exercises you

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.890
can actually develop the muscle
of command over your

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.910
own mind, so that you can
command which part of your

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.570
brain can be activated, and
which part of your brain will

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.680
be quieted down.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.670
And that's a very powerful
contribution to this puzzle of

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.430
what's at the root of
happiness and higher

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:14.580
performance.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.170
And that there are areas of the
brain that will get you

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:21.510
not just higher performance, but
also higher happiness if

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.960
you're able to activate them.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.270
The third area of very exciting
work in the past 15

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.540
years plus is in cognitive
behavioral

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.640
psychology, what we know.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.360
It's kind of a little bit of the
psychological corollary of

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.480
what I shared about neuroscience
a minute ago.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.010
The psychological corollary is
that in most people's mind

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.680
there are some really
dysfunctional habits of the

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.120
mind, automatic habits of the
mind that create a lot of not

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.040
only your unhappiness about
your problems with highest

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.780
achievement, they get in the way
of you performing at the

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:55.620
highest level.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.460
There are just these automatic
habits of the mind that gets

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.050
triggered and they go--

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.120
we go on automatic drive and
they don't serve us.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:07.260
And very excitingly, what
cognitive behavioral

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.180
psychology has shown us is there
some relatively simple

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:15.850
ways to actually reprogram the
mind to replace some of these

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.720
dysfunctional habits with much
more positive habits that have

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.740
you be not only a lot happier,
but also a lot more effective.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.070
And the final piece of this, the
puzzle, that's an exciting

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:33.330
contribution to this is the area
of performance science.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.780
And in particular, about 15
years ago we had emotional

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.420
intelligence.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.010
Daniel Goleman and his
colleagues made a huge

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.430
contribution to us beginning to
understand that actually,

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.740
when it comes to, especially,
professional achievement, the

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.250
highest achievement, the highest
performance that you

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:56.680
can get actually comes from
having high emotional

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.970
intelligence competencies that
are in the soft skill domain

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.430
rather than hard skill and IQ.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.260
So for the highest level of
achievement, especially in a

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.470
lot of professional fields,
the soft skills are what

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.770
ultimately make the difference,
rather than either

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.850
your IQ or harder skills.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.990
And that has been a huge
contribution to this puzzle.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:20.060
So what I'm here to show you
is that-- so this is all

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.120
exciting, and there's
one problem with it.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.980
The problem is that it can be
pretty overwhelming to figure

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.420
out how to connect all the dots
between these things, and

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.490
actually-- so what in the world
do you do differently

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.670
tomorrow based on all
this insight?

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:39.790
One of the CEOs that I was
coaching telling me that he

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.450
has read five books
on neuroscience.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.050
He's so excited that
he knows--

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.390
he can tell you exactly what
part the brain gets excited

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.580
then lit up when he does well.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:51.260
But he has no idea when he's
sitting tomorrow in a meeting

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.750
with his staff, and there's
conflict in his staff-- what

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.390
the heck I do differently now?

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.760
How do I go from my
understanding of the brain to

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.970
what do I do differently when
two of my team members are

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.340
always fighting with
each other?

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.310
How do you connect the dots
between all of this beautiful,

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.950
wonderful scientific research
to what's actionable?

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.640
So basically that's where my
contribution comes in, in

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.530
construct of positive
intelligence.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.280
What positive intelligence
is--

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:27.100
sitting on these four powerful
cornerstones of science, what

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.570
positive intelligence does, it
creates a unified framework

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.310
that brings in the best of these
fields but very, very

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.530
importantly does what it is
that you need to do at the

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:38.430
root level.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.520
At the root level things
need to be simple.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.080
Things need to be actionable,
and things need to be

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.320
measurable.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.640
So how do you make things really
simple, because the

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.640
root is simple.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.880
The promise of the root is if
you water the roots, lots of

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.200
awesome things happen
on their own.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.760
How can we make sure that it's
a simple framework, it's an

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.570
actionable framework, so that
I can tell you what to do

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.240
differently tomorrow when you're
sitting in a meeting

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.740
and things are not going well?

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.470
And it needs to be measurable.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.700
How do we make sure it's
actually working?

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.300
And those are the things that
positive psychology--

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.770
with the original research
of positive

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.840
psychology we add to this.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.570
And basically it is about going
to the very core, the

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.970
root, the common root of what
creates your optimal happiness

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.700
and what creates your
optimal performance.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.620
And the way that it works with
positive intelligence--

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:32.200
a definition of positive
intelligence is that basically

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.680
at the core, at the root level,
the most important

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.440
thing for you to pay attention
to is the war that's

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.360
constantly raging inside
of your own brain.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.550
Inside every human being's brain
there is a war every

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:47.360
minute of every day, raging
between two different voices

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.800
and the mind.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.980
One is the voice that
serves you.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.440
The other is the voice
that sabotages you.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.240
And positive intelligence is
defined as the percentage of

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.380
time that your mind is serving
you, as opposed

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.360
to sabotaging you--

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.960
the percentage of time that your
mind is serving you, as

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.730
opposed to sabotaging you.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.760
The premise being that every
single one of you--

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.730
I just met you.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.210
You're a wonderful
group of people.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.350
But I know that you are
busy self-sabotaging

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:14.610
yourself all the time.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:15.750
How do I know that?

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:19.390
Because I have yet to meet a
human being who doesn't have a

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.060
level of self-sabotage.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.640
It is just impossible.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.680
And so the question is, how
often do you self-sabotage,

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.330
and what's the amount of time
that you self-sabotage versus

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:33.060
serve yourself.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:37.210
And with positive intelligence
we actually put frameworks to

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.330
this that makes it more
understandable.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.810
So basically, the voices that
are sabotaging you, we call

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.400
the saboteurs.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.790
And the voice that serves
you, we call the sage.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.460
So the sage is really our true
voice, is the voice you can

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.070
trust, is the voice you
were born with.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:55.560
It's your unique voice.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.480
And the saboteurs are things
that get into your head.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.090
Sometime in your childhood,
I'll get into more detail

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:03.300
about where the heck do these
saboteurs come from.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.220
How come they're so universal?

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.050
They have by their very names
like the judge, controller,

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.340
stickler, and victim.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.360
Does any of that remind
anybody of

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.400
anybody that you know?

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.490
Of course, not yourself,
right?

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:16.820
You are the one--

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.610
by the way, if my wife is in
audience, I always tell her,

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.030
tell them everybody has
lots of saboteurs.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:26.070
But my wife is this unique
miracle, where absolutely,

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.310
that's just the one exception
to the rule.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.280
But since she's not here I
can tell you, she has her

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.140
saboteurs too.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.820
And so do every one of you.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.820
By the way, there are 10
saboteurs altogether.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.820
These are the four.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.730
One of the things that's
measurable about positive

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.330
intelligence is that you can
actually measure the strength

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:45.160
of your saboteurs.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.090
We can also measure the relative
strength of your

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.970
saboteurs versus the sage.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.540
And at the root level of your
greatest happiness and your

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.500
greatest performance is
this balance of power.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.290
And it's a balance of power
that's never completely here

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.640
and never completely there.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.260
There is nobody who is 100 in
PQ, in positive intelligence.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.329
There's nobody who's a zero.

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:08.520
The question is, how do
you shift the scale?

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.010
And as you do, dramatic
improvements happen.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:15.109
This is the psychological way
of describing what's at the

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:20.619
root, but this correlates
completely, one on one, with

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:23.750
the neurological explanation
also of what's happening at

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.900
the root level of your mind.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.730
And at the neurological level,
you really are of two brains.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:33.550
You have the survival brain
region, and you have the

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.290
positive intelligence brain.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:37.450
And basically what the saboteurs
are, they are the

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.400
agents of your survival brain.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.940
And what the sage is, it's the
agent of your positive

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.510
intelligence brain.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.380
These are entirely different
regions of your brain--

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.160
entirely different regions
of your brain.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.550
So this is a slight
generalization.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:58.410
My book goes into a lot more
detailed specifics, but just

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.220
to give you an idea, the
survival brain region is made

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:05.700
up mostly of your brain stem,
limbic system, parts of the

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.730
left brain.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.590
The positive intelligence brain
is made up mostly of the

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.450
middle prefrontal cortex, the
ACC insular cortex, and parts

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.620
of the right brain.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.390
They are neurochemically wired
differently so that when they

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:23.455
are activated, they produce
completely different emotions

00:18:23.455 --> 00:18:24.540
and energy.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.700
So survival brain's
job is survive.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.690
And that's the reason that
everybody has a very active

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.990
level of survival brain, because
from an evolutionary

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:38.510
perspective, that has been
important to your survival.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:41.930
Now notice the emotions that get
generated by the saboteurs

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.810
and the survival brain.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:48.270
These are the emotions that
generate the quiet

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:53.460
desperation, the unhappiness,
all the stress and difficulty.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.290
It's collectively what
I call unhappiness.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.860
So when I talk about happiness
versus unhappiness, I'm asking

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.660
the question, are you
primarily here?

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.970
Or are you primarily here?

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.280
And happiness--

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.485
becoming happier is about
spending more time here and

00:19:08.485 --> 00:19:09.610
less time here.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:13.250
Again, you can never be
completely here, but you can

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.630
definitely move a lot
farther that way.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.890
Now notice immediately,
something's become very clear.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.540
I can make some dramatic
generalizations.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.550
Basically one of the most
important things I can say is,

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.170
your unhappiness has nothing
to do with what's

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:28.950
happening in your life.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.050
It doesn't have to do with the
fact that you have a bad boss.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.270
By the way, I have heard there
are no bad bosses at Google,

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.990
but just theoretically
speaking.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.860
Doesn't have to do with that, it
doesn't have to do with the

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.810
fact that you just failed
in your job.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.040
Doesn't have to do with
the fact that

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.050
you just lost a client.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.330
Those are events that are
happening in your life.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.780
And what I will show you is that
if the way you respond to

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.040
those events is by activating
your positive intelligence

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.810
brain, you can absolutely be
dealing with all of the

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.060
challenges of your work or life,
while not feeling any of

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:04.040
those unhappy feelings.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.445
And that basically, your
unhappiness comes from the

00:20:08.445 --> 00:20:11.350
fact that you are not in command
of your own mind.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.630
You get sabotaged, you
get hijacked by this

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.570
region of the brain.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.710
Why do we get hijacked
so often by this

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:18.640
region of the brain?

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.350
Think about it.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:23.430
All those negative energies,
the anxiety, the fear,

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.780
paranoia and those
kinds of things.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.320
Think about thousands
of years ago, our

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.020
ancestors in the jungle--

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.720
imagine the one that was very
anxious, and very negative,

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.110
and assumed the worst.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.680
If the tree was starting to
shake and the leaves started

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.170
to shake, and our distant
ancestors started thinking,

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.210
some animals is going to emerge
from behind the tree,

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:48.140
the one who was really
negatively biased, the one who

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.300
was running anxious, the one
who had low positive

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.880
intelligence who assumed, I
don't know enough here, but I

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.970
guarantee you it's going
to be a hungry tiger

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.750
coming to eat me alive--

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:02.340
that one bolted before
anything happened.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.540
That one actually survived.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.280
99 times out of 100, he
or she was wrong.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.590
But the one time he or she was
right, it saved their life,

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.940
and they end up being
our ancestors.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.050
But imagine if you had,
theoretically, this very

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:18.660
optimistic distant ancestor and
the tree started shaking,

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.070
and she or he said, "I
have a good feeling

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.770
about things today.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.490
I'm just feeling very
optimistic.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:30.210
I think a panda bear is going
to emerge from the tree and

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.960
give me a big bear hug
or something."

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.520
How long do you think that
ancestor actually survived?

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:41.410
So the predisposition to
negativity was something that

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:42.620
was helpful for survival.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.230
That part of brain kind
of got developed

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.370
because we all have that.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.510
The problem is, as you can
notice by the way, that these

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.700
things kind of cascaded
on each other.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.860
Stress is the fuel
of this brain.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.660
And once this thing gets going
it loops on itself.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.740
When you're under high stress,
which a lot of you are, it

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.970
begins to fuel all of this
cascade of emotions up there.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:07.330
You are more disappointed with
yourself, you're more

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.870
disappointed with others, you
are more anxious about what's

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.280
going to come next.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.250
All of these things
that come with the

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:16.840
saboteurs end up happening.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.780
And the counterpart, by the way,
it is something that is

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.090
helpful for performance.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.950
We talked about happiness,
but also performance.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.330
Because what I'm going to show
you later is that this region

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.200
of the brain is really good.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.030
It's a specialist for figuring
out what's wrong.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.840
It's a specialist for
seeing the tiger

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.010
where there is a tiger.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.380
But it also sees tigers
in a lot of places

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.520
there are no tigers.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.600
It's really good at picking
up what's wrong

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.670
and what's the problem.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:47.020
The problem is, that is not
really good for creativity.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.940
It's not really good for
resourcefulness.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.480
It's not good for seeing
out of the box.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.540
It's the brain--

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.410
we know that physically, when
you go to this mode, you get

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:56.690
tunnel vision.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:00.000
But what we are now also
discovering that mentally,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.640
intellectually, you get
tunnel vision when

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.990
you go to that brain.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.710
So most of us are living
far more tunnel vision

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:06.590
than we need to.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:09.980
We do not see the easy way out,
easy answer out, because

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.010
we are stuck in the wrong
kind of brain--

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:14.070
wrong part of the brain.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.800
And I'll give you a lot
more examples of this.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.810
Right now I know it's a little
conceptual, but I'm going to

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.270
give you a lot of examples.

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.490
In real life, how does this
happen and why does this end

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:24.390
up being the root
of both higher

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.330
performance and higher happiness?

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:30.850
One other thing, by the way, is
that as you look at it, you

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.180
can either talk about being in
survival brain or saboteur

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.030
mode, or talk about positive
intelligence or sage, it

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.970
doesn't matter, because one is
at the psychological level,

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:43.050
the other is the parallel on
the neurological level.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.490
So one of the things that I want
to show you now about how

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:50.810
we measure this is that like I
said before, to be at the root

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.170
level, we need to make sure
things are simple and also

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:54.280
measurable.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.110
So the way you measure this
positive intelligence quotient

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:00.840
or PQ is the percentage of
time you are in sage mode

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:04.600
versus your saboteur modes.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.980
And we can actually measure it
based on the amount of time

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.850
you spend in different kinds
of emotions, because as you

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:14.210
can see from the previous slide,
the emotions are a

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.340
telltale sign of which part of
your brain is activated.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.840
So we can begin to measure what
that is, and therefore

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.380
really help you figure out how
you're going to be improving

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:29.300
this, and if you are about
to improve this.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:35.860
And by the way, the final thing
I want to say about this

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.980
before actually trying to make
this a lot more concrete for

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:42.570
yourself is what we have done
now is connect this idea of

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.540
positive intelligence, the PQ,
with a lot of different

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:49.010
researchers, a lot of my
colleagues in the field.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:52.240
There's a whole plethora of
connections that are made

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.400
between this idea of what's
the level of positive

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.090
intelligence in you and what
you're going to do in terms of

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.790
both performance
and happiness.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.520
Some are pretty intuitive,
and for example sales--

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.760
this is very hot with
salespeople.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.070
Just imagine the difference
between a

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.970
sales person who wants--

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:14.530
he gets a rejection, or she gets
a rejection at 10 AM, it

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:18.630
takes that person two hours to
recover from being angry and

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:23.110
upset and self-doubt and stress
and all that stuff

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:26.020
before they'll be able to pick
up the phone and have clean

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.270
energy in making the next phone
call, versus somebody

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.410
who is going to be able to shake
off those feelings in

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.270
two minutes.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.330
What difference do you think is
going to make in terms of

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:36.310
their performance?

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.940
How quickly you recover from
negative emotions to positive.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:43.130
And that's one final point I
want to make about this, is

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:46.700
that the question that might
be raised is, is there any

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.020
room for these negative
feelings?

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.300
Is there any room for feeling
angry, feeling anxious,

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.700
feeling upset, feeling
disappointed?

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:59.160
And the answer is yes, but
say about 5% is useful.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.400
The rest of it is not.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.160
And to give you an example of
why and how, think about your

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.475
physical body.

00:26:04.475 --> 00:26:08.640
Do you think it's useful
for you to feel pain

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.640
at a physical level?

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.900
Absolutely.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.850
If you did not feel physical
pain, you would go to the

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.770
kitchen and when the oven, the
stove was left on, you'd put

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:17.670
your hand on the oven.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.360
Because you don't feel
pain, you'd burn

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.330
your hand to the bone.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.920
Therefore, you need
to feel pain.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.700
But when you go and put your
hand on the hot oven and feel

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.530
pain, what do you do?

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:30.850
You take off your hand.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:34.360
How long do you feel the pain
before you get the message?

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:38.540
You get the message in
a tenth of a second.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:43.040
The equivalent of that in our
work and life is, OK, a

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.720
failure has happened in the
middle of your project.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.450
You have made a really
bad mistake.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:50.770
You have just lost a client or
something important like that.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:53.840
Is it good to feel angry,
disappointed,

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.870
any of these feelings?

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:58.930
Absolutely, because otherwise
you'd not be paying attention

00:26:58.930 --> 00:26:59.490
to anything.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.130
There would be no
consequences.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:04.960
But how long is it helpful for
you to stay in those modes?

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.740
For 10 seconds, for a minute,
for two minutes, before you

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.840
find a way to say OK,
wake-up call.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.820
There has been a mistake
or a failure.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.100
What do I do now?

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.970
And the part of your brain
that's going to help you

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:20.020
figure out what to do now is
this part of the brain.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.630
This is good for
a wake-up call.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:23.410
This is good for actually
figuring out

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.250
what the heck to do.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.840
The problem with most of us is
we keep looping in this part

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.810
of the brain, because we remain
upset and disappointed

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:32.760
and anxious and all
that stuff.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.800
So yes, there's value to
them, but not for long.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.580
By the way, a final thing
I would say is--

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:43.520
I promise is the final thing,
I keep saying finally--

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.650
you see something
there called--

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.520
you live 10 years longer if
you have high positive

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.460
intelligence.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.960
This is new science, so I know
some of you are skeptical--

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.300
where the heck is this
number coming from?

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.380
I won't tell you.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.660
You need to go read the book.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:01.780
There's a really fun story about
how come we know that

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.800
people with high positive
intelligence actually live 10

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.210
years longer.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.340
It shouldn't be a surprise to
you, because think about it--

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.600
the neurochemicals that the
survival brain produces are

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.170
neurochemicals like cortisol,
stress hormone coursing

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.270
through your body.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.790
These days it's 24 by 7.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:23.150
Those things were intended to
get activated once every five

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:25.280
days when there's an
actual tiger in the

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.360
jungle, not 24 by 7.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.220
Your body's not supposed
to be running on

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.960
stress all the time.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.310
The fact that you live 10 years
shorter if you have

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:39.090
survival brain activated all the
time, versus the positive

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.850
intelligence brain, where the
chemicals are endorphins--

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.420
all the cool things that
make you feel high.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:50.190
If you live life being high
without resorting to external

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.820
drugs, you live 10
years longer.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.040
And I'm here to show you how
to turn on this cool

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.560
manufacturing facility in your
own brain, to make really cool

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:03.090
chemicals that have you feel
high and live longer and have

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:04.720
higher performance.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.490
OK, so now to get more
specific in terms of

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:09.810
how do we do this.

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:12.250
Going back to one, we want
things to be measurable.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:15.480
If you're at the root level of
what's happening, what's

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.970
impacting your performance and
happiness, it needs to be

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.080
simple, it needs to be
measurable, and it needs to be

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:23.940
actionable.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.660
So please hold me accountable
to those three things.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.170
There are three strategies for
how to increase your positive

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.480
intelligence.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.420
And please pay attention to
whether you believe there are

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.890
simple, actionable,
and measurable.

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:40.880
The first strategy is, hey,
weaken your saboteurs.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.950
If your positive intelligence
is the relative strength of

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.650
your saboteurs versus sage, then
obviously weakening your

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:52.090
saboteurs, weakening the bad
guys, is one way to increase

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.900
your positive intelligence.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.760
Now as you know, I'm
into research.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.550
I lecture on this topic
at Stanford.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:02.180
By the way, I recognize some of
the faces from my Stanford

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.370
lectures on positive
intelligence.

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.340
It's good to see there
are repeat customers.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.770
I'm very happy.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.900
It's a good sign, and I'm really
happy to see you guys.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.970
So I love research, but I also
once in awhile believe in a

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.570
picture is worth more than
a thousand words.

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.180
So to tell you about saboteurs,
let me use a

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.470
picture, not numbers.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:24.620
Now what I want to show you is
what we all used to look like

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.490
before saboteurs started
messing with us.

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:30.230
So if you're a lady, this is
what you used to look like

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:33.470
before saboteurs started
messing with you.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:36.620
This is how we are born--

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:41.990
full of possibility, full of
positivity, full of awareness

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:44.180
of how awesome you really are.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:48.100
Now if you're a guy, you look
like a variation of this.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.160
You think he knows how
amazing he is?

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.670
Every strand of his hair knows
how unbelievable he is, how

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:00.410
awesome life is, and what
his potential is.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.890
We are born with emotional,
energetic access to how

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.540
awesome we are.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:09.960
And our possibility for both
happiness and creating good

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.220
stuff in life.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.530
And then-- by the way, I can't
ever leave this without

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.770
showing these two
are my kids--

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:20.780
my beautiful son [? Kion ?], my
beautiful girl [? Tisa-- ?]

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.630
they too at this stage
of their life,

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:24.990
this is before saboteurs.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:28.240
This is before anybody
has messed with them.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.430
So, and I guarantee that if
I had a picture of you six

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:34.510
months old, a year old, you'd
be as vibrant, as powerfully

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.570
in touch with your amazing
beauty as a human being.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:40.390
But at some point, every
single one of us

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:44.460
starts losing the light.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.030
At some point, these
faces begin to dim.

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:50.840
This energy and joy begins
to dim, and the

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.430
reason is the saboteurs.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:55.170
Now in my own case, it happened
pretty quickly.

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:56.840
In most cases, it
takes longer.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.580
But here's--

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.880
here is my own case.

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:09.730
Do you think this guy knows
how amazing he is?

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:10.390
He used to know.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:12.820
He was born knowing
how awesome he is.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.320
By the way, adorable, right?

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.680
Right, you agree?

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.700
It's amazing what a little
bit of hair does to

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.720
you, or lots of it.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:27.290
My wife assures me that she
thinks bald is cool.

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:28.930
I don't buy it.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:32.170
So basically, yes.

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:35.160
This is only about two years
old, and as you can see in

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.210
this picture, something has
happened to me already.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:40.510
And what had happened to
me was the saboteurs.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:43.780
Now, saboteurs are not initially
the bad guys.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:47.580
The reason we get them is that
saboteurs are actually our

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.390
agents of survival.

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:53.290
And the reason I have the look
that the saboteur brings you,

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:56.170
and this is a dramatic look that
the saboteur brings, is

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.230
that I really needed
my saboteurs to

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:00.360
come and help me survive.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.280
Now I'm going to tell you the
story of how my saboteurs came

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.920
into my life and helped
me survive.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.700
You may not relate to it
from your perspective.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.060
You may have had an easier
childhood, and all that, but

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.380
I'm going to tell you
how even a happy

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.350
childhood results in saboteurs.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:17.810
Basically, what happens is that
as a child we have a need

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:21.460
to survive emotionally and a
need to survive physically.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.530
And the saboteurs come in to
help make sure that you

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:26.630
survive both physically
and emotionally.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:30.810
So in my case, I was born a
happy kid, a very sensitive

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:31.570
and adorable.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.380
OK, that we already
established.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.930
But also a sensitive kid, and
the problem was that I lived

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:42.550
in a two bedroom apartment in
a ghetto with four siblings

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.330
and my parents in poverty.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:46.380
But that wasn't the problem.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.050
The problem was that
my parents--

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:56.660
my father was a very angry and
scary and violent man.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.660
And for a sensitive kid like
me, that was pretty

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.630
devastating, seeing what
happened with me, with my

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.390
mother, with the kids.

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:08.380
So basically, life was not
all that enjoyable.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.100
And the key thing was that I
wasn't getting much love or

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.030
attention from my parents.

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:17.630
Now, I needed to emotionally
survive,

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:19.300
and here's the situation.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.739
There is no way that I could
have admitted to myself that

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:24.070
my parents were flawed.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.570
Imagine how terrifying it
would've been for me to say,

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.929
you know, Shirzad, you're
out of luck.

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:32.449
Your life is in the hands
of imperfect parents.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:34.400
You realize how terrifying
that is?

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.420
It's almost like being under
the sea, scuba diving or

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.199
whatever, and then thinking that
the thing that brings you

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:44.290
air is broken, and
is going to stop

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:45.250
functioning any minute now.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.449
That's terrifying.

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:48.429
My life was in the hands
of my parents.

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:50.770
I needed to keep them perfect.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.719
In order to keep them perfect,
I needed this saboteur that

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:57.360
began to come into my mind,
which I later called it the

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.430
judge saboteur.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:02.360
What this judge saboteur said
to help me survive was, "Hey

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.450
buddy, your parents are actually
perfect beings.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.680
And the reason these perfect
people don't love you is

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.550
because you are such a loser.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.220
You are completely unworthy
of any love or attention.

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.630
They are perfect.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.400
You're a loser."

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.690
It sounds cruel, but actually it
was extremely helpful to me

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.820
surviving my childhood
emotionally.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.135
It would have otherwise been
far more terrifying.

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:28.990
But notice that once this
construct of the judge

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:31.690
saboteur started telling me,
"Shirzad, you're a loser.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:34.020
There's something fundamentally
wrong with you,"

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:38.310
it also started judging
everybody else around me,

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.640
except for my parents and
finding fault in everybody

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.320
else instantly.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.480
I would see anybody and
instantly I would find what's

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.900
wrong with them.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.250
Why do you think that
was necessary?

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:51.320
Once again, the judge saboteur's
saying, "Well,

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.090
Shirzad, you're a loser,
but then don't worry.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:55.570
Everybody else too is.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.650
Everybody else is also broken
and screwed up." It allowed me

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:02.410
to not be terrified by being the
only loser in the world.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:05.380
Now how conscious do you think
I was of this construct

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.300
happening in my mind?

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.320
It was happening at this age.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.190
There's no way I remember
the genesis of it.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:15.640
And most saboteurs start
very early, so we are

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.260
unconscious of them.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:20.950
So here I am growing up, and
I'm a very ambitious person

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:23.530
and become the teacher's
pet, straight A

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.090
student, all that stuff.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:29.080
And I have no idea that I have
this strong judge saboteur.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.560
And then what happens that
changes my life is that at

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:38.420
Stanford Business School, not
far from here, I was in an MBA

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.080
class when I was a
student there.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:46.260
And in this class, what we did
was put people into groups of

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.170
12, and we would meet once a
week in a group of 12 and sit

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:49.800
in a circle.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.940
And we had to tell each other
the honest truth about how we

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.810
were really feeling
about each other.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:58.370
And most of the people in my
life I had fooled into--

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:00.740
not realizing I didn't judge
them or whatever--

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.350
the problem with this group
is after awhile

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:03.720
they get to know you.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.410
And so there is no hiding.

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:08.750
So at one point, one of the
people in the group turned to

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:09.820
me and said--

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.420
and his lips were shaking,
his hand was shaking--

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.520
he said, "Shirzad, this is
really hard for me to tell

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.380
you, but I often feel harshly
judged by you, and it really

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:23.510
bothers me." So I turned to him
and said, "John, thank you

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:25.310
so much for telling me.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:28.640
This is very helpful feedback."
In the back of my

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.960
mind I was thinking, "Well,
of course you feel

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.320
judged by me, you idiot.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:37.790
You are the biggest loser
in this group.

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:41.030
How else do you expect
me to think of you?"

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:42.210
That's really what
I was thinking.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:44.330
But then a second person, a
third person, and a fourth

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:46.580
person said exactly
the same thing.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.800
And believe it or not, I kept
thinking, "Well, take a

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:49.450
number, guys.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:51.005
You're the second biggest loser
in the group, you're the

00:37:51.005 --> 00:37:52.510
third, the fourth, come on.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:54.870
It's amazing how this
is lining up.

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.970
Look at yourself in the mirror,
stop blaming myself

00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:59.210
for your insecurities,
all that stuff."

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:02.220
But then what changed my life
is the fifth person was

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.090
sitting to my left.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.440
At this point he got up in
disgust and went and sat

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.390
across the circle from me and
said, "Shirzad, I feel so

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:11.450
disgusted by your inability to
hear the truth about what

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:12.560
people are telling you.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.420
I literally can no longer sit
next to you." And at that

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:22.940
point, finally, the facade of my
judge saboteur was broken,

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.910
and I finally saw, "Oh my
God, they are right.

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:28.580
I have this automatic habit
of the mind where I judge

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:29.530
everything instantly.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:33.310
I instantly find faults with
others and myself, and it's

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:34.500
something that--

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.250
it's just such an automatic
habit I never think about it."

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:40.005
And that's the moment where I
realized that I had this rude

00:38:40.005 --> 00:38:42.710
little judge saboteur.

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:46.140
And of course, as you can
imagine, that realization

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:46.920
changed my life.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.570
Because as I started looking
into it, I also later

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:51.290
realized, hey, I have
a couple of other

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:53.350
nasty guys in my head.

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:54.700
I also had other saboteurs.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.270
And I did some research in this
work and finally realized

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.950
there are altogether 10
saboteurs, the judge being the

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:00.750
masters saboteur.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:03.490
I had a couple others, but then
so do everybody else.

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:05.780
That part I really loved,
finding out that everybody

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.140
else has saboteurs too.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:10.420
But at that moment, the
terrifying realization was

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.550
that I thought I was the only
one who had the saboteur.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:17.430
So I want to just in the
interest of time, move a

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:23.520
little faster and get into just
talking about how the

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:28.250
saboteurs are in these
two different--

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:31.250
there's a grid of these nine
saboteurs and that the two

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:33.530
dimensions are motivation--

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:36.420
what the saboteur gets you, and
the style with which that

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:40.090
saboteur gets you, that thing
that you're looking for.

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:43.420
And that results in this
cast of characters--

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.260
the controller, hyperachiever,
restless, stickler, pleaser,

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:49.220
and hypervigilant, and
avoider, victim,

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.010
hyperrational.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:53.090
This is the nasty cast of
characters that's running the

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:56.640
show in many of our heads, the
judge being the one that

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.720
everybody has.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:02.250
Then the question is, which
other saboteur do you have?

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:05.020
And I have worked with
hundreds of people--

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:07.930
I have actually literally
coached hundreds of CEOs and

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:09.080
their executive teams.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.800
I have worked with people on
the manufacturing floors.

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.830
I have not yet found a
population that is not

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:18.330
significantly hampered
by the saboteurs.

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:22.070
This is the source of our quiet
desperation in life, and

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:25.630
how we do not achieve a lot of
our potential in the world.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:34.500
So there is an assessment
at the end of--

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.500
actually at the end of this
talk, I'm going to give you,

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.800
there is an assessment online
that you can go and in five

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.540
minutes you can get a bar
chart of your saboteurs.

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:45.730
And the reason I want you to do
that is that one of the key

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:50.300
ways that we want you to weaken
your saboteur is this.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:57.020
If the saboteur is your internal
enemy, I what do we

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.900
do with criminals?

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.120
We create a "Wanted" poster.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.800
And why do we create a "Wanted"
poster for criminals?

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.560
So that we can catch them
the moment they show up.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.730
So ultimately, you want to
create a "Wanted" poster for

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:07.610
your saboteur--

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:09.480
what's its name, what's
its habits, what's its

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.710
characteristics, what's
its belief systems.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:14.380
And the assessment online is
going to help you figure that

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.160
out, figure out what your
judge's characteristics are,

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.390
and what other top saboteur
that you have.

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:23.640
And then what you do after that,
one of the key ways to

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.020
reduce the power of your
saboteur over you is that

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:28.160
every time--

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.270
since you have done the "Wanted"
poster, when it shows

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:33.430
up in your head you can
immediately recognize it.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:35.760
So all you need to do-- one of
the key things that you can do

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.920
is when the thought shows up in
your head, you just label

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.720
that thought as saboteur and let
go, instead of trusting it

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.770
or pursuing it, because now
you know it's your enemy.

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:48.600
So just notice the difference
between me saying "I am going

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:53.050
to fail tomorrow" versus "My
pesky judge saboteur says I'm

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:56.230
going to fail tomorrow." Do
you see the difference?

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:57.350
Do you feel the difference?

00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:01.510
You take away the power, the
credibility of these nasty

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:03.830
characters in your head the
moment you label them,

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:05.740
recognize them as
not your friend.

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:09.700
Label them as they show
up and let go.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.590
And that gets us-- so that's how
you weaken your saboteur.

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:16.930
In the book there are other
strategies for how to weaken

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:18.150
your saboteurs.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:19.890
The second strategy--

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:22.050
remember the first strategy
was weaken your saboteur.

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:26.070
Second strategy is, OK, if you
can weaken the bad guy but can

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:28.330
also strengthen the good guy
or gal inside of you, and

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.620
that's your sage.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:34.510
Now one of the key things about
the sage is the sage

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:35.920
perspective.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.145
And the sage perspective is a
radical departure from how

00:42:39.145 --> 00:42:42.690
your saboteurs have do you deal
with life's challenges

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:43.680
and difficulties.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.210
And here's the sage
perspective.

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:49.670
Every outcome or circumstance
can be turned into a gift and

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.170
opportunity.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:53.850
Every outcome or circumstance
can be turned into a gift and

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:56.410
opportunity.

00:42:56.410 --> 00:43:01.450
And a key way to strengthen your
sage is to actually begin

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:03.170
to embrace that perspective.

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:05.290
Now to help you embrace that
perspective I want to share

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:07.560
with you a story, and also share
with you a little bit of

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:12.100
an experiment somebody did
to prove this hypothesis.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.380
So first, the story.

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.480
And it's a story that comes
from Taoist China.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.690
And it's a stallion
story, where--

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:24.420
it's a story of a farmer who
lives on a farm with his

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.870
stallion and--

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.310
by the way, before I tell
you this story, let

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:29.650
me ask you the question.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:34.250
If you have a prized possession
in your life, and

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:38.060
your most important prized
possession gets stolen, do you

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.560
think that's a good thing
or a bad thing?

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.420
Most of you would say, with the
normal mindsets, of course

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:43.840
that's a bad thing.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.650
What kind of stupid
question is that?

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:48.510
If a loved one falls down and
breaks their leg, is that a

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:50.070
good thing or a bad thing?

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:52.460
Once again, stupid question.

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:53.600
Of course it's a bad thing.

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.190
And basically the sage says,
nonsense to that.

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:59.060
The sage says it's a gift
and opportunity.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.800
And that's what this stallion
story is about.

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:05.540
So this farmer lives on a farm,
and he has a prized

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:06.540
possession, his stallion.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.170
He enters the stallion into a

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:10.750
competition in a nearby village.

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.510
And the stallion wins
first prize.

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:16.150
His neighbors come to
congratulate him, and the

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:20.010
farmer says, "Who knows what's
good and what's bad," which is

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:22.060
a very puzzling response.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.000
The thieves in the neighborhood
have found out

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.680
that this stallion has
won first prize.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.770
It's more precious.

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:29.980
So they come and steal
the stallion.

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.320
The neighbors come to
bring condolences.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.400
Once again, the farmer says,
"Who knows what's good and

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:40.090
what's bad." Again, a very
puzzling response.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:43.220
Another couple of weeks pass,
and the stallion, who is very

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:46.810
free spirited, he runs away from
his captors, finds his

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:49.440
way back to the farmer's farm,
and has befriended all of

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.590
these beautiful wild mares, and
comes to the farm with all

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:55.670
these precious wild mares,
in addition to himself.

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:57.850
The neighbors come to bring
their congratulations.

00:44:57.850 --> 00:45:00.800
Once again, the farmer says,
"Who knows what is good and

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.320
what is bad." Another week or
so passes, and the farmer's

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:09.200
teenage son is riding one of
these wild mares to tame it,

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.570
and he's thrown to the ground
and breaks his leg.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.100
The neighbors come to bring
their condolences, and once

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.570
again, the farmer says, "Who
knows what is good and what is

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:19.770
bad."

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:21.170
Another week or so passes.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:23.630
By the way, by now you have
noticed this village is a very

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:24.600
eventful village.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:28.110
Every week something
monumental happens.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:29.460
I'd like to live in
that village.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.680
It's exciting.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.090
So another week or so passes.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:33.790
A war has broken in the area.

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:36.850
The Imperial Army's coming to
every village to conscript

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:39.900
able-bodied adults, and they
have to bypass his son, the

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.000
farmer's son, because
he has a broken leg.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.400
By this time in the story, the
neighbors have gotten the

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:44.970
picture, right?

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:47.720
They don't even bother to
come and bring their

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.020
congratulations because
they know what the

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:50.990
farmers going to say.

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:53.070
What is the farmer
going to say?

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:56.740
"Who knows what is good and what
is bad." Now, there is

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:58.670
one thing about this
story that's

00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:59.690
different from our sage.

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:03.750
In this story, the farmer
miraculously passively waits

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:06.550
for the bad thing to turn
into the good thing.

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:08.290
Now our sage is very active.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:12.710
Our sage says, "I can and I
shall turn this bad thing into

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:15.670
a gift and opportunity." So
please, if you miss your

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:18.520
numbers for the quarter, do
not go to your manager and

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:23.770
say, "Boss, I have missed all my
numbers, but who knows what

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:26.710
is good and what is bad."
Don't do that.

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:29.940
Say, "I have made mistakes here,
but I know how to turn

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:32.460
it into a gift and
opportunity."

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:39.500
And once you do that, once you
assume the sage perspective of

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.670
everything can be turned into
a gift and opportunity, your

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:46.030
brain shifts to the region of
the brain that's your positive

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:47.310
intelligence brain.

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:51.580
That brain is far more capable
of being resourceful.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:56.710
And one of the most powerful,
inspiring examples that a

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:59.190
researcher by the name of
Richard Wiseman did to prove

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:03.780
this point is that he actually
brought some study subjects

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.940
that were running
on low positive

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.290
intelligence, in his terms.

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:11.800
They felt unlucky and things
like that, versus another

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.540
group that runs on high positive
intelligence who are

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:17.340
feeling lucky and optimistic
and that kind of thing.

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:21.640
He gave both groups this
challenge that said, there's

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.200
this newspaper that
I've created.

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.410
The newspaper had many,
many pages.

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:29.510
Find out how many pictures are
in this newspaper as quickly

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:31.500
as you can and you get a reward
if you find the right

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:32.980
number really fast.

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.690
The first group that was
running on low positive

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:36.340
intelligence, they paged through
every page in the

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:38.210
newspaper really painstakingly,
counted all

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:40.950
those pictures, and proudly
announced within about two

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:42.890
minutes on average-- two minutes
on average they said,

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:45.300
"Hey, there are 43 pictures
on this newspaper."

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:48.230
They felt very proud of
themselves that they performed

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:49.560
and got the right number.

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:51.320
Here's the interesting
challenge.

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.940
The second group, who are
running more on high positive

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:57.550
intelligence, they came back
within 10 seconds and gave the

00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:58.240
right answer.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.080
You know why and how?

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.220
They saw that on the second
page of the newspaper, the

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:08.920
entire half of the newspaper in
two-inch high letters said,

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.480
"Stop counting.

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.680
There are 43 pictures
in this newspaper."

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.980
That's how a brain that's
running on positive

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:22.240
intelligence region operates.

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.740
It sees opportunities.

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.210
It sees the panoramic view.

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:27.320
It's not tunnel vision.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:30.910
The question I have for you is,
how many of you are having

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:34.560
your life be difficult and your
work be difficult because

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:38.780
your saboteurs are telling
you it's just so.

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:42.700
Because the part of your brain
that is used in the no pain,

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.610
no gain-- used to life being
difficult, and challenges

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:49.290
being stressful, is running you,
versus the part that can

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:52.150
figure out on second page, the
answer is right there.

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:55.510
The easy answer is right
in front of your nose.

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:58.290
The sage perspective is not a
matter of spiritual leap of

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:00.640
faith, it's a self-fulfilling
prophecy.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:04.410
If you believe in the sage
perspective, your brain shifts

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:09.290
into the region that will be
able to actually turn whatever

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:11.870
the challenge, difficulty,
failure, even your failures

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:14.960
and mistakes, and turns them
actively into gifts and

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:15.630
opportunities.

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:16.550
It's not a matter of faith.

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:18.940
It's a matter of a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:20.850
Your saboteurs are a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:22.510
So is your sage.

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:27.820
And once you actually activate
the sage, with this

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:30.410
perspective you actually get
automatic access, because of

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:34.890
that part of your brain, to
five powerful sage powers.

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:38.460
And what I do in the book is
show you that every life

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:42.030
challenge or every work
challenge can be handled by a

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:43.880
combination of these five
powers that you have

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.130
it inside of you.

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:47.850
If you shift to that region,
you'll tap into it.

00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:50.270
And you'll be able to handle
all your challenges without

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:53.530
ever resorting to things that
make you anxious and negative.

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:57.090
And these five powers
are empathize--

00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:59.520
rather than beating yourself up
and beating other people up

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.135
when difficulties happen,
can you be

00:50:01.135 --> 00:50:02.710
compassionate with yourself.

00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:05.600
You have access to that in
positive intelligence brain.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:06.650
Explore--

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:09.300
can you be a fascinated
anthropologist with great

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:12.230
excitement, figure out what's
going wrong, rather than the

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:15.400
shame or blame or difficulty
or anxiety.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.120
Innovate--

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.870
can you be truly
out of the box?

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:22.080
The positive intelligence brain
is wired for creativity.

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.170
The survival brain is not
a very creative brain.

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:25.520
It gets stuck in the box.

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.710
If you have shifted yourself,
you have access to far more

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:29.090
creativity.

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:30.140
Navigate--

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:34.040
when you generate lots of
options, can you navigate your

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.970
path and figure the option
that's more aligned with your

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:40.700
deeper sense of purpose and
meaning-- the part where your

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.920
song lives?

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:45.490
That's how you end up singing
your true song in the world.

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:47.460
And finally, activate--

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.620
and with activate, the
way I describe it is

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:51.980
like the Jedi activate.

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:54.740
When the Jedi is being attacked
by lots of enemies at

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:58.800
the same time, the Jedi takes
action with complete focus and

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.440
complete peace.

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:02.920
There is no anger, there's no
stress, there's nothing.

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.410
There's just pure action.

00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:12.110
Can you move into action with
the clarity and calm

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:13.880
and focus of a Jedi?

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:14.870
That's why, again,
your positive

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:16.540
intelligence brain gets you.

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:19.310
Survival brain has you take
action with all this drama and

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:23.370
all this waste of energy--
emotional and mental energy,

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:26.910
so your action is not going
to be as impactful.

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:30.170
And again, the book is all about
how different people--

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:32.400
real-life leaders, CEOs
that I've coached--

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:36.330
have used these five powers to
achieve both greater happiness

00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:38.150
and also effectiveness.

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:42.730
And that brings us, finally,
to the last of the three

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:45.060
strategies, which is strengthen

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.730
the PQ brain region.

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:49.690
This one is about going right
to the heart of the matter.

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:53.630
How do you make sure you build
the brain muscle that

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:57.180
automatically has you be much
more in the positive

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:59.790
intelligence region of your
brain, rather than the

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:00.750
survival brain.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:03.480
The first two strategies were
at the psychological level.

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:07.030
This strategy is at the
neurological level.

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:10.980
So those brain regions that I
talked about-- the ancient way

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.930
of making sure you shift
to that brain region--

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:17.720
what do you think the ancient
way has been?

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.550
Meditation.

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:22.370
So meditation has been the
ancient way, proven beyond any

00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:26.110
doubt now by researchers that
has a profound, lasting impact

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:27.260
if you regularly meditate.

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.000
Here is the problem.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.530
About 10 years ago, I started
requiring every one of my CEO

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:36.050
clients to do 20 minutes of
meditation a day, or anybody

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:37.540
who wanted to be my client.

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:40.650
Everybody promised-- not a
single person said no.

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:44.790
What percentage of them do you
think actually did it?

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:46.400
About 10 percent.

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:51.930
The problem with meditation, I
found, is that it's not simple

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:52.680
and actionable.

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.650
For a vast majority of people,
it's not a tool that works,

00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:56.780
unfortunately.

00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:59.120
Even though if you use
that tool, it's a

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.160
very profound tool.

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.630
So I went back to the functional
MRI and the studies

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:07.760
and tried to find another way
where we can activate that

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.740
region of the brain without
it being such a high bar.

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.790
And what that way is is what
I call a PQ rep, a positive

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:14.680
intelligence--

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:16.190
PQ stands for positive
intelligence.

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:21.950
You need to get about 100
PQ reps a day for--

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:26.250
and what a PQ rep is, it's 10
seconds of bringing your full

00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:29.820
attention, as much as you can,
to any of your physical

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.460
sensations.

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:35.450
And it's something you can do
any minute of any day in the

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:36.930
middle of anything that
you're doing.

00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:41.190
For example, right this moment,
begin to feel the

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:44.520
weight of your whole
body on your butt.

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:46.820
You have been sitting on your
butt, but have you been aware

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:47.350
of your butt?

00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:48.190
No.

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.630
You haven't.

00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:49.870
You have been in your head.

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:52.290
So become aware of your
butt right now, for

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:54.550
the next ten seconds.

00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:57.210
And that will activate a region
your brain that ends up

00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:00.260
building your positive
intelligence capabilities.

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:03.050
Or it can be any sensations.

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:06.070
Rub two fingertips against each
other with such exquisite

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:08.370
attention that you can
feel the fingertip

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:09.690
ridges on both fingers.

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:13.230
If you do that for 10 seconds,
you'll be able to actually

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:15.440
activate that part
of the brain.

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.840
The most common way, the next
few breaths, feel the rising

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.920
and falling of your chest
or stomach with

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:22.940
your next few breaths.

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:25.710
More fun ways, even when you're
not in the middle of a

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:28.465
meeting, next time you have
lunch, can you, for God's

00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:32.860
sake, just a few bites, a few
bitefuls, can you actually,

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:36.640
exquisitely taste the amazing
taste of what you have put in

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.140
your mouth?

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.850
Can you close your eyes for 10
seconds and really feel what

00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:42.060
it is you put in your mouth?

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.850
When you're taking a shower,
can you feel the

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:44.750
water on your skin?

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:47.970
Can you hear the sound
of the water?

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:50.210
When you're hugging your loved
one-- this is my favorite--

00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:52.890
next time you're hugging your
loved one, can you hold on for

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:54.020
10 seconds?

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:57.730
Long enough to actually
feel their heartbeat,

00:54:57.730 --> 00:54:59.390
or feel their breathing?

00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:02.240
It will have an impact
on your relationship.

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:04.960
So what I have done, hopefully,
with this third

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:08.990
strategy is again, make it
simple and actionable.

00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:11.990
Can you get a few
PQ reps a day?

00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:15.170
An hour, so that it builds
up to about 100.

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:17.890
I have shown you that you just
got three PQ, three or four

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:19.230
right now, sitting here.

00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:20.110
You can get there.

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:21.600
The question is, will you?

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.770
One of the other final insights
I want to show you

00:55:23.770 --> 00:55:27.100
about this third strategy
is the following.

00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:29.820
One of my biggest mistakes
through many years of trying

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:32.420
to transform myself into a much
happier person, a more

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:35.910
capable person, was the lie
of the insight model.

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:38.700
The lie of the insight
model is, if only I

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:39.930
read the right book.

00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:42.900
If only I get the right insight,
and get the answers,

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.480
I'm going to be transformed.

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:49.450
The lie there is that actually,
in reality, personal

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:52.790
transformation is more
of a fitness model.

00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:55.400
You would never go to a workshop
on physical fitness,

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.230
come back and say, honey,
I'm fit for life.

00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:59.000
I figured it out.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:55:59.810
You will never do that.

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:03.080
You'll say, "I'm motivated to go
to the gym every day," but

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.950
then you've got to go to
the gym every day.

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:07.400
My work has been-- because
these are muscles.

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.550
These are brain muscles that
need to be developed and

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:10.470
maintained.

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:14.220
My job has been, show you how
fun and easy it can be.

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:17.780
Your job is, do you care enough
for an orbital shift to

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:21.080
a much higher level of sustained
happiness and

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:21.860
effectiveness?

00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:24.970
Do you care enough to put as
much attention on it as you

00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:28.390
did in learning how to play
golf, or tennis, or all sorts

00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:30.260
of other things you
do every day?

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:33.330
So I'd like to begin to wrap up
by basically pointing you

00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:38.360
to PositiveIntelligence.com.

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:41.820
It's where you can find a free
5 minute saboteur assessment

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:45.470
to figure out a bar chart
of your top saboteurs.

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:48.240
In a couple of minutes, you
get an assessment of your

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.740
positive intelligence--

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:53.260
what is your PQ score, so how
are you doing, and then keep

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.030
track of your progress.

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:57.990
And please send me emails on
your progress because I love

00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:01.170
to know what this work is
doing in the world.

00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:03.820
The dream that I have
is the following.

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:06.700
I believe by figuring
out the roots--

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:10.270
the root level of what creates
much higher happiness and

00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:14.000
productivity, that we now
finally, after all these

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.530
centuries, can create a world
where in 20, 30, 40 years,

00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:22.410
we'll basically be reading
Thoreau's haunting and

00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:25.082
heartbreaking quote and say
it used to be like that.

00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:30.400
And the dream will come alive,
really, when we finally begin

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.170
to teach our children this.

00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:35.860
Imagine how insane it is that we
teach our kids literature,

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:39.250
and history, and math, and
everything, except we don't

00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:41.910
teach them probably the most
important thing, which is

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:44.050
mastery over their own mind.

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:47.310
The science and technology
of happiness and highest

00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:48.010
performance--

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:50.370
why do we not teach
this stuff?

00:57:50.370 --> 00:57:53.720
So help me make sure in 20, 30
years we are teaching this in

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:54.740
every high school.

00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:56.270
Imagine the kind of world
we're going to

00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:57.750
build if you do that.

00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:59.890
And one final thing I want
to say about that.

00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:02.450
If you want to spread
a fire, you need to

00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:03.640
possess the fire yourself.

00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:08.010
You cannot spread that fire
unless you have let the fire

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:10.400
inside your own heart
and mind.

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.460
Please light it.

00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:12.160
You're worth it.

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:15.290
You deserve a lot more happiness
and peace of heart,

00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:16.220
peace of mind.

00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:19.390
You deserve a lot more
effectiveness in reaching your

00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:20.480
true potential in the world.

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:24.440
And this hopefully, I've shown
you a way to do that.

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:31.080
For final sense of how universal
this is, I just want

00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.010
to show you this last slide.

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:36.960
This is my little
girl [? Tisa ?].

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:40.920
I had missed her a lot after
a week of being on a trip.

00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:45.140
She hugged me and it is a
spontaneous kiss that we had.

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:46.210
Somebody took a picture.

00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:48.680
But I'm just showing you this
final thing because I want to

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:51.700
show you how universal the
saboteur phenomenon is.

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:54.490
She's a real angel, right,
in this picture?

00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:56.200
I want to show you her demon.

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:58.510
She has an Incredible
demon inside of her.

00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:03.050
She had created this little 5
1/2 by 11 thing for me and my

00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:07.540
wife, saying, "I love you, Mommy
and Daddy." And we just

00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:08.900
loved it so much,
we put it on the

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:12.240
bedroom door in our bedroom.

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.895
So then once she got it, she
wanted to do something and I

00:59:14.895 --> 00:59:16.126
held really hard boundaries
with her.

00:59:16.126 --> 00:59:18.530
And she was really upset
with me and went away.

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:21.090
And a few hours later, I was
passing the corridor, and

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:24.615
passed the door to my bedroom,
and this is what I saw.

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:34.940
So not only had she crossed out
"Daddy," but to make sure

00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:38.070
I got the message, she
put No up there.

00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:41.570
So she has a little demon inside
of her, the saboteur.

00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:43.815
I told her, it hurt my feelings,
whatever, I helped

00:59:43.815 --> 00:59:45.645
her shift to the sage mode.

00:59:45.645 --> 00:59:48.950
And the next day she actually
said to me, "Daddy, I have a

00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:49.930
surprise for you.

00:59:49.930 --> 00:59:53.280
Close your eyes." She held my
hand, brought me to the front

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.460
of the bedroom.

00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:55.730
This is what she had done.

00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:58.180
She had actually cut out
the bottom, replaced it

00:59:58.180 --> 00:59:59.213
with the new Daddy.

00:59:59.213 --> 01:00:03.160
And what I said to you before is
every challenge and problem

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.360
is a gift and opportunity.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.340
Look.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:08.260
Daddy is now bigger
than Mommy.

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.610
Daddy is bigger than Mommy.

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:11.200
The whole thing just
worked out great.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.570
This stuff works.

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:15.480
Please go do it.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.790
And thank you for your time.

01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:21.690
I'll stay here for
your questions.

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:22.590
Thank you.

01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:23.840
Thank you.
