00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.310
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music
Division, Library of Congress:

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.610
I am Anne McLean from the
Library's concert office

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.770
and it's my great pleasure
tonight to be talking

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.820
with all four members
of the Artemis Quartet.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.430
We're expecting three
out of four

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.000
and we've got the whole quartet.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.980
This is very exciting.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.390
Gregor Sigl, Anthea Kreston,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.240
Vineta Sareika, and
Eckart Runge.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.890
Welcome.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.190
&gt;&gt; [Unison] Thank you.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.490
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music
Division, Library of Congress:

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.790
Probably some of you
know this quartet is one

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.940
of the most foremost
groups on the stage today.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.560
Their superb artistry,
stellar musicianship,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.790
and sheer exuberance make
their performances memorable.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.390
The Financial Times talks

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.790
about a vitality that's
utterly compelling.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.750
And probably a few of
you tonight, like me,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.790
have a wonderful memory
of their appearance

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.190
with us a few seasons back.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.070
Eckart, you've performed
here then.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.980
But you're the only
one of this group.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.930
But Anethea, you performed

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.920
at the Amelia Quartet
-- Trio, didn't you?

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.220
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston: Yes I did.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.520
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: Wonderful.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.820
So we -- that's one

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.120
of the things I thought
would be interesting to talk

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.690
about is continuity and how
groups change and develop

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.190
over time and new people
and so forth and so on.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.120
You appear regularly
in an impressive number

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.970
of the world's great concert
halls on four continents.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.830
And I believe you now
curate your own series

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.180
at three of them.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.810
Say which ones they are
and how you work these.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.110
How do you do it?

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.740
How do you fit that in?

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.040
Gregor.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.100
&gt;&gt; Gregor Sigl: we do a series
in our hometown in Berlin

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.910
as well as Vienna and in Munich.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.670
And that's we -- go there
three times a season.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.280
We do three programs
each season.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.530
And it's very demanding, but
it's actually quite a feeling

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.000
to -- we realized that the
audience becomes friends

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.300
with us.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.600
And if you go there regularly,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.900
you have a totally
different atmosphere

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.430
when you enter the hall,
and you get a reception

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.490
that is very different
from just visiting once

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.560
or twice each couple of years.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.890
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music
Division, Library of Congress:

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.890
Do you have -- do you choose
your own repertoire for each one

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.200
and a do you ever do
educational commitments

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.560
or outreach or anything?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.060
No time, really, probably.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.720
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston: Well,
we are all four professors

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.190
at the University of
the Arts in Berlin,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.980
so we have a full load there.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.080
I think we take care of around
40 or 50 groups there as well

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.710
as some master groups that
come in just to work with us

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.150
in short-term periods.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.160
And we are also master
teachers in Brussels,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.230
the Queen Elizabeth Chapel,

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.090
and there we have six master
groups to do the same thing.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.510
They live in different counties
and they come for several days

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.500
and work individually with us.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.650
So we are kind of maxed out
with the old education stuff.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.480
But which is important
and a great part

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.780
of our lives, of course.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.080
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: Oh, my God.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.920
I am sort of amazed because I
know your touring schedule is

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.050
hefty and to be able
to add that...

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.300
&gt;&gt; Vineta Sareika: We are
not teaching this week.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.600
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: Yeah.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.220
You have -- this is a
multi-city stop tour

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.040
in the U.S. How many cities are
you going to be in now here?

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.510
&gt;&gt; Vineta Sareika: We
are doing 11 concerts.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.810
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music
Division, Library of Congress:

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.110
That is a lot, more than
your last tour, I think.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.410
Yeah.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.710
&gt;&gt; Vineta Sareika: So we started
the tour yesterday in Princeton.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.010
It was very nice.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.310
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: Uh-huh.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.610
That's a nice, nice venue.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.910
&gt;&gt; Vineta Sareika: Yeah.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.210
&gt;&gt; Eckart Runge: We
are still quite fresh.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.510
[ Laughing ]

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.810
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: Yeah.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.110
I can understand.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.410
&gt;&gt; Vineta Sareika: So next
week we are going to Ann Arbor.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.230
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston: And that
was Kalamazoo, Ann Arbor...

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.080
&gt;&gt; Vineta Sareika: Houston,
New York, and the West Coast.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.500
Three concerts on
the West Coast.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.800
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.100
Library of Congress:
Well, we are lucky.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.400
We'd tied for you last time
and we couldn't capture you.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.560
So this time, we're lucky.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.540
I know that Beethoven has
remained a focus for you

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.270
since the quartet was founded.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.180
And that one of your early
formative experiences was a

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.870
shared passion to
master the Grosse Fuge.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.770
So I want to ask about that how
you engage with Beethoven now.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.840
I know you have a residency
and an honorary membership

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.370
at the Beethoven House in Bonn
which is pretty interesting.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.920
You can see a really
masterly performance

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.260
by a very young Artemis quartet

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.390
in a documentary
called Strings Attached.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.190
And if you happen to have a
Medici subscription you can find

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.860
it on there.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.160
And it's kind of fascinating.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.350
It's one of the cleanest
and most precise

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.960
that I've ever heard actually.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.510
And this is when you
were much younger.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.230
So are you still engaged with
this work and does it...?

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.630
Yeah, how is a figure
in your lives?

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.840
&gt;&gt; Eckart Runge: I think
Beethoven has been a very

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.740
essential part of our repertoire
throughout the whole history

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.600
of the quartet and I'm sure
and I hope that our readings

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.900
and interpretations

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.650
of Beethoven's music have
changed throughout the years.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.960
But somehow we always felt
so connected to this music

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.320
and we had two wonderful seasons
where we played only Beethoven.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.800
We did the whole
cycle for two years.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.410
And the most remarkable
experience for me

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.160
in this time was I
was little worried

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.880
that playing Beethoven two years
would be maybe a little too much

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.760
and we would start to miss
Bartok and Shostakovich and --

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.500
but the truth was that
we couldn't get enough.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.710
It was like addictive.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.560
Because the music has everything
a whole concert program needs.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.860
And it has the connection
to the tradition

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.560
and also the huge modernism.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.800
So I think probably
this was the fact

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.470
that we felt most connected
to, that Beethoven was

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.460
so modern for his time.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.680
Probably the most modern
of any composer ever.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.980
And on the other
kind, of course,

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.210
connected to the great
quartet tradition.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.900
And we somehow always
strongly identified with that

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.280
and it's just a pleasure to see
how this music developed also

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.120
through the different formations
of the group and just because of

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.540
who we played last season.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.050
We did it a lot.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.570
And so this work has
always accompanied us.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.870
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: You know,

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.540
I was -- I ran across
a note somewhere

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.510
that you can see online the --
Beethoven's own transcription

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.100
of the work for four
hands and I wondered

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.870
if you'd ever played it.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.410
I will send you it if you
would like, but it's kind

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.000
of fascinating to see this
on -- in a manuscript score.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.350
But the reason it stuck in my
mind is that, as you'll read

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.800
in the program notes tonight,
Schumann, Clara Schumann played

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.510
through Haydn, Mozart, and
Beethoven quartets to learn them

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.240
and to understand the format
before he began to write his.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.860
And somehow when I read about
this, it popped into my mind

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.850
about this Beethoven
[inaudible].

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.150
&gt;&gt; Gregor Sigl: Yeah.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.860
It has been -- we
actually did a program

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.030
when a piano dual played
the Grosse Fuge, four hands,

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.850
and after the break -- or
other way around, we played it

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.210
in the string quartet
version and it was incredible

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.510
to see how different it is.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.140
It's an entirely
different thing --

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.440
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music
Division, Library of Congress:

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.740
So instructive, you know,

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.880
to see how he's thinking
[inaudible] and ideas and so on.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.680
By the way, I always
have to tell people this

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.980
that this is the --

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.120
this portrait behind us is
the real Heckel portrait.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.630
It's an original.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.850
Beethoven House has another one,

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.100
but we are proud
to have this one.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.870
&gt;&gt; Gregor Sigl: We
will tell them.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.170
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: Would you?

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.470
Great. Okay.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.360
So Beethoven continues
certainly to be a focus for you.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.490
And it is a hugely
important element

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.280
in your identity,
really, as a quartet.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.300
And this question of identity
was one that was on my mind

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.790
when I knew you were coming.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.710
Thinking about your quartet
and other significant ones

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.800
like Takacs, Julliard,
Alban Berg, and many others,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.380
quartets have been -- that
have been in existence

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.430
for decades growing
and developing

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.440
as quartet players
come into the new ones.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.390
And I saw an article in the
Strad magazine that touches

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.340
on this about how quartets come

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.680
to create their own
identities and voices.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.500
This -- there's a
man name Tully Potter

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.500
who writes a lot about quartets.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.230
He's an historian of quartets.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.650
And I think it was his
concept of the fifth partner,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.130
an indefinable presence
that defines a quartet.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.330
It sounds very eerie, but
it was so interesting.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.630
And I wondered what --

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.850
how do you feel that
things get passed along?

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.080
How does a group evolve
when you change colleagues?

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.580
What do you concentrate on?

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.820
And what are the
challenges in recalibrating?

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.750
&gt;&gt; Gregor Sigl: I mean
what is fascinating is

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.130
that simply the amount of time
you spent together working

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.670
on music is so intense,
it's different

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:13.410
than anything else you do
rehearsing without musicians.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.690
It's even way more
intense than studying.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:21.250
You don't have a teacher that
is right next to you for 5,

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.820
6 hours a day and inspires
you or tells you what is wrong

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.390
or you can tell what is wrong.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:33.570
So the influence we have on
each other is very strong.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.340
And think that is also the
answer why there is an identity

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.640
of a quartet.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:45.740
It comes a product of many
influences and it becomes yours.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:52.690
We influence each other and we
find something that is common.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.780
And that -- it's also passed on.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.590
If someone leaves --
it is our experience

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.230
that if someone leaves,
it's not necessarily a loss.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:05.030
You should keep that, what the
person brought to the quartet

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.820
and add something new.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.440
It can be the opposite.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.080
It can be a huge
development too.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:18.660
So that's what we are trying
to do keep all these treasures

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.900
with each new member coming to
the quartet, add something new,

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.000
add a new color, new power,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.160
fresh blood that's
something very healthy to do.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.840
&gt;&gt; Vineta Sareika: You know it
is such an incredible feeling

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.370
when you come to a
group that has existed

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:40.020
since 15 years in
my case -- yeah.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.050
Yeah, it's like the feeling
to sit down in a limousine

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.360
that is already on its way.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.330
Everything is working and you --

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.830
there are so many interesting
things and those little details

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:56.850
that you speak about in the
rehearsal that you can just take

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.150
of it every day, and...

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.080
So I think the most important
thing for new member is

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.490
to be open-minded and to, yeah,
to really be very attentive

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.590
to everything that has
been done in the group

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:08.890
and on the other hand,

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:13.360
the remaining members should be
open-minded for the new impulses

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.550
that are coming from new person.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.850
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: Well,

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.150
what I heard in the rehearsal,
you just sound superb.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.540
You'll be just astounded.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.230
Their sound is gorgeous
and huge.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.880
But I can imagine that -- I know
something about the backgrounds

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.590
of each of you and your
work as chamber musicians

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:34.260
and this is an amazing
amalgamation of talent and ideas

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.530
and it's interesting that
your sound is so blended and

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.980
yet individual to what I hear.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.030
And I know something
about your solo work

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.380
with orchestras and so on.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.050
And you have had a very --
you started with a quartet

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.540
and then also a trio and you've
had major chamber experience

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.350
with so many great players.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.550
And I know something about
your tango playing and your --

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.970
but many other things.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:03.190
And Gregor is both a
violinist and violist

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:07.930
and so it's really a
remarkable group in this way.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:11.820
We wanted to talk with
you a little too about:

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:14.690
how do you rehearse?

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:20.330
I heard you talk maybe on an
interview about how you rehearse

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.010
as if you are performing almost.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:26.550
That you are so intent and
I loved that description.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.990
I hadn't heard people talk
about it like that before.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.950
You think of rehearsals
as repetitive, you know

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.250
&gt;&gt; Eckart Runge:
Well, I think --

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.270
well, we try to focus on is

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.800
that we don't do the
music for ourselves.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.760
It doesn't make sense
that we enjoy the music.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.060
I mean, we do.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.080
But that's not our issue.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.000
The issue is to pass over
the emotions to the public.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.220
So I think this is -- and the
public's not right next to us.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.600
So sometimes we have to
play a little differently

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.290
than we hear it on our place
because it has to sound right

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:10.180
in the 15th row of a concert
hall and not on our lap.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:17.710
So I think to do that or to be
in that mode or in that spirit,

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:23.890
every rehearsal has to have
the focus on how do we get

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.990
out what we think the
composer intended emotionally.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:33.770
And it doesn't make sense
to rehearse at 30 percent

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.350
because then you
practice wrong things.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:40.360
And so it might be a little
tiring to rehearse as we do,

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:45.080
but I think it is the only way
to achieve this goal to bring

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.850
out the emotional goosebumps
or whatever you want

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.440
to call it out in the hall.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.760
And, yeah, that is just
a thing we've always done

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.260
from the very first day somehow.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.330
I don't know why, but we did.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.860
&gt;&gt; Vineta Sareika: I think also
technically it changes a lot

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.460
if you don't rehearse
100 percent.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.170
With the adrenaline
of the concert

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.860
and the stress will
be huge if you are

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.220
in a different situation,
if you've never felt

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.900
that before rehearsing.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.190
So that's another reason
why we try to keep...

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.490
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music
Division, Library of Congress:

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.540
And I think you were
saying one --

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.890
in this interview that I
watched that you always feel

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.500
that if you do something
a little differently

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.350
that quartet colleagues
will be very supportive

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.050
and they will notice you.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.350
And, you know, you don't --

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.660
it's like have a
network underneath you

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.980
or a net underneath you.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.300
You never have to think about
it [inaudible] the freedom

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.490
to experiment and
jump out there.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.790
I was thinking when you were
talking about the expression

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.640
of emotion, I was thinking

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.060
when had the Minguet Quartet
here a few months ago,

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.390
we had an interesting
conversation with them

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.870
because they were playing the
Zreutzer Sonata of Janacek

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.370
which is, of course,
that's a very intense

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.640
and dramatic program
based on the told story --

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:05.780
short story and it has many
tremendous psychological shifts.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.960
And if you've ever
seen a picture --

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.430
you remember the
old Taboo perfume ad

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.580
where the man has a
violin in one hand

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.540
and he grabs a woman
with the other?

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.480
That image is sort
of relates to this --

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.360
some people relate
that image to this.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.250
But anyway, what was interesting
was that they said --

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.070
we were talking about
programs and whether they chose

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.610
to pursue a programmatic
approach or abstract approach.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.500
They said vigorously
that they do not look

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.980
at any exterior sources.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.110
They do not think about
the program at all.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:41.320
They only go for the abstract
music and they work from that

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.680
to create their own
version, their own drama.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.320
And I was just curious
about that for you.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.000
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston: Do you
mean when we are programming?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.990
When we're figuring out which
pieces should go to together?

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.290
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: No,

00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:00.010
I mean literally do you
or do you choose to read

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.990
such background material
and learn

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.540
about the history and so on.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.840
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston:
Oh, I absolutely do.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.110
We probably are all
different actually

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:09.890
and that's quite different.

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.720
And that's probably very good.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.310
But I'm a big, big reader
and a big researcher.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:19.600
And I try to -- whether
it's even something related

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.620
to that particular work.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.920
I'm constantly drawing
things from around

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.770
that period maybe historically
what was happening at the time.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.070
What wars were happening.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.060
What was happening with
that's person's life.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.780
What was happening with her
love life, with their children,

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.800
everything absolutely.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.880
It's all -- and when I hear --
when I hear -- I'm always --

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.510
I want more [singing] cu-la,
I'm always -- I'm always --

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.190
and they're like, okay, it's a
little too much [singing] cu-la.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.710
Or I'm like [singing] cula.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.190
And so I'm always -- I'm just
thinking about, you know,

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.950
Robert and Clara and then Brahms
and then I just, you know,

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.920
I'm always put too
much cula on there.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.840
But, I mean -- that's
because I -- yeah.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.880
And everyone's different and
I think that's the magic.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.700
I don't even know
how much you guys --

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.620
&gt;&gt; Gregor Sigl: No,
I do that too.

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.920
I can read.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.370
No, what I find astonishing
is because there's always

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.460
that question: is music --

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.210
for example, is Beethoven's
music up-to-date?

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.700
Is it -- or is it old music?

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.770
I think that this is not
even a question to ask

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:34.210
because the more we pick
up that music again, again,

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:40.090
we realize that this is
actually something right there.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.390
It's a an motion.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.690
It's something you can feel.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:48.110
It doesn't matter when you
feel love or pain or desire.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.330
It's -- it didn't change.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:55.470
So to realize that this is
such an incredible achievement.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:02.210
How is it actually possible to
put this on paper with rules,

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.960
rules of composing
and just with ink

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.410
and paper: how is that possible?

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:12.450
And it's still alive and you
can wake it up at any time

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.430
and feel it so deeply.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.570
And that is absolutely
astonishing.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.690
Of course, when you know about
what happened at that time,

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:24.050
it is -- this is fascinating
and opens your eyes.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:29.550
But at the same time, it is
so -- it's just right there.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.040
The better the composer,

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:37.140
the more obvious it is what
you can read in this core.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.410
It's just with Beethoven
-- in my opinion.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.660
There are not just
not two opinions

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.230
about if something
is in a certain way.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.840
It's really fascinating.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.640
So both things are interesting.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.090
You can approach it knowing --
actually, maybe it doesn't work.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.080
I mean, you need to have
a knowledge and you need

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.600
to have experience
to understand it.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.650
But once you understand it,
you realize that it's fresh

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.780
and it's pure emotion.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.240
&gt;&gt; Vineta Sareika: I actually
like to think of every composer

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.940
that we are working and
we play their music.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.990
To think of them like actual
human beings, like my friends,

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.510
or like people that I know.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:24.220
Because I think nowadays
people spend so much time

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:29.000
to build a façade, to appear
a little bit more intelligent

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.350
or more beautiful
or more whatever.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:36.430
And, you know, in this society
is sometimes a bit annoying

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:42.680
that it's impossible to
see the real human being,

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.980
you know, behind that.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.760
And I think with music
is a fantastic thing

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.090
because it's like a mirror.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.570
It's like there's no
place for this façade.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:56.240
You can really feel the
person that Mozart was

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.110
or that Schumann was or, you
know, it was all their emotions,

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.350
was there naiveness
maybe or their shyness

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.230
or their great passion
and that's --

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.730
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:08.030
Library of Congress:
It's all there.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.330
&gt;&gt; Vineta Sareika:
Yeah, that's great --

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.630
a great thinking about music.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:11.930
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: Exactly.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.230
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston:
And an amazing part

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:17.150
of being an American having
moved to Berlin and teaching

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.080
at the university where we teach
is Clara Schumann taught there

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.870
and Robert taught there and
we walk the same walls --

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:29.550
the same halls and you see
the doors where they were.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:35.300
So many great names of our
-- of what we are doing.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:40.370
We're right there working as if,
you know, as if they were there,

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:41.670
you know, at the same time.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:42.970
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.270
Library of Congress:
What an inspiration.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:45.570
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston:
Yeah, it's incredible.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:46.870
It's incredible

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.170
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music
Division, Library of Congress:

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:49.470
You really are a
continuity of their lives,

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:50.770
I think, as musicians.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.070
And yet you -- and you
also are doing new music.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.030
I know you work with some
major new music figures

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.500
and do very new compositions,
I think,

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.730
Jorg Widmann we had
here not so long ago

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.260
and other artists
that we admire a lot.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.600
Do you have a new ones coming

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.810
up that new compositions
you are going to premier?

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.630
&gt;&gt; Gregor Sigl: Yes, we have.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:13.560
We're doing a project

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:19.000
in the Beethoven year
coming up in 2020.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.640
We asked three composers
that are very close

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.630
to us to write something.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:32.570
And we wanted to avoid doing
the cycle while 25 other --

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:37.500
25,000 other quartets do that.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:42.350
So we do play Beethoven
and we asked Jorg Widmann,

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.500
and Peteris Vasks,
a Latvian composer

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.210
and Lera Auerbach
to write for us.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:53.330
And that will be three programs
that we do in our cycles.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:57.900
And but we also do -- actually,
I don't know if I'm allowed

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:02.140
to say, but I am going to say
it anyway the American premiere

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:07.910
of the Auerbach piece will
be at Carnegie in 2020.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:10.550
I'm not sure if it is the
premier or the American premier.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.510
I am not really sure.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.860
But that's something coming up.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.160
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music
Division, Library of Congress:

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.170
Those are three great
composers that you've chosen.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:21.210
I would look to maybe I'll
try to remember this and come

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:25.840
up to do this -- to hear them.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.330
Let's see.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.570
So back to the, sort of,
the more mundane things.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:35.160
I'm just curious about
how you chose to stand

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.190
and only Eckart be seated.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.920
You know, how -- I can see
that this is very freeing.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.310
When did you start doing this?

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.650
&gt;&gt; Eckart Runge: We started
doing this about 10 years ago.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:50.200
And initially it
was a medical issue

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.100
because with there
were back problems

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.580
of our former first violinist.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:23:00.390
And playing the violin is a
very unnatural thing anyway.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.830
But sitting and playing the
violin, is basically suicide

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.590
on the long-term side,
you know, for your body

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:11.580
because you never know where
to put the bow and, you know.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:17.940
So first of all, it was a
first aid measure that we took

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.300
to be able to play concerts.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.380
But then it felt good somehow.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.260
It fell free and
it felt natural.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.130
And two violinist
and the viola player

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.870
at the time wanted
to stick to it.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:38.260
So it has the great advantage
that you can first of all --

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.290
except for the natural
posture --

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.280
it has the advantage that
you can project much more

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.580
in bigger halls.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:44.880
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music
Division, Library of Congress:

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.630
Oh, that is interesting.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.270
&gt;&gt; Eckart Runge: We play
in small halls but also

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:53.920
in bigger halls and I think the
string quartets, as you pointed

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.540
out the other day, were
not made for big halls.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.550
They were made for
small living rooms.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:02.970
And there it feels
natural to sit

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.340
down because it's
small and intimate.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.010
But if you want to put
this music into a big hall,

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.120
it feels more natural
to stand up.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.180
And, of course, there is some
disadvantages also which need

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.780
to be considered that a
certain intimacy also which is

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:23.120
in quartet music doesn't get
lost by the gesture of standing

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:27.240
up like a soloist and
projecting and presenting.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.890
You know, and the freedom

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.870
to move also needs more
control than sitting down.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.690
Because sitting down, you
cannot move so much, right.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.510
So there are all these
issues that we had

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.500
to work a little bit on.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.810
But I think in the end,
it gives a bigger pallet

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:48.460
and so it became also
part of our group somehow.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:55.260
And we carry around a little
podium which I sit on so

00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:00.960
that the playing level of
sitting down altogether is sort

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.870
of simulated by the
elevated height.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:09.700
So we kind of have our heads
and or instruments on one layer

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.670
like it is the case
when we all sit down.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.000
So we got used to it
and we kind of enjoy it.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.300
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.600
Library of Congress:
That's interesting.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.040
I don't think I have ever
seen a quartet of your type,

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.460
not a Baroque quartet, you know,

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.250
not a period group play all
standing up except for once.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.060
I think it does make a
wonderful sound actually.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.360
I was just noticing when I
was hearing your rehearsal.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.940
It is a very different
sound for me.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.950
And I want to talk with you to
get your perspective on some

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:43.890
of the pieces on the
program in just a moment.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.610
And I also wanted to ask you

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.460
about your life outside
the quartet.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:53.570
So I know that you have
this duo with the pianist

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.210
that you have worked with
for a long time for example.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:01.320
And I know that three of
you also have children too.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.110
So that's a huge responsibility.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:06.410
I know [inaudible].

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.160
So how do you -- how do you --

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.100
what do you do just
for pure fun?

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:19.000
&gt;&gt; Gregor Sigl: If you have
little kids, that is the answer.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.880
You come home and
they don't care at all

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.730
if you just returned
from Carnegie.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.800
They just -- you are
confronted very basic stuff

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:34.550
and so refreshing and it's just
the very best way to recharge is

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:37.710
to just go home and
be with a kid.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:43.010
It's totally -- it's
the best thing to do.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.310
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston:

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:48.420
I have recently become
really interested in writing

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.070
and I have a blog that I write.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.230
And I just online book club.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:57.530
And so -- and the online
book club is really exciting.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.790
Eugene Drucker from the Emerson
Quartet is my first guest

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.400
and he speaking about his book.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.970
And I don't really know how
to write, but it's really fun.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:10.400
And it has become an
obsession for me and kind

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.700
of a new part of my life.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.000
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music
Division, Library of Congress:

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.770
I have read just a few
of your blog entries

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:16.070
which were very interesting.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.790
And I want to go
back and read more.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.730
Are they all on Slipped Disc?

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.420
If you're not familiar
with this website,

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.580
I think you would really
like it: slippedisc.com.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:30.810
It's a long-standing, very
interesting musical site.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.030
Originally I guess
it's Norman Lebrecht --

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:39.240
but anyway, I saw the blog that
you did about the Curtis Sound.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.820
Which interested
me and I wondered

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.960
if you would maybe talk
just a little bit about that

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.830
because having perspective on
this -- what this sound is,

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:48.670
I've never seen it in writing.

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.340
I've never heard
it talked about.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:54.060
But what made me note
this when I saw your blog,

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.780
was we just had the
Dover Quartet here.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.790
And as soon as they began
to play, I said, wow,

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:01.090
they've all been to Curtis.

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:02.450
And I hadn't really
thought about that.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:03.750
There're other people
too as soon

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.140
as you walk in, you hear it.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:09.240
There was a young man a
young bassist Xavier Foley,

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.600
I heard him at the Kennedy
Center two weeks ago and I said,

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.900
oh, he's been to Curtis.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.200
But what is its sound?

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:18.950
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston: Well, I
think it's this extremely --

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:21.280
well, Curtis is a warehouse

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:26.610
of all musical musicians
-- music and musicians.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:30.300
It's kind of like, come here

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.040
and tell us everything you've
learned and all the people

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.710
that you -- and it takes
care of the older musicians

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:42.400
and it brings them in
and it just nurtures them

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.700
and then they nurture --

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.800
of course, they have these
fantastic young students.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.390
So that is one thing.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:49.470
It is just a warehouse
and a museum --

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.830
a living museum of sound.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.250
And the same time, it's so
small, it's only the size

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:56.770
of a single orchestra.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:00.030
So there is only one tuba
opening every four years,

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:03.170
for example.

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:06.190
And the orchestral
training for so many years

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:11.210
with Otto-Werner Mueller,
it was so vigorous and so --

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.640
and some people say
that there was no human

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.510
that had a more depth
of knowledge

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:19.410
of Western classical
music then Mueller.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:27.050
And he just trained us and then,
of course, about 20 percent

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:31.880
of the principal players and all
the top 10 American orchestras

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.800
are Curtis trained so that goes
throughout and the conductors,

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.530
and so it's like this web.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.310
And there is only one way
to play a quarter note.

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:46.330
There isn't -- there's not a
negotiable quarter note length.

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.460
There is one way and if
you are in an orchestra,

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:53.620
that's how it's going to be and
how all the teachers believe.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.040
And then, you know,
perhaps later

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.440
on in your life you might
dabble with the idea

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.480
that there is a different
quarter note possibility.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.900
But, you know, probably not.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.550
So that's why you
hear the Dover Quartet

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:08.380
and I would know exactly how
long their quarter notes are.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.490
And if you sit down with
someone who went to Curtis,

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.650
you are going to know how
long the quarter note is.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:14.950
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: Now see,

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:17.370
that's one of the one things I
didn't quite understand was a

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:18.880
quarter note is what it is.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.690
I mean, how -- do
some people top it off

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:24.230
or they don't give it
its full value or...?

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:26.310
&gt;&gt; Anethea Kreston: That
is a very deep question.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:29.220
&gt;&gt; Gregor Sigl: Well, that
will take a while, yeah.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.520
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.060
That's a really long -- that's
a heavy, heavy question.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.920
But it's -- that's
basically in a nutshell.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.710
But it's such a small
concentrated, like,

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:39.930
bouillon of knowledge.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:43.580
It's -- and it's so
strict and it's so close

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.670
and everyone knows everything.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.730
And there's no way to
-- and it's so true.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:51.550
It's so true, so you
can't disagree with it --

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.850
anyway, if you disagree,
you are out!

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.670
You're out the next day!

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:55.970
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:57.270
Library of Congress:
Oh, my goodness.

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:58.570
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston:
No, I am just joking.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:59.870
But, not really.

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:01.170
A little bit.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:02.470
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: Well,

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:03.770
it's fascinating -- well, you
know, obviously, we could --

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:05.070
it sounds like we
need more time.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:07.420
But maybe we could move
slightly sideways from that

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:12.660
and just say quickly: is there
a German quartet sound anymore?

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.140
Maybe not?

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.440
&gt;&gt; Gregor Sigl: I
don't think so.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.020
No, I don't think so.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:22.380
&gt;&gt; Eckart Runge: I think
quartets changed with time.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.430
And they reflect the
time they lived in.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:32.300
Fifty years ago I think quartets
were very connected to a region

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.290
or a city like, you know,

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:40.680
the Gewandhaus Quartet would
be four people from Leipzig.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.140
They wouldn't accept
anyone who was not Saxonian

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.760
in that quartet, you know.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.060
They still don't.

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:53.830
But then you had, you know,
the original Tokyo Quartet,

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.720
of course, they were
all from Tokyo.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:00.680
And the Alban Berg Quartet, they
were all Viennese or Austrian.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.090
And this changed a lot.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:08.420
So I think -- as the
world gets more globalized

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:13.130
and more speeding up and
everything is more open

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:19.280
and short term somehow,
changes in quartets

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.810
and the international aspect

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:26.570
of quartets has also become more
visible in the quartet world.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:29.930
And I think we are a pretty
good example, for this we --

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.730
now we have three
nationalities in the quartet.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:36.130
And, for example,
the Barchet Quartet

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:40.390
at some point they had four
people from different countries.

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:41.690
And I think that's
-- they still have?

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.890
I know two of them
are Swiss, no?

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:45.870
No, French?

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:51.050
Well anyway, Swiss-French,
it's kind of the same.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:54.770
Anyway, but, yeah, but I
think it reflects our time

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.250
and I don't know if there
is a German quartet sound.

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:00.340
I am sure we don't have it.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.640
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music
Division, Library of Congress:

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.620
That's interesting for me
just because, you know,

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.170
I've had so many years of
listening to great quartets.

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:10.200
It's been a privilege and so
when I first began working here,

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.920
I did encounter German
quartets and French quartets

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:17.060
and even Italian quartets and
there was, in my experience,

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:22.110
a much more perceptible
unified national type of sound.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:24.950
And now this is my perception
now: it's not so much.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:28.450
As you say, people have
grown into new worlds.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:29.750
&gt;&gt; Eckart Runge:
We are from Berlin.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.120
And I think also this
is an important parts

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.380
of the city's atmosphere
and feel

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:44.650
and vision and image of today.

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:45.950
It's very international.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:47.250
It's very open.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:50.990
It has changed a lot
in the last 28 years.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:55.390
And I think that's why we also
enjoy being there and identify

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:56.690
with where we come from.

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:59.690
I remember then when we were
studying, we went to Vienna

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.050
to study with Alban
Berg Quartet.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:06.280
And as every quartet needs to
take a decision at some point:

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.550
where are we going to live?

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:10.830
Basically, you could
live anywhere

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:18.760
because you earn your money
not where you live basically.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:24.010
And so you can choose a place
from where you start your tours.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:29.110
And it does make sense to choose
a place which you identify with.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.390
And we went to Vienna,
it was so clear

00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:33.090
that we were not a
Viennese quartet,

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:36.390
that Vienna would be
an intermediate time

00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:37.690
and we loved it.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:38.990
It was great.

00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:40.580
And it was a fantastic
inspiration, a very important

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.760
for us -- also the
strong connection

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:46.560
to the Alban Berg Quartet and
the whole tradition of them.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.120
But it was totally clear
that we would not stay there

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.420
because we are not
a Viennese quartet.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.700
I think you are sort of an
ambassador of the city you come

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:59.030
from more than the
country you come from.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.320
&gt;&gt; Gregor Sigl: And just
to add to this question

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:06.640
of German quartet sound,
I think the only thing

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:11.450
that I can feel strongly
is I think it is --

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:13.290
you can hear if a person --

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:18.770
a person's mother language
is connected to music.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:23.530
I feel that especially in Brahms
and Shuman also in Schumann also

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.660
in Shubert those composers
that draw out a lot of lead

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:30.270
and work very intimately
with text

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:32.160
and with the German language.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:38.070
And so that feels -- for me
that feels so much at home.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.960
I feel such a strong
relation maybe

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.550
because my mother sang a Brahms
song for me when I was little,

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:48.470
or I grew up with
the folk music there.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:50.810
And I can feel, for example,
with Viennese musicians,

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:55.620
I can feel that maybe perhaps
they have this Viennese charm

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.930
just a touch more than others.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.680
Yeah, you can feel that.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.300
But, of course, nowadays,
people learn from each other

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:08.320
because you travel so quickly
and you study wherever you like.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.890
Perhaps the most extreme

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.930
for me is the Hungarian
language because, of course,

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:17.570
Bartok is such an important part

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:19.360
of the string quartet
literature.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:24.260
And for me it's his music
is like a foreign language.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:29.420
I can realize how great it
is and I love to work on it,

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.860
but it always remains a
very foreign language.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.820
And I can hear when --

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:40.020
when I hear native Hungarian
people play their music,

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:45.070
and I hear the very strong
connection to the internation

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:48.670
and to the rhythm and the
phrasing of that language.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:51.170
And it will always
remain foreign.

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:55.130
Maybe I can do that well,
but I cannot feel it

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.010
like a mother language.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:58.310
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: Yeah.

00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:59.610
I know what you mean.

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:01.140
I have in my mind's ear
the Bartok Quartet playing

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.280
who studied with Bartok and the
Yvonne Fisher [assumed spelling]

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.870
brought members of the
Budapest Festival Orchestra here

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:11.550
to play a chamber evening
with a variety of music,

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:14.670
some piano solo, some
-- the contrast for,

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:15.970
you know, with the clarinet.

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:17.480
And it was so different.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.270
Their interpretations
were so different

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:20.890
than any I had ever heard.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:24.640
But this is a good movement,
quickly, into asking you

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:29.130
about the Schumann Quartet
because it has those elements

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.770
of the Hungarian style
Steal Anqua [phonetic].

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:34.960
And can you may maybe tell
a little to the audience

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.610
about what they'll
hear in this piece --

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:40.900
the Hungarian style elements.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:47.770
&gt;&gt; Gregor Sigl: But you can hear
that a German guy tried to --

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:50.140
it was some kind
of very fashionable

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:53.260
and very interesting
at that time.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:58.700
But for me -- I know, I think
I know what you pointing at.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:04.470
I could still hear the -- I can
still hear that he was German.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:05.770
I think.

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:07.070
&gt;&gt; Eckart Runge: Saxonian.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:08.370
&gt;&gt; Gregor Sigl: Saxonian.

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:09.670
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: So, yeah.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.230
You'll hear these
various elements

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:15.120
like a little drone elements
and certain rhythmic patterns

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.800
and pizzicato, so
forth and so on.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.740
Well, maybe one more
question for you

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.560
and then other people may have a
couple questions before you go.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.460
In the Shostakovich
Quartet there is --

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:29.640
the three movements are
played attacca right there --

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.710
right together then you
can even hear this work

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.990
as almost one movement
if you think like that.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:37.300
But I wanted to ask you to come

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:41.230
in on the dramatic
bar of silence.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:45.040
That is, before the third
movement and how that --

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.200
how you feel about that.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.500
What does it say to you?

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:53.960
It is a notated bar, right or...

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:57.870
&gt;&gt; Gregor Sigl: It is -- I
don't think he was aiming

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:01.230
for cutting it apart.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:05.250
I think it is -- I mean
often the most tension is

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:07.120
during breaks.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.970
So I think the important
thing for us --

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:12.760
what we are trying
to do is also to --

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:17.240
the unknown factor and the
question what's coming,

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.500
that's the strong thing and
it should not at all stop.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.270
A break is not necessarily
a stop.

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:25.570
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston:
What happens right

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.920
after it, is total crazy chaos.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:34.400
I mean, I need that bar to just
realize what is about to happen.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.450
&gt;&gt; Vineta Sareika: It
is a shock every time.

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:37.750
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston: Yeah.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:39.050
&gt;&gt; Vineta Sareika: For all of us

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:40.450
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston: Yeah,
yeah it's like bugh!

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:41.750
[phonetic].

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:43.050
Yeah, you need that.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:44.700
&gt;&gt; Eckart Runge: The bar is
a huge buildup of tension.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.000
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston: Yes, yeah.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.300
&gt;&gt; Eckart Runge:
Like if someone --

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.600
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston: Gathered.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.900
&gt;&gt; Eckart Runge: --
talks in a, let's say,

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:53.440
tense or even threatening way
and becomes softer and softer

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:58.080
and then he stops to talk,
that's the really scary moment.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:02.010
So, and I think this is a little
bit what happens in that music.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:03.750
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music
Division, Library of Congress:

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:07.570
I want to make sure that you had
a chance to hear what they had

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:08.960
to say about that
because it is a kind

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.150
of an important moment there.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:14.150
Well, this -- we hate to stop.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:16.070
I mean, there's so many more
things we could talk about.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:18.300
And you guys are
great in this way.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.820
But does anyone have
a couple of questions

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:25.630
to ask before they have to
go and warm up and so on.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:27.960
Any particular things?

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.740
No. Maybe one.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:42.520
&gt;&gt; Unknown Speaker 1: You have
mentioned the experience working

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.870
with quartets from different
countries with master classes

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:52.520
and the -- it amplifies
your experience

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.410
of the possibilities of quartet.

00:40:55.410 --> 00:41:01.060
I wonder if you listen
to recordings,

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:04.830
and what is your
response to them?

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:08.770
Does that add a dimension that's
important for you to understand

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.430
or is there something
more alienating

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:15.750
that doesn't give you
the same experience?

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.010
&gt;&gt; Vineta Sareika: Well, I think
we are all four very different

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:19.310
with it also.

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:22.820
It's like with reading
and that background thing.

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:27.000
I think for me personally, I, of
course, I listen to recordings

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.680
in the beginning
to know the piece.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.740
So I listen to a couple of them.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.490
Not to influence
myself too much.

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:36.320
So I pick maybe three or
four different versions.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.870
But then during the time when
we build up our own version,

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:41.680
I try not to listen at all.

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.590
I listen to other pieces of
that composer, you know, but --

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:50.200
because I think it's very --
you don't realize the moment

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.070
when you get influenced
by something,

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:57.560
that it's great maybe, a
version that's totally my taste.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.790
But I just want to make
sure that it's our version

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:03.440
and it is not --
that we stay honest

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.510
with what we feel
the composer wanted

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:09.970
and not some other
great artists felt.

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:13.880
So but, of course, it's always
interesting to also listen

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.270
to other people and
to keep surprised

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:21.610
by the other options
that they find.

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:23.050
&gt;&gt; Gregor Sigl: Also listening

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:27.410
to other people's performances
not only inspires you

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:28.720
to do the same.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:33.840
It might also make you think
why I want to do it differently,

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.210
or why is it the version
sounds so differently?

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:41.730
And I think it's important
to listen a lot and to go

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:48.330
to concerts a lot because,
yeah, or even negative things,

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:51.090
something you don't like
can influence you a lot

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:52.610
and make you learn.

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:56.520
And also, I don't think
there is a danger that --

00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:00.480
in our case, I think
I can say --

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.910
the danger of copying
something is not there

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:09.920
because no matter how much you
listen or how much you learn

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.580
from someone, you always have
your own voice and as soon

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:18.050
as you play it and perform it,
it will sound different anyway.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:21.490
And it's the same like with
the greatness of that music,

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:25.310
what I said about
Beethoven, that it's so pure.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:29.270
And it's the same when you are
an honest musician that tries

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:34.260
to make honest music and just
project your own emotions,

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.560
it will sound like you.

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.700
It will not sound
like someone else.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.370
So I think -- I don't
think there's a danger

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:43.110
and I think it's very healthy

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:45.800
and very inspiring
to listen a lot.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.500
And, of course, you know for
us as string quartet players,

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:53.150
it's so -- I think I can speak
for all of us, when you listen

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:57.830
to a different quartet, a
good quartet, it's so much joy

00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:02.210
because we -- I can't
listen to my own recordings.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.240
It's -- I only hear mistakes

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.980
that I remember the moment
we did it and why we did it

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.540
and when we rehearsed and
when we had a fight about it.

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.840
It's very hard.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.380
And when you listen to another
good group, you can let go

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.880
and you can see that music
in a different light.

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.060
And it's very -- it's so great.

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:21.360
I love it.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.370
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: Any other?

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:25.050
Did you have a question?

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:27.350
Yeah.

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:31.470
&gt;&gt; Unknown Speaker 2: Thank you.

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:34.230
[inaudible] and musicians but
Ms. Kreston, you mentioned

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.530
about your activities.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:39.400
You have a full engaged and
demanding global tour schedule,

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.940
but you also teach
in University.

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.480
But you mentioned
briefly about [inaudible]

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.240
in Waterloo, in Brussels.

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:49.520
So do you mentor
young musicians?

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.040
&gt;&gt; Anthea Kreston:
Yes, absolutely.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:54.700
So the question is: do we
mentor young musicians?

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.170
And a little bit about that.

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:57.470
Is that correct?

00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:04.340
So, of course, being a classical
musician you are kind of always

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:07.110
at a different layer
of the tiramisu.

00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:09.850
So sometimes you're at the
bottom, sometimes you're

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:12.410
in the middle, sometimes
you're in the top; but is all,

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:15.720
you know, that rum or whatever
is on the bottom is so good,

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.760
it's going to work its way up.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:23.000
And so, not only do
we learn by teaching,

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
but I'm in so inspired
by those students.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.270
And then when I get
that score --

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:29.880
Oh, they're going to be
working on this piece.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.180
And then I dig out my old
score and I see my old --

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.520
And then I scan it and I send
it to them and I'm like, Oh,

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.640
these are Isaac Stern's
fingerings.

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.530
You're going to love these.

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:42.190
And I send them early.

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:44.660
And so I really learn
and I reconnect with,

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.110
how long is a quarter note?

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:47.410
No, I am joking.

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:52.410
But it reteaches us and it
re-invigorates our own passion

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:55.770
and then also not only
that, we are so lucky.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:59.130
You should hear these
students we get to teach.

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:02.330
They are unbelievable!

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:05.970
They are so, I'm like, I
want to be in that quartet.

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:08.000
You know, they are
just so fantastic.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.340
Like recent -- people
who have graduated

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.200
from our class Arod
string quartet --

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.640
I don't know if you've
had them yet.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.940
Unbelievable!

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.600
These guys are crazy.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:20.280
All of these groups that
we play with, they are --

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:25.940
they feed our passion
and their desire

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.770
for knowledge is insatiable.

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:34.730
And so all that -- you realize
what's wrong with yourself

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:38.410
and what you -- you realize
again what you do know.

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:40.910
And then they ask --
they are very aggressive.

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:43.440
They ask questions and
you have to answer.

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:46.430
You know, you can't just be
like, well, I just think this.

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:48.390
I mean, they'll reall...

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:49.850
&gt;&gt; Eckart Runge: May I
add something to this?

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:51.510
I think that, sorry --

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:54.410
&gt;&gt; Vineta Sareika: I think
what is interesting also

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:57.630
that those groups already
have such a high level

00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:59.250
that it is not only about music.

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:04.150
We speak about music a lot,
but it's also about how to deal

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:08.210
with the musician's life and
with concert life, with stress,

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:12.310
with touring, with
being in harmony

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:14.330
with the other members
of their groups.

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:16.870
If they have some
communication problems,

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:20.140
we try to solve them together
and it's really interesting

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.720
on the human level as well.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:25.960
&gt;&gt; Eckart Runge: I remember from
myself being a young musician,

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:29.680
I was so fortunate
to have teachers

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.390
that were the right people

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:34.900
in the right moment
not only teaching me

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.870
about quarter note lengths.

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:45.140
Also about aspects about, you
know, that develop personality.

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.580
Because I think that's
the most hard thing

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:52.910
about an artistic studies is
that you cannot read a book,

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:58.240
learn it, know it, go to
the exam, get a great grade,

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.960
go out of school,
get a great job.

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.260
That doesn't work.

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:05.370
There are so many other
aspects of the building

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:10.750
of a personality, of
character, of self-confidence,

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:12.760
of sensitivity; of
course, they all have

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.410
to already somehow
be there in a talent.

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:19.060
And also the passion, the
drive, and the energy to work

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:24.600
and the discipline, there is
so many ingredients especially

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.590
in a group you have it times
four, right, or times three

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:29.820
in a trio, I mean, yeah.

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:34.920
That all this fits together
is way beyond only teaching

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.360
and interpretation of a piece.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:41.650
And so I, again, say clearly,
yes, to your question.

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:45.040
I think it is very, very
important to mentor groups,

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:51.490
young groups, the way we
were lucky to have enjoyed

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:54.770
that by wonderful teachers.

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:57.640
And now, we are trying to
pass on a little bit of this

00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:58.940
from our own experience.

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:03.490
We know how hard and
stony this road can be.

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:04.920
And one of the biggest dangers,

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.710
especially of very
successful young groups,

00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:13.450
are that they get
destroyed by their success.

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:17.020
And it's so tempting to
accept all these offers

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.490
and play all these concerts.

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:22.910
And it's so hard for a young
group to turn down offers

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:26.410
and say, no, we need
the time to develop.

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:30.970
And this is, for me personally,
always a great challenge

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:33.310
to consider with these groups,

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:37.960
to maintain the sustainability
of a group.

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:42.360
Because young people tend to
lose that out of their sight

00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:48.630
and we were lucky enough to
kind of survive until today.

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:52.450
But it was also, we had our
really hard moments, you know.

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:58.010
And I know that this life looks
always so shiny when you walk

00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:59.420
on stage and you perform

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:02.700
and everyone thinks,
they just do it.

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.000
It's very easy.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.300
But it's not.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:06.810
And it takes years and
years and a lot of aspects

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:10.010
around music to make that work.

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:11.310
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music
Division, Library of Congress:

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:14.400
It's inspirational to
hear talk about this

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.400
and it reflects in your music.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.560
I know -- yeah, please.

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.830
&gt;&gt; Gregor Sigl: I
just want to add.

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:23.780
It's a very, very
strong responsibility.

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:26.100
And we don't always succeed.

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:29.510
I mean, we had groups or we
have at the moment people

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:33.080
in their early 20s are
having a very serious burn

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:40.410
out because recording company
contract and 100 concerts

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:42.240
and too much repertoire.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.430
And on some levels they
were not ready for it.

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:46.730
Maybe they can do everything.

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:49.790
They can play everything
and they wow the audience.

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:52.730
But something was too much.

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:56.210
And that's something
we try to tell them,

00:50:56.210 --> 00:51:00.640
that music is a lifelong
process anyway.

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:04.880
Take your time with it,
but not everyone listens.

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:09.950
And that's an important thing
to try to slow down a bit.

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:11.250
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean, Music Division,
Library of Congress: Well,

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:13.340
thank you for talking so
candidly and beautifully

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.840
about everything with us.

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:17.420
We really appreciate
this opportunity.

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:19.550
And we need to get
them backs stage.

00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:22.510
So thanks, and...

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:26.420
[ Applause ]

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:30.090
