the Irish contestant Alexander emini is

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920
the Irish contestant Alexander emini is
 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.490
the Irish contestant Alexander emini is
an avid tennis player he has invented a

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500
an avid tennis player he has invented a
 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.650
an avid tennis player he has invented a
software that analyzes tennis tropes and

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660
software that analyzes tennis tropes and
 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.049
software that analyzes tennis tropes and
gives detailed feedback to athletes so

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059
gives detailed feedback to athletes so
 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.200
gives detailed feedback to athletes so
that they can improve their performance

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210
that they can improve their performance
 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.750
that they can improve their performance
right now my my algorithm is monitoring

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
right now my my algorithm is monitoring
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.640
right now my my algorithm is monitoring
the inertial data from the center and

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650
the inertial data from the center and
 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.269
the inertial data from the center and
until I hit a stroke it will once I hit

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279
until I hit a stroke it will once I hit
 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.040
until I hit a stroke it will once I hit
the stroke it will detect the stroke and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050
the stroke it will detect the stroke and
 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.509
the stroke it will detect the stroke and
then try and process each of the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519
then try and process each of the
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.859
then try and process each of the
possible stroke types I could have

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
possible stroke types I could have
 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.050
possible stroke types I could have
possibly been hit once the stroke is a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
possibly been hit once the stroke is a
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.720
possibly been hit once the stroke is a
process is the process by it's provided

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730
process is the process by it's provided
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.830
process is the process by it's provided

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840
back to the athlete by feedback and also
 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.910
back to the athlete by feedback and also
precise and unbiased feedback is

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920
precise and unbiased feedback is
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.220
precise and unbiased feedback is
provided based on small deviations that

provided based on small deviations that

provided based on small deviations that

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600
were performed and that could be used to
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.450
were performed and that could be used to
improve the stroke for the next time

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
improve the stroke for the next time
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.940
