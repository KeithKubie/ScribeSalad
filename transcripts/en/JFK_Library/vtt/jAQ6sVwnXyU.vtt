00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.080
- NASA's job is to do the research.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.330
They are scientists.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.860
They are not a lobbying organization.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.760
They are not advocates.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.260
They do the research, and
they hand it over to us,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.840
the public, and they hand
it to our legislators

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.590
and the policy makers.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.590
And in my opinion, it is
really the policy makers' job

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.020
and the legislators' job to protect us,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.420
to protect humanity.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.420
At a time like this when
they have the science,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.330
they have the information.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.330
And to not do so, shouldn't be tolerated.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.270
And thankfully we have an
election on November sixth

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.270
where we can do the research
of who is addressing this issue

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.040
and elect them into office.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.730
And if people are in
office not doing that work,

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.340
we can fire them.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.910
And that is, in my opinion,
what we should be doing.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.807
I mean we can--
