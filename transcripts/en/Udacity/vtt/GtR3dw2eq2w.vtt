00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.200
Rather than telling you which chart I would choose and why,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.915
since we have the power of a web-based visualization library at our disposal,

00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:11.710
dimple.js, you do not have to take my word for it.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.660
We can experiment with each of the chart types.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.550
A common theme that we will be bring up over and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.330
over again throughout the course is the process of iterating on a visualization.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.270
This is often called prototyping or sketching.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.780
I wanted to show you the process I went through to come to

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.150
my own conclusions about the chart type and

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.490
hopefully make designing visualizations seem much less mysterious.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.280
And since there is never truly a right answer with visualizations,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.740
just like there's no right way to write a book or

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.430
a news article, once empowered with the insights I will now go through,

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.120
you can hopefully extend and adapt my visualization to make it your own.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.380
We will see later in this lesson why some of the design decisions that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.730
the creator of D3 made makes this process of iterating and

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.170
experimenting with visual displays quite seamless.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.190
And sometimes, even if there is a right or best chart to visualize your data,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.250
you often don't know ahead of time how the data will interact with the aesthetic

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.640
of your visualization, including things like layout, color, scales, and

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.860
how will it interact with the web page itself.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.260
We have already seen which aspects of the grammar of graphics the creator of D3

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.540
chose to implement in his design decisions for the library, and how this makes

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.875
the process of iterating and experimenting with visual displays quite seamless.
