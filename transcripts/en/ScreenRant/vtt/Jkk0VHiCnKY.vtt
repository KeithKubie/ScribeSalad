00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.299
Most of the time, animated films are synonymous
with family entertainment, forced to defy

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.110
expectations of being “just for kids.”
But animated movies have proven to be every

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.500
bit as powerful as their live-action siblings,
with filmmakers using the platform to tell

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.210
compelling and heartfelt stories that speak
to entire generations. Here are Screen Rant’s

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.790
10 best animated films ever made.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.099
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.550
The first animated production by Walt Disney
Studios, Snow White had an impact on the industry

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.900
that few will ever rival. Combining vibrant
art with some standout musical selections,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.160
the film showed audiences that a brand new
medium was on its way to theatres. But it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.250
would have been all for nothing if not for
the memorable story. Viewers responded most

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.309
to the great collection of characters, which
are still heavily marketed nearly 80 years

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.970
after its release. Couple that with a narrative
that spoke to both young and old, and you’ve

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.280
got one of the most revolutionary movies ever
put to film.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.089
The Lion King

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.149
Launching a new era for Disney Animation,&nbsp;The&nbsp;Lion&nbsp;King&nbsp;was
the comeback project the studio needed to

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:18.380
regain top form. Fuelled by an emotionally-driven
story on par with a Greek tragedy, it found

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.190
the right balance between high drama and comedic
hijinks. As one would expect, the animation

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.760
was beautifully realized, making the film
a technical achievement as well. Between the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.270
great characters, memorable songs, and relatable
themes, it was an instant classic as soon

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.270
as it hit theatres.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.270
The Nightmare Before Christmas

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.970
One of the more inventive movies that ever
graced the animated genre, this Tim Burton

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.260
production captured the imagination of viewers
of all ages. Blending music, comedy, and romance

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.490
against the holidays of both Christmas and
Halloween, this Nightmare shows a style and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:52.580
ambition that few have ever tried to copy.
The movie’s characters are grotesque or

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.580
endearing enough to win over children, but
their personalities and deception can only

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.330
be grasped by their parents. The stop-motion
techniques on display were also considered

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.580
revolutionary, making the film a technical
spectacle as well as an emotional one.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.940
Toy Story

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.030
Pixar is the premiere animation studio in
the world today, and their first film’s

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.310
success is a main reason why. Toy Story set
the template many of their future projects

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.000
would follow, as they crafted a thrilling
adventure that both kids and adults could

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.130
relate to. Youngsters appreciated the colourful
collection of toys, while their parents were

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.540
able to pick up on the themes of growing older
and being replaced by something new. Combining

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.281
heart, humour, and emotion, the movie’s
screenplay was even nominated for an Oscar

00:02:30.281 --> 00:02:34.920
– showing Pixar had what it took to be a
major force in the industry.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.310
The Iron Giant

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.070
Brad Bird has made the leap to live-action
blockbusters, but he got his start with this

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.200
WB animated feature. A variation of the “boy
and his dog” trope, The Iron Giant is a

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.630
story that a viewer of any age can enjoy.
Fuelled by an allegorical tale about politics

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.810
and military power, the film was much more
complex and well-performed than a children’s

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.070
movie ever needs to be. Wearing its heart
and affection on its sleeve, and dealing with

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.600
serious problems head on, it found a way to
balance the awe-inspiring magic of movies

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.430
with a story about the fear of the unknown.
The film’s star Hogarth may resemble the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.600
children who loved it, but to us, The Iron
Giant was the first time that the rough, tough

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.590
Vin Diesel worked his way into our hearts
– using his voice alone.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.430
Spirited Away

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.500
Studio Ghibli is one of the industry’s top
animation studios, and this Oscar-winning

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.670
feature shows nearly every reason why, from
art style to its overall message. Everything

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.310
from the film’s voice acting to its direction
were immediately praised by critics, who universally

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.560
demanded that Spirited Away was the kind of
whimsical fantasy that deserved to be seen

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.920
by all children. Walking the line between
eerie, terrifying, and downright fantastic,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:48.730
the movie is one of the few that can be equally
enjoyed by all ages, and across every culture.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.410
Not every animated film dares to dive into
deep social commentary to provide strong substance,

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.500
but we’re appreciative this one did.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.500
Finding Nemo

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.360
Pixar had reached the top of their game in
the 2000s, and this tale of a fish in search

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.790
of his son is one of their landmark achievements.
The film possessed the kind of universal messages

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.180
that audiences have come to expect from the
studio, in this case focusing on parent-child

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.610
bonds, and how and when children must seek
out their own independence. The love between

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.690
Nemo and Marlin is one for the ages, and the
two only realizing it once they had been separated

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.520
by a vast ocean was the driving force of the
narrative. Like so many other Pixar films,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.470
the supporting characters were top notch as
well, with the tank gang – and especially

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.650
Dory – finding a permanent place in our
hearts.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.650
How to Train Your Dragon

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.310
DreamWorks may often be seen as standing in
the shadow of Pixar, but every so often, they

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.810
break through with a winner of their own.
With a beautiful visual style and a rich and

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.840
witty screenplay, How to Train Your Dragon
is a perfect example of a family film done

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.900
with heart and intelligence. The movie’s
aerial sequences and heartwarming teamwork

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.280
between the young Hiccup and the dragon Toothless
lent weight to the standard third-act battles,

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.820
and delivered a happy ending despite all involved
being scarred in the process. A touching tale

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.820
of friendship with sufficient dramatic heft
and insight to please everyone in attendance,

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.970
it’s easy to see why this became on of the
studio’s flagship franchises. Who wouldn’t

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.470
want their own pet dragon?

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.470
Despicable Me

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.470
The Minions stole the spotlight, but the loveable
yellow creatures are hardly the only things

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.560
that made Despicable Me a modern animated
classic. At the film’s core is an unlikely

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.380
protagonist in Gru, a super-villain obsessed
with ruling the world - until he comes across

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.561
three adorable little girls who become much,
much more than pawns in his evil game. Over

00:05:24.561 --> 00:05:28.880
the course of the film, Gru and his surrogate
daughters become a caring family, raising

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.930
serious questions about the ways in which
every parent organizes their priorities. Thoughtful,

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.010
humorous, and enough emotion to sell viewers,
Despicable Me is a heroic accomplishment that

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:45.880
shows there’s good in all of us.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.880
The LEGO Movie

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.680
Ridiculed upon its announcement, audiences
everywhere were eating plenty of crow when

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.660
the film released. Wildly imaginative and
extremely creative, LEGO was able to crack

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.949
the Pixar formula of having something for
everyone, with sharp humour and well-timed

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:05.020
pop culture references that gave it a cross-generational
appeal. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.490
were in top form, using the film to offer
biting social commentary and powerful statements

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.280
on relationships, childhood, consumerism,
and pack mentality. Full of exciting action,

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.200
crazy characters, celebrity cameos, well-hidden
jokes and plenty of laughs, LEGO showed that

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.199
a toy movie could be done right. In the end,
Everything really was awesome.

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:32.139

films ever made. Are there any we missed?
