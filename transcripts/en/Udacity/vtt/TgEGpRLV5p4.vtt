00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is not necessarily.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We can't guarantee that m and n are relatively prime.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What we know is that n is pq, which are prime, and we know that m is less than n.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But it's possible that m is some multiple of p or some multiple of q.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Those could still be less than n if c1 is less than q or c2 is less than p,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but that would mean that m and n are not relatively prime.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That means that we can't use Euler's theorem directly.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We'd have to deal with these special cases.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That's a little kink in our correctness proof. I'm not going to go through those details.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
They're not too interesting, but we're real close, and we're going to assume

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that we can deal with this detail, and now we have the invertibility property

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that we need for RSA to be correct.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
One useful thing to notice here is that this works in both directions.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What we wanted for signatures was invertibility

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
where we do decryption first and then encryption..

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
That's equal to c^de mod n, which is also congruent to c mod n.

00:01:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We'll have correctness in both directions.
