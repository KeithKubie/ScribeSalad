00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
The question I would now like you to think about for a moment and this is going to be

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.690
our next quiz is if you have a computer problem and you want to know if this problem

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:19.190
is tractable or intractable, then I would like you to think about which one is actually harder to show

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.330
or if it's both equally hard to show.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.120
If you think that showing the problem to be tractable is easier than showing it to be intractable,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.610
then I want you to check this circle here.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.770
If you think that showing intractability, so showing that a problem belongs here is easier

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.390
than showing that it belongs here, and I want you to check this circle here.

00:00:44.390 --> 99:59:59.000
And finally, if you think it hardly makes any difference, then I want you to check this circle here.
