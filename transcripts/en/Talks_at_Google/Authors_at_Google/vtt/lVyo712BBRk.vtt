KAREN MAY: I'm Karen May.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.280
I lead people development
here at Google,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.826
and have the honor today,
as you enjoy delicious food,

00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:17.770
of introducing Michael
Pollan to all of you.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.080
Michael-- he doesn't
know this yet,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.620
but his work has
changed my household.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.520
Because we say to
each other, "Eat food.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.960
Not too much.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.880
Mostly grains.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.049
Mostly plants."

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:37.200
So we use our food
rules quite regularly.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.290
And I think, for many
of us, Michael's work

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.990
directly and indirectly
has changed our households

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.770
for the better.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.140
One of Michael's
rules that many of you

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.370
know-- since you're here,
I'll assume you know--

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.130
is to not eat food that your
grandmother wouldn't recognize

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.190
as food.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.420
And I understand
that's been revised

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.550
to great- great- grandmother,
depending on how old you are.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.489
You have to continue to revise
that every 20 years or so.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.240
And based on when refined
sugar was introduced.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.040
But we do, also in my
household, tease each other--

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.030
would your grandmother
recognize that?

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.350
Put that down!

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.940
Grandma wouldn't recognize that.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.220
So I think you've made--
you've raised consciousness

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.800
around the world, in a way
that I don't know if you know

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.810
the full extent of
the personal impact.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.257
But it's quite lovely.

00:01:28.257 --> 00:01:30.590
And I'm pleased-- this is not
Michael's first time here,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.040
but pleased to welcome
him back to our talks

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.310
at Google series, multi-year
series, and to have you here.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.630
Michael's work, as
many of you know well,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.540
the body of work preceding
the current book, "Cooked,"

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.240
really takes us through kind of
a look at industrialized food,

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.860
if you will.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.850
And Michael tackles
agribusiness, and throws

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.240
devastating criticism
at processed food.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.040
And I sort of see you, as
I experience your work,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.530
as one part writer, one
part historian, and one part

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.070
social activist.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.480
There's probably another
part, nutritionist, and then

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.130
another part, sort of
curious learner in there

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.960
as well, if I put my
development hat on.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.960
But all of that comes
together to create

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.730
a very accessible
body of work that's

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.410
both thought-provoking
and behavior-changing.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.960
So, in this current book,
"Cooked," Michael sort

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.050
of tackles, literally, the
art of cooking and helps us

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.610
see cooking not
only as from kind

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.230
of a social-historical
perspective,

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.880
but also about what happens as
you bring ingredients together,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.720
and the impact on
society, on environment,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.820
on families, as
well as the impact

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.800
on general kind of
social connectivity.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.190
So I think we take
something as potentially

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.990
simple and unidimensional
as heating food in fire,

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.850
and turning it
into something that

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.580
infuses the social
fabric in which we live.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.620
So it's very exciting.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.050
I am very fortunate to be loved
by two great cooks, my mother

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.300
and my husband.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.720
I am very fortunate.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.080
And in reading
"Cooked," I developed

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.910
a deeper understanding
of some of their passion,

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.660
and where that might
come from, as well as

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.480
appreciation for the gift
that they give to me.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.710
So, on behalf of the Googlers
here and watching us virtually,

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.420
welcome to Google and thank you.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.050
MICHAEL POLLAN:
Thank you, Karen.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.883
Thank you very much.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.110
Thank you.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.210
I think this is my fourth visit.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.500
And the last time
I was here it was

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.530
because there had been
a program to give out

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.006
copies of "Food Rules."

00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:45.380
I don't know if
any of you were--

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.920
there's a lucky recipient.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.210
And I see it's had an impact.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.060
You all look very
svelte and healthy.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.560
So it works.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.570
Very glad to see that.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.830
And I'm also glad to see people
eating at an event about food,

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.870
despite the sign as
we entered that said,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.280
No Eating In This Room.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.130
But, honored in the breach.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.051
What I'd like to do is
first try to tell you

00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:10.550
a little bit about
this project I've

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.650
been on for the last couple
years, which was mastering--

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.400
that's a strong word--
the art of cooking,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.300
and the transformations
that we call cooking.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.980
But first I want to
start by putting it

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.260
in the context of
other books of mine,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.880
and of the journey
that I've been

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.100
on since I started
coming here, really.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.030
And that is, following
the food chain.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.170
I mean, that's the story of my
work over the last dozen or so

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.030
years, has been trying to figure
out where our food comes from

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.000
and where it goes.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.970
And I started this
journey, really,

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.070
with "Omnivore's Dilemma."

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.630
And that was an attempt to trace
four different kinds of meals

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.800
back to their
source on the farm.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.070
And what we eat
connects us to the land.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.460
It's our most profound
connection to nature,

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.786
is our eating.

00:04:59.786 --> 00:05:01.410
Although most of us
are not aware of it

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.474
as such because we're
now so disconnected

00:05:04.474 --> 00:05:05.640
from the source of our food.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.040
And we live at the end of a
very long and intricate food

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.190
chain that's largely opaque.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.080
And so in that book, I tried
to follow the food back

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.780
to the land, and see
how it was created out

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.420
of soil and chemicals and
fossil fuel and sunlight,

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.910
depending on what
kind of food it was.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.430
And then after I did that book,
people just were asking me,

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.484
you talked about every
dimension of food except health.

00:05:34.484 --> 00:05:35.900
And what I really
want to know is,

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.880
what are the links
between diet and health.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.590
What I eat and
what happens to me.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:47.830
And so I plunged into another
project, equally exotic to me.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.540
And I should tell you,
whatever expertise I have,

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.500
I've acquired as a journalist.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.620
Not with any-- I have no
academic training in food

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.240
studies or nutrition or
biochemistry or all the things

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.070
I should have taken in college.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.420
I was an English major.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.320
And so I delved into nutrition,
and looked at, what do we know,

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.950
and more importantly,
what don't we

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.305
know about the links
between what we eat

00:06:13.305 --> 00:06:16.070
and our odds of chronic disease,
our likelihood of getting

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.790
obese, all these kind of things.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.390
It's remarkable how much we
don't know about nutrition.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.560
And so I was looking at these
two ends of the food chain, one

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.410
after the other.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.330
The earth end, and the body end.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.540
And I hadn't really
paid much attention

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.950
to the middle of the food chain.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.380
Which is to say, the area
where the stuff coming off

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.720
of the farms gets transformed
into the meals we eat,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.600
and how it gets transformed,
and who does the transformation.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.360
And I was picking up
clues along the way,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.800
though, looking at
the earth and looking

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.350
at the body, that those
transformations were actually

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.300
really important, and that
they were driving changes

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.230
going on at both ends
of the food chain.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.570
So let me explain.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.310
So the industrialization
of our agriculture,

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.210
the rise of these
giant monocultures

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.360
of corn and soybeans
all over the Midwest,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.170
the rise of animal factories,
where we put tens of thousands

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.010
of the same species in
tightly controlled situations

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.260
and feed them these diets
that maximize their growth,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.380
and these pharmaceuticals
that also maximize

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.380
their growth, that
was very much driven

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.660
or underwritten by the fact
that we were no longer cooking.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.510
And that we were outsourcing our
cooking to large corporations.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.400
And when you let McDonald's and
Burger King and Olive Garden

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.350
and all the companies
making the processed

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.970
food in the supermarket
do your cooking,

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.880
they shop in a very
particular way.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.260
They want to buy from the
biggest possible suppliers

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.920
of the most consistent,
cheapest food.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.650
And so that the
monocultures of corn and soy

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.220
are very much driven
by fast food diets.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.120
That's what corn
and soy is-- it's

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.420
the building blocks
of the fast food diet.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.010
The corn becomes the
high fructose corn syrup,

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.900
and the soy becomes the oil in
which the fast food is fried.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.500
And I realized this
when I was studying,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.460
I was looking at
potatoes, of all things,

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.790
and I went to a
potato farm, which

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.970
was this amazing
landscape in Idaho.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.790
It was 50,000 acres divided
into these vast crop circles,

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:28.810
each one 156 acres with a sweep
second hand irrigation pivot

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.590
that was putting out the
water or the fertilizer

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.419
or the chemicals.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:35.990
And they were using one chemical
in particular-- it really

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.679
stuck with me-- called Monitor,
that was such a toxic pesticide

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:44.889
that the farmers wouldn't go out
into their fields for like five

00:08:44.889 --> 00:08:46.430
days after they
spread it, because it

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.050
was such a neurotoxin.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.910
And they explained--
I said, why do you

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.010
have to use this chemical?

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.950
And they said,
well, because we're

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.367
growing Russet Burbanks, which
is the only kind McDonald's

00:08:56.367 --> 00:08:58.199
will buy, and all the
other-- and Frito-Lay,

00:08:58.199 --> 00:08:59.430
and all the other companies.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.477
And it's a hard potato to grow.

00:09:01.477 --> 00:09:03.060
And I said, why do
they like that one?

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.851
And they said, oh, it's
the longest potato.

00:09:04.851 --> 00:09:07.920
So when we get our
McDonald's french fries,

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.720
we love that red
envelope with the bouquet

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.620
of long French fries
coming out of it.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.500
And the only way
you can get that

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.686
is with the Russet Burbank.

00:09:15.686 --> 00:09:18.310
Problem is, Russet Burbanks are
susceptible to something called

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.350
net necrosis, those little brown
lines you very occasionally

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.570
will see in a potato,
or brown dots.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.230
Totally cosmetic defect.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.810
No problem eating that at all.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.900
But McDonald's will
not tolerate it.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.570
So the way you deal
with net necrosis

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.130
is Monitor, which is
this horrible toxin.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.690
And I was thinking,
God, so we're

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:41.320
kind of complicit in this
landscape I'm looking at.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.240
And indeed it is
driven by the fact

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.260
that we are letting
McDonald's cook

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.890
our French fries
in a certain way.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.790
So that's one side, and
that's one example of how

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.450
the collapse of
cooking in America

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.560
is driving the industrialization
of our agriculture.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.500
And Eric Schlosser
told the story really

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.890
well in "Fast Food Nation,"
the links between the fast food

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.180
industry and the
new ways of raising

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.890
chickens and hogs
and corn and soy.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:13.050
On the other end, though, when
I was looking at the body,

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.670
this was even more curious.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.320
I realized that the
collapse of cooking

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.950
there was taking a huge
toll on our health.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.760
And although we
couldn't tell ourselves

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.785
with real certainty
that saturated

00:10:25.785 --> 00:10:28.160
fat is the evil nutrient we
should avoid if we don't want

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.530
to get fatter,
get heart disease.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.890
Or sugar is the really bad
nutrient we should avoid.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.360
And we're totally
still pretty confused

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.610
about nutrients, good and bad.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:44.110
What we did know was that
home-cooked food is--

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.460
people who eat a home-cooked
diet are much healthier than

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.710
people who don't.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.930
And that the best predictor
of a healthy diet, regardless

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.897
of your income, was whether
it was cooked at home.

00:10:56.897 --> 00:10:59.480
And there's a very interesting
study I came across that showed

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.080
that poor women who cook have
healthier diets than rich women

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.010
who don't.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.870
So it even undoes
the usual class bias

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.490
toward the poorer you are,
the worse your diet is.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.760
If you're cooking,
you can undo that.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.940
So both of these
clues were telling me,

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.270
I really had to deal with this
middle link of the food chain.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.330
Why aren't we cooking?

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.790
What is cooking?

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.290
And why were we
willing to let it go

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.830
from so many of our lives?

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.780
So that's what kind
of got me started.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.180
There was also, though,
a paradox I was noticing.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.154
And I started out by
looking at this, well

00:11:34.154 --> 00:11:35.820
whatever happened to
cooking in America?

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.460
And I wrote a long essay about
that for the New York Times

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.070
Magazine, that ended up in
the book in another form.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.030
But there was this
really curious paradox,

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:48.200
which was as rates of home
cooking were declining,

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.990
from more than an
hour per person

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.830
per day in 1965,
to 27 minutes now,

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.880
with four minutes
for cleaning up.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.415
Which, I know, what
kind of cleaning up

00:11:58.415 --> 00:11:59.540
can you do in four minutes?

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.600
And it's kind of suggesting that
cooking is not too ambitious,

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.770
that you're crumpling
a pizza box,

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.210
or throwing out some
takeout containers.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.310
And indeed, if you ask
the marketing experts,

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.360
will you define cooking for me?

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.130
Is it cooking from scratch?

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.060
Oh no, we can't even
measure scratch cooking.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.620
That's too small.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:24.030
It's the combination
of any two ingredients

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.990
qualifies as cooking.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.270
So I said, so bottled
salad dressing

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.030
over pre-washed greens?

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.270
Cooking.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:35.610
Slice of meat between
two pieces of bread?

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.200
Cooking.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.950
And in fact, the sandwich is the
most popular meal in America,

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.980
both for lunch and dinner today.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.270
And so we were
cooking less time,

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:51.800
and cooking less in what most
of us really think is cooking.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.650
But at the same time
we were cooking less,

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.780
we were obsessing about
cooking as a culture.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.820
And we were watching
cooking shows on TV.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.920
And we have magazines
devoted to chefs

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.450
who have become cultural heroes.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:10.770
And this struck me is
this interesting anomaly,

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.810
in that what it
suggests-- OK, we're

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.230
spending 27 minutes cooking.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.120
How long is the average
cooking show on TV?

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.310
It's 30 minutes, or 60 minutes.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.470
So that meant there
were tens of millions

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.950
of Americans who were
spending more time watching

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.540
other people cook on
television than were actually

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.410
cooking themselves.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.440
And I don't need to
tell you that you

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.730
can't eat the food you see
getting cooked on television.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.060
You can't even smell it.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.020
And yet, we were doing it.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.080
And so I wanted to understand
what that was about.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.650
Because if you think about our
lives, there's plenty of stuff

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.680
we've outsourced to
corporations, right?

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.097
I mean, we don't change the
oil on our car anymore, right?

00:13:49.097 --> 00:13:50.513
We don't work on
our cars anymore.

00:13:50.513 --> 00:13:51.160
We can't.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.090
We can't figure
them out anymore.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:57.280
We don't sew our own
clothing or darn socks.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.670
And there are many things
we've let go, we've outsourced,

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.260
and we have not looked back.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:01.990
No problem.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.990
Don't miss that.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.840
And I don't watch TV about
changing the oil in my car,

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.780
or darning socks.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.320
There are no shows
about that stuff.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.820
I mean, I'm sure
you could find them

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.430
if you dig deep enough
into the cable channels.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.370
But in general,
they're not popular.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.150
So why is cooking different?

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.690
I think it's a real
clue to us that cooking

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.670
has a certain importance--
an emotional importance

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:29.860
and I would argue, even genetic
importance to our species.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.970
And I want to try
to convince you

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:36.310
that cooking is central to
our identity as humans, that

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.750
to do it is an agricultural act.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.820
To paraphrase Wendell
Berry, who said, "Eating

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.280
is an agricultural act," I would
say cooking is even more so.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.380
It is a political act, and
it is a therapeutic act.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:55.560
And how I came to this was
by learning how to do it.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.740
I mean, I essentially
apprenticed myself

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.920
to masters of the
four transformations

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.200
that I think we can break
cooking down into, each

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.970
of which represents
a technology.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.850
And I want to quickly run
you through what those four

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.340
technologies are, in order.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:18.220
But before I do, this paradox
probably owes to the fact

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:23.870
that we all still have
very powerful memories

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:28.080
of being cooked for, of being
in the kitchen with our parents,

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.390
probably our mothers, and that
incredible process of watching

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.480
her conduct these
transformations,

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.570
at the end of which is this
profound gift from parent

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.632
to child, of something you
love to eat, a favorite food.

00:15:42.632 --> 00:15:44.840
I mean, I can remember the
foods that my mother would

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.440
make for me on my
birthday, or things

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.220
that-- the dish during the
course of the week that

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.650
was just-- I loved.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.550
And so it goes kind of
deep in our lives, I think.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.500
And we remember those smells.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.520
We remember that
transaction of love.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.220
And so that's part of it.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.520
But it turns out it
goes even deeper.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.880
And when I said that it's
kind of hard-wired into us,

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.320
I meant that quite literally.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.900
What we've learned in
recent anthropology

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.680
is that the transformation
in our evolution

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.520
that separated us
from the apes and led

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.040
to the growth of our brains
and the shrinking of our jaws

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.420
and our gut, which happens
about 1.8 million years ago,

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.490
when we become-- even
before we were human.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.290
Before we're Homo sapiens--
when we're Homo erectus.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.270
That dramatic
transformation has kind

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.760
of mystified archaeologists
and anthropologists

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.470
for a long time.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:44.490
What would cause such
a profound change?

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.280
And for a while they thought
maybe it was meat-eating.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.980
But meat-eating can't
really explain it,

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:52.500
because eating
raw meat, in fact,

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.835
you need a giant jaw to chew it.

00:16:53.835 --> 00:16:55.210
It's really hard
to chew, and you

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.918
need a big gut to
digest it, because it's

00:16:56.918 --> 00:16:58.110
really hard to digest.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:02.600
What it really is, it
appears, is the discovery

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.790
of cooking with fire.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:08.730
And when we figured
out this amazing trick,

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:13.950
this critical technology,
these amazing changes happened.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.780
And the reason is that
when you cook food,

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.790
essentially you externalize
much of the work

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.819
and the energy
needed for digestion.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.710
So that instead of your
body having to do it all--

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:32.210
and we burn a lot of calories
digesting, or we used to-- it

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.830
takes place, the partial
breakdown of the proteins

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.360
and the carbohydrates
and the fats.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.460
And it becomes detoxified,
and it becomes easier to chew.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.200
It's a huge deal.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.670
And it really gives us this
tremendous evolutionary edge,

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:51.160
because it also gives us access
to foods other animals can't

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.720
eat like tubers, most of which
are toxic unless you cook them.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.770
Cassava, potatoes.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:01.150
You eat raw potatoes, you
can have solanine poisoning.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.860
But we found when you cook
them, you could eat them.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.729
And so we had this
new stash of calories

00:18:05.729 --> 00:18:07.020
that other animals didn't have.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.560
So it gave us a big edge.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.180
But this energetic--
this boom of energy

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.130
we got from cooking
food appears to be

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.220
what underwrites the
growth of our brains.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.160
Our brains are tremendous
energy guzzlers.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.990
They take up about 2%
of your body weight,

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:27.950
but they use 20% of
the energy you take in.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.790
So it's expensive
to maintain a brain.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:34.330
And you can't do it
without cooked food.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:39.110
So you raw foodists, take note.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.930
Now, raw food, you ask.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.810
OK, well, there are
people who eat raw food.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.810
And some people try to
do raw food exclusively.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.230
But most of them
don't do very well.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.230
And half of the women on raw
food diets stop menstruating.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.780
They're not getting
enough energy.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.880
And anyone who does do raw food
is highly blender-dependent.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.320
I mean, if you know any
people who cook raw food,

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.540
they'd be literally
dead without a blender,

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.330
because that's doing
all that chewing

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.220
and that work of digestion.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.840
So I would say that
actually qualifies

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.510
as a primitive form of cooking.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.250
So we need cooked food.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.810
It's now hardwired into us.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.600
We're dependent on it.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.000
We're obligate cooks.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.420
Now, the other thing,
though, that fire

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.780
gave us is it freed
up a lot of time.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:33.290
Before we cooked with fire,
we spent a very large portion

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.390
of our day chewing.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.780
And if you look at apes
that are our size, similar

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:43.700
weight and size, they spend
half of their waking hours

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.010
in the act of chewing.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.910
Six hours a day, chewing.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.800
It's no wonder they
don't get a lot done.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.100
You can't have a culture if
you're spending half your time

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:54.680
chewing.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.830
You can't have art.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:57.850
You can't have software.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.525
There's all sorts
of things-- well,

00:19:59.525 --> 00:20:00.899
you probably could
have software.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.930
So it was a great boon to us.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.980
And the last thing
cooking gave us,

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.590
and why I think it is
so important socially,

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.170
is that when you start
cooking with fire,

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.270
you start eating
in a different way.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.690
Cooking gave us
not just the stuff,

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.230
but the occasion, the meal.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.390
And here's how.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.340
If you're cooking
over a fire, remember

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.350
this is pre matches
and lighters.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.210
Keeping the fire going is
a tremendous undertaking,

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.390
and requires a lot
of cooperation.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.495
So you need someone to
kind of tend the fire,

00:20:36.495 --> 00:20:39.400
while someone else is hunting
or preparing the food.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.470
And it becomes
cooperative in a way

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:44.327
that hunting and
gathering never had to be.

00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:46.160
In hunting and gathering,
you could eat food

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.430
wherever you found it.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.490
You might bringing some home for
your family, or you might not.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.510
But as soon as you cook,
you need cooperation.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:58.300
And you also need to
learn how to share.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:03.860
Because if you're cooking this
big beautiful chunk of kudu,

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.220
or whatever this
animal is that you get,

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.390
you have to restrain
yourselves from eating it

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:13.560
before it's ready.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.720
And if you don't have rules
surrounding your meal,

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.610
you will find the biggest,
strongest, hungriest,

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:25.350
greediest animal will get
the food, and you won't.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.630
So with meat-eating around
fires becomes the rudiments

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.460
of civilization.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:35.840
A lot of civilization is about
restraining your instincts,

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.580
learning rules of
social engagement.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.790
And many, many things
happen around that fire,

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.800
including probably language.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.155
And this rulemaking,
though, is that we're

00:21:46.155 --> 00:21:48.280
going to divide it this
way, and you get this piece

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.177
and I get this piece.

00:21:49.177 --> 00:21:50.760
This is the beginning
of civilization.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.570
So cooking give us a lot.

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:56.300
And as we cook less,
we're losing a lot.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.250
Our brains are not
getting smaller,

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.770
but our guts are getting larger.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.370
And we're not eating
around the table

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.480
as much, as we fail to cook.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.350
So cooking is really
important to us as a species.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.992
And there are costs
to outsourcing it.

00:22:10.992 --> 00:22:12.950
Now we're still getting
cooked food, obviously.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:15.600
McDonald's and the
cafeteria here,

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.560
everyone will give
you cooked food.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:23.030
And the problem is
that when we allow

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.170
large corporations to
cook-- and actually, we

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.350
call it processed food
when corporations do it,

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:32.350
cooking when humans do it-- when
we allow corporations to cook

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.390
for us, in general, and
there are exceptions,

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.530
they don't cook very well.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.910
They tend to use the cheapest
possible raw ingredients,

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.980
and to use the most
salt, fat, and sugar

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.670
to make that food acceptable.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:47.970
We love salt, fat, and sugar.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:51.050
We evolved to-- we have buttons
that you can push very easily.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:53.420
We need those nutrients.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.550
The problem is, in nature,
they're pretty rare.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.560
In modern industrial
economy, they're really

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.090
cheap and easy to add,
and everybody loves them.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:03.040
And when you layer
them together,

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.500
you get food that's
irresistible,

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.670
that stimulates cravings.

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:09.740
And that's why the industry,
the food processing industry,

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.510
works with them so much.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.480
And they're just very
cheap to add to a food.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.289
So that's one problem,
that you're not

00:23:17.289 --> 00:23:18.830
going to get high
quality ingredients

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.810
and it's going to have too
much salt, fat, and sugar.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:23.220
Another problem, though,
which is a little more subtle,

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.210
is that corporations
are very good at cooking

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:29.050
certain things,
like French fries.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.320
Classic example.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.740
There's something about home
cooking that basically gives

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.445
you a nudge in the direction of
simple foods, simply prepared.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.980
Any of you made
French fries before?

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.030
It's a pain.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.920
I mean, they're wonderful,
but you have to, like,

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.360
peel the potato-- wash the
potato, peel the potato,

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:54.320
cut the potato, heat up
this big thing of fat,

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.800
and then spatter
your whole kitchen.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.560
It's a mess.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.630
And then you have to
get rid of all that fat.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.090
And you're not going to do
it more than once a month,

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.540
if you're an ambitious cook.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.470
You're just not going to fry.

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.800
But McDonald's, or
anyone, or Ore-Ida,

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.000
can make really
good French fries

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.570
so cheaply that they
become ubiquitous.

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:19.750
And so you end up eating
this special occasion food,

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:22.240
that I think of it, because
I love French fries.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.240
Many Americans eat
it twice a day.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.290
So when you outsource
cooking to corporations,

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:30.170
they're going to make those
labor-intensive, highly

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.610
desirable cookies and cakes,
too, which are also a pain.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.269
And so you don't
make them that often.

00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:36.810
So what I'm saying,
there's something

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.650
built into the nature
of home cooking

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:42.370
that tends to keep you
onto the healthier foods

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:43.640
than you can have.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.820
And it's the ubiquity of these
labor-intensive foods that

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.410
gets a lot of
people into trouble.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:50.470
So that's another reason.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:53.750
And a food marketing expert I
talked to, this guy in Chicago

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.020
named Harry Balzer, we
were talking about--

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.040
and he works for the
processed food industry.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.830
And I was saying,
well, what are we

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:03.990
going to do about this
obesity, this problem?

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.590
And he said, well, I've
got the diet for America.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.200
You want to know how to
control weight in this country?

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.510
And I'm, like, taking
out my notebook, what

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.343
is he going to tell me,
the secret from deep

00:25:12.343 --> 00:25:14.900
within the heart of the
processed food industry.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.470
He says, eat anything
you want, as long

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:20.280
as you cook it yourself.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.440
If you could actually do
that, any problems around food

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.420
would disappear.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.503
Because you wouldn't have
French fries that often.

00:25:27.503 --> 00:25:29.300
You wouldn't have
dessert every night.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.090
And you would eat a healthy
diet without counting calories,

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:36.040
without looking at
any ingredient labels.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.790
It would take care of itself.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.900
But that's easier
said than done.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.290
So I kind of took the
Harry Balzer challenge,

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.760
and went out and tried
to learn how to cook.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.430
And as I said, I divided cooking
into these four transformations

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:51.470
or technologies.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:54.780
And they happened to correspond
to the classical elements.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.360
There is cooking
with fire, water,

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.360
which is cooking in
pots, with liquid.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.440
And then there's air,
which is cooking--

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.250
which is baking, bread, which
is putting air into our food,

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.030
which is very significant.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.500
And then fermentation-- earth.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.130
Cooking with
microbes, the microbes

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.780
that live in soil--
many of them do.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.840
And most kinds of
cooking, you could

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.280
put into one of those
transformations or another.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.590
And I want to quickly
run through what

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:24.267
I learned about each one.

00:26:24.267 --> 00:26:26.600
And they're all interesting
in their are different ways,

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.170
and in each case I found
a master to teach me.

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:31.840
In the case of fire
cooking, I wanted

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.270
to find the most
unreconstructed cooking,

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.320
the most like that primitive
scene that I described,

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.030
with the people around the fire.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.690
And that turned out to
be eastern North Carolina

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:45.130
barbecue.

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.750
And I specify eastern, because
if you go to western North

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.240
Carolina, they do
it differently.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.770
But eastern North
Carolina barbecue

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:55.270
is whole hog, wood fire, time.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:56.080
That's the recipe.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.280
A lot of time-- 20 hours, maybe.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.730
And it's just so
simple, but dressed up

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.810
with lots of pretension, and
lots of self-dramatizing men

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:07.680
telling you how hard it is.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.250
But it's really
simple, believe me.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:10.430
I've done it since.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.962
And I mean, guys
know that barbecue

00:27:12.962 --> 00:27:14.670
is all about taking
something very simple

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:18.220
and making it look
like a big deal.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.190
And that's probably been
going on for a very long time

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:23.770
in human history.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:26.920
And one of things that struck
me learning about barbecue--

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.810
and I explore the science of
it, like, why is cooked meat

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:32.090
taste so much better
than raw meat?

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:34.290
And there are these
amazing chemical reactions

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.980
that take place-- the Maillard
reaction and caramelization

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:42.090
that create, like, 30,000 new
compounds that are elusive,

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:45.949
that taste like other things,
that just kind of complicate

00:27:45.949 --> 00:27:47.490
the food in a really
interesting way,

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.620
making it more
metaphorical, even,

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.780
and less literal in ways that
humans always like doing that

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.720
to everything-- to
language, and to food too.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.970
But the thing that
struck me is that it's

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:00.760
so rule-bound, even now.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.160
Cooking the meat outdoors
is really rule-bound.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.180
And the barbecue pit masters
have-- they're, like,

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.000
more rule-obsessed
than any rabbi

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.460
I've ever met about eating meat.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.790
And so I'll say, so what do
you think of the barbecue

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:17.215
in over in western
North Carolina?

00:28:17.215 --> 00:28:22.080
And they're like, well, those
are pork shoulders with sauce.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.920
And that's good, but
it's not barbecue.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.170
And I said, what about what
they do in South Carolina?

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.940
Well, they do a mustard-based
sauce and they're eating ribs,

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.370
and that's not barbecue.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:33.210
And so it's like
it's not kosher.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.190
Over and over again,
it was like Kashrut

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.860
for goys going on
all over the South.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.150
So I was very struck by that.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:43.050
And there had been
this long tradition

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:52.760
that the priest and the
butcher and the chef, all

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.160
through classical history, Greek
history, was the same person.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.760
{Megaros}.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.400
One word for those
three functions.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.070
That's how important it was,
and how ceremonial it was.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.930
And cooking meat is still very
ceremonial, and it's very male,

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:11.520
and it happens in a
very theatrical manner.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.680
So that was the first science of
cooking, the first technology.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.530
The second big breakthrough,
you have to leap forward way

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:24.260
from 1.8 million years ago
to just 10,000 years ago.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:28.480
And that is when we
begin cooking in pots.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.250
It awaited pots.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:32.180
We needed to develop
the technology

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:36.130
to create clay-fired pots
that could withstand a fire,

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:37.840
and that you could
boil water in.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.840
This seems really
simple, but it's actually

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.190
a profound development.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.440
It's hard to imagine
agriculture getting off

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.990
the ground without
this technology.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:47.560
Because a lot about
agriculture is,

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.580
is eating seeds, right-- grain.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:54.120
And it's very hard to eat
grain unless you've softened it

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.600
in water, and you turn it
into a porridge or cooked rice

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.040
or whatever you're doing.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.730
So toasting grain, these
little things over fires,

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.100
you can't get a skewer on them.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.830
It doesn't really work.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:09.300
So it's no accident
that cooking with water

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.920
comes up at the exact same
time that agriculture begins.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.420
And they're probably
closely allied,

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:17.050
and there's probably a chicken
and egg phenomenon going on.

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:18.880
But when you can
do this now, you

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.140
can do all sorts of new things.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:25.570
You can combine vegetables
with meat, for example.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:29.582
You can eat parts
of animals that

00:30:29.582 --> 00:30:31.790
are very tough, because you
can break it down slowly.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.350
You can braise it and stew it.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:35.610
And what I learned to do
was braising and stewing

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:36.910
in this chapter.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.900
Working with a young
Chapanese chef in Berkeley.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:45.000
And you begin to have cuisines.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.559
Cooking meat over fire,
if you close your eyes

00:30:47.559 --> 00:30:49.600
you couldn't tell if you
were in Brazil, or North

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:54.580
Carolina-- leaving the sauce
aside-- or Europe, or China.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.380
It's meat over fire.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.150
But as soon as you
cook in pots, and you

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:00.610
can mix these
vegetables with it,

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.700
you get these
aromatic vegetables

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.150
like onions and garlic,
or onions and pepper,

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:07.050
these different
combinations of vegetables

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:10.240
that really mark a food
as part of a culture.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.610
So if it has a mirepoix
base, that's French cooking.

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:19.540
That's onions and
celery and-- I always

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.870
forget-- carrots,
thank you very much.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.120
And then there's
the Asian mirepoix.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.530
There are these
flavor principles

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:27.910
that you really can't
establish until you're

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.480
cooking in pots with liquid.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.650
And the other cool thing about
it is there's no waste anymore.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.970
It's a very economical
way to cook,

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.800
because when you're
cooking meat over fire

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.730
you have the dripping
fat, which is all

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:41.060
very nutritious, actually.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.730
And you're losing
all those calories.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:45.510
But in a pot, you
get everything.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.970
You save it all, and you
get the amazing dividend

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.790
that is a sauce.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:51.790
You can't have sauce
before you have these pots.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:53.820
So it does a lot for cuisine.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.840
It also does a lot,
interestingly enough,

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.850
for the human lifespan.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:04.690
Once upon a time, when you only
had meat cooked over fires,

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:08.300
you couldn't wean a baby
until they had some teeth

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:12.210
and could eat it, or you would
have to chew it for them.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.380
But now, you can make these
soft soups and porridges

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.320
that allow you to
wean babies earlier,

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.850
which is a great
boon to society,

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:22.600
because you can increase
population and have babies

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.920
spaced more closely together.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.720
And then on the other
end of the lifespan,

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.000
you can keep old
people alive longer.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.170
Because previously, when
you lost your teeth,

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.240
you were kind of screwed.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.280
But now, you have
these foods, these

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:39.780
gruels that you can keep people
alive even without teeth.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:43.570
So the pot actually
expands human lifespan,

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:46.090
and so it's a very
important technology.

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.062
Now let me leap ahead.

00:32:47.062 --> 00:32:48.770
I'm going to go quickly,
because I really

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.530
do want to hear your questions.

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:52.520
And we can talk about
this, or anything else

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.140
you want to talk about.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:55.850
Bread.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:58.950
One of my favorite
technologies of all.

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:00.840
Bread is discovered
in Egypt, it is

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.460
thought, about 6,000 years ago.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.080
How?

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.780
Well, probably what
happened is somebody

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.660
made one of those porridges
that I was describing.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:13.360
It was some grass seed, and
ground, and then added water,

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.580
and lost track of it.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.560
Didn't eat it.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.550
And it just sat off in a corner.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.319
And some yeast and
bacteria got into it,

00:33:19.319 --> 00:33:21.110
and somebody looked at
it one day and says,

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.460
wow, that's bubbling,
and it's gotten big.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.920
It's twice as big
as it was before,

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.310
which is kind of amazing.

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:31.750
Wow, I just got more
food by leaving it alone?

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:36.550
And then they thought, hey,
let's put it in the oven

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:37.620
and see what happens.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:41.830
And even more miraculous,
it doubled again in size.

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:46.220
And so you can see why bread
became this miracle that's

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.470
part of the Eucharist,
the Catholic communion.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:52.820
Because it does seem to come
from nothing, or very little.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.250
And it becomes quite big.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:56.940
And what's happened,
of course, is

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.240
it's air is the additional food.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:00.770
Or "food."

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.030
But we've added air to the food.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:06.210
And the significance of
this was driven home to me

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:09.380
by a food scientist I
interviewed for the book, a guy

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.170
at Davis named Bruce
German, who said

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:14.690
if I gave you a bag of
flour, even whole wheat

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:19.679
flour, and water, you could
live on that for a little while,

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:21.100
but not very long.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.900
You would eventually die.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.110
But, if you took that water and
flour and turned it into bread,

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.270
you could live indefinitely.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:32.270
So what's going on?

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:35.210
Why is that such an
important transformation

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:39.080
from dough, essentially,
he's saying, to bread?

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.040
Well, he explained
what's happening.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.000
When you have that starter
culture, that sourdough-- which

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.980
is a culture of both yeast,
fungi, and bacteria--

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:54.830
when you introduce them to that
wet mass of flour and water,

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:58.520
they start digesting
the polysaccharides,

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:04.650
the long-chain proteins
and carbohydrates.

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:08.240
And the microbes
create these enzymes

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.070
that break down
those long chains.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:11.600
The reason they're
in long chains

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.250
is that the seed--
remember we're

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:14.710
talking about
eating seeds here--

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:18.570
that the seed has
everything needed

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.605
for the next
generation of plants.

00:35:20.605 --> 00:35:23.075
It's an amazing
pantry of nutrients.

00:35:23.075 --> 00:35:24.340
It's got it all.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.790
Fat, protein, carbohydrate,
minerals, vitamins,

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:28.350
antioxidants, it's all there.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:31.637
But it's locked up tight,
because the plant doesn't

00:35:31.637 --> 00:35:32.970
want to give it away to animals.

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:37.470
It wants to keep it intact for
the developing, the germinating

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:38.450
seedling.

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:40.660
But what the microbes
that we introduced do

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.390
is they break down those--
they break into the pantry

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:46.370
and break it down into
much more digestible forms,

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:49.620
into short-chain
carbohydrates or sugars,

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:55.322
and proteins that
become amino acids.

00:35:55.322 --> 00:35:56.780
So that's the first
transformation,

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.660
is during that fermentation.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.100
And then the second
transformation

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.790
comes when you bake it.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:03.750
Now you know from your
elementary physics

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:06.600
that if you have boiling
water or something like that,

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.500
it can't really get hotter than
the boiling point, at which

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.580
point it turns into steam.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:16.000
But if you enclose it
in the crust of a bread,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.330
you create a pressure cooker
in which all those little air

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:23.072
pockets inside get
really hot and steamy.

00:36:23.072 --> 00:36:25.280
And steam can get much hotter
than the boiling point.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:29.360
And you can drive it up
to 300, 400, 500 degrees.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.240
And what that extreme
heat does is thoroughly

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:35.940
cook the carbohydrates so that
they become very digestible,

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.440
and much more sweet
and delicious.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.370
So this is a
profound technology,

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:43.270
for taking a mush of grass
seeds and turning it into a food

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:47.920
that you can live on, unless
you're gluten-intolerant.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.310
But people weren't that
gluten-intolerant back then.

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:52.300
We can talk about that later.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.240
And so, very
profound technology.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.370
And I worked with-- if
some of you, I'm sure,

00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:01.280
live in San Francisco-- Chad
Robertson, who bakes at Tartine

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:05.480
and makes what I think is the
best bread in the whole world.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.310
And I spent a lot of time
learning from him how to bake,

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:13.170
and when I was
making my starter,

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:16.722
I didn't know whether it was OK
to ask a famous baker to take

00:37:16.722 --> 00:37:18.180
some of their
starter or not, and I

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.596
thought it wasn't
a cool question.

00:37:19.596 --> 00:37:22.680
But I made a point of shaking
his hands every time I saw him

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:28.340
and not washing my hands, and
then adding it to my starter.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.190
So I ended up with a
Tartine-ish starter

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:34.430
that's very lively, until
I went on book tour.

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:37.420
And I neglected it for
two months and it died.

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:41.600
So I need to see Chad
over lunch very soon

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.350
and shake his hand, yeah.

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:46.494
So that was air.

00:37:46.494 --> 00:37:48.410
And then the last section
I want to talk about

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:51.680
is, for me, what was probably
the most fascinating.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.840
And that was this
method of cooking

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.710
without the use of
any heat whatsoever,

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:59.140
purely through the
action of microbes.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:02.250
What an amazing thing that these
microbes can give us everything

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:07.540
from wine to cheese to
sauerkraut and kimchi

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:13.536
and pickles, to chocolate,
which is a fermented food.

00:38:13.536 --> 00:38:14.910
I don't know if
you realize that.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:17.190
And coffee, which must
be fermented before you

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.660
can grind the beans.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:24.540
It's an amazing thing that we
can use bacteria in this way.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.950
It began as a food
preservation strategy.

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:29.940
Before refrigeration,
how would you

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.380
preserve the harvest to
get through the winter,

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.190
until you had another harvest?

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:36.031
Well, you did it
by fermenting food.

00:38:36.031 --> 00:38:37.030
And it's still going on.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:38.830
I was in China
recently, and they'll

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.380
take a bunch of cabbages and
they'll throw them in a pit

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.910
and cover it was soil.

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:45.920
And the lactobacillus
will go to work.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.170
They're already on the leaves of
cabbages, and everything else.

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:50.530
They're on you.

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.630
And just like they're waiting
to ferment you when you die,

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:57.000
they are waiting to ferment
cabbages when they die.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.440
And so they start breaking
down the vegetable matter,

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:06.330
releasing lactic acid, which of
course is a great preservative,

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:08.500
and makes them more nutritious.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:14.390
So I grew up in a very
microbe-phobic family,

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:17.660
like most of us did
in recent years.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.200
And my mother was
terrified of bacteria.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:25.760
And if she dropped a can of
green beans on the ground

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:29.500
and it got a dent, she we sure
it had contracted botulism

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.700
and we had to throw it out.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.840
And so we had lots
of hand-washing

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.080
and all the normal things.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:40.310
But I met this generation,
this subculture

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:43.740
of what I call "fermentos"--
people kind of obsessed

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:44.580
with fermentation.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.000
And they're all around us now.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.990
And they're a very
interesting subculture.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.520
They go a little
further than I do.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.710
I mean, they'll eat
roadkill and high-meat,

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.730
and they love bacteria.

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:56.677
And they're trying
to renegotiate

00:39:56.677 --> 00:39:58.760
the terms of our relationship
with these microbes.

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:02.290
And I think in that, they're
really on to something.

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:03.920
They're very casual
about hygiene.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.920
You'll ask them for a
recipe and I'll say, well,

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.220
shouldn't I wash that crock
first, or that cabbage?

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:11.440
No, don't wash it, because it
has the good bacteria on it.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:17.380
And it turns out though,
they're on to something.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:21.300
I mean, we're learning
that our war on bacteria,

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.910
even though it has helped
conquer several diseases,

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:27.900
has also led to
various problems.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.030
And it is probably
our lack of contact

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:32.140
with bacteria as
children that is leading

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.530
to these high rates
of allergy and asthma

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.890
and autoimmune disease.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:38.410
That's the hygiene hypothesis.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:40.290
But we're also
learning more recently

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:45.392
that the ecosystem
of microbes that

00:40:45.392 --> 00:40:47.850
live in your large intestine--
I mean they're all over you,

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:52.340
but especially there-- are
very important to your health.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:57.200
And that-- I don't know if you
know this, but you are only 10%

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.100
human.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:03.230
90% of the cells that you
are, that are on your body

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:06.480
and in your body, those
belong to microbes.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.500
You're a super organism.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.370
And our health is,
in significant ways,

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:15.230
mediated by the health
of that ecosystem.

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:18.340
And we have in our
antibiotic culture, literally

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.310
antibiotic culture,
we've been killing off

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:21.710
a lot of those microbes.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:24.310
We have not been ingesting
them in our diet,

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:27.500
with the result that our
biodiversity internally

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:31.230
is dramatically lower than
it is in people probably 50

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:33.550
years ago, and we know in
hunter-gatherer populations

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:36.760
that have these wild, wildly
diverse and very healthy

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.680
microbiomes.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.350
So the fermentos are
really on to something.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:43.300
And I look in the book
at the biology of this,

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.860
what we're learning
about the microbiome

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.170
and how it affects our health.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:47.930
And that was fascinating to me.

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.730
It's leading to a
revolution in medicine

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:54.077
that we will all feel
very soon, although we

00:41:54.077 --> 00:41:55.160
don't have to wait for it.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.510
I mean, eating
more fermented food

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:57.968
is what a lot of
these doctors will

00:41:57.968 --> 00:41:59.510
tell you is a good thing to do.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.720
I'm talking about
sauerkraut and pickles

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.770
and all that live culture food.

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:08.630
But as important as
fermentation is biologically,

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:11.830
it's very important culturally
too, and this kind of surprised

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:12.660
me.

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.350
A great many cultures
have a fermented food

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:20.300
they love that other people
think is kind of disgusting.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.730
And they're polarizing foods.

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:27.080
I'm thinking of stinky cheeses
and kimchi and sauerkraut.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.730
And if you go to
China, they love

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:32.887
something called stinky tofu.

00:42:32.887 --> 00:42:34.720
I don't know if any of
you have ever had it.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:38.000
It's well-named.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.750
It's essentially tofu
that's been marinated

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:45.460
in rotten vegetables, just black
slime of rotten vegetables,

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:46.880
usually outdoors.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.550
And then maybe if you're
lucky, fried after that.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.520
It actually-- if you can
get it past your nose,

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.900
it doesn't taste that bad.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.710
They love it.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:59.170
And yet they think
a cheese, even

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:01.490
kind of a not so stinky
cheese, a cheddar or something,

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:03.830
is the most disgusting
food imaginable.

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:06.450
They will not-- they can't
believe we like cheese.

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:10.110
And they say-- and it's oily and
the taste stays in your mouth,

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:14.230
whereas stinky tofu, it's so
clean and the taste disappears.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:16.320
Although, what kind of
praise is that for a food,

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.530
that the taste
quickly disappears?

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:23.060
I will also point out that they
eat stinky tofu exclusively

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.480
outdoors.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.080
So anyway, cultures have this.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.360
And the Koreans are very
proud of their kimchi.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.264
And when I went to
Korea, I went to Korea

00:43:32.264 --> 00:43:33.430
to learn how to make kimchi.

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:38.666
And I went to the
kimchi museum, in Seoul.

00:43:38.666 --> 00:43:40.540
I went to one on the
south side of the river.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.664
There's another one on the
north side of the river.

00:43:42.664 --> 00:43:46.820
And there are a total of
six kimchi museums in Korea.

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.660
And when I was there, I
asked the docent a question.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.340
I saw all these groups
of kindergartners

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.673
with their little uniforms
and yellow backpacks trooping

00:43:54.673 --> 00:43:57.540
through, learning how kimchi
is made-- the urns, the spice

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.790
mixes, and everything.

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:00.600
I said, why do you
bring kindergartners

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.950
to a kimchi museum?

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:05.180
And this woman said,
because children are not

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.230
born liking kimchi.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.580
OK.

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:14.010
It is, by definition, it is
the definition of an acquired

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:14.670
taste.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:17.390
And these fermented foods
are all acquired tastes.

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:19.630
And they're one of the
ways-- culture's very much

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:20.874
about drawing lines, right?

00:44:20.874 --> 00:44:23.040
And they're one of the ways
that we define ourselves

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.730
against other cultures.

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:26.510
And I'm convinced--
I couldn't write

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:30.010
about this, because the
research isn't there--

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:34.920
but that these foods actually
change our bodily odors in ways

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.230
that make us either
very comfortable or very

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:38.760
uncomfortable.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.909
So anyway, fermented
foods are really

00:44:41.909 --> 00:44:43.450
interesting on many
different levels.

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:45.120
And I learned how
to make cheese.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.340
I worked with a
wonderful nun who's

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:50.700
a cheesemaker and
a microbiologist.

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.400
And she actually
believes-- she makes

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.950
this beautiful cheese
in Connecticut.

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:56.960
And she makes it
in a wooden barrel,

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:01.210
which is the most-- you
know, it drives the health

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:03.030
department crazy,
because you can't

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:04.180
sterilize a wooden barrel.

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.710
And in fact, the recipe for
this traditional French cheese

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:10.430
she makes specifies, don't
sterilize the wooden barrel.

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:11.800
Just rinse it out.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.760
Because they're
really good bacteria

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.310
that live in the
little crevices.

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:19.040
And in fact, she proved to
the health authorities, when

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.540
they tried to shut her down or
make her use stainless steel,

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:24.290
like every other
cheesemaker in America,

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:27.170
she got two vats of
raw milk from her cows,

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:28.900
right in the abbey.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:32.390
And she introduced e.
coli into both vats,

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:33.640
and waited a couple hours.

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.340
And at the end of
three or four hours,

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:38.560
the stainless steel vat
was so teeming with e.coli

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.610
that it was toxic.

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:42.300
You couldn't-- that would
be condemned, that milk.

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.910
And the milk in
the wooden barrel,

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.390
it had vanishingly
small levels of e. coli.

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:48.440
And what had happened?

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:52.160
The lactobacillus that
lived in the wooden barrel

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.790
started-- they call
it lactobacillus--

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:57.460
eating the lactose,
their favorite food,

00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:01.310
breaking it down into lactic
acid which killed the e. coli.

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:03.390
So you see, these people
have been practicing

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:07.240
a kind of folk microbiology for
hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.199
And she's mastered that.

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:11.740
And the health department went
away after this demonstration.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.950
And she really believes
the cheese is so wonderful

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:20.380
that it belongs
in the Eucharist,

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.140
along with those other
two fermented foods, wine

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:24.120
and bread.

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.150
And she thinks cheese is a
better reminder of the body

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:32.370
than bread is, because it rots
and reminds us of mortality.

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.020
And it's like, it's
a heretical idea,

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.870
but it's kind of beautiful also.

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:38.861
So, a lot of the
cooking I did is not

00:46:38.861 --> 00:46:40.360
things you're going
to do every day.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.370
It's really extreme cooking,
making cheese or kimchi--

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:47.350
although kimchi is really
easy to make-- and sauerkraut

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.010
and baking bread.

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:51.680
But I found that doing
this, even every now

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:56.430
and then, is an incredibly
satisfying process.

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.850
When we learn how to do
something for ourselves that

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:04.890
is not what we do at work,
it's really empowering.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:07.650
So many of us, we live in
such a specialized culture.

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:11.160
And we've gotten really good
at the one thing that we do

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.650
and selling to the market.

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:14.220
And we've outsourced
everything else

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.190
in our lives--
our entertainment,

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:22.400
our exercise to some
extent, our food certainly.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.680
And there's something
wonderful about that.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.560
It makes this economy go around.

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.980
But there's something
debilitating about it too,

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.280
and something infantilizing.

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:35.450
The fact that we're so dependent
on fossil fuel, which is really

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:38.560
what allows us to do
all this outsourcing,

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.030
and so dependent
on other people,

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:44.630
that it feels really good
when you do something,

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:47.180
you learn a new
skill that actually

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.360
is in support of your body.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.050
And so few of us
have these anymore.

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:56.650
And I found there was-- it
was a very satisfying way

00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.650
to spend time, to learn
how to bake bread.

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:02.360
And learning to
diversify your talents,

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:05.696
learning how to take care of
yourself to a greater extent,

00:48:05.696 --> 00:48:07.070
I really think,
is a precondition

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:10.951
for the kinds of political
changes we need in this world.

00:48:10.951 --> 00:48:13.450
I just don't think we're going
to tackle things like climate

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:18.880
change until people can imagine
living in a different way.

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.420
And if you're
highly specialized,

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:22.500
you can't imagine living
in a different way--

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.370
without that car,
without that fossil fuel,

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:27.480
without that restaurant
to cook your meals.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:31.480
But as soon as you realize,
oh, I could do this,

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.430
suddenly you're open to change.

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:36.960
And so that's why I said
it's a political act.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.200
Take back control of
your diet, take back

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.600
control of some
part of your life

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.850
that you've been letting
other people do for yourself.

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:44.870
Not every day, even
just occasionally.

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:49.779
I think you'll find it feels
empowering and really good.

00:48:49.779 --> 00:48:51.070
So I'm going to leave it there.

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:54.080
We have a microphone here
if anybody has questions.

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:58.270
I'm happy to talk about
cooking, gluten intolerance.

00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:01.660
And I forgot to mention
there is one animal that

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:04.490
does cook, at least one animal.

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:06.710
If you include fermentation
under the definition

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:09.990
of cooking, squirrels cook.

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:13.740
Any animal that buries their
food is not just hiding it.

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.590
They're starting that
earth-driven process

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:19.530
of breakdown, to make that
seed, that acorn healthier.

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:22.149
So we're not quite the
only animal who cooks.

00:49:22.149 --> 00:49:23.440
AUDIENCE: Back to the microbes.

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.890
I think it's great that
you've sort of helped

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:27.030
get a lot people excited
about what is clearly becoming

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:28.150
a pretty big deal
scientifically,

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:29.983
understanding the
microbiota and how much it

00:49:29.983 --> 00:49:31.070
affects all our health.

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:32.653
I have a two year
old daughter, so I'm

00:49:32.653 --> 00:49:34.630
very keen to make sure
she's exposed to enough

00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:36.887
of the right microbes,
but my wife probably also,

00:49:36.887 --> 00:49:38.720
intelligently, is worried
about exposing her

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.460
to too many of the
wrong microbes.

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:41.650
So I'm just curious,
have you figured out,

00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:44.030
for people who are sort of
enlightened about this stuff,

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:45.670
but still-- we're in a
world where the bugs are

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:47.076
kind of hostile,
and there aren't

00:49:47.076 --> 00:49:49.450
a lot of things that are--
the good bugs [INAUDIBLE] it's

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:51.000
hard to get raw milk, et cetera.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.360
Are there good practical
ways to get access

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.660
to more bugs in your
diet without being

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:56.860
too off the reservation?

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:57.735
MICHAEL POLLAN: Yeah.

00:49:57.735 --> 00:50:00.550
Well, I mean, eating
whatever fermented foods

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:01.640
that your daughter likes.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.850
If she likes yogurt, great.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:07.000
Kids tend not to like
sauerkraut and kimchi.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.880
I mean, they're
strongly flavored foods.

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:11.487
But try it.

00:50:11.487 --> 00:50:13.320
But the other thing is
not just in the diet,

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.110
but in the lifestyle.

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:16.690
There's a lot of
research showing

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:20.370
that kids who grow up on
farms, especially ones who

00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:25.020
eat raw milk, drink raw milk,
but are exposed to animals,

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.330
have much lower rates
of autoimmune disease.

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:30.140
So raw milk is a complicated
one, and a risky one.

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:32.810
And I don't simply
recommend it, unless you're

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:36.140
very confident of the farmer
who's selling it to you.

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:41.660
But taking your kid to farms,
having pets-- even having pets

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:44.150
has been correlated with lower
rates of autoimmune disease.

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:49.470
So those exposures while she's
that age-- her immune system

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:51.080
is being trained right now.

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.550
And exposure to bacteria during
that training is a good thing.

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:56.290
Hand washing is still
advised, actually,

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:59.740
because of-- that's how many
germs are conveyed among kids.

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:03.980
And not that that's a bad
thing, but it's inconvenient

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.870
if your kid is sick a lot.

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:07.620
You're probably building
her immune system

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:10.640
every time she
gets an infection.

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:13.310
So, exposure to
animals, really good,

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:20.222
any kind of food that has
live bacteria is really good.

00:51:20.222 --> 00:51:20.930
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:21.870
MICHAEL POLLAN: Sure.

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:26.380
AUDIENCE: I've read, I guess,
all four of your food books.

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:30.690
And one thing I don't
remember you writing about

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:39.380
is a currently popular, or
maybe faddish trend in food,

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:41.270
and that is
molecular gastronomy.

00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:43.495
Or as Nathan Myhrvold calls
it, Modernist cuisine.

00:51:43.495 --> 00:51:44.370
MICHAEL POLLAN: Yeah.

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:46.550
AUDIENCE: It certainly
violates your grandmother

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:49.371
recognizing it.

00:51:49.371 --> 00:51:52.150
MICHAEL POLLAN: Well,
not always, because--

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:54.630
AUDIENCE: But at
same time, it doesn't

00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:58.090
seem to have any of
the bad things that

00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:00.170
led you to suggest that rule.

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:01.395
So what do you think?

00:52:01.395 --> 00:52:03.790
MICHAEL POLLAN: I did look
into molecular gastronomy.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:06.880
And in fact, Nathan served
me a beautiful lunch up

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:11.100
at his mad scientist lab
in Seattle, as part of it.

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:15.120
And I was very interested
in it, and that kind of food

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:19.150
is interesting and
artistically engaging,

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:23.130
but I don't think it's central.

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:24.740
I don't think it's
going to change

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:27.170
the way we eat any time soon.

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:30.310
And so I think it was a little
too rarefied for me to explore.

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:31.940
I was really, in
this book, trying

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:36.120
to get back to the fundamentals,
the basics of cooking.

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.710
And he's on the
frontier of cooking.

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:39.960
Which is interesting,
but I don't

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:45.740
know that we're all going to be
doing sous-vide and using some

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:48.030
of the techniques he's using,
even though it produces

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:49.310
interesting food.

00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:51.570
I was trying very much not
to write a foodie book.

00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:53.620
This is not a foodies' book.

00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:55.190
I hate that term.

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:57.260
I think our food culture
gets a little bit

00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:02.590
decadent at various points, in
the way we're eating sometimes.

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:04.550
And so we really
wanted to concentrate

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:08.555
on familiar foods that are
available to everybody at home.

00:53:08.555 --> 00:53:09.930
Even though
intellectually I find

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:11.677
what he's doing fascinating.

00:53:11.677 --> 00:53:13.510
There may be some
applications at some point

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:15.160
of what he's doing.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:19.210
And if we can figure
out a way to use

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:21.290
the techniques of
the food scientist

00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:24.520
to make food more nutritious,
I think that would be great.

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:29.110
It's striking how little of
that work has succeeded so far.

00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:32.674
That, in general, and I
tell the story in the book,

00:53:32.674 --> 00:53:37.200
in the bread chapter, processing
food for thousands of years

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.160
consistently made it healthier.

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:43.090
Coming up with fermentation,
cooking in pots, breadmaking.

00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:45.920
At a certain point, we
started processing food

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.680
to make it less healthy, to
make it have a longer shelf

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.870
life, mostly.

00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:53.750
And it happens when we go from
whole wheat, stone-ground flour

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:55.730
to white flour.

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:58.600
And so that's kind of
an interesting story.

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:01.560
And it may be Nathan is
at the beginning of a move

00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:04.350
toward figuring out how
to again use technology

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:07.140
to make food more healthy again.

00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:09.430
But not much has happened
in that area yet.

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:13.380
AUDIENCE: If I can make just
one final comment on this,

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.020
you can now get a
really good immersion

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:17.250
circulator for only $200.

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:20.750
I think in 10 or 15
years, sous-vide cooking

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:23.717
is going to be like a
blender or food processor.

00:54:23.717 --> 00:54:24.800
MICHAEL POLLAN: It may be.

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.840
I'd be curious.

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:30.900
The last big addition has
been the microwave, which

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:34.200
is an interesting technology
and it's really good for, like,

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.370
heating up your cup of tea.

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:38.789
It's not really
good for cooking.

00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:40.830
And I don't think it's
very good for family life,

00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:43.800
because you do one
thing at a time.

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:47.489
So I look forward
to the new gadget

00:54:47.489 --> 00:54:49.530
that we'll put in our
kitchens that will actually

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:52.630
make cooking easier, and make
the food more nutritious.

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:54.042
And that might be it.

00:54:54.042 --> 00:54:56.560
AUDIENCE: So I come from a
family of traditional rice

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:57.830
farmers in southern India.

00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:00.540
And when I was growing
up, 90% of everything

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.670
I would eat with my grandparents
came from the land around them.

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:05.961
They grew it themselves.

00:55:05.961 --> 00:55:09.050
A couple generations later,
many of us, including me,

00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:11.270
have chosen to
pursue other things

00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:14.470
like develop software and
chew food for six hours

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:18.160
a day, in an ape like fashion,
and outsourcing our food

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:21.319
production to other people,
and cooking to Google.

00:55:21.319 --> 00:55:23.110
But no one I know around
this area actually

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:26.270
says, I want to be an alfalfa
farmer or a wheat farmer.

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:28.220
Everyone wants to
pursue other careers.

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:29.850
And I wonder in
50 years from now,

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:33.980
will anybody be available to
grow this fundamental thing

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:36.020
that hedge fund managers
and software engineers

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.550
still need for their survival.

00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:38.560
Who will be there?

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:39.730
Who will grow the food?

00:55:39.730 --> 00:55:41.729
MICHAEL POLLAN: I think
that's a great question.

00:55:41.729 --> 00:55:44.370
Well, I actually said at
dinner the other night

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:47.690
with the 125th employee
of your corporation, who

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:50.350
is now a farmer.

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:52.370
His farm is supported
by his Google stock.

00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:58.740
[LAUGHTER] But he's doing
really interesting, good farming

00:55:58.740 --> 00:55:59.690
somewhere in Marin.

00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:02.930
And in fact, I've
met a succession

00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:05.210
of people who work
in your industry who

00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:06.440
have gotten the bug.

00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.740
I mean, one of the encouraging
things going on right

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:12.100
now is, for the first time
since we've been keeping track,

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:14.436
the number of farmers in
America is ticking up.

00:56:14.436 --> 00:56:15.810
It's been going
down consistently

00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:20.222
since we had-- since we
measured it, since 1900, say.

00:56:20.222 --> 00:56:21.930
And there is a generation
of young people

00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:25.650
who's very engaged by the
work of farming, which

00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:28.210
is really important
because you point

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:30.560
to the big problem with
industrial agriculture.

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:32.620
It doesn't require
a lot a labor.

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.580
We basically traded
labor on the farm

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:37.530
for chemicals and machines.

00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:40.590
And we're paying
the cost of that.

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:44.660
It's very hard to grow
good quality, nutritious,

00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:47.830
chemically-free food without
more people on the land.

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:51.170
And we will need many
more people on the land

00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:54.240
if we really want
to eat sustainably.

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:57.880
But there's also growing
food in your own home,

00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.240
which is not trivial.

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:02.472
I mean, during the
World War II, about 40%

00:57:02.472 --> 00:57:03.930
of the fresh produce
in America was

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:05.929
being grown by individuals
in their gardens.

00:57:05.929 --> 00:57:07.720
There's no reason we
couldn't do that again

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:10.200
even while developing software.

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.830
So I think the
challenge, though,

00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:17.520
is going to be in
places like India,

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.950
that-- there are many people
who want to stay on the land,

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:22.366
there are many people who don't
want to stay on the land--

00:57:22.366 --> 00:57:25.150
that the option of staying
on the land is preserved.

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:27.080
Because that's in
danger in many places.

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:30.060
I mean, there is a vision of
industrializing, developing

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:34.000
world agriculture on
offer right now, that

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.400
threatens to flood
the cities and lead

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.820
to a kind of agriculture that
will be very hard to sustain

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:42.160
because it's so
fossil fuel-dependent.

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:46.080
So we do live in a
specialized economy.

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.960
We need people to grow our food.

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.940
The best thing we can do
as people writing books,

00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:55.760
or developing software is,
pay them a living wage.

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.780
Make it attractive.

00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:01.730
One of my food rules
is pay more, eat less.

00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:04.200
Good food, sustainable
food, does cost more.

00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:06.920
And those of us who can afford
to support those farmers

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:07.570
need to do it.

00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:10.130
We need to make it a very
attractive way of life,

00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:12.530
so that we will draw more
people into doing it.

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:14.260
And we will pay
farmers for doing

00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:17.050
something, as you
recognized, is so dependent.

00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:19.230
No matter what we're
doing, we still need food.

00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:21.650
And food still comes
from the earth.

00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:25.120
And to ignore that connection
and lose track of it, I think,

00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:25.890
is a tragedy.

00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:28.620
So it begins with
supporting farmers

00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:30.096
who are doing good work.

00:58:30.096 --> 00:58:31.345
Thanks for your good question.

00:58:31.345 --> 00:58:33.330
AUDIENCE: Well, I was going
to ask a final question,

00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:34.470
but we've run out of time.

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:36.810
So everybody join me
in thanking Michael

00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:38.732
for coming back to Google.

00:58:38.732 --> 00:58:40.998
MICHAEL POLLAN:
Thank you very much.

00:58:40.998 --> 00:58:42.744
Thank you.
