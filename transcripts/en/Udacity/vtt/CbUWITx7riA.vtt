00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right. Here's how we decode the message.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We start off with the 15-bit message. We write it down.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Then we write the bits down in a column in order,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and we label each bit with its position number in binary

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
from 0001 all the way to 1111.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
There's 15 bits. We're starting with 1. That's how we get the codes.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Then we make note of which bit positions have 1s in the broadcast message,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and then we pull out those numbers, and we add them together with wraparound.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So, in the right-most column, we have 00110, and that's three 1s,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
so the sum is going to be a 1. It's an odd number of 1s.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In the second column from the right, it's 011010.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
That's three 1s again, so that sum will be 1 in that position.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
In the third column from the right, 111001.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
That's four 1s, so we'll have a 0 in that position because it's even.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
In the first position, again, three 1s gives us a 1.

00:01:02.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So, that is the message that we're looking for--1011.
