00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.592
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:07.760
SPEAKER: I'm happy
to introduce today

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.590
Brian Olson, a former member
of this office from a few years

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.340
ago, who's been doing computer
science for many, many years

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.230
and also been
interested in applying

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.390
computer science to politics.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.970
So he's here today to
talk about his thoughts

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.120
on that, using computer science
to get better democracy.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.226
So please welcome Brian Olson.

00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:34.674
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:34.674 --> 00:00:36.650
BRIAN OLSON: So
if you've ever had

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.380
the feeling that our democracy
is not entirely fair,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.090
and sometimes the deck
is stacked, you're right.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.630
In a lot of places,
we have democracy

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.690
that has been distorted
by the state legislature,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.110
using their power to make sure
that their favorite candidate

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.460
wins.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.890
In Florida in 2010, they
passed by ballot initiative

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.640
a new law to prevent that from
happening, but it didn't work.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.880
This map that the Florida State
legislature drew was later

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.605
thrown out by court decision.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.690
So that's what we
call gerrymandering.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.750
Gerrymandering is the
distortion of districts,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.350
representational districts,
toward some political end.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.160
How does it work?

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.840
So let's say you've got
this hypothetical map that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.080
has the 60-40 split in
its population favoring

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.760
the green people.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.680
Now, if you cut that up
in a very simple way,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.156
you get three districts
that the green people win,

00:01:36.156 --> 00:01:38.030
and two districts that
the purple people win,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.580
preserving that ratio.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.760
If you cut it differently, and
you pack enough green people

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.500
into just a couple
of districts, you

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.920
can get three districts where
the purple minority wins,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.560
thus inverting and
letting the minority power

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.270
have the majority power in that
five-person state legislature.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.690
Or if you do it the other way,
and you split the purple people

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.240
just right, they don't
get a majority anywhere,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.830
and they're completely shut out.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.750
These strategies of
"packing and cracking"

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.289
have been used in many
places around our country.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.990
In Florida, this
district was found

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.080
to be illegally
packing too many people

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.930
of an under-represented
group into one district

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.060
so that they would have
less influence elsewhere.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.820
Florida was doing that in 2012.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.330
But this is gerrymandering from
1812 here in Massachusetts,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.190
where the term was invented.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.890
Governor Elbridge
Gerry signed into law

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.380
this map that was drawn
into political cartoon

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.410
as this monstrous
dragon, a salamander--

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.990
thus coining the "gerrymander."

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.040
It's gotten a lot worse lately,
because computers have allowed

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.220
people to draw lines
very finely, looking

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.860
at all the demographics
down to little pockets

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.840
of hundred people
here and there,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.720
and thus making
designer districts just

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.130
for their particular purpose.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.130
But what if we used that
same computational power

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.490
to make completely
impartial districts that

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.910
just tried to make
local representation

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.100
without any political bias?

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.638
You might get
something like this.

00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:17.800
This is a map that I made
with my open source software.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.720
We started to be able
to make this kind of map

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.300
about 10 years ago,
when home computers got

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.880
fast enough to do this.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.620
So following the 2010 census,
I downloaded all of the data,

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.750
ran my home computer
for six months,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.750
and generated 137 maps for
all the states and state

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.030
legislatures, except
for a few where there

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.470
were bugs I'm still working on.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.390
This is North Carolina.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.630
North Carolina has been in a
constitutional crisis for years

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.330
now over their gerrymandering.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.990
They have had three years in a
row there are maps thrown out

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.510
by court, and they had
to go back and fix them I

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.250
forget which generation
of the map it is.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.190
This is probably
the map from 2013.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.630
You can see this
big red district

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.050
reaching into and around three
other districts around it.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.880
This pink district
pinches down as

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.800
narrow as possible
while reaching out

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.780
to grab other areas.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.835
This is nuts.

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:13.210
And the court has
found that this

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.390
is nuts and illegal and
trying to distort the system.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.930
It could be like this, though.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.900
You can go from the
hallmarks of gerrymandering,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.340
all of these fiddly
bits reaching

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.600
into and around everything,
to soap bubbles.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.940
Maryland also has one of the
most distorted, contorted

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.800
district mappings
I've ever seen.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.280
This is a Democratic
Party gerrymander

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.670
based on the Maryland
State legislature's

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.150
Democratic majority.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.570
The previous two were
Republican gerrymanders.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.510
Maryland's Republican
governor made some news

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.660
briefly calling out
for help, can somebody

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.400
please help fix my state?

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.350
To which President
Obama said, yeah,

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.540
we should fix gerrymandering
everywhere, please.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.620
It could be like this.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.930
So my point about
gerrymandering is that there

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.850
is technology possible.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.800
There is political
will on both sides

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.250
of the aisle in various places
to want to make a saner system.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.040
So let's do it.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.260
So how did I do it?

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.380
I wrote effectively
a custom GIS stack--

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.960
Geographic Information Systems.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.600
It was a lot of code
and various tools,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.680
depending on what part
I was going to do.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.820
But it's pretty efficient.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.200
It runs on home computers.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.110
It's open source.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.651
You can all go look at it, but
you probably wouldn't want to.

00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:48.770
It's not very pretty code,
but I'm working on that.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.400
And I'm going to update it
again for the 2020 cycle.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.320
It does that kind of
data pre-processing stuff

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.200
you'd expect, because it
downloads raw census data,

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.940
turns it into just the data
needed to do redistricting,

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.080
solves that.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.810
It can run in a distributed
fashion on as many computers

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.130
as you throw at it.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.360
And then finally
rendering the map output.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.150
What data do you actually
need to run this?

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.420
The census data provides
blocks as the lowest

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.550
level of information they have.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.460
Sometimes literally
a city block,

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.900
sometimes just miles and
miles and acres and acres

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.230
of land in Montana between
this stream and that stream.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.660
But blocks that are
blatantly split up

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.096
based on some political
or physical boundary.

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:38.470
And the whole
country is split up

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.890
into about 9 and 1/2
million blocks of data.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.890
Some blocks have just 100
people or zero people.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.860
Some blocks have 1,000 people.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.960
Each of those blocks
has a position.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.000
It has its neighbors,
because districts

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.100
have to be contiguous.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.960
They can't have part
of a district here

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.510
and part of a district here
with nothing in between.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.580
Although sometimes a
gerrymandered district

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.520
will have a town over
here, a town over here,

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.555
and a thin strip
of road in between.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.400
Land area and information.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.090
So my process takes the
raw census data down from 2

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.640
and 1/2 gigabytes of raw data
down to about 16 megabytes

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.620
for a typical state
of what I actually

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.940
need to solve this problem.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.440
Makes it much more tractable.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.690
So what I'm actually solving for
in my definition of compactness

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.430
is the average
distance per person

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.260
to the center of their district.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.080
If this little
map is a district,

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.290
and those are blocks with
population counts in them,

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.240
I find the center
of the district

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.550
and then measure the distance
to all of those blocks

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.650
and weight it by the population.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.640
And minimizing for that score
is how I identify a locality.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.990
A locality will be a relatively
high-density population area

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.750
surrounded by a more
sparse area around it

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.020
in a typical town,
city arrangement.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.600
And that's all I'm
optimizing for.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:09.480
Just compact localities, and
no political or demographic

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.280
information.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.040
You can look at the demographic
information, though.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.620
The census provides
lots of race-

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.250
and income-based demographics.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.180
And one of the big questions
is, the Voting Rights

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.340
Act used to specify
that there would

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.220
be a certain kind of
gerrymandering for good.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.860
There shall be,
in certain states,

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.980
a majority minority
district to make sure

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:40.140
you get a black congressman
from Georgia, for example.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:45.870
And my system does not try to
make those, but in a few states

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.470
it winds up with them
anyway, just because of where

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.130
people are self-sorting into
where they choose to live.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.730
So that's still an open question
about how we do this, though.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.110
The details are a heuristic
hill-climbing search.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:08.010
I can talk to you more about
that if you're really curious.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.160
This is one run through the data
of getting a little bit better,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.360
a little bit better, as
it's searching for a better

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.690
solution.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.350
So that's the short, short
version of gerrymandering

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:24.150
and what you can do to
make an impartial map.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.750
There's one other big fix that
I'd like to see in our system,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.170
and that is when we actually
go to vote for people,

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.540
we can do better.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.350
You should never, ever
again, if at all possible,

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.960
pick just one
person on a ballot.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.050
You all know the problem
of being told, oh,

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.170
don't vote for them, you're
throwing your vote away.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.290
It's a two-party system.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.800
You have to vote for one of us.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.530
But we can do better.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.150
Once upon a time,
a mathematician

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.330
proved that if you only
have one choice, that's

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.580
only enough information to
pick between two choices.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.900
If you only get to mark
one person on your ballot,

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.000
it will devolve to
a two-party system.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.800
So let's do better.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.670
Let's rank our choices, first,
second, third, and so on,

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.990
or rate them on some scale,
like a five-star scale,

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.650
or A through F letter
grading, or minus 10 to 10.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.490
Or even just approve,
disapprove on each candidate

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:28.140
gives you better results
than picking one.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.730
But this is just data.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.640
If you can say something
about every candidate,

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.470
you're not throwing
your vote away.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.870
You have said something
about every candidate.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.210
You said, yes, I like
this one, and this one's

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.532
OK, and that one--
no, no, not them.

00:10:41.532 --> 00:10:42.990
And if you don't
get your favorite,

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.030
you might get your
second favorite.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:49.740
So you can vote for the weird,
obscure, idealistic candidate

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.410
who just really gets
you moving, and then you

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.640
can have your second choice,
yeah, popular, mediocre,

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.770
or whatever.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.800
And then, if it's
just not your year,

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.540
and you don't get
any of them, you

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.150
can keep ranking
your vote on down,

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:07.470
and maybe you can help the other
party elect a moderate instead

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.280
of their crazy person.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.480
So ranked choice voting is good.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.020
But there are many algorithms
to count these ballots,

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.170
and they all have trade-offs.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.750
There was a famous
theorem that proved

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:26.490
you can't have a perfect system
based on some set of qualities

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:28.740
that all sound good,
and it was proven

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.650
you can't have all of those
qualities at the same time.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.525
But you can still have
a pretty good system.

00:11:33.525 --> 00:11:35.400
You can still have a
better system, and maybe

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.600
a best system.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.870
And our current system
is the worst system

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.720
aside from actual tyranny.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.720
So here's one algorithm.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.100
Instant runoff voting.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.780
So you have a rankings ballot.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.630
You count up all the
first choice votes.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.680
If someone has a simple
majority, great, they win.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.160
Otherwise, whoever has the
fewest first choice votes,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.750
you disqualify them.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:01.350
And all of those ballots, well,
let's count their second choice

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.610
vote now.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:07.160
And this repeats, disqualifying
until finally somebody wins.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.350
Very simple system.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.300
It was used in
Burlington, Vermont,

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.150
for a couple mayoral elections.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:18.190
And after you filter out
the lesser candidates,

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:23.440
here are just the dramatic
finish of that election, where

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.680
people are getting
disqualified one by one,

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.702
and then finally
you have a winner.

00:12:28.702 --> 00:12:30.160
One thing you can
see about this is

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.420
the vote counts for the
eventual winners keep going up.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.650
As Dan Smith's candidate's
votes are disqualified,

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.260
well, they had a second choice
of one of the other candidates.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.320
So those counts go up.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.600
As Andy Montroll
is disqualified,

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.780
the other counts go up as
those votes are transferred.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.040
Another algorithm.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.090
Condorcet method,
or Con-dor-say.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.260
A French mathematician
from 100 years ago.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.690
I like to think of this
as a virtual round robin

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.320
tournament, where the match
score between each candidate

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.780
is how many people
like A higher than B

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.390
versus how many people
like B higher than A.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.190
And that's the score
of them, and if more

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.760
people like A higher than
B than like B more than A,

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.720
then A should win.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.610
A has defeated B. A ranked vote
says, I like A higher than B,

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.770
and A higher than C,
and A higher than D,

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.570
and I also like B higher than C.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.280
So you have
information about all

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.970
of these hypothetical pairings,
and you can count it up,

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.300
and the result looks
something like this.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.360
This count says that
from the same Burlington,

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.940
Vermont election data--

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.430
they published the
full anonymized vote

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:44.780
set, which is really useful
for research like this.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:49.090
This count says that 4,067
people liked Andy Montroll

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:53.830
better than Bob Kiss,
and 3,477 people

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.680
liked Bob Kiss better
than Andy Montroll.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.120
And 4,500 people liked
Andy more than Kurt or Dan.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.000
b is different.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.690
This is a different outcome
than the instant runoff voting

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:05.830
election.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:09.190
This is saying more
people like Andy Montroll

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.260
than Bob Kiss or Kurt Wright.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.970
But the previous election was
that Bob Kiss wound up winning.

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:17.710
How did this happen?

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:23.680
Andy Montroll had a huge support
at the second choice level.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:29.290
Kurt Wright and Bob Kiss had
really fanatic fans, but not

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.780
so many of them in the end.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:37.330
So Andy Montroll might have
been the centrist candidate that

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.190
made a lot of
people pretty happy,

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:44.320
but he wasn't the first choice,
and instant runoff voting only

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.600
looks at the first choice,
whereas a virtual round robin

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.820
election looks at all
of the data at once.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:58.270
So just from a perspective of
navigating the solution space,

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.060
Condorcet is a better algorithm.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.510
And it requires exactly
the same inputs.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.480
A rankings ballot, first,
second, third, and so on.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.850
Instant runoff voting was
used in Burlington, Vermont

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.750
twice and then repealed,
because they wound up really

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:17.980
not liking the guy it
elected on the second try.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.040
And they could have had
a different outcome.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.020
The algorithm matters.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.770
In this age of search
engines and news feeds,

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.000
the algorithm matters.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.920
You have a big pile
of data, but then

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.640
what do you actually do with it?

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.980
And one more thing out
there is that if you're

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.260
picking more than
one person, there's

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.840
an even more powerful
thing you can do.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.780
Proportional representation
is the notion

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:48.910
that if you're electing a city
council or a state legislature,

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.510
if 20% of the people show up
in some constituency and vote

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.900
for whatever their
favorite cause is, then

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.410
20% of the seats
of the legislature

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.140
should go to that
20% group of people.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.390
That's proportional
representation.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:08.590
And there's an algorithm called
single transferable vote, which

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:12.070
is used to achieve just
that in the Cambridge City

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:16.840
Council and a few
parliaments around the world,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.920
like the Irish Senate.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.060
And they're trying
it out in Australia.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:25.180
And I think this is a really
powerful hack on democracy,

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:31.370
because what if you had a state
legislature that was not--

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:35.680
if it was 40 people, and it
wasn't 21 Democrats and 19

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.510
Republicans, it was 13
Democrats, 12 Republicans,

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.310
five Greens, three Libertarians,
and, I don't know, that guy.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.840
That would be a much
more interesting

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.080
and vibrant and
representative democracy.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.180
This is about representing us.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.240
All of this is about
representing us,

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.970
whether we are people
who live in an area

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.810
and might have common concerns,
like, you live near Boston.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:06.490
You probably want the T to run.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.230
Or you live near Amherst.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:12.040
You want-- well, I don't know
what they want in Amherst.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.990
And that's part of the problem.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:18.010
Or you can have the
ideological representation

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:21.910
of a proportional representation
system, where you get together

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:26.470
and say, we all really care
about preserving our parks

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.870
and open spaces
and green spaces.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.420
And if 10% of the people
show up and vote for that,

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.090
then they are going to get a
couple of seats that are just

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.890
really going to push
for that and introduce

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.410
new legislation around that and
build coalitions around that.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:44.440
So these are what I think
are the most important hacks

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.690
that we can do to
improve our continuing

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.700
democratic experiment.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.483
Thank you.

00:17:49.483 --> 00:17:56.878
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:56.878 --> 00:17:57.864
Questions?

00:18:01.674 --> 00:18:03.840
AUDIENCE: I was just curious
what your thoughts were

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.840
on approval voting, where
you choose which candidates

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.640
you like and which
you don't like,

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.354
and then whoever gets
the most acceptance wins.

00:18:11.354 --> 00:18:13.770
Which is a little simplier
than some of the other systems,

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.120
but still usually gets
pretty good results,

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.045
from what I've seen.

00:18:16.045 --> 00:18:17.100
BRIAN OLSON: Yes.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.450
It is definitely simpler.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.322
It definitely gives
pretty good results.

00:18:21.322 --> 00:18:23.280
Another thing I've done
that I didn't show here

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.240
is run simulations on
millions of simulated voters.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.430
It's a model.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:30.720
It's maybe not the best model.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.600
But it shows that, yes,
approval is pretty good.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.610
I just find it
unsatisfying personally.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:40.470
I want to say, I like this
guy better than this guy.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:44.250
And so I would prefer a
rankings or a ratings ballot.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.560
But yes, approval
is pretty good.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.700
And if it's the matter of, if
you're just designing a survey

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.820
form, if you can just
switch from radio buttons

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.000
to checkboxes, that's all you
need to do to get better data.

00:18:59.952 --> 00:19:00.880
AUDIENCE: Hi, Brian.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.007
Thank you.

00:19:02.007 --> 00:19:03.590
First of all, I
wanted to say that I'm

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.050
on the board of an organization
called Voter Choice

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.360
Massachusetts, where we're
advancing ranked choice

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.770
voting here in Massachusetts.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:13.740
And I have a sign-up sheet,
if anybody wants to sign up.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.356
We have legislation
and other things.

00:19:18.356 --> 00:19:19.730
I do want to
respond a little bit

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.960
to the criticism of the
instant runoff algorithm.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.202
You bring up Burlington,
and Burlington's not

00:19:26.202 --> 00:19:27.410
the only city that's used it.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.270
Currently, 11 cities
in the United States

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.240
use that form of
ranked choice voting.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.030
And there's been over
150 elections since 2004

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.830
using that version.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:40.970
The Burlington 2009
election is the only one

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.470
where the instant runoff result
has differed from the Condorcet

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.440
result. So in practice,
it seems to be

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.075
a very, very rare outcome.

00:19:50.075 --> 00:19:53.150
So that's one comment
I wanted to make.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.400
And the other thing is that
I'm a little bit concerned

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.050
with the Condorcet
algorithm about some

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:01.130
of the strategic manipulations
that it is vulnerable to.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.200
For example, two front-runners.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.690
If you insincerely rank your
formidable opponent last,

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.400
that can benefit you.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.230
Or bullet voting
your first choice

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.960
and not deciding to rank
the rest of the choices

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.420
can benefit that first
choice, can benefit

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.160
that favorite candidate.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.490
And those are certain
strategic vulnerabilities

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.541
that the instant runoff
version is immune to,

00:20:25.541 --> 00:20:27.290
and I think that's
part of the reason it's

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:31.610
been successful in being
implemented across the country.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:35.600
And most recently, Maine became
the first state in the nation

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.800
to enact it--

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.660
historic first state nation to
enact it for statewide offices.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.060
So that's my commentary on this.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.260
BRIAN OLSON: I look forward
to the Maine experiment.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.760
I wish them well.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.770
I hope they release
full data so that we

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.550
can analyze it properly.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.580
And yes, it's true that most
of the time instant runoff

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.430
voting and Condorcet agree.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:00.710
My argument is that
for no additional cost,

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:04.250
you can get a better choice
when they don't agree.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.630
The strategic concerns?

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:12.740
There's what is sometimes called
the favorite betrayal problem

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.690
of, you have your favorite, and
so you really want them to win,

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.400
so you vote for them first.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.090
And then you vote for
your second favorite,

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:27.500
but if it hadn't been for that
vote for that second favorite,

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.630
your favorite would have won.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.960
And instant runoff
voting doesn't do that,

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.900
because it doesn't look
at your second favorite.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:42.830
But I think that's a flawed
analysis, because it's not just

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:43.650
all about you.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.910
It's also about what
can we all agree on.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:51.610
Your second choice is
also pretty good, I hope.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.280
And so if you say, well,
this is pretty good,

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.950
and it makes the rest
of the group also happy,

00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.195
that should be an OK outcome.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:06.260
And if you are voting
dishonestly and saying,

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:11.960
yes, I want Hillary
first and Bernie last,

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.760
then you are shooting
yourself in the foot.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.420
Don't do that.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.440
Please don't do that.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.860
Please just vote honestly
and say I like Hillary first

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.310
and Bernie second, or I like
Bernie first and Hillary

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:26.510
second, or I like Winona
LaDuke first and whatever else,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.520
and then Hillary
and then Bernie.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:34.040
Just vote honestly, and if
we implement a good system,

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.040
it will do the right thing
with that honest vote.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.172
So that's what I would
say, is vote honestly.

00:22:41.172 --> 00:22:42.630
If you don't get
your first choice,

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.004
you might get your
second choice,

00:22:44.004 --> 00:22:47.455
and that should
still be pretty good.

00:22:47.455 --> 00:22:51.160
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about policy.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.650
I forgot about Maine, and I'm
really excited that Maine is

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.350
moving to ranked choice voting.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.380
But in general, with both
gerrymandering and things

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.920
like ranked choice
voting, I notice

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.320
that generally the
people in charge

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.680
of making the change
to better systems

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.290
are the people in
power, who probably

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.540
stand to benefit the least.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.940
If you want to keep control
of the two-party system

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.470
because it works
fairly well for you

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.350
and it works fairly well for
Democrats and Republicans,

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.900
you probably aren't
excited to hear

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.330
about these exciting
new plans to help

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.240
get third-party candidates or
vote for multiple candidates,

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.690
rather than being forced to pick
between the two major parties.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:34.570
So I was wondering if
you could speak to--

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.730
in spite of that,
what I perceive

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.370
as an obstacle,
what people can do

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:43.810
to keep this conversation going
and keep progress growing.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:44.800
BRIAN OLSON: Right.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.390
Getting it through the
traditional legislative process

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:50.250
is--

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.000
there is an obvious
conflict of interest

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.930
between people who won via
the old system versus enacting

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.880
a new system.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.630
And so I believe that most
of the time it gets in,

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.670
it gets in via
ballot initiative.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.239
Direct democracy.

00:24:05.239 --> 00:24:07.280
People put something on
the ballot, they vote it,

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.830
it becomes law.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:12.610
That's what happened in Maine
and several other places.

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:14.710
Even in the Burlington
City Council.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.780
The Burlington
mayoral election was

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.060
something that was
voted on, a proposition

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.730
that was locally voted on
directly by the people,

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:23.200
in and out.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.080
AUDIENCE: This is kind of a
similar comment or question,

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.410
but with gerrymandering
in particular,

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.380
I think as you
mentioned, there's

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:40.750
a lot of incentive for
people to keep doing it.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:45.430
And I can see relinquishing
all the control to a computer

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:47.920
might be hard, or an algorithm.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.500
What are your
thoughts on proposals

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.550
of just limiting
the amount of damage

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:56.080
that gerrymandering can do?

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.480
One thing that I've
seen or suggested

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.670
is, you've got n
districts, you can

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.820
draw n minus 1 straight
line segments on the map,

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.504
or some other--

00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:08.170
because right now,
like you say, there's

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:12.160
just contiguousness of a space.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.880
But you could have some
aspect ratio or something

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.910
like that that constrains
the problem such

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:22.330
that there is
still some control,

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:26.740
but hopefully not as ridiculous
as some of these maps

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:27.340
you've shown.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.440
BRIAN OLSON: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.760
One of the ways that this
is going through my work

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.020
and through others is
computational accountability

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.640
of gerrymandering.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.230
There was recent
work out of Illinois

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:44.800
where they just simulated
hundreds of thousands

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.040
of plausible maps and then
analyzed the current map

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.950
and saying, is this
outcome likely,

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.980
or is this outcome
unlikely, and therefore

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.779
evidence of malfeasance.

00:25:56.779 --> 00:25:58.195
So that's an
interesting approach.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.370
So in passing laws
one state at a time,

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.060
there's a unilateral
disarmament problem,

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.390
where if a blue state
gives up its gerrymander,

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.330
and a red state keeps
its gerrymander, then

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:15.910
the Congress is distorted.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:20.170
So we need something that
can be applied everywhere.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:25.210
And in that strategic
vein, I know one person

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:29.500
who's advocating computational
accountability and court

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:34.030
challenges, because
the ACLU and the League

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.220
of Women Voters and
Common Cause can

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.010
go into a state that
has gerrymandered

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:43.180
and sue them to get
it un-gerrymandered.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.910
And you can apply a
national lawyering dollars

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.240
to fix a local problem.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.725
And there's a certain
logic to that strategy.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:05.040
Also, giving up the pen entirely
and letting a computer do it

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.100
fully automatically,
obviously we'll

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:13.830
have missed some opportunities
that a good person looking

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.600
at a map would do.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.840
Someone who really
understands Massachusetts

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.290
could draw lines to say, oh,
these people go together,

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.330
because reasons.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.700
This is actually a
community of interest.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.710
These people will actually
identify together.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:35.940
But the problem is, we have very
few of those people actually

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.010
drawing lines.

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.940
I believe Iowa has had a pretty
good independent commission

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:46.000
model for redistricting
for several decades,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.280
and it's worked pretty well.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.620
They also only have
four congresspeople,

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.780
so there's not a whole lot
of wiggle room to play with.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:57.390
But versus Alaska,
at last I checked,

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:59.370
their state
legislature maps have

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:03.663
been subject to court challenge
every decade since statehood.

00:28:07.527 --> 00:28:11.160
AUDIENCE: I had a quick
comment about strategic voting,

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.990
because it came up.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:17.040
So everyone mentioned that
for no single member district

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.185
is it--

00:28:18.185 --> 00:28:20.310
there's no voting system
that completely eliminates

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.220
strategic voting, even
in instant runoff,

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.370
because of that situation
where who your first choice is

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:29.790
matters, in terms of whether
a candidate who was otherwise

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:32.370
widely acceptable can get
eliminated in the first round.

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:36.960
There is some incentive
to strategically vote

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.550
for who your first
choice is, even

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.140
with instant runoff voting.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:45.360
There's analysis I saw
which showed ratings,

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:50.640
or approval voting
does have less ability

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.530
to vote strategically,
and certainly even

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:57.420
instant runoff voting still is
much lower than single-member.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.090
But I believe from
what I've read,

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.062
if you have multi-member
districts, that largely gets

00:29:03.062 --> 00:29:04.270
[INAUDIBLE] strategic voting.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.300
So I wasn't sure if you
had thoughts on that.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.050
BRIAN OLSON: Yeah.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.430
That gets into proportional
representation.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:13.140
So if you're electing five
or more people at once,

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.810
then you want to vote
for who you really want,

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:20.340
and you're more
likely to get them,

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.850
because you will be voting
as part of some coalition,

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:24.750
most likely.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.320
You will be voting with the
Dems or Greens or Libertarians

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:36.500
or Republicans or the Nature
Conservancy or the gun lobby.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.250
You will be voting with
some group on the issue,

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:42.510
and so you will get
something, most likely,

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:44.910
in a proportional
representation scheme.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:51.780
So it's a pressure release
valve for the pressure

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.130
of electing one person.

00:29:55.947 --> 00:29:58.030
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the
talk and for all the work

00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:59.470
you're doing.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:03.160
So I have a point, and then
a comment and a question,

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.560
I guess.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.697
So my comment is, you'd
mentioned just earlier,

00:30:06.697 --> 00:30:08.530
in response to one of
your earlier questions

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:12.680
about how voters shouldn't
try to game the system,

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.680
for instance, depending
on the algorithm being

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.930
used for ranked choice voting.

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:21.580
Vote for your
sincere intentions,

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.580
not some strategized,
clever hacking

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:28.540
of that, of whatever the
specific algorithm is.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.540
So I guess the issue
that I have in general,

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.340
having followed
politics for a while

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:37.600
and been very frustrated with
how dysfunctional government

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.180
and electoral processes are and
all that, and the unfairness

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.596
or bias in the system, and the
gaming of the system and so

00:30:42.596 --> 00:30:49.900
on, is that it seems like
underneath it all, this very

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.360
human, subjective problem.

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.930
And at the other
end of the spectrum

00:30:55.930 --> 00:31:01.720
is objective ways of approaching
it, like you're framing here.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.320
Just have an algorithm, which
is blind to these various

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.790
subjective factors.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.820
But then at the end of
the day, as you point out,

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:14.470
voters and politicians are going
to know about the underlying

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:19.990
objective system, and if
their mindset is diabolical,

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:23.310
they're going to find ways
of subverting the system.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.300
Which maybe speaks
to, well, some systems

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.910
are just more difficult
to game than others.

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:29.920
But humans are very
clever, and we're always

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.730
going to find ways, if we have
bad intentions, of undermining

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:37.780
the system or getting our
result even if it's not really

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.250
borne out in the majority of
the population, for instance.

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:43.600
So this is just a
commentary about,

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.330
even with all these objective
measures, there's always

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:51.291
going to be that desire, if
there's kind of bad intentions

00:31:51.291 --> 00:31:51.790
out there.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:53.830
So this gets me
thinking about, how

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:58.600
do we actually minimize the
impact of those bad intentions

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:03.515
by promoting healthier mindsets
toward our self-governance

00:32:03.515 --> 00:32:04.390
and things like that?

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.907
It isn't diametrically
opposed to what you're doing.

00:32:06.907 --> 00:32:07.990
There is a relation there.

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:09.906
If you want to speak to
that, that'd be great.

00:32:09.906 --> 00:32:12.940
But also, my
follow-up question is,

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:22.060
have you looked into producing
egregious examples of--

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:27.730
if you turned your
algorithm evil,

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:32.140
how bad can you make it to
perhaps maybe shine a light on,

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.870
this is how bad the situation--
if you wanted to really

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:39.220
be strategic about undermining
democratic principles

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:43.900
and majority government and
minority representation, here's

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.810
how you could do it,
and this is how awful

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:50.560
and how distasteful
it would be, if you

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.930
were better at trying to
gerrymander than you currently

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:54.180
are?

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:58.450
Might that help people shine a
light on how bad it could be?

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.540
BRIAN OLSON: So to answer
your second point first,

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.710
the data that I
would want for that

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:06.730
would be recent
precinct-by-precinct election

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.200
data for a general election.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.360
A governor, a
senator, a president.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.050
And then I would map those
precinct data back out

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:18.880
onto the world and
say, OK, how do

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.930
I cut this up so that I
get the most of my party

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:26.620
winning and the fewest of
the other party winning?

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:30.740
And the problem is, that data
is really hard to come by.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.170
It's different state-by-state.

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:34.720
Sometimes it's different
county-by-county.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.335
They don't just hand it
out, except to the parties.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.430
I was very familiar with the
law when I lived in California.

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:50.230
The parties just get that data.

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:52.330
If you are a major
party in California,

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:56.530
you get a copy of the
address of every registered

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:57.370
voter in the state.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.290
You've been talking to the
elections officials, the county

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:07.750
clerk and whatnot, for decades.

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.542
And you can just
show up and say, hey,

00:34:10.542 --> 00:34:12.250
can I have a data dump
from last Tuesday?

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:13.666
And they're like,
yeah, all right.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:22.150
There is a very small,
nascent distributed network

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:24.610
of people trying to
gather that data,

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:28.989
and they have a handful of
states for a handful of years.

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:30.460
And it's just hard to come by.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.219
AUDIENCE: That's just an issue
of just getting enough people

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:35.677
aggregating all this data from
all the different districts?

00:34:35.677 --> 00:34:37.780
BRIAN OLSON: Yeah.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:43.540
Back on the first choice
around psychology and voting,

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.870
it is my sincere hope
that a better system

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:50.500
will open up people to thinking
about the system differently.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.679
You know right now that
if you vote for Nader,

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:55.719
he's not going to win.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.790
But sometimes you do
anyway, because you

00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.590
hope it sends a
message, or you're just

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:03.160
being idealistic or whatever.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.280
And I kind of applaud
that idealism.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.930
I just want to say, OK, but
do you have a second choice?

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:14.980
And that would
improve the outcome.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:19.285
Or, OK, you really
like Trump, but do

00:35:19.285 --> 00:35:22.270
you have a second choice?

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:27.400
What could have happened in the
most recent Republican primary

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.140
if you had it sorted
out differently?

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:35.620
And because there were
15 different candidates

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:37.810
at some point that
were considered viable

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:42.460
at some level, that could have
gone in any which direction.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.710
And speaking of could
have gone in any which

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:48.910
direction, the French
presidential election.

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:52.480
This year less so,
but back in 2002,

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.280
they had a very close election.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.970
The first round election
had people coming

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:02.770
in at 23%, 21%, 15%, 13%, 10%.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.740
And this is in a
pick one ballot.

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.550
But all those people who
voted for the top two,

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.470
then they had a top two runoff.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:16.720
And the second choice candidate
was the elder Monsieur Le

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:21.550
Pen, who got 20% in
the first round and 20%

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:23.830
in the second round,
because he was out there

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.560
and he had his die-hard
followers and nobody else.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.360
And everyone else
said, OK, I guess

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.198
we vote for the boring guy.

00:36:31.198 --> 00:36:33.850
AUDIENCE: And I wonder with--

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:36.370
if that was the new
established system,

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:40.840
if given current
hyper-partisan, very tribal,

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.750
divided electorate, that
even in the primaries

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:49.450
it gets kind of micro-tribal,
where given that environment,

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:53.050
it would just descend
into, OK, in the primaries,

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:57.190
vote Trump first, Cruz last,
or Hillary first, Bernie last.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:58.930
Make up for that--

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:01.000
you want to recover
that kind of tribal--

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:01.927
BRIAN OLSON: Right.

00:37:01.927 --> 00:37:03.010
AUDIENCE: You can do that.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:04.010
SPEAKER: I hope not.

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:07.720
And I hope that having
these things actually run

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.090
and looking at actual
data will bear out

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:12.550
that, yeah, probably a
few people will do that,

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:17.680
but if you're sending a message,
you should send a message of,

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:21.700
this is what I really
like, and this will do,

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:26.140
and this is not so bad,
this is really bad.

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.450
Just actually send that message.

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:30.470
And if we have a good
election algorithm,

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:32.360
a good result will come out.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.569
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:34.569 --> 00:37:35.110
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:38.740
A question about your
redistricting algorithm.

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:45.340
Why did you choose average
distance to the center

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.211
as the thing to maximize for?

00:37:48.211 --> 00:37:49.210
Are there other options?

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:50.950
What other types of
things did you look at?

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:51.700
BRIAN OLSON: Sure.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:56.560
There are dozens of proposed
measures of what is generally

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.450
called compactness.

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:03.000
The opposite of compactness
is the sprawling tendrils

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.620
of tentacled monster districts.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.960
So there are lots
of ways of measuring

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.550
what a compact district is.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:12.280
A lot of them are
purely geometrical.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.620
The length of the perimeter
around the district.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:18.490
The ratio of the area of
the district to the area

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:22.420
of the smallest enclosing
circle of the district.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:24.860
And these kinds of things.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:28.450
But what these purely
geometrical measures don't do

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:31.300
is, they don't tell you
anything about the distribution

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.580
of the people
inside the district.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.640
So imagine, if you will, a
perfectly circular district.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.410
This is perfectly compact.

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:40.860
What if it is
perfectly circular,

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.640
but there is a huge
city off on one edge,

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.720
and then rural
areas out from it?

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:50.800
That is perhaps not the ideal
of having a perfectly circular

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.620
district that is just
a bull's eye on a city,

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.900
that it's representing
that city and metro area.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.390
So that's what I
wanted to do, is

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.570
by measuring the
distribution of the people,

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:05.560
how far away are the people from
the center of their district?

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:09.492
How tightly packed
are the people?

00:39:09.492 --> 00:39:11.200
So that's what I really
wanted to measure

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.740
in designing my measure.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:17.470
There are still some variations.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:19.460
I'm still looking
into other things.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.230
One thing I'm doing is
I'm measuring the land

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:26.860
area of the district and finding
the center of the land area,

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.780
and measuring the
distance to people.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.960
Maybe I should just completely
forget about land entirely

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.660
and measure the population
center of the district,

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:38.200
and measure the distance
from people to people.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.950
And on even-numbered
days, I believe in one,

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:43.280
and odd numbers the other.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.456
But I implemented this one,
and I think it's pretty good.

00:39:46.456 --> 00:39:49.554
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:49.554 --> 00:39:51.100
AUDIENCE: I think
to some extent,

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:56.160
you need to consider natural
boundaries and transportation

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.150
and things like that.

00:39:57.150 --> 00:40:00.840
But that wasn't what I was
going to comment about.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.000
At the end of your
prepared remarks--

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.640
I think you briefly
touched on this--

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.940
I found it dissatisfying
that states

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:12.730
with bicameral legislatures
have two bodies, each

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:16.830
of whose members are allocated
based on arbitrary geographic

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:18.026
boundaries.

00:40:18.026 --> 00:40:19.650
And I was wondering
why they don't just

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.530
make one of the bodies
at- large seating

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:24.832
with preferential balloting
or something like that.

00:40:24.832 --> 00:40:26.560
BRIAN OLSON: Yes,
I would love that.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:31.290
For every bicameral legislature,
take the smaller one

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:37.260
and maybe run it in
two off-cycle sessions.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:42.810
If you have a state
legislature of 40 people

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:44.860
with four-year terms,
run it in two sessions,

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.130
so you're electing 20
people every two years

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:48.630
at large across the whole state.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:50.220
Proportional representation.

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:53.070
I would love that.

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:55.809
If anyone wants to write up
a constitutional amendment

00:40:55.809 --> 00:40:56.850
for a state, let's do it.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.700
AUDIENCE: So I
have two questions.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:06.580
The first was, you
had mentioned things

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:10.690
about partial representation
or transferable vote.

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:13.360
And the US system
is traditionally

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:18.230
very much region-oriented
electoral process.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:21.880
And I guess the first
question is, how do you

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.336
balance these two objectives?

00:41:25.336 --> 00:41:28.090
BRIAN OLSON:
Basically, in spending

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:32.590
15 years studying districting,
the most unexpected thing

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:36.460
that I discovered is that people
don't actually want districts.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.750
They don't actually care
about local representation

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:44.524
nearly as much as they do about
ideological representation.

00:41:44.524 --> 00:41:45.940
I mean, that is
especially true in

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.610
the current political climate.

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:51.430
There are times when
having a local rep

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:53.140
is still awfully
handy, and people

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.320
will identify with a local
representative, which

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.400
is why in a bicameral system,
I would have one of each.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.410
I would have a districted
local representative

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:07.150
and the at-large proportional
ideological representative.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:11.650
And there's a current
court case in Wisconsin

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:16.690
that I think is sitting
with SCOTUS right now that

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:21.100
is putting this to the
test of, will Wisconsin

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:25.090
be required to gerrymander
for both parties?

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:29.110
Will it be required to achieve
proportional representation

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:34.570
by district, saying, OK,
this state is 60% Republican

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:36.160
and 40% Democrat.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.980
We should make sure that our
state legislature and our US

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.560
House seats break
in the same way,

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:45.070
even if that means that 49%
of people in every district

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:46.870
are unhappy?

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:49.390
Whereas if you had a
proportional system,

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:52.210
you're not in a district,
and you might still

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:57.730
have some representative
that you feel affinity for?

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:02.380
So yeah, I see people trying
to achieve proportionality

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.630
through districting,
and I find that to be

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:06.190
a terribly awkward fit.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:07.690
And I think what
they actually want

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:11.290
is a more direct proportional
system, if we could just

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:14.050
figure out a way to
broach the subject

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:18.015
and start down that reform path.

00:43:18.015 --> 00:43:20.140
AUDIENCE: The second question
I had is a little bit

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.800
orthogonal to the talk.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:26.770
But it used to be that
the Senate and the US

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:30.400
elected representatives were
elected by state legislatures,

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.607
rather than directly
from the people.

00:43:33.607 --> 00:43:35.440
And this, I think, was
viewed as a mechanism

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:42.245
to squash short-term passions.

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:48.770
My question is, what do you
think about these tiered voting

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:50.726
systems?

00:43:50.726 --> 00:43:53.810
BRIAN OLSON: There is
definitely a rationale

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:58.250
for a hierarchical system,
where each layer elects

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:00.770
the layer above it.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:02.570
You get network effects.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.630
Every layer has its own--

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:06.620
what's that guy?

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:14.900
The number, 150-- so if there's
only so many relationships

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.080
that you can carry
on as a human, then

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:24.700
every layer mimics
that star topology.

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:27.920
And I think that can make sense.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.945
Direct democracy has its place.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:34.340
So let's take the president.

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:37.790
Right now, we have a
fake direct election

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:41.180
And every four years,
this frustrates me,

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:44.240
and I wish we had either
a real direct election

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.790
with an actual
national popular vote,

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:48.800
or we would quit
faking it and just

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.810
let the state
legislature decide,

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:54.710
and we would have more of
a parliamentary system.

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:59.840
And we have this one
national vote that

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.940
can get thrown out sometimes?

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:03.200
What's up with that?

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:08.420
So I think we should either
have real hierarchical systems

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.130
or real direct systems.

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:12.551
And there's a place for each.

00:45:12.551 --> 00:45:14.220
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.130
AUDIENCE: On your
redistricting algorithm,

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:17.780
you talked a lot
about compactness

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.420
was there anything about
trying to keep the districts

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.174
of near-equal population?

00:45:22.174 --> 00:45:23.090
BRIAN OLSON: Oh, yeah.

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:25.080
They are all with
equal population

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.560
to within half a percent.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:31.730
Current maps sometimes
get it down to exactly 1%,

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:34.450
and they're doing funny
business to achieve that.

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:36.920
So I didn't bother keeping
myself to that strategy.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:40.490
So I'm just keeping it
to within half a percent

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:43.710
variance between districts.

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:46.130
The traditional
requirements of districts

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:52.060
are equal population and
contiguous, and that's it.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:55.790
And at various court
decisions, they

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:59.540
refused to put any other
restrictions on it,

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.250
and therefore the
state legislature

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:04.772
does whatever partisan
hackery they want.

00:46:04.772 --> 00:46:05.930
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:09.800
There's recently some news
coverage about research

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.004
into a partisan efficiency gap.

00:46:12.004 --> 00:46:13.670
Have you been following
that, and do you

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:18.700
have hope that that might
help swing districts away

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:19.640
from gerrymandering?

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.020
BRIAN OLSON: Yeah.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.230
This came up again about
the recent Wisconsin case.

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:29.150
And it is following that
line of logic I believe

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:33.200
leads to shoddy proportionality
through districting where

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.050
we say, we will make
the districts such

00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:41.660
that this 60-40 state turns out
with 60-40 end representatives,

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.730
which in some ways
would be an improvement

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:50.660
over the current system where
you have a 48-52% state that

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:54.920
winds up being a 60-40
representation because

00:46:54.920 --> 00:47:00.260
of gerrymandering, really
pushing it that extra gap.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:07.260
So in the balance of
power way, it's better.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.840
But in terms of actually
representing people,

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:10.520
I'm not sure.

00:47:14.747 --> 00:47:17.080
AUDIENCE: This is a little
bit of an out-there question,

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:23.400
but have you looked at using
your redistricting algorithm,

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:26.070
or a redistricting
algorithm, for things

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:27.480
other than districts?

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:33.510
Like the states, or the
Balkans, or other places

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:36.759
that have somewhat
arbitrary lines.

00:47:36.759 --> 00:47:37.800
What does that look like?

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:44.070
BRIAN OLSON: It's
on my to-do list of,

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:46.590
well, what if we
redistricted the Senate?

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:49.500
Because the US
Senate is nonsensical

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.620
in its current implementation.

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:57.840
I believe it made
sense in 1790, when

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:01.440
the states had an
option of being actually

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:05.250
independent mini-nationalities.

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:08.220
We could have Rhode Island
hanging out with Luxembourg,

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:11.560
and they'd be on equal footing.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:15.085
But I don't think it
makes sense anymore.

00:48:15.085 --> 00:48:17.910
I would love to see
the US Senate replaced

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:20.250
with an at-large
proportional body

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:24.610
with 33 people elected
every two years.

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:26.310
That would be
really interesting,

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.110
to have a national
Senate election.

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:32.970
But we should probably
try it on a state level

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:37.440
first, because the states are
the laboratories of democracy.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.490
AUDIENCE: Thanks

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:42.100
AUDIENCE: In your packing
and cracking slides,

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:46.000
you showed how to
push a 60/40 populace

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.520
to one end or the other.

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:52.370
Do you have measurements on
how your system approximates

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:57.310
representational voting in all
the states and other algorithms

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:58.045
as well?

00:48:58.045 --> 00:48:59.710
BRIAN OLSON: That
goes back to, I

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:02.740
would need to get the partisan
election data in order

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.580
to do that kind of modeling.

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:12.290
So I have the census's
built-in racial demographics

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:13.700
for my districts.

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:17.650
So I can tell you, yes, I make
two majority black districts

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:18.640
in Georgia.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:22.930
But as for party breakdown,
I don't have that data.

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:24.460
AUDIENCE: So
another ramification

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:27.910
of gerrymandering-- by
creating safe seats, you end up

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:31.780
getting more radical or
extreme people elected

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:35.140
than reflects the population
as a whole, as we've seen.

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:38.980
So while getting closer
to proportionality

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:43.289
through districting may seem
unsatisfactory at some level,

00:49:43.289 --> 00:49:45.580
it would also have the effect
of a different population

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.590
of elected representatives,
a much more representative

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:49.900
and a moderate one.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.240
So that seems like a
highly desirable outcome.

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:56.470
I think coupled with probably
the most pragmatic solution

00:49:56.470 --> 00:50:00.340
to these gerrymandering problems
is the judicial solution,

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.730
and the fact that big data
does allow us to actually

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:06.745
score these gerrymandering
districts now,

00:50:06.745 --> 00:50:11.500
and to impose requirements that
districting schemes do obey

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:18.310
some computational fairness,
which not only gets us closer--

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:21.040
yes, less perfectly
satisfactory, but closer

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:26.554
to representational, and
therefore more elected

00:50:26.554 --> 00:50:27.220
representatives.

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:30.469
That seems like a
double goodness.

00:50:30.469 --> 00:50:31.510
How does that strike you?

00:50:36.622 --> 00:50:37.690
BRIAN OLSON: Yeah.

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:39.670
We definitely have a
problem with safe seats.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.650
I worked a campaign when
I lived in California.

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:47.890
I was briefly the
volunteer webmaster

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:52.330
for a congressional
campaign for a few months.

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:53.380
Let me say that again.

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:59.080
I was the volunteer webmaster
for a congressional campaign.

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:03.250
Because they were
running in a district

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:06.400
that was gerrymandered
against them.

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:11.320
For many years, California
had a bipartisan gerrymander,

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:15.040
where everybody on both
sides had a safe seat.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:20.260
And so our party did
not send any help.

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:22.750
They figured we
were a lost cause.

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:26.020
And their candidate
would not even

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:28.390
agree to show up
for any debates.

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:32.680
They did not deign to partake
in the democratic process,

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.180
because they didn't have to.

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.580
They had a safe seat.

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:40.390
And there are lots of
sociological analysis

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:44.830
to be done in saying, oh, all
these safe seat politicians

00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:47.590
are now more extremist,
because some of them

00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:50.530
have had primary challenges
from the extreme wing

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:51.490
of their party.

00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:54.700
And those are the most motivated
people who actually get out

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:55.570
during a primary.

00:51:55.570 --> 00:52:00.420
So we're representing
2% of the people.

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:02.877
2% of the people show
up, vote in a primary,

00:52:02.877 --> 00:52:03.710
and that's who wins.

00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:11.570
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that hierarchical voting

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:13.955
schemes and direct democracy
each had their place.

00:52:13.955 --> 00:52:15.830
I wondered if you could
say a little bit more

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:19.870
about which places are more
appropriate for which method.

00:52:22.702 --> 00:52:26.210
BRIAN OLSON: Well, maybe this is
part of the checks and balances

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:28.010
system of our government.

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:32.450
We have a state legislature
that is elected from pretty

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:34.310
small local districts.

00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:38.330
In Massachusetts, some of our
districts are 30,000-something

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:40.160
people.

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:44.090
And then we also have a governor
who is voted on by everyone.

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:47.630
So you have that
play right there.

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:49.370
You have the direct
democracy of,

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:53.139
everyone votes and gets one
representative for everyone,

00:52:53.139 --> 00:52:55.430
and everyone votes and gets
their local representative,

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:58.760
who work together in the
milieu of the state House

00:52:58.760 --> 00:52:59.510
to do their thing.

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:07.590
And I don't think
we would ever be

00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:12.510
happy with a fully hierarchical
system, because we would then

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:15.820
lose touch with people
a few levels up,

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:18.630
and we would see them doing
things, and we would say,

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:20.642
ah, they don't represent us.

00:53:20.642 --> 00:53:22.725
AUDIENCE: So what you're
saying is you want a mix.

00:53:22.725 --> 00:53:23.560
BRIAN OLSON: Yes.

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.074
AUDIENCE: For these things,
you want this reason.

00:53:26.074 --> 00:53:26.990
You want some of each.

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:28.080
BRIAN OLSON: Yes.

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:32.630
[APPLAUSE]
