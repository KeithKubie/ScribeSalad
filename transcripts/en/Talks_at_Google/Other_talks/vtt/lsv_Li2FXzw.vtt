00:00:05.313 --> 00:00:06.762
OWEN: Welcome.

00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:09.177
I'd like to welcome to
Google Ralph Simpson.

00:00:09.177 --> 00:00:13.041
Ralph is a 30-plus year
veteran of technology industry,

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:14.510
recently retired.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.474
He volunteers at
History San Jose

00:00:17.474 --> 00:00:20.342
and is an avid collector
of cipher machines,

00:00:20.342 --> 00:00:22.732
has probably a couple
dozen cipher machines

00:00:22.732 --> 00:00:23.688
in his collection.

00:00:23.688 --> 00:00:25.122
And he's agreed
to come here today

00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:26.622
to tell us about
his Enigma machine.

00:00:26.622 --> 00:00:30.314
And he's going to be demoing it
and also letting people come up

00:00:30.314 --> 00:00:31.924
and play it with
afterwards, I guess.

00:00:31.924 --> 00:00:32.757
RALPH SIMPSON: Sure.

00:00:32.757 --> 00:00:34.822
OWEN: And so welcome, Ralph.

00:00:34.822 --> 00:00:39.372
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:41.080
RALPH SIMPSON: Thank
you very much, Owen.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.980
It's a real pleasure and an
honor for me to be here today.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.170
I really appreciate the time
that you are providing here

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.880
for me.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.940
To be able to speak at a Google
Tech Talk is quite an honor.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.180
And I really look forward to it.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.490
This little machine here is not
only of great interest to me,

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.580
I think it also reflects
a huge historical value,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.090
both in terms of what it
meant in World War II,

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.770
as well as what it
led to afterwards,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.240
because in breaking the
code during World War II,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.660
basically the Allies had to
come up with modern computing.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.250
And you could argue that the
computer revolution, Silicon

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.830
Valley, and even Google
here has its roots back

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.150
to this little humble
typewriter in a wooden box.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.000
And so what I'd
like to do today is

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.850
go through that early history,
the technology of the machine,

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.266
and, let's see--
the early history,

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.390
the technology the machine.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.820
I'll do a demonstration
as Owen mentioned.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.620
And then I want to talk about
the significance of this

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.180
to World War II and how the
Allies actually broke the code

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.500
and how that led to
modern computing.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.990
Now there's at the
end a calculation

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.330
of the key length
of the Enigma, which

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.050
I will not have
time to go through.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.010
But it's there.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.320
It doesn't take a lot of math.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.986
And it is enlightening,
so I'd encourage

00:02:07.986 --> 00:02:11.990
you to use that as an
exercise with a reader.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.200
It's really quite interesting.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.730
So if you take a look at what
drove the need for something

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.280
like an Enigma
machine, it actually

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.260
started in World War I because
of the proliferation of radios

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.180
for the first time in warfare.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.320
And that was a huge advantage.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.580
But after the war,
the Germans were

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.350
horrified to find out
that all of their messages

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.480
were being read.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.150
And it wasn't just the Germans.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.140
Every single message
was being read.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.830
And part of the
reason is that if you

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.550
look at the types of cipher
devices that were available,

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.470
they were really made for
a different environment.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.160
They were made in order to send
a message, a written message,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.730
by courier or in some
other fashion where

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.120
it wasn't on a radio.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.680
As soon as you're talking about
having hundreds or thousands

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.770
of messages on a radio
with the same code,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.570
that can easily be broken.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.520
Letter frequency
analysis, you identify

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.240
which letters are the most
frequent in the first letter

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.900
of each message, the second
letter, the third letter.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.080
And generally you
can break these codes

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.350
in minutes, not hours.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.890
And I brought a few examples.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.570
You see on the left here,
it's called a Vigenere wheel.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.950
This one was used by
the Confederate Army.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.645
It was invented in
the 1400s, so this

00:03:36.645 --> 00:03:38.340
has been around a long time.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.640
Here is a life-size
replica of that wheel.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.940
There's only five in existence,
so I had to get a replica.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.670
But it's a very simple device.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.180
You can see there's the
alphabet in two wheels here.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.490
You just use a code
word and spin this

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.540
and come up with a new
algorithm for each code word.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.760
Unfortunately, this
is easily broken.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.600
And in fact, the North broke
the Confederate Vigenere wheel

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.210
regularly.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.290
I mean, it was-- the South only
used three different code words

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.540
all during the war,
so it was quite easy

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.589
for them to break it.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:20.070
And that's despite the fact that
"Scientific American" magazine

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.289
in 1917 said this
device was unbreakable.

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.330
Shows you what they know.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.530
Here's another example.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.570
Now, this one came out
just after World War I.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.940
But it was used by the Army
up through World War II.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.470
This was invented by
the US Army in 1922.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.160
And you can see each of these
are separate wheels that

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.630
have the alphabet in a
different configuration

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.010
around the outside.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.960
And the way it's
used is you just

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.460
write your message in
25 lines across this.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.480
And then you spin this wheel
around and pick any other line

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.530
to send as your gibberish.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.619
And then the receiver
would print out

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:05.160
that gibberish and then would
have to search around the wheel

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.920
to see something that looks
like normal English or German

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.430
or whatever your language is.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.780
But it was also
found in 1922, just

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.990
by coincidence in Thomas
Jefferson's papers,

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.820
that actually he invented this.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.060
I'm talking about
our second president.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.640
He invented this device.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.650
And his had 36
wheels instead of 25.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.475
But he described it exactly.

00:05:28.475 --> 00:05:30.100
And they actually
have an example of it

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.430
at the NSA Museum in
Fort Meade, Maryland,

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.807
where you can take a look at it.

00:05:35.807 --> 00:05:37.390
By the way, if you
have any questions,

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.932
feel free to ask me
as I go through this.

00:05:40.932 --> 00:05:42.390
Another thing I
wanted to show you,

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.670
I talked about this Vigenere
wheel and it's from the 1400s.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.540
That doesn't mean
that it ended there.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.060
Here is a US version
of that Vigenere wheel

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.150
that was used in
the Vietnam War.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.680
Vietnam.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.290
And what you do is you take
this little thing down.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:06.140
You attach a little
cassette tape to it.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.580
And then the cassette tape,
by spinning this around,

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.920
will put a different
Morse code on the tape.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.510
You can take this off and
then connect it to a radio.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.580
And it would send it in a
blast mode very quickly.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.450
But it's using the
Vigenere wheel.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.060
Now you may ask,
why in the world

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.920
would we use this in Vietnam
when obviously there's

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.110
much better technologies,
this one can be broken?

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.890
Well, in battlefield
conditions, this is very fast.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.380
It's easy to do.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.160
And if you only need to confuse
the enemy for an hour or two,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.836
this works.

00:06:39.836 --> 00:06:45.080
If it's more than
that, it's not good.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.240
Now I wanted to show you
one other, or a couple more.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.450
Another one is a simple book.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.740
This is a code book from 1988.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.584
It's called "Commercial
Cryptograph."

00:06:56.584 --> 00:06:59.000
There were military versions
of these types of code books.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.160
But it has words
and phrases written

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.280
on one side, other words and
numbers written on the other.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.100
And so you all you have to do
is just make up your message,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.470
look up the words, and send
other words or other numbers.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.200
And that's how you send a code.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.810
This has also been in
use since the 1400s.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.550
And this is
relatively effective.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.560
The problem is, as soon as
it's broken by losing a book,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.820
you're dead in the water.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.740
And to then send out books to
thousands of army locations

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.740
is just untenable.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.160
So it was typically used
more for diplomatic locations

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.820
and high commands
and things like that.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.470
And the last one I'll show
you is another US Army one,

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.180
just to show you what was used
by the US Army in World War II

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.190
to compare it to
the Enigma machine.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:58.450
The Enigma machine
is a 26-pound device.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:07:59.410
It's a typewriter.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.670
You press on a key,
a light lights up.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.520
Somebody has to write it down.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.190
That somebody is usually
a second operator,

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.290
so that they can go fast.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.240
This device is a little
bit different than that.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.725
You can see there
are six wheels.

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:14.730
It uses a whole
different technology.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.110
There is no battery,
no electricity.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:23.110
And actually it performs an XOR
exclusive or operation in this.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.880
And then it prints
out the results.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.660
And it can cipher and decipher
just with the switch of a key

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.550
here.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.780
So it's very handy,
smaller, easier to carry.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.409
No batteries needed.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:40.400
But not as effective, and
not as cryptologically strong

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.640
as the Enigma machine.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.290
So this one was used, again,
as a battlefield cipher.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.780
It was typically broken by the
Germans in a couple of hours.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.900
OK.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.510
So let me go on.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.830
What I wanted to show you was
kind of the background of what

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.200
environment was in place
when the Enigma machine was

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.850
invented, and why there was
a need for something that

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.360
was stronger, that
could work better

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.614
than what was in
existence at the time.

00:09:07.614 --> 00:09:09.280
And it turns out that
the Enigma machine

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.450
wasn't the only
rotor-based cipher machine.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.800
Now, what was unique
about the Enigma

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.560
machine and these other
rotor-based cipher

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.420
machines is the rotor itself.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.260
This is the Enigma rotor.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:26.250
And as you can see, it has
these little pin connectors.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.480
There's 26 of them,
representing all the letters

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.760
of the alphabet.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.170
On the other side
is the connectors.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.350
And what it has
in the middle are

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.860
wires that will connect one
letter to a different letter.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.380
So an A may be connected
to a G in this rotor,

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.600
but the A may be connected
to a B in one of the others.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.480
They're all wired differently.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.550
And so this is the
key innovation,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.930
which maybe doesn't
sound all that great.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.790
But at the time this was huge,
because when you put three

00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:03.690
in a row, that means that the
letter is changed three times.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.800
And actually in the Enigma,
there's a reflector.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.009
So it goes through.

00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:08.550
And then it goes
through a reflector.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.010
It's changed again and then
gets changed three more times.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:16.360
So this was quite an effective
way to encipher messages.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.730
The other thing was that
it made it very easy.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.230
If you notice on
some of the others,

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.720
it's a very manual
process, error-prone, a lot

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.000
of fiddling around.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.730
Here, you just type
on a typewriter.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.010
Much less room for error.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.210
So that was the innovation.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.579
Now, it turns out that the
Enigma wasn't the only one that

00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:37.120
was invented in this
same time frame.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.230
Like I said, World
War I showed the need.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.072
And so this was invented
around the world.

00:10:42.072 --> 00:10:43.530
There are four
different countries,

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.610
four different inventors
all within a few years

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.140
came up with this
same rotor concept.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.070
And the first inventor was
here in the US, Edward Hebern.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:57.070
He was actually in jail for
stealing a horse in 1915.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.760
And he said he came up with
the idea while he was in jail.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.410
And when he got out, he came
up with a really nifty-looking

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:04.800
device.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.110
He didn't make a lot
of those, although he

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.380
did get a million dollars
worth of investment money.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.660
He built a huge manufacturing
plant in Oakland

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.227
that was going to
house 1,500 workers.

00:11:17.227 --> 00:11:19.060
And after making a
couple of dozen machines,

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.010
he went bankrupt.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.630
And then he got thrown in jail
again for stock manipulation,

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:27.300
so that one went by the wayside.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.510
Then we have the Enigma machine.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.100
Now, that Enigma
machine you can see

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.680
is different than the one
that's sitting before you.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.160
That was the first version.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.590
It weighed 110 pounds.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.320
And not a lot of those sold.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.430
It was very cumbersome to use.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.060
And then by the mid
'20s, he came up

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.040
with this version, which
is a 26-pound device.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:55.280
And it got accepted by
the German military.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.610
Hugo Koch in Holland
came up with a design.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:02.290
He actually developed some
prototypes in the lab.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:06.350
But they didn't work very
well, so he never really

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.430
was able to sell
these commercially.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:12.540
And Arvid Damm is
an interesting guy.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.650
He came up with a
device and sold some.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:22.120
And in fact, the guy that bought
him out was named Hagelin.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.410
Hagelin formed a company
called Crypto AG.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.900
And the first big sale he had
was this device right here.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.600
He sold 140,000 of these
to the US government,

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.384
which allowed him
then after the War

00:12:35.384 --> 00:12:40.110
to sell these around the world,
or a follow-on version of that.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.910
And he ended up selling
to 130 countries,

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.920
their military, diplomats.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.900
It was used everywhere.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.190
What wasn't known
was that the NSA

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:54.470
had a sweetheart deal with
them and had a back door.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:58.170
So this story of the NSA
goes way back, right?

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.620
This is from the '50s.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.440
And that back door
existed for about 40 years

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.860
before it was unearthed
by Iran in 1999.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.920
So there's a whole history here.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.020
I could do a whole nother
Tech Talk on Hagelin.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.450
But I have to go on.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:18.660
And as you can see on
the next slide, what

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.710
I want to talk about now
is the Enigma machine.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.020
Now, the Enigma was
invented, as you can see,

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:29.960
by Arthur Scherbius. w And Hugo
Koch was the other inventor

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.580
that I said never
got off the ground.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.980
His device was too intermittent
and didn't work well.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.670
But in 1927, Scherbius
did a strange thing.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.225
He bought the rights
to Koch's patent.

00:13:43.225 --> 00:13:44.725
Now, the reason I
say that's strange

00:13:44.725 --> 00:13:47.390
is Scherbius had
the earlier patent.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.950
And it turns out they
were identical patents.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.250
So why would he buy this right?

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:54.600
It was never really understood.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.690
It was kind of a
mystery, until 2003.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:03.420
So here again in the story
of ciphering, a lot of times

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.630
we find things out after the
fact, sometimes decades or even

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.450
hundreds of years
after the fact.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.620
And here what we found out was
that the rotor-based cipher

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.230
machine was not invented
by these four gentleman

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.740
that I showed you earlier.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.130
We have to rewrite history.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.910
It was actually invented by
two Dutch Naval officers.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.840
They built a machine in 1915.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.470
And that machine worked.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.690
They showed it to
the Dutch Navy.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.920
And this was at
World War I time.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.090
They decided to squelch it.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.480
And they would not
allow these two Naval

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.730
officers to patent that device.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.400
And it just so happens
that the patent attorney

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.520
that these Dutch
Naval officers hired

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.620
was the brother-in-law
of Hugo Koch.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.170
What a coincidence.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:48.120
And it turns out also
that Hugo Koch and Arthur

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.500
Scherbius were collaborators.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.170
So they worked together
in stealing the patent

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:54.730
and coming up with the Enigma.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:59.670
And I think that Scherbius
felt a little bit

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.640
like he owed
something to Hugo Koch

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.660
and gave him a little bit of
money to buy out his patent.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.430
So that's the story
behind Hugo Koch.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.097
So after all of this
and all the stories

00:15:09.097 --> 00:15:10.638
you're going to read
about Hugo Koch,

00:15:10.638 --> 00:15:12.440
it turns out it's
these two Dutch Naval

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.890
officers that invented
the Enigma machine.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:15.390
Yes?

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.640
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
idea who the two Dutch Naval

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.380
officers are?

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:18.690
RALPH SIMPSON: Yeah.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:19.190
Yeah.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.820
The question is, who are the
two Dutch Naval officers?

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.150
I don't know a lot about them.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.220
I do know their names.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.095
It's Theo van Hengel.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.330
And the other one
is RPC Stengler.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.007
Those are the two
Dutch Naval officers.

00:15:34.007 --> 00:15:35.840
There's not a lot of
information about them.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.940
But they were the
ones that invented it.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:42.890
They were tasked to invent it,
basically, by the Dutch Navy.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.650
And when they did,
the Dutch Navy

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:48.070
didn't want it out
for some reason.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.170
It's also interesting
that they happened

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:54.170
to release that
requirement that they not

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.560
publish this or
get a patent on it.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.060
But Hugo Koch came
out with his patent

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.320
just two weeks
before that release.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.460
And so it was too late.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.480
So here is a picture of it.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.350
And you can see it
in front of you here.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:16.600
This is a typewriter
type device.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:24.000
The innovation is these rotors
that messes up the alphabet.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.110
And the other thing
that I should mention

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:28.710
is that the way
this works is when

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:33.610
you press a key-- and
this key does two things.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.260
It advances the rotors
mechanically, not electrically.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.750
And it sets up an
electrical signal

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.040
that goes through
first the plug board--

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.800
and I'll discuss each of these
pieces more in just a minute.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.710
But it first goes
through the plug board.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.350
Then it goes through
each of the three rotors.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.440
It goes through a
reflector, reflecting back

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.890
through the three rotors,
back to the plug board.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.850
And then it lights up a light.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:02.750
So it does create quite
a different algorithm,

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.210
because that rotor will advance
every time you push a key.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.589
And it advances odometer style,
with the right one advancing

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:14.099
once each time you press, the
next one advancing every 26

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.329
times, and so forth.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.720
So that's the way
this thing works.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.290
I'll go through
each of the pieces

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.690
here, just so you have a good
sense for what this is all

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.440
about.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.360
I really like the way that
they put this together.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.470
It's 26 pounds.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:31.610
It's very heavy.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:36.260
But this thing is definite
German engineering.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.640
It's heavy duty, very well made.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.080
You can see the keys are
made of stainless steel.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.680
This is over a
70-year-old device.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.880
I've done nothing to it.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.520
And it works right
out of the box.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.160
And I haven't had
to do anything to it

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.430
other than put a little
bit of oil on it.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.630
And it works to this day.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:18:01.930
And you can tell it's very
strongly made, because it does

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.030
have to advance some
pretty heavy rotors.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.810
So in other words, you
can't touch-type on this.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.580
You have to push down
one letter at a time.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.471
And it takes a bit of effort.

00:18:12.471 --> 00:18:13.970
The other thing I
should mention is,

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:17.430
you'll notice that
there's only 26 keys.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.210
There's no special characters,
no numbers, anything else,

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.490
no space bar.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.890
So they don't allow that
in the cipher message.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.650
You have to write
out the numbers.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:32.850
They did allow an X
for a sentence stop.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.570
And basically, they ran
all the words together,

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.070
because you don't
want to give hints

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.470
on where the spaces or the
spacing of words could be.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.190
So that's the way that works.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.410
If you go to the next
element here-- so

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:53.040
I'm going to go through the way
that the electrical signal will

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:53.540
go.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.450
So next is the plug board.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:56.950
Now, as you can
see, the plug board

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.580
is in the same format
as the typewriter keys.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:04.600
And the bulbs will be
in the same format.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.030
It's a QWERTZ format,
not a QWERTY format.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:11.560
And basically what this does
is you attach one letter

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.800
to another.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.290
So if you were to
press-- for instance,

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:18.589
here you can see
that I've got a Q

00:19:18.589 --> 00:19:19.880
and it's attached to something.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.840
Let's call it the O. So
if you press a Q here,

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.920
it's going to
transfer that to an O

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.660
before it goes to the rotors.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:27.210
OK?

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.190
That's all it does.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.760
And coming back, if
it comes back as an O,

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.540
it'll change it to a
Q. That's all it does.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.790
This was something that
Scherbius did not design.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:45.230
So Scherbius designed all of
this sans this plug board.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.990
And it turns out that the plug
board added more cryptological

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.510
strength than all the rest of
the machine combined, which

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:52.510
is very interesting.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.330
So the military added that.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.860
And they only used
it for the military.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:59.739
They continued to sell a
commercial version of this

00:19:59.739 --> 00:20:02.030
to other countries that did
not include the plug board.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.080
OK.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.560
And here is a picture
of the rotors.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.060
And I think I showed
you these already.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.600
One thing I don't
think I mentioned

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.660
was there's a little notch here.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.050
This notch can be moved to
any of the 26 characters.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.760
And what that notch does is,
when it's in the machine,

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.910
it sets the point for when
the next rotor to the left

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.120
will advance.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:26.924
Yes?

00:20:26.924 --> 00:20:29.344
AUDIENCE: I noticed that
not all the plug board

00:20:29.344 --> 00:20:30.970
connections had connections.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.220
What happens when you don't
have the letter connected?

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.053
RALPH SIMPSON: Yeah.

00:20:34.053 --> 00:20:36.151
When it's not connected,
it basically bypasses.

00:20:36.151 --> 00:20:36.650
Oh.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:38.880
The question is that
not all the plug board

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.960
connections had a cable in it.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.850
And that was done on purpose.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:49.430
And so if a letter was not
plugged, let's say a B,

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:54.130
the B just went straight
through without any change.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:54.630
OK.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.590
And so this is the rotors.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.800
You can see a couple
of facts about these.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.230
I have three of them here.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:06.950
But in a general Army
Enigma situation,

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.270
they would have
five to select from.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.800
And each day they would
have to change them.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.340
And therefore, you can have five
in one position, any of five,

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:20.150
four, three, 60 different
combinations of rotors in this.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:23.530
You can also set this
on any of 26 letters.

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:24.660
And there's three of them.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.590
So it's 26 cubed.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:30.530
And the notch can be set
on any of 26 positions.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.980
But only the right
two rotors matter.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.870
The left rotor isn't
going to move anything.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:39.040
So that gives you a sense
for the key strength

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.120
of just the rotors.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.440
It's actually not a big number.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.730
In the Naval version of the
Enigma, they had four rotors.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:49.700
So that gave them
a little bit more.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.070
And they also could select
from eight, instead of five,

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.460
so that also gave them
a greater strength.

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:03.660
Next that I want to talk
about is the reflector itself.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.560
The reflector is this
item here that you

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.730
see with the big
red B on it, just

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.530
to the left of the three rotors.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.350
And what that does is
it takes the signal

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:15.860
from the leftmost rotor and it
swaps it for another letter.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.780
And so it works much
like the plug board,

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.620
but with all the
letters plugged.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.560
So if for instance
you come in as an A

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:30.290
and it was enciphered to a G,
if you came in to this reflector

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.970
with a G, it would come
out enciphered as an A.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.210
And the reason for
that is this allows

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:39.170
you to encipher and decipher
with the same code settings.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.840
Very handy.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.530
Ease of use was all-important
on a battlefield,

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.590
so this made it very easy.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:50.660
Also, this became
a very big home

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.050
in the design of the
Enigma, because what

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.590
it meant was no letter
could encipher to itself.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.920
And so keep that in mind
as I go through this,

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.140
because that was a big hole.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.290
But I think the
Germans felt that this

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.670
was important to be able
to encipher and decipher

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:10.510
without having to change
keys or change settings.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:13.530
And so they left it that way.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.580
All right.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.940
So the last section I
wanted to show you on this

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.980
is the lamp board.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.660
The lamp board actually
has a small little light

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.300
underneath each of the
letters, so when you press down

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.510
on a key, a light lights up.

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:29.640
It seems very simple.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.190
But it goes through this
tremendous calculation

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.280
of changing letters.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.680
And the other thing
I should mention

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.415
is that there is
a battery in this.

00:23:40.415 --> 00:23:43.940
It's a square, fairly large 4
1/2 volt battery that was used

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.730
in World War II.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:49.360
I've replaced it with
two AA batteries,

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.470
which is only 3 volts.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.880
But it seems to work fine.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.420
And also you can attach
this to a 220 volt

00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.240
plug, which was a
European power supply.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.110
And so it works-- with
just a flip of the switch

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.610
you can attach it to that.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:08.220
Or you can attach it to a
transformer they also had.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.950
So there was multiple
ways to do this.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.660
Within the lid here, you see
a couple of other things.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.510
There are some spare plug
cables for the plug board.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.590
There are some
spare light bulbs,

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.050
in case you have a
burned-out light.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:25.290
Interestingly, I've had this
machine for about 12 years.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.130
And I've never had a
light burn out yet.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.394
Yes?

00:24:29.394 --> 00:24:32.035
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:32.035 --> 00:24:33.280
RALPH SIMPSON: To test what?

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.550
AUDIENCE: To test
all the lights.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.341
RALPH SIMPSON: Yes.

00:24:35.341 --> 00:24:36.250
Yes.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.420
That's a good question.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.064
So the question is, is there
a way to the test lights,

00:24:40.064 --> 00:24:41.980
rather than just trying
it, because how do you

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.430
know if the light's out, right?

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.040
Well, they thought of
that, believe it or not.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.120
So if you look
inside here, there's

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:54.420
a little empty plug here
that's written in German.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.250
But it's basically a test plug.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.602
You just put the light in there.

00:24:58.602 --> 00:24:59.810
And if it lights up it works.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.900
If it doesn't, it's dead
and you throw it away.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:06.840
And so they thought
of those things too.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.350
OK.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:16.270
Oh, and also I have in
here a little light filter.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:19.790
It's really just
a tinted plastic.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.035
And what this is used for is
when you're in direct sunlight,

00:25:23.035 --> 00:25:26.070
it's sometimes hard to
see the light light up.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:32.000
And so when you put this in
here and cover the lights,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.290
it actually shows up
a little bit better.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:37.510
And you can read these.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:40.770
Now, I'm going to leave this
in place, because when we film,

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:43.080
it turns out you can see
the letters light up better

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.250
even on video this way.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.590
And then here is a
description of how

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.055
to take care of the machine.

00:25:51.055 --> 00:25:53.140
It tells you about
how to oil it,

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.550
how to sand the
little rotor fingers,

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.680
and what you need to do
to keep it operational.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.215
So here's the wiring diagram.

00:26:08.215 --> 00:26:10.090
I've already really gone
through all of this.

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.250
But this will just
show you an example

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.090
if you hit the H key
what it goes through.

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:17.020
And each of these
numbers represents

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.390
a change of characters.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.330
So if you hit the H
key and the H cable

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:25.390
is plugged over to the O,
as you see, it changes.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:27.810
That's the first
change of letters.

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.560
And then it goes through
the three rotors,

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.820
where it's changed.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.870
It goes through the reflector,
back through the three rotors,

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:36.290
and back through the plug board.

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:39.050
So it could be changed nine
times, seven times, or eight

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.740
times, but at least seven
times for every hit of the key.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.350
And every time you
push a key, you're

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:47.020
going to get a different
transformation.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:51.770
So that is the strength
of the Enigma machine.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:55.770
So I said I wasn't going to
go through the calculation

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.560
of the key length of the Enigma.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.380
But I want to
mention what it is.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.760
The Enigma has a
theoretical maximum number

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.690
of settings of 3
times 10 to the 114th.

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:07.740
The math is at the back.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.620
You can read it.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.300
But that's far more
than the number

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.330
of atoms in the universe.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.310
And for this crowd,
I have to say

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:19.686
it's also 300 trillion
times more than a google.

00:27:19.686 --> 00:27:23.020
So it's quite a large number.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.010
Now, the Germans weren't able
to achieve that, actually,

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:28.240
because it would've taken
rooms full of rotors

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.560
and other inconveniences.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.140
So the way they used it
with just five rotors,

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.700
the way they used the plug board
and so forth, what they saw

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.812
was 10 to the 23rd, which
before the days of computers

00:27:41.812 --> 00:27:43.520
is nothing to sneeze
at, let me tell you.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:48.490
10 to the 23rd is still
equivalent to a 7y-bit key,

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:52.300
which if you compare that with
the original DES standard which

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:58.120
was used up until this century,
it's much better than that.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.680
But let's compare it to
what they were expecting.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.120
There were no computers.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.020
They were expecting
brute force, manual type

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.700
of breaking of the key.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:11.860
And to break a key that has 10
to the 23rd as its key length,

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:16.180
it would take 100,000 operators
each checking a different key

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:20.280
every second 24 by 7 for
twice the age of universe

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.380
to break this machine.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.090
So I think they felt
pretty safe that this

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:29.100
was a safe machine for them.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.410
And by all rights,
it should have been.

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:35.530
But let's talk about
how the Germans actually

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:38.270
used this Enigma.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.730
First of all, they
had a daily key.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.950
And the daily key, I think
I've already hinted at,

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:46.360
there were five rotors.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:50.670
They had to select three and
put them in a specific order.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.670
That was the first set of keys.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:58.670
Then they had to change the
notch setting for two of them.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.600
That is another key.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.820
They had to change the
plug board settings.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.420
Then they had to
place the rotors

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.840
in a particular configuration.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.830
Once they set that, they're
able to send a message.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:13.610
But they didn't just
code in a message.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:16.380
And the reason is, if you
have hundreds or thousands

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:20.200
of messages all going with the
same key, that could easily

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.090
be broken.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:24.220
Letter frequency analysis
again will tell you

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.680
what's the most frequent
letter of the first of each

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.890
of these messages, the second
letter in each message,

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:30.850
and so forth.

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:32.420
It would be quickly broken.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.670
So what they had
them do was they

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:38.890
had them send a
new rotor setting.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:42.460
And they were told
specifically to make it random.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.820
And unfortunately,
what would happen

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.759
with the German operators
is they got lazy.

00:29:48.759 --> 00:29:50.300
And they would just
use three letters

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.680
in a row, or three
columns in a row,

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.020
or sometimes their
girlfriend's initials.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:00.490
In fact, one operator had
a girlfriend named Cil.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:06.160
And the British called this
type of breaking of code cillies

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.180
because it was so frequent.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.410
I mean, he typically
used that every day.

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:14.382
And so we could count on
him to help break codes.

00:30:14.382 --> 00:30:16.090
Now, another thing
that they did was they

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.900
sent that three-letter
new code twice.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.660
And the reason for
that was they're

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.010
sending this by
Morse code, by radio.

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.360
And sometimes that
would get garbled.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.860
And they would want
to send it twice

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.521
to make sure that it
was received correctly.

00:30:31.521 --> 00:30:32.520
So that's what they did.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.560
They would send that twice.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:40.350
And it turns out that that
slight problem that they

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.250
created, or that
slight shortcoming

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:45.020
was exploited by the Polish.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.820
And they were able
to break the code.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.610
So now what I'd like
to do is give you

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:52.630
a demonstration
of this if I can.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:58.180
I hope you can see enough that
I can explain this to you.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.564
OK.

00:31:00.564 --> 00:31:02.480
So like I said, the first
thing you have to do

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.570
is set up these rotors
in a particular format.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.965
And so I've set it up.

00:31:07.965 --> 00:31:10.530
I've got it written
down here, in fact.

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:13.830
and I will put this in
the message clip holder,

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.420
just as the Germans would have.

00:31:19.021 --> 00:31:19.520
OK.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.160
So this is my cheat sheet.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:26.610
So the rotor order is going
to be 3, 1, 2 in my example.

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:30.520
Here's Rotor 1-- I mean 3.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.880
And here's 1, so that's next.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.040
And then 2.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.640
And so that's going
left to right.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.694
That's the order.

00:31:36.694 --> 00:31:37.860
You put this on the spindle.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:47.930
And you kind of
press it together.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:54.520
And you put it in this-- you
put it in the machine like this.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.510
And it's in there.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:04.600
Now the other thing we had
to do that I will assume I've

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.620
already done this is set the
notches in the right locations.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.120
OK.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.450
Now this is in.

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:11.580
And I can screw this down.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.090
The next thing I have to
do is put these rotors

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:16.360
on a particular setting.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.890
And the setting that
they sent me for today--

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.510
and this is a daily setting, so
I have to do this every day--

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.180
is EJ zero, EJO.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:29.370
So I will set this to
EJO, which by the way

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.390
all these are in numbers here.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:34.769
And EJO is 5, 10 and 20.

00:32:34.769 --> 00:32:37.060
And if I didn't know that,
there's a little cheat sheet

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.960
right here on the lid that
tells me that's 5, 10, and 20.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.940
So it makes it
easy and foolproof.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:48.490
The next thing I have to
do is set the plug boards.

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:51.280
Now the Germans,
interestingly, always used

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.900
10 cables for the plug board.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.780
And you may ask, well,
why don't they use all 13

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.300
and swap all the letters?

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:02.590
Well, it turns out 10 is
better than 13 cryptologically.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:06.140
And in fact, the
cryptologic strength

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:10.430
goes up as you go from
zero cables up to 11.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:11.530
11 gives the most.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.080
And then it drops
off significantly

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.014
when you go to 12 and 13.

00:33:15.014 --> 00:33:16.430
So then the question
is, well, why

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.510
didn't they use 11 then,
if that was stronger?

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:21.360
Or why didn't they vary
the number of cables?

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.711
Here's my theory.

00:33:22.711 --> 00:33:23.210
OK.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:24.350
This is just my own theory.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:27.206
My own theory is they wanted to
use the same number of cables

00:33:27.206 --> 00:33:29.122
so that the cables weren't
laying around extra

00:33:29.122 --> 00:33:31.130
and could get lost.

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:33.930
And the other is,
why 10 instead of 11?

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:36.000
They felt 10 was strong enough.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.990
And it kind of matched their
sensibilities of order.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.920
It's a good round
number, you know?

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.560
And so why not use 10?

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.960
They could send that 10.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.880
It's nice and neat
in their code books.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.310
And that's what they did.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:50.370
And so that's what they
used, is 10 every time.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.860
So let's assume I've
got that all set up.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.430
And now I'm an operator.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:55.390
I'm a German operator.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:56.960
I want to send a message.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.660
So the first thing
I have to do is

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:03.600
I've got it all set up
to the right settings.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.230
And the first thing
I do is I make up

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:08.270
a three-letter new setting.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.949
And being kind of
a bad operator,

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:14.449
I'm going to set it up to
my wife's initials, TES.

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:19.647
So T gives me a
C. Is that right?

00:34:19.647 --> 00:34:20.230
Wait a minute.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:24.361
I've got this-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:34:24.361 --> 00:34:25.610
I had this on the wrong thing.

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:26.949
5, 10, and 15.

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:29.600
So I'm going to type
in T. And that gives me

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:38.820
a Y. E, which gives me an H. And
then S. It gives me a Y again.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:39.320
OK.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.406
Now I have to write
these down, right?

00:34:41.406 --> 00:34:43.239
Now, I've got to do
that again, because as I

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:46.150
said I'm typing in TES twice.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.280
So again T. This
time it gives me

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:54.810
a Z. E gives me a C. And
S this time gives me an E.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:58.590
So those six letters, I have to
write down and send them along

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:00.240
with the message.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.060
But before I encode the message,
I have to set this to the TES,

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.540
right?

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:11.230
So T, if I look on my
cheat sheet here, is 20.

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:14.150
E is 5.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:16.290
And S is 19.

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.500
So now I've set my
machine to 20, 5, 19.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.640
That's TES.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.300
And now I can send my message.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.950
And I'm just going to send
a simple hello message.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:30.760
So I'll type in H. That
gives me an X. E, which

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.430
gives me an O. L gives me a D.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.120
I'm typing in L again.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.300
This time I get a Q.
Notice it's different,

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.850
because it's a different code.

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:44.330
And then O, which gives me an H.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:47.900
Now I've got my message to
send, the six letters which

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.760
is sending the
new setting twice,

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.780
and then the letters of hello.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:56.290
The way I would send this
is in groups of five.

00:35:56.290 --> 00:36:00.370
I would send the message by
Morse code across a radio

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:01.410
usually.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:05.185
And then the receiver
would get this message.

00:36:05.185 --> 00:36:06.810
And the message he
would get would just

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:09.170
be that string of letters
that I just mentioned.

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:12.070
And what he would
do is first set this

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:16.970
to the original
code setting, which

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:25.790
is as I said EJ
zero, 5, 10, and 15.

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:28.909
And he would then decode
the first six letters.

00:36:28.909 --> 00:36:30.700
And I don't know if
you were keeping track.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.210
But I have it written
down just in case.

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:34.950
It starts with YHY.

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:43.290
So if I type in Y I get
a T. H gives me an E.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:46.730
And Y again gives
me an X. That's TES.

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:48.440
That's what I should set it to.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.940
But I'll type in
the next three just

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.880
to verify that I didn't
get some garbled message.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.501
And the next three were ZCE.

00:36:56.501 --> 00:37:00.998
So I'll type in a
Z. And I get at T.

00:37:00.998 --> 00:37:02.450
And I'm sorry.

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:04.680
I'm looking at this
keyboard backwards.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.400
And it's a little bit different.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:12.790
C is an E. And the
last letter was-- CZE.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:13.910
And E is an S.

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:14.550
So it verifies.

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.020
I got TES again.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:20.360
So now I know I need to
set my settings to TES.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:28.250
And when I do that, that's
again I said 20, 5, and 19.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:30.850
Now I can type in the
rest of the message that

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:32.020
was sent to me.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:34.920
And that starts with XODQH.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:40.710
So X gives me an H. O-- oops.

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:41.980
Let me back up a minute.

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.920
I didn't see it.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.230
Well, that should
be a-- trust me.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:50.490
It's an E. It's just not
shining up through this thing

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:51.620
very well.

00:37:51.620 --> 00:38:03.550
XOD-- I think it's, let's see.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:10.410
D. After telling you that this
has worked flawlessly for me,

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:12.950
it seems to be disconnecting.

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:13.450
OK.

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:15.044
There it goes.

00:38:15.044 --> 00:38:17.260
Back up.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:18.470
19.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:24.612
So it started with X.
That's the H. O. Now

00:38:24.612 --> 00:38:25.820
there's something wrong here.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.290
But it worked this morning.

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:29.650
Believe me.

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:32.510
Anyways, you type
in those letters.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:35.990
And you get H-E-L-L-O. And
that's how you would decipher

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.570
the message.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:40.020
Now this seems
rather convoluted.

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.340
In a way, it is.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.300
But comparing this to
previous cipher methods,

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.620
this was more foolproof.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.280
It was a much stronger cipher.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:54.650
And therefore the German
Navy and German Army

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.120
definitely relied on this.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.870
They used this extensively.

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:58.570
Yes?

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.403
AUDIENCE: When they
sent out the daily code,

00:39:00.403 --> 00:39:03.010
did they send it encoded
with the previous day's code?

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:03.760
RALPH SIMPSON: No.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:04.260
No.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.500
The question is, when they
sent out the daily code,

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.040
did they send it encoded
with the previous code?

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.530
That would be one way to do it.

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:13.810
But what they did was they
sent out a book that had 30

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.230
days' worth of
codes written in it.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:19.630
If you were in the
submarine service, though,

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:22.850
you got three months'
worth of these codes.

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:24.900
And so there again,
keep that in mind,

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.630
because that was one of
the shortcomings of this.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:30.640
And by stealing the code
books, you sometimes

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.379
were able to decipher this.

00:39:32.379 --> 00:39:33.795
And I think if
they sent it daily,

00:39:33.795 --> 00:39:36.612
it might have been a
better way to do it.

00:39:36.612 --> 00:39:38.070
AUDIENCE: If you
sent it daily, you

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:41.849
would have been able to decipher
all the codes any time you

00:39:41.849 --> 00:39:42.640
had one day's code.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:42.931
RALPH SIMPSON: Yes.

00:39:42.931 --> 00:39:43.460
That's true.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:43.960
That's true.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.920
If you ever got one day's code,
yeah, that's the other fallacy,

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:47.420
yeah.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:52.400
But the books were sent out
widely to all of the Army units

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.390
that had these.

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.670
And there were tens
of thousands of them.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:58.480
So that was also dangerous.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:03.590
And sometimes the Allies
did steal those code books.

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:04.170
Yes.

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:04.980
Can I go back?

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:09.094
AUDIENCE: Was there a
protocol for stolen code

00:40:09.094 --> 00:40:10.788
books or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:18.590
RALPH SIMPSON: I don't know if
there was a protocol, because I

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:21.570
think this was something
that they did everything

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:23.110
they could to prevent.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:27.260
So for instance on a submarine,
if a submarine was lost at sea

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:32.690
or they were sinking, they
were told to blow it up.

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:35.240
Cipher machines, if the
enemy were approaching

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.930
and they were
going to lose, they

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:39.600
were ordered to destroy the
cipher machines, the code

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.000
books, everything.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.620
The code books for the
boats and the submarines

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.970
were made of a water-dissolvable
type of material.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:52.700
So if it got in the
ocean, it would dissolve.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.010
So there were a lot of
precautions that were taken.

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:59.790
And in fact, I think that
led to some of the reasons

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:03.860
why there are so few Enigma
machines in existence today.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:07.870
A lot of those were
destroyed by the Nazis

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:12.160
as the Allies advanced
on their positions.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.300
OK.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.350
So that's the demonstration.

00:41:20.027 --> 00:41:22.360
I now want to talk about some
of the shortcomings, which

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.250
I've already been hinting at.

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:28.930
You see here a picture of
Panzer General Heinz Guderian.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:32.420
And in the bottom left,
you'll see an Enigma machine.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.170
And it's interesting that
there's an Enigma operator

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:36.030
there.

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.230
And beside him is the
person that would typically

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:42.630
be telling him the message to
decipher and writing it down.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:46.280
And then the third person is the
person that operates the radio

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.250
and sends the Morse
code back and forth.

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:50.370
So this is quite an
elaborate operation.

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:54.280
There's three operators
there to send a message.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:58.270
And in fact, I
would say that one

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:03.030
of the shortcomings of this
machine is that it's so strong.

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:05.680
And so let me elaborate.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.840
The cryptologic strength
of this was so good

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.710
that the Germans never
believed that it was broken,

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:14.640
all throughout the war
and afterwards, even when

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.730
they were presented with
pretty strong evidence

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:19.920
that it was broken
and they were told

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.990
it was broken by their
allies, the Japanese.

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.950
They didn't believe it.

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:27.770
They didn't believe
that it could be broken.

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:30.100
So that was one of
the shortcomings.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.880
Another is this
reflector design.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.530
I mentioned that it
allows for ease of use

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:37.420
by deciphering and
enciphering with the same key.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:40.530
But what it also
did was it made sure

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:43.930
that no letter got
encoded to itself.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:47.180
And one of the ways that the
Allies liked to break codes

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.570
is come up with a crib.

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:53.570
And a crib is what they think
could be included in a message.

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:57.800
And the Germans being very
precise in their language

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.350
and especially in
the military, we

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:03.390
could count on them to use
certain words over and over

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:04.380
in messages.

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.090
And one of them was
a weather report

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:09.440
that went out to the minute
every day in the morning.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:14.270
And the front of it
said weather report.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:18.100
And by using those words,
you can pretty well tell.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.830
You can eliminate a
lot of rotor positions,

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:24.809
because you can't have
one letter coming back

00:43:24.809 --> 00:43:25.600
to the same letter.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.640
So it wouldn't necessarily
tell you the code.

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.950
But it would tell you
which ones to eliminate.

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:35.830
So you don't have the 10 to the
23rd key settings to try out.

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:40.280
The other is that the rotors
had a regular odometer

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.060
motion to them.

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:45.660
Now, it turns out that the US,
besides these 140,000 machines

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.276
which were used in
the battlefield,

00:43:47.276 --> 00:43:48.650
had another machine
that was more

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:51.410
similar to this called a SIGABA.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:54.410
And the difference between
the SIGABA and this

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:59.090
is that it had 10 rotors
to change the letters.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.310
And it had five other
rotors to change

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:05.020
the motion of those 10 rotors.

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.820
And it was irregular.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.640
And so by having an
irregular motion,

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.830
you've just added immensely
to the cryptologic strength.

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:17.220
And in fact, that machine was
never broken by the Germans.

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.900
But anyways, the
odometer movement

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.290
is a problem because
what that means

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:26.710
is you're only changing
one rotor for 26 times.

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:30.900
And then when this one flips,
you go in another 26 times only

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.860
changing that same
fast-moving rotor.

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:38.760
And so the third rotor
actually never moves

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.230
in the entire message.

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:42.750
And the reason is that the
Germans were told never

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:45.700
to send a message more
than 250 characters.

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:49.830
When you do, you go all over
again and send a new setting.

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:55.210
And 250 wouldn't allow
that third rotor to move.

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:58.050
So that was one of the problems.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:01.750
And another is
the lax operations

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:03.860
by some of the
operators, especially

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:08.260
in the Army and the
Air Force, for instance

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:12.230
using girlfriend's initials
and things like that.

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:14.090
Sometimes they
even went so far as

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:18.690
to send a message twice
with different keys,

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:22.840
like they accidentally didn't
reset the keys from yesterday

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.630
and then they sent the same
message with today's key.

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:29.650
That's a huge, huge
problem for anybody

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:31.532
that understands
cryptography that you

00:45:31.532 --> 00:45:35.480
can break into a code that way.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:39.420
So let me ask you, see that
Enigma machine in the corner?

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:40.860
I've blown it up here.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:42.550
Is there anything
unusual that you

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:45.908
can tell about that
Enigma machine?

00:45:45.908 --> 00:45:47.450
Can anybody spot it?

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:48.830
It's not real obvious.

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:49.572
Yes?

00:45:49.572 --> 00:45:50.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:51.875
RALPH SIMPSON: What's that?

00:45:51.875 --> 00:45:52.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.300
RALPH SIMPSON: Yes.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:53.960
Exactly.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.560
It's missing a plug board.

00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.111
So, if you look at
this machine, it's

00:45:58.111 --> 00:45:59.610
actually not missing
the plug board.

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:02.750
They put some white paper
or cardboard or something

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:04.490
over the plug board.

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:08.790
Now this was a picture
taken at World War II.

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:11.744
Why would they cover over
the plug board, you may ask.

00:46:11.744 --> 00:46:12.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:13.413
RALPH SIMPSON: What's that?

00:46:13.413 --> 00:46:14.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:14.410
RALPH SIMPSON: Yeah.

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:15.982
Those changed every day.

00:46:15.982 --> 00:46:16.940
They changed every day.

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:20.720
So it's not a matter of
giving away a secret,

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.970
or not a secret
of the plug board.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:26.430
But I have another
picture of a plug board.

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:29.351
And you can see that
also has that covered.

00:46:29.351 --> 00:46:31.850
I went back and looked at a lot
of different Enigma pictures

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:35.500
from World War II that
came from the Germans.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.730
And they all are
either covered over

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:41.250
or they show it at an angle that
you can't see the plug board.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:44.860
And I think it's because
this was a military edition.

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:47.340
They felt it was
a secret edition.

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.840
And all the other
Enigma machines

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.570
went out without a plug board.

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:52.970
In fact, they also sold
these Enigma machines

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:58.431
to the Italians and the
Japanese sans the plug board.

00:46:58.431 --> 00:46:58.930
Yes?

00:46:58.930 --> 00:46:59.728
Question?

00:46:59.728 --> 00:47:03.072
AUDIENCE: You sure it
wasn't just a wrist strap?

00:47:03.072 --> 00:47:04.780
RALPH SIMPSON: The
question is, am I sure

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.680
it's not a wrist strap.

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.260
Well, if you put this
up, it doesn't really

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.800
provide much of a
wrist rest there,

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.330
because you've got the
wooden board here anyways.

00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:18.030
And on top of that,
you're not touch-typing.

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:20.590
You have to push down
pretty hard on these things.

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:23.410
So I though that
was interesting,

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:26.100
that they felt that this plug
board was important enough

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:27.850
that they kept it
covered in the pictures.

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:28.350
Yes?

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:30.235
AUDIENCE: So a machine
without a plug board

00:47:30.235 --> 00:47:32.205
would not be able
to decode a message

00:47:32.205 --> 00:47:33.580
from a machine
with a plug board?

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:34.630
RALPH SIMPSON: That's right.

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:35.130
Exactly.

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:38.370
So the question is, if it didn't
have a plug board you couldn't

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:41.790
decode a message from a
machine with a plug board.

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:47.200
And that's true, because that
adds a whole different levels.

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.709
Unless you took
out all the plugs.

00:47:48.709 --> 00:47:49.875
Then it would be equivalent.

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.730
OK.

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:57.050
So let's talk about
how the Allies actually

00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:59.320
broke the Enigma code.

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.980
It was broken by the Polish.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:04.820
And I'm sure all of you
have heard the story.

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:08.920
This seemed to be a little
bit kept secret, not secret,

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.396
but people thought
that the British

00:48:10.396 --> 00:48:11.520
are the ones that broke it.

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.290
But actually the Polish did.

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:17.240
And what happened was, in
1932, being between Germany

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:20.800
and Russia, they
were very nervous

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.830
about the military buildup
of these large countries

00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:25.180
on their borders.

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:29.361
And so they were carefully
looking at the messages

00:48:29.361 --> 00:48:30.610
that the Germans were sending.

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:33.412
And they noticed a
difference in 1932.

00:48:33.412 --> 00:48:35.620
And that difference was it
looked like these were not

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.570
being coded with the same cipher
machines that they were using,

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:41.220
or the cipher devices they
were using in the past.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:43.630
And it was some kind
of machine cipher.

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:46.940
They eventually were able to
reverse-engineer an Enigma

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:48.350
machine.

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:50.870
They figured that out
through the commercial Enigma

00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:53.720
and saw that they also had
some kind of other swap,

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:54.890
like the plug board.

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:57.670
And so they
reverse-engineered it.

00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:00.070
And also the Polish
did something else.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:02.260
For the first time
in a cipher bureau,

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.370
they hired mathematicians.

00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:08.240
And Marian Rejewski was
the main mathematician

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.750
that they hired who ended
up breaking the code.

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:14.600
And it turns out
that they actually

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:18.320
could not break the
code even with this.

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.090
First of all, they
only had three people

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:21.561
working on this in Poland.

00:49:21.561 --> 00:49:22.060
OK.

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.610
Three mathematicians.

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:32.250
But in 1933, it turns out
that the French approached

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:37.210
an official in the cipher
bureau by the name of Hans-Thilo

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:39.190
Schmidt.

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:40.970
He got that position
because he's

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:46.210
the brother of a
decorated Panzer general.

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:50.830
But this particular
person was in debt.

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:52.230
He needed money.

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:55.320
He spent a lot of money
on wine, women, and song.

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:58.740
And as they say,
he wasted the rest.

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:02.210
Since he was in need of
money, he went to the French

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:06.330
and offered the Enigma
codes, the keys,

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:08.800
and some diagrams of the Enigma.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:13.000
And so the French took
it, gave it to the Poles

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.520
and to the English.

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.720
And the French and English
could not break the code even

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.050
with those keys.

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:23.580
Now, they could break
the codes for those days,

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.400
but it didn't help them
break it afterward.

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.620
The Poles took that
information, got

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:30.990
the information about the
double-coding of the day's

00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:34.214
keys, the three-letter setting.

00:50:34.214 --> 00:50:36.130
They were able to figure
out that if you typed

00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:42.400
TES twice, the T and the T, if
the second rotor hasn't moved

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.560
gives you a hint,
and the E and the E

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.810
and the S and S. You don't
know what letters they are,

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:48.550
but you know that
they're the same.

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:50.320
And so that gives
you a hint, if you

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:54.550
had the rotor wiring
and the reflector wiring

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:56.050
to help figure this out.

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:58.170
And they were able
to figure it out.

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:00.350
It's maybe not quite as
simple as I described.

00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:02.650
It still took quite a while.

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:08.770
But they were able to figure
that out in 1933, early '33.

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:13.670
They had broken the code and
were reading it until 1939

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.130
when they got invaded.

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:17.710
And the day they got
invaded, September 1, '39,

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:19.990
is the first day
of World War II.

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:22.280
So they were successful in this.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.840
It turns out that
in July of '39,

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.090
they finally told their allies,
the French, who had given them

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:30.390
the way to break
it, and the English.

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:32.050
And both the French
and English were

00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:33.920
astonished that
they'd been breaking

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:38.310
this code for 6 and 1/2 years
and they had not themselves

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:40.520
made any progress.

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.190
And in fact,
besides breaking it,

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:45.590
the Poles made what
they called a bombe.

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:51.100
It was a device that strung
together six Enigma machines

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.840
and allowed them to break
the code much faster.

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.590
They were able to break
the code typically

00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:57.744
in about 15 minutes every day.

00:51:57.744 --> 00:51:59.160
And then the rest
of the day, they

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:02.390
would decode them in
real time, just as fast

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:04.150
as the Germans
were decoding them.

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:06.810
And so this was
quite a breakthrough.

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:08.380
They passed this along.

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.570
And unfortunately
for them, they passed

00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:14.840
along replica machines, all
the information they had.

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:18.315
And then very quickly afterwards
the Germans invaded Poland.

00:52:18.315 --> 00:52:21.410
And it was all over for them.

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:25.940
And so the UK set
up a major operation

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:27.550
to help break this code.

00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:29.390
Here's their park.

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:33.020
They bought this home
in Bletchley Park,

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.330
north of London.

00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:37.730
They had up to 11,000
people working on this.

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:38.980
Remember, the Poles had three.

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:46.390
But to their credit, they had a
much tougher problem to solve.

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:48.260
When the Poles had to
solve this problem,

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.400
there were only three rotors.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:54.310
And so the three rotors
were in different positions,

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:55.700
of which there's only six.

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:59.780
That's why their
six-machine bombe worked.

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:03.490
But now that there's
five rotors to pick from,

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:05.560
now all of a sudden you need 60.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:11.780
They didn't have the ability to
create a bombe with 60 rotors.

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:14.400
And so they left
it to the English.

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:18.000
Now, the English also could
have done a 60 rotor bombe.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.670
But that would have been
quite an undertaking.

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:23.980
They figured out they
could do a 36-Engima bombe

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.850
and manually eliminate
some of the settings

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.570
and still figure out
the code fast enough.

00:53:29.570 --> 00:53:30.570
So that's what they did.

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:34.080
They made a 36-machine bombe.

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:39.800
And they were able to break the
code, typically in a few hours,

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.570
because what it would do is
it would allow the operator

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:45.295
to know which
settings could work.

00:53:45.295 --> 00:53:46.670
Then they'd have
to manually test

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:52.390
that setting and then go
on and test the next one.

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:55.640
Also interestingly,
throughout the war

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:58.220
the British were very careful
with this information.

00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:01.760
So if they got information
that said, for instance,

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.550
that a submarine was going to
surface at a certain location

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:09.140
to be resupplied
by a mother ship,

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:12.230
they wouldn't just go and bomb
that location, because then it

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:14.609
would give away that they
had read this message.

00:54:14.609 --> 00:54:16.650
So what they would do is
they would fly a spotter

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:20.070
plane over it, make
sure the German saw it.

00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:23.610
Then their boat that
happened to be nearby

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:28.270
would come over and
bomb it and blow it up.

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:31.400
This almost backfired
on them once.

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.870
They knew that there were going
to be two submarines being

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:36.830
resupplied in this remote
location in the Atlantic.

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:38.970
So they sent out
this spotter plane.

00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:39.970
They bombed it.

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:41.709
But in that same
exact message it

00:54:41.709 --> 00:54:44.250
said that there were going to
be these other submarines going

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:47.170
through this strait
in northern Europe.

00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:50.030
And they had to decide which
ones they wanted to bomb.

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:52.670
They decided to get the
ones in the mid-Atlantic.

00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:55.500
Well, it turns out that
legitimately the Allies

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:59.530
found these submarines
going through this strait.

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:01.560
And they knocked
one of them out.

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.530
And so this caused a big
concern by the British military.

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:07.260
And in fact, Hitler
called a meeting

00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:12.720
that included the Navy, the
Air Force, and the Army.

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.670
And all of the heads
of these groups

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:20.240
came in to discuss
the possibility

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.682
that the Allies had
broken the code.

00:55:22.682 --> 00:55:24.140
But they also
brought in the person

00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:25.848
that was in charge of
the Enigma machine,

00:55:25.848 --> 00:55:28.490
who told them why it was
absolutely impossible for them

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:29.674
to have broken this code.

00:55:29.674 --> 00:55:31.340
And so they all went
on their merry way.

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:32.962
And nothing was done.

00:55:32.962 --> 00:55:34.920
They could have easily
started changing things.

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.128
But they didn't even do that.

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:45.270
So let me set what was going
on in the North Atlantic

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:46.690
with the U-boats.

00:55:46.690 --> 00:55:49.780
Before the US entered
the war, the U-boats

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.400
were having a field day.

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:56.070
They were sinking
Allied boats in droves.

00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:58.850
In the few months before
the US entered the war,

00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:03.240
it was 60 boats per month,
at a tremendous loss

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.480
of life and loss of
supplies that were really

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:08.540
needed for the war
effort for the Allies.

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:11.150
The U-boats, the way they
would do this is they

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:12.900
would form wolf packs.

00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:14.510
There would be a
number of U-boats

00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:17.410
all roaming around the Atlantic.

00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:20.020
They would spot a convoy,
because they were all

00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:20.940
separated.

00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:22.932
But rather than attack
it with one U-boat,

00:56:22.932 --> 00:56:24.890
they would send a message
back to headquarters.

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:29.610
Headquarters would then
say, form a wolf pack.

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:31.180
Here's the location.

00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:33.950
Maybe up to a dozen
U-boats would go there.

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:36.230
And they'd all pick
out a different boat.

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:38.450
And they'd fire on
them simultaneously.

00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:42.970
And it was at a tremendous
loss of life for the Allies.

00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:45.970
And this went on
for many months.

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:51.790
So it turns out that this was
a major strategy of Hitler's.

00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:55.830
He was expecting that the UK
would capitulate and surrender

00:56:55.830 --> 00:57:00.581
because of this, because of this
blockade and lack of supplies.

00:57:00.581 --> 00:57:02.830
And you can see the quote
here from Winston Churchill.

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:05.790
He said the only thing that
ever really frightened me

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:08.270
during the war was
the U-boat peril.

00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:13.330
Now this is despite the V-2
peril, the peril of D-Day

00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:17.954
and the landing there, all the
problems they had in Africa.

00:57:17.954 --> 00:57:20.370
The U-boat peril was the only
thing that really frightened

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:23.040
him, and I think
for good reason.

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.853
I mean, this could have
lost the war for him.

00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:31.750
So here's what changed that.

00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:33.779
U-110.

00:57:33.779 --> 00:57:36.070
You've probably heard about
the movie or seen the movie

00:57:36.070 --> 00:57:37.870
"U-571."

00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:42.340
That was an important
U-boat that was captured,

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:43.510
code keys and all that.

00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:46.670
But this was the
first one, the U-110.

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:48.640
And here you see the captain.

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:51.370
He was actually a hero in this.

00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:54.030
The U-boat was purposely
captured in a way

00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:59.240
that they wanted to get the
code keys from the U-boat.

00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:03.600
And so when it was bombed and it
surfaced, rather than just let

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:05.701
everybody surrender,
if they did,

00:58:05.701 --> 00:58:07.200
they would have
scuttled the U-boat.

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.182
They would have set
off charges within it

00:58:09.182 --> 00:58:10.140
and it would have sank.

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:13.850
So they purposely started
shooting at the tower

00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:16.130
to get everybody out of the
boat quickly before they

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:18.310
could set these depth charges.

00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:19.510
And they did.

00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:21.660
And by getting
everybody out quickly,

00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:23.510
they then rounded
them up and put them

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:28.580
on the Allies' boat,
this "HMS Bulldog."

00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:31.280
And the captain saw
what was happening.

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:34.610
And he saw that the
charges were not set.

00:58:34.610 --> 00:58:37.290
So he jumped in the
water to swim back

00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:40.250
to set the charges
to sink his boat.

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:43.800
And the Allies saw
that and killed him.

00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:46.990
And so the Allies went on board,
got all the Enigma machines,

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:48.460
all the code books.

00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:52.040
And this boat happened to have
been out for about one month.

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:54.840
As I said, they have three
months' worth of code settings.

00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.570
So the Allies now had the next
two months' of code settings

00:58:57.570 --> 00:59:00.230
that they could
break very easily.

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:01.840
And that's exactly
what they did.

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:05.899
This single act is what changed
the Battle of the Atlantic.

00:59:05.899 --> 00:59:08.190
And the reason was, not only
did they have the next two

00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:11.460
months', it gave them insights
into the kinds of messages

00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:14.570
the Germans were sending, the
kinds of cribs they could look

00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:18.380
for, and how they could then
break future Enigma codes from

00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:20.440
the Navy.

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:29.910
So here's how this goes back
to the beginning of computing.

00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:36.526
And the father of computing
is considered Alan Turing.

00:59:36.526 --> 00:59:39.585
[SOUNDS FROM LOUDSPEAKER]

00:59:39.585 --> 00:59:40.460
RALPH SIMPSON: Hello?

00:59:47.162 --> 00:59:47.970
OK.

00:59:47.970 --> 00:59:48.470
OK.

00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:50.370
So here's Alan Turing.

00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:54.270
He was the person that
led the effort in the UK

00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:57.040
in breaking the code.

00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.240
He was a mathematician,
who came up

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:05.500
with-- he was the brains
behind breaking the code.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:10.370
And he came up with the
English version of the bombe.

01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:13.140
By the way the bombe
was named after they

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:17.470
think an ice cream treat that
the Polish code breakers were

01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:20.160
eating at the time they
came up with the idea.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:24.310
But others say it could
be the ticking of a bomb.

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:26.040
So we're not really sure.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.270
In the UK, they built
210 of these things.

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:32.390
Now these, as you can see,
they're not insignificant.

01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:34.270
They're quite large.

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:37.070
The one you're looking at here
is the US version of the bome.

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:43.670
The English version had a
column of three Enigma rotors.

01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:47.450
And it simulated 36 machines.

01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:49.780
These rotors on
the English version

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:55.580
would spin about twice a second,
so quite fast, but slow enough

01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:59.000
that when they got a possible
hit it could just stop.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.870
The operator would then write
down that setting for someone

01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:03.695
to manually test
out to see if that

01:01:03.695 --> 01:01:04.937
could be a possible setting.

01:01:04.937 --> 01:01:06.770
Meanwhile, they would
start back the machine

01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:08.560
and it would spin again.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.000
Now, all of that would not have
worked for the Naval Enigma.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.550
And the reason is
there's just not

01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:16.990
enough hours in
the day to do this.

01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:21.440
The Naval Enigma, having four
rotors selected from eight,

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.220
it's hugely more
difficult to break.

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:28.470
They also had a
selection of reflectors

01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:30.310
that I didn't mention
that were pluggable,

01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:32.150
so they could change
the reflector.

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:34.920
So it was immensely
more complex.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:39.410
And so what the US did was they
invented a new kind of bombe.

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:43.140
Not only did it have four
rotors and it spun faster--

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:47.400
it spun at a rate of 29
revolutions per second.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.970
So the problem with that is--
well, first of all, the problem

01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:53.574
is the brushes wore out quickly
and it was tough to manage.

01:01:53.574 --> 01:01:55.490
But the other problem
was you couldn't stop it

01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:58.510
and then read the setting.

01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:00.320
It was spinning
too fast to stop it

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.280
on a dime like that when it's
going 29 times per second.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.140
So what they did was they
came up with a new invention.

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:12.930
And that invention is
memory, believe it or not.

01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:14.800
So the top of that
machine, that box

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.310
that you see on top,
that long box, that

01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:19.160
is memory for four
bytes of information.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.220
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:26.830
And you can see this
machine at the NSA cipher

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:30.100
museum in Maryland.

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:33.060
That top box held radio tubes.

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:37.060
Each radio tube represented
a bit of information.

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:41.960
And it held the four bytes
that represented the code here

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.080
of the rotor code.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.570
And it would print it out.

01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:48.370
So this was a major advance.

01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:52.190
And I would almost say this
is-- it's memory, right?

01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:56.550
So it's the beginning
of modern computing.

01:02:56.550 --> 01:02:59.130
The British also came
up with another machine

01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:02.400
to break a different type
of cipher device, which

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.210
was the cipher device
they used for telegraphs.

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:09.000
And that was called Colossus.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.660
And that also was another step
forward in modern computing,

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:18.170
because it was programmable.

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:21.720
So this is the
beginning of computing.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.720
This is what we're
talking about here

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.690
as far as this homely
little wooden box that

01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:33.280
looks like a typewriter set the
stage for things like computing

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:39.500
and Silicon Valley and
Google and all of that.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.710
So by the end of
the war, the US was

01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:45.422
able to break the Naval
Enigma code in 12 hours.

01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:47.100
That's quite a while.

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:50.530
But from then on, they
were broken in real time.

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:52.852
So that was quite an
advantage that they had.

01:03:52.852 --> 01:03:58.280
They were able to identify
where these submarines were.They

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.770
were able to blast
them out of the water.

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:03.060
And it turned the tide.

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:07.010
This turned the tide of
the Battle of the Atlantic.

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:10.730
It was unfortunate that by
finding out where they were,

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:14.560
they had to select which
convoys they were going to save.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.350
They could not save them all.

01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:18.750
That would just give
away the entire secret.

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:21.790
And then they would be
out, that information.

01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:23.990
So they would have
to selectively pick

01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:28.360
which ones they wanted
to take care of.

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.580
Another way that they were able
to break these code that they

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.350
found out was that
the weather trawlers,

01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:37.950
these were almost
unarmed small boats

01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:39.743
that they could easily capture.

01:04:39.743 --> 01:04:42.034
And they would have three
months' worth of Enigma codes

01:04:42.034 --> 01:04:42.790
on them.

01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:44.860
And they would
purposely, of course,

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:48.470
sink them immediately and make
sure that the Germans never

01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:50.220
suspected that they
were really after them

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.910
to get the code books.

01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:55.270
So what happened by
the end of the war

01:04:55.270 --> 01:05:02.100
was that 82% of the sailors that
went into service-- including

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:06.060
the Admiral's son, Admiral
Donitz who was in charge of all

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:10.440
these, his son was one
of them-- died at sea.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:15.585
And 725 of 1,155
U-boats were gone.

01:05:15.585 --> 01:05:17.210
And in fact, toward
the end of the war,

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:18.710
even before the end
of the war, they

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:20.880
quit going out into the
Atlantic altogether.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:23.390
It just was not
fruitful for them.

01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:26.164
They were losing more submarines
than they were sinking boats.

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:30.660
One of the things
that you'll read

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:33.880
if you read up on the
Enigma, a lot of people

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.940
will claim that
breaking the Enigma

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:41.680
allowed the Allies to shorten
the war by about two years.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.750
That's a made-up number.

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:45.922
I don't know if it's true.

01:05:45.922 --> 01:05:47.380
But two years would
definitely have

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:50.160
saved millions and
millions of lives.

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.710
I think there is no
doubt that whether it's

01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:54.680
two years, three
years, one year,

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:57.880
it made a change and a
huge difference in the war.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.460
But even I think
greater than that

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:04.620
was breaking it
allowed the invention

01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:09.515
of the modern computing, which
has changed our lives forever.

01:06:09.515 --> 01:06:19.080
And I think that is the
legacy of this device.

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.030
Now, after World War II,
it's also interesting

01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:23.470
that a couple things happened.

01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:27.190
One was nothing happened.

01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:30.710
So here we have
this huge success.

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:32.890
There were 11,000 people
working on breaking

01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:34.660
this code in the UK.

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:37.440
And there were several
thousand in the US.

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:40.150
And nobody told this secret.

01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:43.760
I can't imagine this happening
today in a day of Snowden

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.860
and releases and all
that kind of stuff.

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:51.430
But this was kept secret
for 30 years, until 1974.

01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:54.070
So in the meantime, there were
some of these Enigma machines

01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:56.390
around, some of them
without the plug boards.

01:06:56.390 --> 01:07:01.010
And the US and the UK encouraged
our allies to use these things.

01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:04.980
And our allies and enemies
alike used them for 30 years.

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:07.910
And unbeknownst to them,
they were being cracked.

01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:12.420
And this particular machine came
from Norway, one of our allies.

01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:15.600
They were invaded early
on in World War II.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.650
The Germans left
behind these machines,

01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:20.060
because when they left,
they didn't have time

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:23.730
to destroy all the things
they left behind in Norway.

01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:26.820
So Norway's secret police,
their equivalent of the CIA,

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:29.430
used these machines
for 30 years,

01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:32.590
with the US and Britain decoding
every one of those messages.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:35.080
So in 1974, when
this was disclosed,

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.080
they made these things surplus.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:39.430
And as a result, it went
on the surplus market

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:41.010
and eventually into my hands.

01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:46.820
The other thing I should
mention is kind of a rarity.

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:49.930
Some people ask me, how
many of these were made?

01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:51.240
How much are they worth?

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.270
Those kind of things.

01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:55.690
We think about 30,000 of these
machines with the plug boards

01:07:55.690 --> 01:07:57.500
were made.

01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:02.320
We found serial numbers
up into 28,000's, so we're

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:05.400
assuming around
30,000 were made.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.720
Today, we know of
about 350 that exist.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.730
Half of those are in museums.

01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:14.260
Half are in private hands.

01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:16.600
And of those half that are
in private hands, about half

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.700
of them are in the US.

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:20.389
So the US has half of them.

01:08:20.389 --> 01:08:24.649
The rest are scattered
around the rest of the world.

01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:27.670
And these things have
been quite collectible.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:30.390
Around the year 2000, you
could pick these things up

01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:32.560
for $20,000 or less.

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:36.750
And they stayed that way
for quite a few years.

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:40.220
I picked this up in 2002
for less than $20,000.

01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:45.770
But today, they seem to be
going for over $200,000.

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:49.760
The highest that I know of
one selling for was $260,000.

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:52.640
But oftentimes they're going
on Sotheby's or Christie's

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:57.000
or something like that and
they're bringing $200,000,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.542
I think partially because of
the added notoriety because

01:09:01.542 --> 01:09:03.250
of a couple of movies
that have come out.

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:04.249
One was called "Enigma."

01:09:04.249 --> 01:09:08.260
One was called "U-571," which
depicts a US crew boarding

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:10.743
a submarine and
stealing the codes.

01:09:10.743 --> 01:09:12.534
It's actually a British
crew that did this,

01:09:12.534 --> 01:09:18.279
so the British aren't
too happy with our movie.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.319
But that's what's happened.

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:23.050
And I call this a collector's
item for the uber-geek.

01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:25.140
So I consider
myself an uber-geek

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.370
for having such a thing.

01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:33.430
If you're interested in
downloading this presentation,

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:34.990
I have it on my website.

01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:37.585
My website is
ciphermachines.com.

01:09:37.585 --> 01:09:39.344
You can just type
that in Enigma.ppt,

01:09:39.344 --> 01:09:43.240
and you can download this
entire presentation, including

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:47.410
the follow-on addendum that has
the mathematical calculation

01:09:47.410 --> 01:09:52.819
for the key, for the
length of the key.

01:09:52.819 --> 01:09:55.130
So are there any
other questions?

01:09:57.687 --> 01:09:58.186
Yes?

01:09:58.186 --> 01:10:02.146
AUDIENCE: What's the actual
origin of the word Enigma?

01:10:02.146 --> 01:10:04.770
RALPH SIMPSON: I don't know the
actual-- some people have asked

01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:09.650
me, because they think did the
US or the British use this word

01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:12.050
and the Germans did not.

01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:14.990
It turns out enigma means
the same thing in German

01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.980
as it does in English.

01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:17.470
And it's spelled the same way.

01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:19.386
Now, I don't know if
that's part of the reason

01:10:19.386 --> 01:10:21.840
that Scherbius picked that name.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.900
But enigma means the same thing.

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:28.690
It's a puzzle, a tough puzzle
to break or something like that.

01:10:28.690 --> 01:10:31.070
And it's identical
in both languages

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:32.140
and spelled the same way.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:34.259
So maybe that's just fortunate.

01:10:34.259 --> 01:10:34.800
I don't know.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:39.970
But I'm not sure of the
original origin of the name.

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:40.470
Yes?

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:42.440
Other questions?

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.150
Comments?

01:10:43.150 --> 01:10:44.573
Yes?

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:48.517
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
published the way that works.

01:10:48.517 --> 01:10:54.433
And other people have
designed replicas [INAUDIBLE]?

01:10:54.433 --> 01:10:55.419
RALPH SIMPSON: Yes.

01:10:55.419 --> 01:10:58.377
AUDIENCE: Has anybody actually
published engineering diagrams

01:10:58.377 --> 01:11:01.114
of the actual mechanics
of the machine?

01:11:01.114 --> 01:11:03.030
RALPH SIMPSON: So the
question is, has anybody

01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:05.850
published engineering
diagrams of the mechanics

01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:08.257
of the machine?

01:11:08.257 --> 01:11:09.090
I believe they have.

01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:12.920
Now, I haven't really looked for
that, so I can't say for sure.

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:13.990
But I believe they have.

01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:17.030
I think that-- if
you look online,

01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:18.800
I think you'll find quite a bit.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:23.480
I know of a person in North
Carolina who actually makes

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:28.730
these replicas to be almost
as precise as could be,

01:11:28.730 --> 01:11:30.910
other than they look new.

01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:34.050
So when he builds it, you
can't tell the difference other

01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:35.410
than it looks new.

01:11:35.410 --> 01:11:38.600
And he uses the
same crinkle paint,

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.630
the same exact materials.

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.780
And I believe he goes
to Germany to get

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:45.490
the same trees to make the wood.

01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:46.760
So it's quite precise.

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:51.181
RALPH SIMPSON: Yes.

01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:54.060
And actually, one of
things that surprised me

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:56.810
when I received this
machine was it's

01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:58.450
in relatively good condition.

01:11:58.450 --> 01:12:00.060
If you take a look--
afterwards you're

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:03.760
welcome to come up and take a
look-- the paint looks good.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:06.310
It's hard to believe
that it was made in 1941.

01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:07.550
It's over 70 years old.

01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:10.120
It went through the
war and afterwards.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.420
And it still looks in
relatively good condition.

01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:17.050
I think that these were pretty
well babied by their operators.

01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:19.040
I think they understood
the value of it.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:22.975
They knew that they were to
value this with their life,

01:12:22.975 --> 01:12:26.120
that if an enemy came along,
they were to destroy it.

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:29.550
And therefore, they took
very good care of them.

01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:31.100
Although, on the
outside the box,

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:36.870
you can see that there
is quite a bit of-- I've

01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:39.190
got something blocking it here.

01:12:39.190 --> 01:12:41.420
There's some scratches
and so forth.

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:43.580
But for a 70-year-old
device, I would

01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:47.050
say that's in
relatively good shape

01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:48.770
for going through the war.

01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:51.840
I can imagine this thing
got quite a bit of use

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:52.851
during that time.

01:12:52.851 --> 01:12:53.350
Yes?

01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:54.266
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:58.140
RALPH SIMPSON: OK.

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.473
The question is, why did the
Navy switch to a better one

01:13:00.473 --> 01:13:03.770
and the Army and
Air Force didn't?

01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:06.100
I think it has to do--
and this is my theory.

01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:08.820
I think it has to do
with Admiral Donitz.

01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:11.590
He was skeptical
that this had not

01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:15.200
been broken, because
he was not-- I mean,

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:19.820
he trusted his submarine
operators and commanders

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:23.120
to be able to do what was
needed to fight the war.

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.360
And they were losing.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:28.480
And there were enough
evidence that he

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.450
thought that this
could be broken.

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:34.520
On the other hand, it
could've been spies.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.320
You know, it could have been
other technologies, like radio

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.610
direction finders or
something like that.

01:13:39.610 --> 01:13:41.820
But I think he was
suspicious all along.

01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:45.350
And so part of the
way along the way

01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:48.630
he came up and had them
design the four-rotor.

01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:50.390
The Army and Navy
decided they didn't

01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:52.890
want to go with that, because
it would have been quite a bit

01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:55.990
more work for them to them
swap out all these machines.

01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:58.960
And remember, there could've
been 30,000 of these.

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.420
To swap those out in
that many locations

01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:04.500
versus a few submarines
and a few boats,

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:08.120
it was easier for
the Navy to do that.

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.400
I think it was a combination
of things like that.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.870
In fact, they interviewed
Admiral Donitz after the war

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:17.910
and asked him if he thought
that the code was broken.

01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:19.440
And he said no way.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:23.080
And then in '74 when it was
announced that it was, just

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.550
before his death, he
was quite surprised.

01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:29.560
So I think even though
he was suspicious,

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.560
he still believed
that it was safe.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.940
Yes?

01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:38.132
AUDIENCE: So how
much more complex

01:14:38.132 --> 01:14:42.416
would it have to be for it
to be-- for them to have not

01:14:42.416 --> 01:14:45.490
been able to take 12 hours,
say 36 hours for them

01:14:45.490 --> 01:14:46.240
to break the code?

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:46.701
RALPH SIMPSON: Yeah.

01:14:46.701 --> 01:14:48.159
AUDIENCE: How much
more complicated

01:14:48.159 --> 01:14:50.651
would they have had to make
it so that [INAUDIBLE]?

01:14:50.651 --> 01:14:51.401
RALPH SIMPSON: OK.

01:14:51.401 --> 01:14:53.120
So the question is,
how much more complex

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:54.970
would the device
have to be that it

01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:57.850
couldn't be broken in 12 hours?

01:14:57.850 --> 01:15:01.950
And just adding-- not
even adding another rotor

01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:04.750
to the design, but adding a
couple more rotors to what

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:09.404
can be selected from would
probably do that and more.

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:10.820
That adds a lot
of complexity when

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:13.390
you have these extra rotors.

01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:16.240
And if you only supplying
a few to some boats

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:19.640
and some submarines, you
can probably do that.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.730
I don't think they
felt it was necessary.

01:15:22.730 --> 01:15:24.360
And so why didn't they do it?

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:27.440
They had no suspicion that
this was broken, because

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.890
of the care that was
taken to make sure

01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:34.520
that they didn't
misuse the information.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.450
The British didn't even
tell their commanders

01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:38.860
many times where
this was coming from.

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:41.780
They would tell them this
came from a trusted spy.

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:43.590
And so they would act
on the information,

01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:50.905
but not even know that it came
from breaking the Enigma code.

01:15:50.905 --> 01:15:52.340
Yes?

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:53.800
I think we're out of time?

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:54.340
OK.

01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:56.460
We're out of time.

01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:58.987
Feel free to come and take
a look at the machine.

01:15:58.987 --> 01:16:01.070
I thank you very much for
your time and attention.

01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:04.120
