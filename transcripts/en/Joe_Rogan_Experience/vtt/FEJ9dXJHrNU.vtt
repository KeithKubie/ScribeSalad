WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.070
Yeah.
There's a lot of people listening.
A lot of folks look at you.
Look at it.

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.730
God bless you.
That you looking at me looking at you,

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.330
look at you or your yoga class.
Did Yoga class here for the first time in awhile.

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.840
I'll stretch down.
It's fucking hard to do,
but if you feel great,
you ever do it?

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.380
Yeah.
I kept falling asleep.
I swear to God I was doing at the west side.

6
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:19.590
Why New York?
I go with my wife.
I would always fall asleep.

7
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.790
You fell asleep in yoga because I was high.

8
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.450
I don't even know how that's possible.
Oh,

9
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:27.210
you and your lay lay down and just don't get up.

10
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.380
It's really a,
it's hard to do though.
I did.
I fell asleep a number of times,

11
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.180
but I mean it's hard.
The yogas hard to do.
Oh,
you have.

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.800
Maybe this wasn't that hard.
This was just like stretching and stuff.

13
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.840
I did hot yoga.
Oh no,
that's,
no,
no,
no way.
As soon as you walk in,
you're sweating.

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.020
Yeah.
Don't know.
I like that you really,
it's good for you.

15
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.550
Really stretch out because of it.

16
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:54.630
But God damn like it takes a long time to stop sweating after you get out of

17
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:59.220
there.
I was sweating for like an hour and a half.
That just,
yeah.
Yeah.

18
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.310
Drink tons of water before.
Ton of water after.

19
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.820
But it's so hot in there.
I mean it's like,
I dunno how many,

20
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.430
a hundred plus degrees,
whatever the fuck it is while you're in there.

21
00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:11.370
But it's drinking alcohol.
Must be a good buzz after that.
Yeah.

22
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.890
You'd probably die.
Nah.
Ice Cold Beer with a shout about it.
Come on Joe.

23
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.920
I shot of vodka.
You heard me?
Tough guy.
I don't drink vodka by this shot.

24
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:23.280
I'm more of a screwdriver toward sort of a drunk driver.
What do you my aunt,

25
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.550
like a little bit of an eerie.
The Tom Collins.

26
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.600
I haven't even,
I don't even know what a Tom got out either.

27
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:33.300
I just liked the name.
I know what a cosmopolitan is,

28
00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:36.180
but I don't know what's in it.
But I know the broads,
like the,
um,

29
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.630
I'll have a cosmo and that's where there's a few drinks,
right?

30
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.660
That they're feminized.
For whatever reason,

31
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.010
those drinks became a woman's drink.
And then there's like vacation drinks,

32
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.410
like a Pina Colada.
Yeah.
If you're out with the boys,
you can't get high on them.

33
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:56.510
You get sick first.
Really?
Well that's sweet.
Yeah.
Oh,
you're going to get that.

34
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.870
He fucked up on those things.
Get a buzz and Pina coladas and that much ice.

35
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:01.140
You got a drink.
That's true.

36
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.510
But the ice is probably good for it helps to rehydrate you.

37
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.300
I'm back on the show us by the way,
back up,

38
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:10.180
back down and got back there and you're out.
I swear I'm never doing it again.

39
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.780
That's a danger being a comedian though,
because I set my alarm like one of them,

40
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.800
if I'm hung over,
I got to show it at eight o'clock.

41
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:24.660
I set my alarm for 6:00 PM yeah.
Whoa.
That's sad.
I mean it's ridiculous.

42
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.800
I mean like you got,
you know,
you've got kids,
you've got a life.
I got,

43
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.680
I'm stand up.
Nothing else.
I'm a clown.
I'm a verbal clown.

44
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.770
So the time between you go to bed at 6:00 PM all that spent sleeping well,

45
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:41.280
no,
but it's just roll over in pain and agony.

46
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.800
I lament my mistake for the night because the buzz doesn't last nearly as long

47
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:49.260
as the suffering.
That's true.
That's one thing,

48
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:53.370
like if you are willing to go through the buzz,

49
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.820
like if you're willing to go through the hangover just to get to that buzz,

50
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.880
that's a big,
but you don't see opposite.
Yeah.

51
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.930
You go to the buzz and then you get the hangover and I regretted it every time.

52
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.080
Like very few people would go through.
Like if you had it,

53
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.100
the only way to get drunk is you had to feel like shit for 24 hours first and

54
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:14.240
then you could drink.
Yeah.
Nobody would drink right now.
I just want,

55
00:03:14.241 --> 00:03:17.560
as soon as you said the ice house was still there,
I thought to myself,
man,

56
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:19.910
you martinis.
It's for,

57
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.080
why'd you think that?
I don't know.

58
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:25.420
I just had the image of having a Martini before you went on.

59
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.321
What kinds of Martini?

60
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:29.800
Like a James Bond type shaken not stirred that kind of a little bit dirty.

61
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.150
A little dirty.
I like saying that to a girl,
a little,
little stinky,

62
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.770
uh,
grey goose,
uh,
extra draw.
And you know what actually dry means?

63
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.740
It's not really straight alcohol.
Oh,
okay.
That was the other thing is remote.

64
00:03:42.741 --> 00:03:45.480
They put in them,
waters it down.
The little mic gives the more,

65
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.280
that's why it's called the Martini instead of a strictly as of October.

66
00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:50.800
But basically they're either gin and vodka,

67
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:53.710
but everybody just makes him pretty much strong.
What's Vermouth?

68
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.040
It's like some kind of sweet liqour that's mixed with,

69
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.060
or you wouldn't drink it on its own.
Huh?
So you only drink it in a drink?
Yeah.

70
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.780
Yeah.
Like olive juice is goddamn delicious.
Delicious.

71
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.380
Especially in a nice Martini is good for the blood pressure too.
I'm sure.

72
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.710
Juice of salt.
Olives are very good for everything,
right?
Yeah.

73
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.760
Olives the fantastic for you.
Yeah.
The olive oil.

74
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:19.450
That's why all these Italians and French lifts along those poor fucking Greek

75
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:20.560
fucks.
Those people,

76
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:24.010
they live on that place where nothing else grows with that island.

77
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.150
They gotta eat olives and shit.
Rarely.
Oh,
it's hard.
Yeah.

78
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:29.800
The places where all of his grow like uh,

79
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.550
like people that are used olives as a staple in their diet.

80
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.400
It's very laborious.
I have an olive tree in my yard.

81
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.920
It's not easy getting all of out of that fucker.

82
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.460
Did you ever think you'd have an old tree geo where you grew up?
No,
I did not.

83
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.320
I didn't ask for it.
She was there when I moved in,
but it's a,
my dogs eat olives.

84
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.430
You don't need them?
Yeah.
Nope,
nope.
You don't just eat him.

85
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.050
I wouldn't have said anything that I grew,
you know what I mean?

86
00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.580
I still go to the store.
Even if I had an orange tree.
Oh,
I have oranges.

87
00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:04.810
I eat those lemons.
I eat those.
I,
I grow tomatoes and Kale.

88
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:07.390
I have a garden.
I grow with a bunch of different kinds of vegetables.

89
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:10.720
I eat them all the time.
Yeah,
they're good tomatoes,

90
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:13.570
especially you grossly fucking jam and tomatoes in your yard.

91
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.320
Tomatoes can be delicious.
I've never had a craving for Kale.

92
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.490
I never woke up in the middle of my baby.
We got any Kale.
I am.

93
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.580
It's always chips and soda.
Why is it always the bad stuff you crave?

94
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.170
I don't know,
but I want a good run.

95
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.520
Lately I came home from the comedy store last night,
um,
at you.
Duke killed,

96
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.780
destroyed.
And I said,
you know what?

97
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.990
I was thinking about eating unhealthy and I said,
ah,
I'm in a good run night.

98
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:40.720
Now I'm going to go to the fucking supermarket but get a bunch of fresh

99
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:42.850
vegetables and blend those fuckers up.
Yeah.

100
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.460
And I made a Kale shake at like one o'clock in the morning.

101
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.680
Well that's why I like those,
those juices that are,
it's all like gray,

102
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.320
green juice and stuff.
Cause that's the lazy way out.
But at least it's healthy.

103
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.630
Yeah.
That's a good place down the street from here I go,

104
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:58.010
it's called the juicy lady.
And uh,

105
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.920
<v 1>they,
they have,
um,
you know,
you can just order them right there.
It's nice.</v>

106
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.700
But just to just get fucking vegetables in your body.

107
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.090
So many people don't drink enough vegetables.
They don't eat enough vegetables.

108
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:10.940
It's like the number one problem.
I think that most people have,

109
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.480
they just don't get enough nutrients in their body and their body is forced to

110
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.950
make,
do you live a dull existence?
Like your mind is dull.
You know,

111
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.030
your body feels dull.
Hey,
a little too much salami so loud.

112
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.100
That's God's plan was if you really love it,
you're not going to live long.
Well,

113
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:30.950
I found this place,
uh,
it's called Bordeaux.

114
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.740
It's out in a Gora [inaudible] Gora hills.

115
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.000
I was just here the other day and they have,
um,
they,

116
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.580
they make their own shark tutoring.
How do you say it?
Charcuterie,
sorry.

117
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:44.690
Sharp charcuterie.
Charcuterie.
I Dunno.
There's,
you know,
smoked meats.

118
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.310
They make their own Salamis and hams and stuff like that.
Oh,

119
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.670
it was fucking fantastic.

120
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.400
When you find like someone who's an expert at that shit and they really know

121
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:55.470
what they're doing.
I'm going to bring the guy some bear meat,

122
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.210
have them turn it into Salami diva.
You're going hunting again.

123
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.340
Ooh,
yes.
Have you shot at bear?
Yeah,

124
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.620
I shot a bear.
Wow,
that's cool.
Come over,
eat some delicious.
I'm good.

125
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.500
I'll just stop it.
Isn't that tastes good man.

126
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:15.980
People love this idea of like people a bearish for a long time before

127
00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:17.570
supermarkets were invented.
Well,

128
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:21.680
it's funny how we separate what's really good for us to eat and like,
it's okay.

129
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.660
Like chickens and you know,
there are certain things I like,

130
00:07:25.661 --> 00:07:28.790
I wouldn't think of eating horse.
Hello.

131
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.170
I ate some horse in Montreal.
Montreal.
Uh,

132
00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:37.030
there's this place called Joe beef is a famous restaurant.
Oh,
I know.
You know.

133
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.000
Yeah.
That plays fantastic.
Yeah,
that's great.
And uh,

134
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.610
they served as a beef two different times.
One time.

135
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:48.560
It was like a beef tar tar or excuse me,
not with you.
Where you went.

136
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.130
Yeah,
I think the night of the fight.
Hmm.
Maybe.

137
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:55.790
I'm almost positive we went there probably after that.

138
00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.350
A great French kid.
The George Saint Pierre.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Most likely.
Yeah.

139
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.320
I've been there a bunch of times.
I probably took you.
Yeah.
Makes Sense.

140
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.890
Did you eat the horse?
Did you have horse?
No,
no.
I went with Dunkin.

141
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:11.200
We had horse tar,
tar,
all ugly.
Raw horse going too far.

142
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.370
So good.
I hear the ponies.
Delicious.
I'm a donkey guy myself.

143
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.960
Um,
and we had a horse tenderloin,
you know,
but it's one of those things like,

144
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:24.260
you know,
you'd say horse to people and it's for some folks,

145
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.150
like there's a lady that lives in my neighborhood.

146
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.280
I would never tell her that I ate a horse.
She rides,

147
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.400
she rides her horse by my house every day and she's real nice,
you know,

148
00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:34.300
doing let her know that I eat horse and then I don't eat.

149
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.450
I don't eat a horse on a regular basis.
Nobody they can.
It's too rich.

150
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.580
Donkey Cock is very,
is a delicacy that we served.

151
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.820
We served horse on fear factor was one of the biggest issues on the show.

152
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.490
Oh really?
Yeah.
As far as like as people complaining,

153
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.960
we serve People Horse rectums Oh my God.
Yeah.

154
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.160
And people are so

155
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.330
<v 0>angry.
They were so angry.
Like we were so many calls and this is like,</v>

156
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.771
you know,
the early days,

157
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:06.150
the fear factor was essentially before the Internet had a real voice.
You know,

158
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:06.541
it wasn't,

159
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:10.260
the social media aspect of the Internet hadn't really been created yet the way

160
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:13.410
it is now.
It was more of like,
um,
you know,

161
00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:16.800
there was like a few websites and a few blogs and stuff like that,

162
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:20.400
but that Twitter presence,
the Facebook,
but you know,

163
00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:23.870
the communities that existed,
they didn't exist like they do now.
Yeah.

164
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:28.470
It's amazing.
The world's changed with that.
It's amazing,
uh,
for the good end,

165
00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:31.680
for the bad,
but more for the good than anything.
You'll help me get on that.

166
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.780
You got to get on and Dominic made it,
put my head,

167
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.610
I had a little guts before you,
he got to promote this.
I mean,

168
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:41.580
it's the best way because you think about all this stuff that we used to have to

169
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:44.280
do,
you know,
every time you would go on the road,

170
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:46.890
you'd have to show up days earlier and do all this press.
Like,

171
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.340
I think Ralphie may was still doing that up until recently where he would show

172
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:55.341
up at a town like weeks out and do press and then come back in the week of and

173
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:00.000
you know,
really try to get the word out that he was going to be there.

174
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.960
Press in Philly,
like I told you of the Atlantic City Gig next week.
Yeah,

175
00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:07.590
the Atlantic city gigs.
It was a great Gig for you,
right?
Your,
that's your area.

176
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.880
You're going buys Tropicana next Saturday and it's 2000 people.

177
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.860
It's the most intimate 2000 theater I've ever been in in the house.

178
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.580
So they're just,

179
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.030
there are built in such a way like it's kind of an arc and so half of them are

180
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:25.050
kind of around yet.
It's really beautiful.
You work the AC it all.
Yeah,

181
00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:28.010
I've done the Borgata a couple times but that's it.
Yeah.

182
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:33.090
I've never done the trop but the difference is the Borgata is a four wall,

183
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:38.380
so the,
so the casino's not as behind you as they are at the sans lip.

184
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.500
Regatta was good,
but the sands is great.
Not the sand,
Tropicana,
Tropicana,

185
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.090
you know,

186
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.080
they always say the sands cause it's the best Gig I've had since the sands.

187
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.520
Oh really?
Yeah.
That was the first took place I've ever had.

188
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.220
Like imagine how cool that was,
Joe from me.

189
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.110
You know the feeling like I go there with share,
which is already a big deal.

190
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.230
My family and friends are there and then you know nothing like pleasing your

191
00:10:58.231 --> 00:10:59.700
sister,
your mother,
people you love.

192
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.010
And then I get the headline in there and I got the headline and then he,

193
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:09.050
he had me headline when Whitney Houston couldn't make like a couple nights and

194
00:11:09.151 --> 00:11:13.620
then he opened for her.
What a fucking nightmare.
You Open for Whitney Houston on?

195
00:11:13.621 --> 00:11:17.340
My God she was,
she was late all the time and I'm up on stage,
you know,

196
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:20.970
and I sold,
I told the crowd,
I says,
look,
I'm not jerking you guys off.
I said,

197
00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:24.660
I'm up here.
Not because I'm being self indulgent,
Shane here.
I said,

198
00:11:24.661 --> 00:11:28.200
I ain't taking a bullet for her.
She Ain't here.
And then they started cheering.

199
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:28.661
I said,

200
00:11:28.661 --> 00:11:32.610
and I'm not gonna leave you in the dark while she just hung out with them.
Well,

201
00:11:32.611 --> 00:11:36.600
no,
I just stayed on stage,
you know,
I owe like 45 an hour.

202
00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:40.400
I was supposed to 25 minutes,
you know,
and when you're pushing shit,
man,

203
00:11:40.401 --> 00:11:43.590
I don't know.
She was probably doing coke and eating pussy out.
Dare you.

204
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.460
I can't even believe you said that.
Don't you know she has left us.

205
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:52.140
I know have some respect for the dead dom.
I rera back.
I take it back,

206
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.740
but if it's bad Karma,
I take it back.
I liked that part.

207
00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.600
Do it go get eaten buzzy.
I never get to watch it at the very least.

208
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.000
I haven't either.
But I've eaten some about you.
Yeah.

209
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.420
You know the more
you actually know them,

210
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.270
Whitney Houston.
That was a weird one.
Right?

211
00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:15.100
Because like when she was doing that movie,

212
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:18.160
my body guard and she was America's sweetheart.
I know.

213
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.330
And you know her and Kevin Costner when love and she was the superstar and she

214
00:12:22.331 --> 00:12:25.810
had that amazing voice and fuck man,
she wasn't,
no,

215
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.030
she didn't have an amazing voice when I've worked with her though.

216
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:30.650
She was going down.
Oh really?
Look Coco.
Yeah.

217
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:35.050
She was tell you who is fucking great.
Was Natalie Cole really well,

218
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:38.140
the people I opened for,
she was fucking talented.
No Shit.

219
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.200
Did you ever do that stuff,
Joe?
No.
No.
I never opened for a while.

220
00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:46.240
I did some stuff for MTV where opened up for Bon Jovi wants and a hundred good

221
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:48.880
guys.
Did you get back with them?
Just said Hi.

222
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:52.870
They were very nice and now trying to think maybe one or two other bands.

223
00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:54.280
I think I did.
I'm trying to remember,

224
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.930
but the Bon Jovi one was weird because it was a theater in the round.

225
00:12:56.931 --> 00:12:58.360
It was the first time I ever did,
I'd hate,

226
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:03.280
it was very weird because there was all this musical equipment on stage two and

227
00:13:03.281 --> 00:13:05.290
they asked me to,
um,
I was,

228
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.760
I was warming up the crowd and I was also supposed to get people to come closer

229
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:13.330
to the stage and they wanted me to just get attractive people.

230
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.650
They wanted me to just get pretty girls to come close.
You stay back.
Yeah.

231
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:22.540
What the fuck?
Like there's no way to do that without being a ledge or creepy.

232
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:25.250
Fuck any girl.
Can you hear me?

233
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.250
What are you girls with the nice ais in the big tips coming?
Like,
wait,

234
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.450
what do you do to that?
I remember how I handled it.

235
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.310
It was a long time ago was you know,

236
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:37.770
early nineties when first Gig was a Joan Jett and a black card.
Oh yeah.

237
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:42.540
Shit Park Convention Center.
Oh Shit.
And the guy says to me,
uh,
you know,

238
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:44.170
40,000 people,

239
00:13:44.171 --> 00:13:47.560
which was really a lot then I was just starting now you know the guy has to be

240
00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:51.540
$250 goes to stay on as long as you can.
Right.

241
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:55.270
What does that mean exactly what it say Alexa?
Exactly what he said.

242
00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.080
So I go up and I'm like,
dude,
remember that pinch a loaf bit.

243
00:13:58.081 --> 00:14:00.160
I used to have dementia,
low of two cup of squat,

244
00:14:00.161 --> 00:14:04.150
the roads I was doing that bit and half.
Do you want answers laughing?

245
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.530
2000 people left and the other 2000 we w we hate you Joan,

246
00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:09.970
Joan or screaming.
Right.

247
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.740
And I was up there for less than like maybe two minutes and somebody taught us

248
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.850
just like a Dixie Cup top,
just you know,
look light piece of paper.

249
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.880
Oh they had to see was that and I was out of there and the guy goes,

250
00:14:21.881 --> 00:14:22.714
you did great.

251
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.490
I go only on for two minutes because nobody lasts that long.

252
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.270
I know what the fuck the SVT and say,
hey,
you know,

253
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.940
it's a change of pace because the band's tuning up.

254
00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:37.300
You could hear the band tune and bank.
Right,
right.
Yeah.

255
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.520
That's one thing that's weird about opening for bands.

256
00:14:39.521 --> 00:14:42.670
They will tune up while you're onstage.
Well,
and that level yet,
I mean,

257
00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:43.550
when I work with Sharon,

258
00:14:43.551 --> 00:14:46.780
it was classy because she was the one that there was the,

259
00:14:46.781 --> 00:14:51.200
by far the best job I ever had an opening for anybody because she knows she had

260
00:14:51.201 --> 00:14:54.830
a great crowd.
She had transvestites and mothers with the grandmothers,

261
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:57.440
with their grandchildren.
The audience.
Yeah.
ECLECTIC.

262
00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.750
If you know what the security told me,

263
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.440
if they ever saw a single straight guy alone,

264
00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:05.510
a sing and he looks straight,
they would,

265
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.210
they would track him all night because no,

266
00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:11.660
no guy along goes to a Cher concert of his straight.
Oh,

267
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.090
that's a gay guy dancing and happy.
No problem.

268
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.440
So if someone's going to be like a crazy stalker,
it's going to be a straight,

269
00:15:18.441 --> 00:15:22.730
straight guy.
But she was fun though.
Yeah.
You enjoyed working with her,
right?

270
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.950
Yeah,
I really liked her.
Do you ever feel like a friendship with her?

271
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:29.270
Do you contact her?
I'm not anymore.
But you know,
she's,
she's very isolated.
Yeah.

272
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.270
She's a good person.
And you know,
she was like,
she,

273
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.830
she used to ask me about the world,

274
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:36.890
like she wasn't really in it because she wasn't really in it to go,
well,

275
00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:38.570
what's it like and do you know,

276
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:41.900
she asked me about people and then one night we went to,
I said,

277
00:15:41.901 --> 00:15:44.150
I talked her into going out in Montreal.
I said,
look,

278
00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:48.710
why don't you drop the outfits?
Stop wearing a hat top hat and a cane.

279
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:54.860
I like,
maybe nobody will notice you shoot where

280
00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.640
I could just fix her with the fucking tales.

281
00:15:59.641 --> 00:16:04.641
Does [inaudible] back and forth on the reds.

282
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.650
And she,
uh,
you know,

283
00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.500
so we got to an ice cream place and some like old guy go in and look with French

284
00:16:12.501 --> 00:16:16.730
gun.
Hey,
aren't you the famous one?
What's her name?

285
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.580
And that's all she had to hear it.
He goes,
yeah,
get ever,
forget all,

286
00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:23.660
what's your name?
So then now that validated that she can't go out,
you know,

287
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.920
but I have one guy,
that's it.
Yeah.
But we had a good time,
you know,
we stayed,

288
00:16:27.921 --> 00:16:30.410
it was a funny thing in the casino.

289
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.990
We would meet when I like in the,

290
00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:37.010
in the arenas I would do my act and they'd have a break and then she'd come up.

291
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:40.340
So we'd never see each other except when she had like a team prayer.

292
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:45.170
And then sometimes I was in that.
But um,
when,
when she's,

293
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.040
we would cross each other one night at her grandmother and grandfather were

294
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:53.000
there and she said to me,
she goes,
you just did a juice joke,

295
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.760
my grandparents there.
And I said,
and by the way,

296
00:16:55.761 --> 00:17:00.740
your answers out and your grandfather's looking at it.
And she started laughing.

297
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:07.230
Well it was that one video she did where she was on like a battle ship turn back

298
00:17:07.231 --> 00:17:08.630
in time,
I think it was.
Yeah.
Fuck.

299
00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:13.280
Could turn back time show he got a little charity if I can find,

300
00:17:13.281 --> 00:17:17.920
oh wait,
I'm on.
I like some sheriffs on.
Yeah,
me too.
What's that song?

301
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:22.780
Gypsies.
Tramps.
Santis the people of the town.

302
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:26.870
I didn't like half breed,
which was happening,
have prayed,
was not,
but I did.

303
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.530
I loved the,
the Bob Dylan Song should cover it.
She's on Goddamn Ball.

304
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.660
I really want to do this baby.
Be Friends with you.

305
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:37.700
She's riding a cannon without hair.
Jesus.
Hey Joe.
We put the uh,

306
00:17:37.701 --> 00:17:42.220
the song on that.
Uh,
what is it called?
Itunes.
Itunes,

307
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.430
iTunes or youtube.
Yeah.
It's called the just to disappoint you further.

308
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.220
The one you played last time you were here.
Beautiful.
Yeah.

309
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.910
Well you doing any music back when you were opening for these people?
No,

310
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:57.600
but I did one time.
It come out,
we were at Madison Square Garden,

311
00:17:57.601 --> 00:18:00.890
but we weren't at the big room that we were doing the smallest 7,500.

312
00:18:00.891 --> 00:18:04.920
See the pellet form where I used to box and she,
this is so funny.

313
00:18:04.921 --> 00:18:07.340
I bet her how I got the good,

314
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.470
the band wants me to go out and bake playing a guitar and she was singing this

315
00:18:11.471 --> 00:18:14.670
song.
Something about the something fire,

316
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:19.200
the wheels of Samsung.
And again,
I get out there and I'm playing.

317
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.690
I'm really playing that.
He's the guys behind the Scrim,

318
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:24.950
the real guitar players playing his ass off and I'm faking.
Like I'm planning,

319
00:18:24.951 --> 00:18:27.720
she's at the,
and I'm singing with her on the song.

320
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.440
We get down on her knees and we're like looking at each other and singing and

321
00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:36.090
screaming and then I get off and she never said a word about it.
She never said,

322
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.880
what the fuck are you doing?
That was great.
That was going to be,

323
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.150
they work with her for all those years.
She would notice that this was day.

324
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.480
What was the song?
Oh,
he's saying I forget,
but it was pretty lucky.

325
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.250
It was a good rock song.
You know,

326
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.370
there'll be something like gimme shelter or something like them looking up the

327
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.970
oh wow.
But now how many different gigs did you do?
Whitney Houston?

328
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:58.830
Just the weekend.

329
00:18:58.831 --> 00:19:03.240
It was a little long weekend and I think I opened for her three to three nights

330
00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:05.730
and then it was like a long,
like a hot,
like Memorial Day,

331
00:19:05.731 --> 00:19:10.360
July 4th something like that.
And then I,
I did a,
my own headlines.

332
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.730
The first in my headline was on the fourth night and I did a whole bit about
her,

333
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:18.000
like make fun of her and,
and singing and stuff.

334
00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:23.070
And then the crew was crying often.
That's hilarious.

335
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.940
And her father was such a good guy and he,
I felt like he said to me,
you know,

336
00:19:26.941 --> 00:19:29.820
I really look you,
you,
you're,
I said thanks.
He goes,

337
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.250
let me get a little work with my daughter again.
I said thank you.

338
00:19:32.251 --> 00:19:33.660
And I'm thinking,
no fucking way.

339
00:19:33.661 --> 00:19:38.661
I'd rather be at Jimmy's clam bar on bail for them before they shucked the clams

340
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:44.580
have them shocking in the back on clack,
clack,
clack,
clack.
But anyway,

341
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.110
it was that bad,
Huh?
Yeah.

342
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.690
You know shit like I remember saying on stage,

343
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.400
cause you know that she's always doing the prayer and looking,

344
00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.140
Jesus does in his head.
Like,
you know,
I don't,

345
00:19:56.141 --> 00:19:59.190
I know a lot about religious history,

346
00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:03.930
but I don't think Jesus had 300 pound bouncers pushing old people away.
You know?

347
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.010
I mean she pushed people away.
Well,
you know,

348
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.040
I'm exaggerating kind of shit that had the divas thing that I couldn't stand
for.

349
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:13.070
The diva shit is weird.
Right?
Yeah.
I remember though,

350
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.280
read this article about Gene Simmons was dating Diana Ross.
Wow.
That's weird.

351
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.870
Yeah,
it was real weird.
It was way,
way back in the day and uh,

352
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.520
he just couldn't take the divas shit apparently.

353
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.960
Just couldn't take her being mean.
Those people.
Yeah.

354
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.140
Like that was the argument that they'd got.
But you know,

355
00:20:28.141 --> 00:20:30.680
obviously this is like completely third hand.

356
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:35.730
Remember in the Millennium Millennium when Barbara Streisand,
uh,

357
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.960
did the MGM grand and if you remember that now,
well,
the funniest part,

358
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:41.700
what being held,
we were also connected.

359
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.740
A friend of mine's brother was a waiter at the MGM and he would bring her room

360
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:49.840
service and he was,
it wasn't allowed to look at her.
Why?

361
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:53.590
So he had the back into the room with the tray,

362
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:58.270
with the cart and just walk away and not look at her.
Is that hilarious?

363
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.220
This is Barbara Streisand.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I have a friend who,
um,

364
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.620
was told the exact same thing.

365
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.350
He was a stage hand and he was told do not look at her,
do not.

366
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:11.020
I talk to her and he violated it.
He uh,

367
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.230
you know it said something to her like Ms Tracy and your cue is going to be
done.

368
00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:16.750
And she goes,
why is he talking to me?
Wow.

369
00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:19.240
She pointed to him when she looked away and pointed to him and said,

370
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:22.360
why they so sweet when they're talking about their charities and all this

371
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:25.840
bullshit.
Yeah.
It's weird.
It's weird.

372
00:21:25.841 --> 00:21:29.470
It's without the diva thing is a very weird thing that did that getting above

373
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.020
everyone where you wanted to be treated like royalty.

374
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:37.080
There is a ballet dancer named Rudolph Noriev ever hear him?
Okay.

375
00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:41.180
So he,
I used to park cars at the river cafe in Brooklyn.
Did you fuck them?
No,

376
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.020
I got,
it seemed like one of those guys,
the second base,

377
00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:49.850
I got to crack the crack second base to a guy who was different than just a lot

378
00:21:50.461 --> 00:21:53.650
of guys get second based on each other.
It's really no big deal.
I'll grab a tit.

379
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.660
I was hoping you'd go with it cause I didn't know what it meant.

380
00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:58.230
But he used to come in and I like,

381
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.150
he was on of those guys with the Cape and everything and I,

382
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:05.460
he fucking hated me because I called him Rudy,
you know rural painted you.
Yeah.

383
00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.720
Go Hey Rudy and how's it hanging?
I said,

384
00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:13.390
cause I would always ask him questions about jumping,
you know,
I said,

385
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.260
could you dunk?
I see you could probably touch the room with you foot.

386
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.660
And he would never thought I was funny at all.

387
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.450
It was such a wise is super serious.
Oh yeah.

388
00:22:22.451 --> 00:22:26.650
Shipper like talk about the male diva.
The ballet.
Yeah.
It's my life.

389
00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.410
I danced,
I practice,
I spin,

390
00:22:29.411 --> 00:22:33.470
I saw for the and I'm free.

391
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:36.970
I'm free.
Yeah.

392
00:22:36.971 --> 00:22:40.060
I mean I'm all for people taking themselves seriously in small doses.

393
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.910
And you're doing important stuff like brain surgery.
Yeah.
Yeah.

394
00:22:42.911 --> 00:22:46.450
You want that to be serious.
And buddy you wearing tights was wearing tights,

395
00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:48.700
chatted,
drawn to the catch line.

396
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.150
One thing you don't want to hear your seat or your shirt,
your surgeon say,

397
00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.060
has anybody seen my lucky scalpel?
You know,

398
00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:01.480
we did,
we did a doctor Katz in the Austin.
Texas was a lot of fun.
How's he doing?

399
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:03.170
He's all right.
He's like,
you know,

400
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:08.170
I saw him in a hotel completely randomly and he was in a wheelchair.
Yeah,

401
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.260
he got up and did stand up though.
He stood up for that.
Which,

402
00:23:11.261 --> 00:23:14.520
what is wrong with them?
What's called Mesh?
Yeah.

403
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.460
You know Jonathan Katz was the open mic host the first time I ever went on stage

404
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.540
at Nick's.
No stitches.
Oh no kidding.
Yep.
Yeah.

405
00:23:22.541 --> 00:23:25.570
He was the host very first time.
Everyone on stage.
Wow.
Yeah.

406
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.360
I didn't know that was your first night.
That's such a nice car.
Yeah.

407
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.310
That place used to creep me out.
Cause you had,

408
00:23:30.311 --> 00:23:33.010
when you walked to the back that had the wall was so thin,

409
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.320
so I was afraid it was just going to close up on me.

410
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.810
So you started with Paul,
Paul,
Paul Barkley and those kinds of yeah,

411
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.840
Paul was doing,
staying where the connection,
they were at the connection.

412
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.280
Paul Barclay,
the common connection

413
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.590
<v 1>with Billy Downs.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

414
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.130
And I was doing Nick's comedy stop and I was doing that,
was doing that.

415
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.830
I was doing a connection and I was doing stitches but I started out,

416
00:23:54.831 --> 00:23:58.490
my first set ever was at stitches.
That was on a,

417
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.920
I think it was uncommon have at the time common ones.
There's two,

418
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.660
there's two locations for stitchers.

419
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:06.950
There was one that was right next door to the paradise,

420
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:12.070
which was a a rock club or saw Jerry Seinfeld perform there once and then a they

421
00:24:12.501 --> 00:24:16.790
moved to another location where it was just autonomous.
It was just by itself.

422
00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:17.643
And you connected to,

423
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.270
that was the first time I ever saw somebody get hit in the face with a bottle.

424
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.920
Oh No,
we go,
who is that?

425
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.800
Well actually the only time I've ever saw anybody get hit in the face with a

426
00:24:24.801 --> 00:24:27.410
bottle just,
I wasn't involved.
I was just a,

427
00:24:27.411 --> 00:24:30.380
I just happened to be there and these two guys were arguing in a bar and he

428
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.600
didn't even seem like they were arguing that much and it didn't get like crazy

429
00:24:34.601 --> 00:24:38.000
or heated and this guy just smashed this kind of faced with a Heineken bottle.

430
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.760
Fucking blood was everywhere.
It was crazy.

431
00:24:40.761 --> 00:24:43.670
I just couldn't believe someone could just smash somebody in the face of the

432
00:24:43.671 --> 00:24:47.990
bottle so easily.
I'll never forget that because it just made me,

433
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.060
it made me realize like there's certain people out there that are already at

434
00:24:53.061 --> 00:24:57.350
nine,
you know you might be at zero,
you walk into a bar,
you're like,
hey,

435
00:24:57.351 --> 00:24:59.180
how's everybody doing?
What's up?
How are you?
Yeah,

436
00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:02.870
I'll have a Martini extra dirty.
That's how you like it.

437
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:06.470
And then for whatever reason your elbow touches some guy,

438
00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.050
he spilled his drink a little bit.
Whatever the fuck it was.

439
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.150
I don't know what happened.
I didn't see it.
I mean,
I was,

440
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.940
I was a good distance away in a crowded bar,

441
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.990
but I just happened to look over as these guys were exchanging words and I saw

442
00:25:17.991 --> 00:25:21.570
that guy bottle,
that guy in the face.
I was like,
Whoa,
whoa.

443
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:23.180
The whole Bora mentality,

444
00:25:23.181 --> 00:25:25.630
the guys that will get in a fight because somebody bumps into them,

445
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:30.020
you're going to get bumped into it.
Really.
Crowd.
Yeah,
I will.
If someone bumps in,

446
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.990
you know,
they say sorry,
and that's the end of it.
No matter what happens,

447
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:37.520
if you get fucking wet,
it's like,
didn't nobody did 99.9% of the time.

448
00:25:37.521 --> 00:25:41.030
Nobody's meaning to do that,
but that this,
the,
the,

449
00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.580
the ability to bottle somebody in the face like that.
I mean,

450
00:25:43.581 --> 00:25:48.440
that guy was scarred for life.
There's no question about it for nothing.
Nothing.

451
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:51.800
I never,
I was never in a flight and a board.
The only fights I've ever been in,

452
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:56.680
they were all about sports.
They're all plans.
Oh,
during a game.
Yeah.
Yeah.

453
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.600
I've seen that.
They used to have this,
uh,
thing in Boston,

454
00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:04.340
this comics a baseball game,
like a softball game.
Every Monday I think it was,

455
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:10.130
and we'd all get together and uh,
the fucking heated screaming matches.

456
00:26:10.131 --> 00:26:14.040
I would watch these comic to get into fucking out,

457
00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.340
fucking out.
I was like,
God dammit.
You're playing softball,
right?

458
00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:23.360
This is a comedian softball game.
I remember Brian Frazier and this other guy,

459
00:26:23.361 --> 00:26:27.770
Matt,
which is in each other's face,
fucking screaming and spitting each other.

460
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:33.180
It was just madness.
Yeah,
probably.
They probably would be.

461
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:36.140
If one guy did something that touched the other guy,

462
00:26:36.141 --> 00:26:39.140
they probably would have beat each other's brains out right there.

463
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:43.980
They probably have fought to the death over fucking softball over whether

464
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.980
<v 0>or not a guy's foot had touched the bag before or after the other guy had caught</v>

465
00:26:49.861 --> 00:26:52.770
the ball.
That was a big dispute.
Joe could be.
It could be scrabble.

466
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.130
If you guys are feisty,
they're feisty.
Well,

467
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.870
that's what's dumb about it is like there's nothing on the line here.

468
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:01.650
There's nothing on the line.
This is not professional.
It's not even amateur.

469
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:06.210
It's not organized.
Nobody gives a shit if anybody wins or loses that.

470
00:27:06.211 --> 00:27:09.090
There's nothing that's worth that.
My,
my little cousin who,

471
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.520
thank God he went to Rehab,
we're walking down the street.
I do,

472
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.390
I was doing helium in Philly.
You ever did a club glove,

473
00:27:15.391 --> 00:27:17.960
that club yet woken down and these,

474
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:22.710
these street kids are waiting for this homeless guys in a sleeping bag to fall

475
00:27:22.711 --> 00:27:24.360
asleep.
Cause some people had laid money on him.

476
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:29.010
So my cousin all of a sudden is going to be the hero.
Right.
And they were all,
uh,

477
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:33.330
and the guy said to me,
he goes,
listen man,
get your boy out of here.

478
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.560
All fucking murder him.
And I'm sure he was,
he was holding a piece or something.

479
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.280
You know what I mean?
But like I tell you,
cousin,

480
00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.000
I don't understand the good they were.

481
00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.420
They were waiting for the guy to fall asleep.
Take one.
No,

482
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.970
just waiting for him to,
you know,
they were going to take them with the money.

483
00:27:47.971 --> 00:27:50.160
The people that put out on his chest when he,
you know,

484
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:53.640
he was a homeless guy and there were three just bad fucking dudes.

485
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.980
Three o'clock in the morning.
I said to my cousin,

486
00:27:55.981 --> 00:27:59.940
there's nothing you can win from this.
You want to protect him?
Call the cops.

487
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:04.410
Don't get yourself involved.
Jesus Christ.
Stupid thing getting me killed.

488
00:28:04.411 --> 00:28:07.920
Getting it.
You know,
for nothing you can run into the wrong people.
I mean,

489
00:28:07.921 --> 00:28:12.840
not that that is the world of nightlife of cities and the p and the people that

490
00:28:12.841 --> 00:28:16.860
are most dangerous or the ones that got nothing to lose.
Yeah.

491
00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:19.020
Or they don't even realize they have something to lose.

492
00:28:19.021 --> 00:28:20.460
They're not even thinking.
You know,

493
00:28:20.461 --> 00:28:24.030
there's a lot of people that just not planning ahead or they think life is some

494
00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:24.661
fucking movie.

495
00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:26.790
They're going to pistol whip somebody and that's going to be the end of it.

496
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:28.840
And many times you seen a movie,
it got crack.

497
00:28:28.841 --> 00:28:30.990
Somebody over the back of my head with a,
with a piece.

498
00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:34.410
The guy goes down a wakes up an hour later.
Oh yeah.
But,

499
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:35.940
and then he's getting a bunch of fights.

500
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.140
Movies of the [inaudible] said that fighting is such bullshit as you know.

501
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:44.070
First of all,
hardly anybody gets knocked out.
Yeah.
Everybody,

502
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.480
everybody gets knocked out in Westerns.
One Punch a girl,
ducks and man,
you know?

503
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:51.960
You know what I mean?
It's like and fights.
You're slow,
slow,

504
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.280
real fights in real life or a couple of quick punches and people grab people.

505
00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:59.190
You know what I mean?
Most of Pfizer,
just a sucker punch.

506
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:03.180
I've seen some fights last a while,
but not usually.
You know what I mean?

507
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.020
And hope I like a lot of times people are basically [inaudible] down deep there

508
00:29:07.021 --> 00:29:10.590
pussy,
so they want to have a fight that's broken up immediately.
Yeah.

509
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:13.980
What's always shocking to me is when I watch people fight and they don't know

510
00:29:13.981 --> 00:29:17.280
how to fight.
Like you got in a fight and you don't even know what you're doing.

511
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:21.180
Like I'm terrified to get into a fight and I've been doing it my whole life.

512
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:23.460
Yeah,
because you're smart enough to know how bad it is,

513
00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.960
but I just can't imagine someone would just not have any skill at all.

514
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.710
Like I have no idea what to do.
And somehow or another you find yourself,

515
00:29:31.711 --> 00:29:34.950
fuck you bitch and you're throwing crazy punches.

516
00:29:34.951 --> 00:29:39.030
You're out of gas almost immediately.
Like,
what have you risked your life on?

517
00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.980
You've,
you've taken this crazy like,

518
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.720
<v 1>you know,
it's like you don't know what you're doing.</v>

519
00:29:43.721 --> 00:29:46.270
It's like getting on stage and playing guitar when you don't know how to play

520
00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:48.730
guitar.
Right.
You don't know what you're doing.
Like what are you doing?

521
00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.040
You're fucking crazy.
Like that time when you get onstage.

522
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.580
What if they had given you a real guitar and you had to play and sing?
We share

523
00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:01.600
that.
I couldn't do anything the fuck they play in chords from Norwegian Wood.

524
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.990
Do you play any musical instruments now?
No,
I just,
I,

525
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:08.800
I play a little bit of guitar but I'm left handed so I rarely in unless I have

526
00:30:08.801 --> 00:30:11.080
one in the house,
but I'm not any good.
Oh,

527
00:30:11.081 --> 00:30:13.450
you have to have a different kind of guitar for the left where it's completely

528
00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:15.700
opposite the string.
It's string differently.

529
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.130
So do you have it strong upside down?
That's what it is.
Yeah.
There are some,

530
00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.340
I think they make like that Mccartney is lefthanded and I used to watch him play

531
00:30:24.341 --> 00:30:28.060
bass and when you see those guys that would have like two and three next.

532
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:32.170
So their guitar,
is that like a fad does that out?
I didn't know what that I,

533
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.060
to me it's like so coolio led Zeppelin,
Jimmy page used to have that,

534
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.830
but I don't even know what it does.
I guess they,
you know what?

535
00:30:38.831 --> 00:30:43.000
Probably they have a different chords.
The frets are different,

536
00:30:43.001 --> 00:30:46.390
so they have like different chords already set up so they can go back and forth.

537
00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.870
I'm imagining that that's what it is.
Yeah.
I'm imagining too,

538
00:30:49.871 --> 00:30:54.290
I've been on a Hendrix kick the last a few weeks.
Great.
Any,
oh,
he said,
well,

539
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:55.720
I mean I've always been a huge fan.

540
00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.370
I mean that's the why I renamed the show the Joe Rogan experience.
Oh yeah.

541
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:03.000
Some reason why.
Yeah.
I mean look right behind me,
Hendricks,

542
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.310
I'm a huge Hendrickson.
Was he arrested for heroin?

543
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:11.500
Toronto hollow.
He was trying to take it into the country.
Yeah.
Whoops.

544
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:16.140
That's a good mood.
Somebody should tell him he was left handed as well.
Yeah,

545
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:21.100
so I'm going to tell him this.
Heroin and Toronto,
I was his left hand.
Uh,

546
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.320
Kurt Cobain was left in,
you know,
there's a high instance of a lefthanded genius.

547
00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:29.350
A lot of left hands.
Are you,
you live genius.

548
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.980
Lefthanded people are oftentimes,
you know,

549
00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:36.040
one thing that left handed people apparently excel at is fighting.

550
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.260
It was like a,
um,
a study done on lefthanded people.

551
00:31:41.261 --> 00:31:43.540
They were trying to correlate lefthanded people with violence.

552
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:46.390
They were trying to say that lefthanded people,
um,

553
00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:49.420
perhaps or more violent or better at violence.

554
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:52.870
They couldn't make that correlation.
This is from a radio lab podcast.

555
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:53.471
But when they did,

556
00:31:53.471 --> 00:31:56.980
what they did figure out is that lefthanded people are better at fighting

557
00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.620
because one of the reasons is they're doing everything the opposite where,

558
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.990
so it confuses everybody.
Well,

559
00:32:01.991 --> 00:32:06.991
my father was a boxer and he taught me to start right handed if you know,

560
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:11.660
if I was ever sworn it like summer camp and then switched lefthand that he said

561
00:32:11.661 --> 00:32:15.160
that confused the fuck out.
I don't know.
Yeah.

562
00:32:15.161 --> 00:32:18.640
Lefthand is weird because the jabs coming from the wrong side.

563
00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.460
You're expecting a jab from over here and it's coming from over here and then

564
00:32:21.461 --> 00:32:23.710
the left hand is the big weapons to the right hand.

565
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.760
It fucks you up unless you're used to it,
but you got to get used to it.

566
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:30.700
Like some guys,
they would always have their toughest fights against south paws,

567
00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:32.620
like they would do great against Orthodox fighters,

568
00:32:32.621 --> 00:32:35.650
but they can never get their rhythm against south pause.
Did you watch the fight?

569
00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.530
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm one of the few people that liked it.
You like to see?

570
00:32:39.531 --> 00:32:42.260
I don't like it.
I loved it.
I enjoyed every minute of it.

571
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.320
I thought it was a fascinating fight.
Why?
Because you know some,

572
00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.920
there's so much more about the martial arts and boxing and stuff.
To me,

573
00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:53.540
I wanted to see a fight,
not a boxing match.
You know like I wanted to see anger.

574
00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:56.450
There was no anger,
nothing.
Did you see Canelo Alvarez,

575
00:32:56.451 --> 00:32:58.910
James Kirkland the next week,
the one that knock out,

576
00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:02.090
I saw the knockout while I was fucking good.
Curoil,

577
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:05.710
you see that look on his face when he was out on his feet down.

578
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:09.620
Canelo Alvarez is a fucking beast.
He's a bad mother fucker.

579
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:13.520
But his style is the style.
That's the Mexican kid,
right?
Yeah,
the redhead.

580
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.270
Redhead.
Yeah.
Handsome Fella.

581
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.580
His style is the kind of style that everybody really wants to see today.

582
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:23.870
Like Gennady Golovkin like seek and destroy destructure son,

583
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:27.920
Floyd Mayweather is not that guy.
Floyd Mayweather is a wizard.

584
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.320
I mean he really is a magician in there.
Oh,
he's smart.

585
00:33:30.321 --> 00:33:33.680
He's not getting hit and he's defensive and his counter punching.

586
00:33:33.681 --> 00:33:37.130
But you know like because of the stuff that you're involved in,

587
00:33:37.131 --> 00:33:40.580
I got more used to exist,
like action.
You know what I mean?

588
00:33:40.581 --> 00:33:44.630
I know they get locked up sometime on the floor for too long,
but it's still,

589
00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:47.710
it's pretty funny when even they're locked up and the guy just pounding the

590
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.280
other guy's temple.
Well,

591
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.720
there's more variables in MMA and that's what makes it more exciting because you

592
00:33:53.721 --> 00:33:54.920
never know what the fuck's going to happen.

593
00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:58.130
You never know if guys gonna kick you or take you down or try to submit you or

594
00:33:58.131 --> 00:33:58.964
punch you.

595
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.790
There's just so many different things going on and there's so many different

596
00:34:01.791 --> 00:34:05.420
things you have to think about and prepare for and so many different angles that

597
00:34:05.421 --> 00:34:08.180
a person could take when things aren't going their way,
you know?

598
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.010
And that just doesn't exist in boxing.

599
00:34:10.011 --> 00:34:13.220
When you're a guy like Manny Pacquiao and you're fighting a guy like Floyd and

600
00:34:13.221 --> 00:34:16.520
Floyd's got you figured out after the first round,
good luck.
You know,

601
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:17.880
you're only locked.
He did.

602
00:34:17.881 --> 00:34:21.630
The best case scenario is you land a really good left hand and then you follow

603
00:34:21.631 --> 00:34:23.960
up with a combination.
And he tried to do that a few times,

604
00:34:23.961 --> 00:34:27.480
but Floyd just went into that defensive shell and just shook his head at I'm

605
00:34:27.481 --> 00:34:32.030
nopal didn't do a nope,
you didn't hurt me.
You know,
he's just the best ever.
I,

606
00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:33.800
you know,
a lot of people give me shit about saying that.

607
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:36.920
Like I had an argument with Max Kellerman about him when he was like,

608
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:39.080
sugar ray Robinson is the best ever.
You know,

609
00:34:39.081 --> 00:34:42.650
how could it be the best ever sugar ray Robinson lost to Jake Lamata you telling

610
00:34:42.651 --> 00:34:45.740
me that Floyd Mayweather would lose to Jake Lamata I'm telling you out of your

611
00:34:45.741 --> 00:34:46.574
fucking mind,

612
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.030
Floyd Mayweather would box circles around Jake Lamata if they were the same
size.

613
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:53.060
The Jake [inaudible] is,
is great and tough as he was,

614
00:34:53.061 --> 00:34:54.410
would never fucking come close.

615
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:57.500
You look at what Floyd Mayweather has been able to do.

616
00:34:57.501 --> 00:35:02.010
Two murderous punchers like Canelo Alvarez and all these guys that just smash

617
00:35:02.011 --> 00:35:05.120
everybody else.
I can't even touch him.
He barely can get close to him.

618
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:10.250
He's a wizard is,
it was I,
I take my hat off to them.
You know,
you know Angela,

619
00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:14.840
the sure he used to come and see me in west palm all the time and he knew that,

620
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:15.760
you know,
my,

621
00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.220
I had like some history of boxing and my family and he brought me this great

622
00:35:19.221 --> 00:35:22.370
picture of all the Philly fighters and I was,
uh,
at the,

623
00:35:22.371 --> 00:35:25.400
at the dinner with him one night as I started picking his brain a little,
I said,

624
00:35:25.401 --> 00:35:27.590
who is the baddest motherfucker bowl?
So said,

625
00:35:27.591 --> 00:35:32.000
who do you think of all the guys that you saw or were,
could beat anybody?

626
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.540
He goes,
Sonny Liston,
hands down.
Wow.

627
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:39.200
He said everybody was afraid him.
He said,
you know,
he was,
yeah,
a lot of problems,

628
00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.520
but whatever.
I don't know what mob ties.
Yeah.

629
00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:46.470
But apparently heroine and you know,
that second Ali fight was definitely thrown.

630
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:51.150
Oh yeah.
You know,
you could say it's such a joke to fan.
He's faking.
Well,

631
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.960
he got punched like they call it a phantom punch is not a fan of punchy.

632
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.771
Definitely got punched.

633
00:35:55.771 --> 00:36:00.060
But he was waiting for the first punch to land so that he could just lay down,

634
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.580
like,
pull that up,
Jimmy.
We go watch this.

635
00:36:02.581 --> 00:36:07.440
It's a Muhammad Ali versus Sonny Liston too,
in Lewiston,
Maine.
You know,

636
00:36:07.441 --> 00:36:11.550
I thought it was going to be foreman because of his size and his strength,

637
00:36:11.551 --> 00:36:15.360
but he,
you know,
he's the list.
It was the toughest.
Yeah.
Well,
you know what,

638
00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:18.810
foreman before Ali beat him was a different animal post Ali.

639
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.260
He was never the same guy because that air of invincibility was gone.

640
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.470
And then he had that crazy fight.
I believe it was with Ron [inaudible].

641
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.500
They just fucking blasted each other in the head and knocked it down like four

642
00:36:28.501 --> 00:36:29.191
or five times.

643
00:36:29.191 --> 00:36:32.940
You remember to punch that he hit a George Foreman with in Jamaica.

644
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.800
Picked him up.
Not your children,
Joe Frazier.
Frazier.
Yeah.

645
00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.930
Pick them up on a stomach punch.
I don't remember what,
what he hit him with,

646
00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:42.750
but I remember his legs literally came up off the ground.

647
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.320
I never saw that before.
Yeah.
Credible.
He was a monster.

648
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:48.900
He was such a fucking murderous puncher.

649
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:53.430
I was at the Spinx a Tyson fight.
Uh,
Michael Spinks.
Yeah,

650
00:36:53.431 --> 00:36:55.440
we talked about those couple of times on podcasts.

651
00:36:55.441 --> 00:36:59.560
How scary he said up jumped the devil.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's really what we,

652
00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.260
I think we talked about it at the laugh factory.

653
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:04.380
I think we talked about it more than once.
Uh,
because it was such a,
I mean,

654
00:37:04.381 --> 00:37:08.010
you were there for like one of the most stunning moments in boxing history.

655
00:37:08.011 --> 00:37:09.230
That was cool.
A lot of people talk.

656
00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:12.720
Michael Spinks was going to give him a hard time cause Spinks had gone 12 rounds

657
00:37:12.721 --> 00:37:16.830
at Larry Holmes and you know,
and beat Larry Holmes by decision and you know,

658
00:37:16.831 --> 00:37:19.890
and he was the light heavyweight champion.
He was a good boxer.

659
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:23.340
He just had no business.
He was so small too.

660
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:27.390
He was barely one 99 you know,
and he's fighting Mike Tyson.
Tyson was,

661
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.750
Tyson was a much bigger,
you know,
in comparison to today's fighters.

662
00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:35.190
He was probably like two 20 built better though.
It's compact and 1965 Lewiston,

663
00:37:35.191 --> 00:37:36.024
Maine,

664
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:41.160
watch this because Ali still look and slick man.

665
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.190
There's still to this day,
no heavyweight that moves like him.
Man,

666
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.380
I got fucking good.
He moved

667
00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.230
<v 2>so light on his feet for a guy who's 220 pounds or whatever the hell he was,</v>

668
00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:54.920
side to side,
all that head movement.
You mean you can't look at that.

669
00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:59.690
You can't keep in touch him listed with lunch four with that Jab.
Good luck.

670
00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.260
Now here he gets some with the punch like right as he tries to listen,

671
00:38:03.261 --> 00:38:08.210
tries to crowd them and it happens with Ali's a face to the camera.

672
00:38:08.211 --> 00:38:12.500
So listings back to the camera and he just comes with an overhand right.

673
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.780
And as soon as he catches,
listen on the draw,

674
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.650
listening goes down like he got shot.
I think it's right here.

675
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:24.620
Right here
since whenever it is.

676
00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:26.870
It's when listings backs to you.
Oh,

677
00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:31.720
but look how beautiful Ali moves man.
It's amazing.

678
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.670
I mean he really did float and this is the real Ali.

679
00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:39.700
This is Ali of 1965 you know before the army and all that.

680
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:41.950
Yeah man to army fucked him.

681
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:46.980
That whole thing fucked him because for three years from 1967 to 1970 he was

682
00:38:47.741 --> 00:38:51.910
completely out of committed shed is total prime.
Yeah,
look,
watch.

683
00:38:51.911 --> 00:38:54.460
We'll show the difference here.
Like when,

684
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.690
when he finally catches like listen,
even though listens moving towards him,

685
00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:03.040
he doesn't even live at,
he's trying to hit him.
I wonder if they had like a,

686
00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:07.060
they gave him a time where you had to get knocked out too.
I mean,

687
00:39:07.061 --> 00:39:10.360
it must be probably the first raveling cause all the gambling on it.
Oh yeah.

688
00:39:10.361 --> 00:39:13.840
I mean that was everything.
Here it is.

689
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:19.990
Boom.
Right there.
I mean that this is the fucking way.

690
00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:24.280
There's is no fucking way.
They look well shit.
The way he's going down,

691
00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:28.540
the way he gets up.
Oh look,
you fake.

692
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:31.630
He could see him thinking I should probably fall down here.

693
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.840
And he gets up finally and Jersey.
Joe Walcott as a referee to I believe.
Yep.

694
00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:40.180
Yeah,
that's true.
Walcott

695
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:47.750
and something happened there and now Ali's is tuning them up and they stopped

696
00:39:48.121 --> 00:39:52.260
the fight.
That's it.
So I guess it had reached a 10 power.
Got that.

697
00:39:52.261 --> 00:39:53.820
He got up after that.
Yeah.

698
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:58.390
<v 1>Here's the knockout in slow motion.
What?
I mean,
he does hit them.</v>

699
00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.730
Everybody calls it the Phantom Punch.
But watch this punch.

700
00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:05.110
He definitely does hit him as listing moves forward.
He does.
Boom.
See?

701
00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.770
<v 2>Yeah,
clean hit.
No doubt about it.</v>

702
00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.780
He definitely tagged him,
but it wasn't,

703
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.530
it wasn't the kind of punch that would put a guy like listing out.

704
00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:20.600
It'll probably stun him,
but I just,
it did.
I didn't,
I

705
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:22.580
<v 1>believe that that was a real one.
Punch knockout.</v>

706
00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:26.510
Now watch that and I'll watch,
uh,

707
00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:30.590
he came back against,
uh,
the white dude,

708
00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:34.580
a Jerry quarry.
Sure.
If that was his,
that was his comeback fight.

709
00:40:34.581 --> 00:40:38.480
Mohammed Ali versus Jerry Quarry.
And when he fought Jerry quarry,

710
00:40:38.481 --> 00:40:43.430
this was in after he had taken all that time off and his body just looked

711
00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.830
different.
Man.
He just like,

712
00:40:45.831 --> 00:40:50.080
Jerry Corey was like a really tough guy who by the way before he died,

713
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.740
couldn't even figure out how to walk.
Like you couldn't figure out where he was.

714
00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.810
Didn't know where his underwear it was.
Yeah,
he was gone.
He was,
he didn't know,

715
00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.720
couldn't give you walked out his front door.
He never make it back inside.

716
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:04.190
He was just gone.
You know,
Holly's talking to him here,
but if like,

717
00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:07.370
if you look at Ollie's body,
like as Ali goes back,

718
00:41:07.371 --> 00:41:10.430
the thing about Ali was that if he wasn't training for a fight,

719
00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.600
he wasn't working out.

720
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:15.410
So he didn't spend those three years lived in weights and running hills and

721
00:41:15.411 --> 00:41:17.960
fucking hitting the heavy bag.
He wasn't doing anything.

722
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:19.040
I mean he's probably just,

723
00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:24.260
just fighting to keep from getting locked up in jail,
you know.

724
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:25.850
But if you look at his body like look at it,

725
00:41:25.851 --> 00:41:30.530
he's all smooth and there's no muscles like looking at him.
He looks like shit.

726
00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.820
I mean,
he doesn't look anything.
He used to look,
I mean he's,

727
00:41:34.821 --> 00:41:37.250
he's bouncing around a little bit in the beginning,

728
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:42.320
but he's just not the same guy.
They still had some pretty big fights at the end.

729
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:43.250
Yeah he did.

730
00:41:43.251 --> 00:41:46.820
But he was never the same guy and never forget that Larry Holmes trying to get

731
00:41:46.821 --> 00:41:49.370
the rough to stop the fight cause they didn't want to beat them up anymore.

732
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.140
That was awful.
His idol,

733
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:56.410
that was awful because that was after Ali had no money left and he was really

734
00:41:57.051 --> 00:42:01.010
suffering from Parkinson's already.
He was,
yeah,
I was already kicked in.

735
00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:05.660
He was already,
uh,
in really bad shape.
We,
you know,
as a friend of mine,

736
00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:06.500
we used to work at a,

737
00:42:06.501 --> 00:42:11.210
as Dorman together and doc Watson's affiliate was Randall Cobb tax Cobb.

738
00:42:11.211 --> 00:42:14.810
And we saw him take a beat and from homes.
Yeah,

739
00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.950
we were just going go down Randall,
go down.
Yeah.
Fucking horrible.

740
00:42:18.951 --> 00:42:23.180
That was the fight that made Howard Cosell retired from boxing.
I remember that.

741
00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:27.020
I'm done no more.
Look at that little monkey run

742
00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.980
our code sal who called like some of the greatest fights of all time.

743
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:36.080
But like if you look at Ali here,
I mean he's still looks good,

744
00:42:36.081 --> 00:42:40.820
but it's just not the same.
Molly,
just not the same guy.
He just,

745
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:43.820
his body doesn't look the same.
He smooth.
I mean,

746
00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.200
granted he's had three years off,
but he's just,
I mean the,

747
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:52.270
the old Ali go now to Ali versus Cleveland Big Cat Williams.

748
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:55.730
And I've always said,
if you want to look at it like Ali in his prime,

749
00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.940
when Ali was in his prime,
his,
when he was fighting this guy,

750
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:03.290
Cleveland Williams and Cleveland Williamson is this big fucking scary murderous

751
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.410
puncher and Muhammad Ali box,

752
00:43:06.411 --> 00:43:10.400
this guy's fucking face off.
Who was the one that he,
uh,
when he was doing,

753
00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:15.440
what's my name?
What's my name?
Oh,
I'm shit.
I remember that.
Yeah.

754
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:18.740
Cause the guy wouldn't,
clay called them cut color and Cassius clay.
Yeah,

755
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:22.910
that's what I mean.
What's my mean?
I forget who that was.
God Damn.

756
00:43:22.911 --> 00:43:25.820
I'd have to look at his rhetoric,
but Cleveland,
he's like,

757
00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:27.230
look how muscular Williams is.

758
00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:32.240
Mo Williams is a fucking animal murderous puncher and he just could not catch

759
00:43:32.331 --> 00:43:35.480
Holly.
This is Ali and his prime.
This is Ali,

760
00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:40.660
like in 67 he says this,
he goes,
oh,
but the movement decide,

761
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:41.360
decide.

762
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.420
It was like there was no fucking heavyweights that ever moved to like that.

763
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:45.440
No one.

764
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:50.450
I mean he literally moved faster and lighter on his feet then most welterweights

765
00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.300
and he was fighting at 200 plus pounds.
I mean,

766
00:43:53.301 --> 00:43:54.560
I don't know what he weighed in his prime.

767
00:43:54.561 --> 00:43:57.080
It's probably probably like two 20 or something like that.

768
00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:01.890
You ever see that picture of him in the Beatles?
Uh,
which one?
Classic picture.

769
00:44:01.891 --> 00:44:05.030
Just name it.
The Beatles in Miami.
Just a funny thing.

770
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.470
I'm trying to find out who that guy was that did that.

771
00:44:09.471 --> 00:44:14.420
I know I came with my knee early careers.
Got a bit of a process.

772
00:44:14.421 --> 00:44:17.990
Cleveland.
Oh,
the hair?
Yeah.
They all used to like that.

773
00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:21.770
Sugar Ray Robinson had that too.
The conk,
they would call it.

774
00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:27.250
But you know who also is great sugar ray Leonard.
Oh yeah,
dude.
It was in front.

775
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:29.840
Why?
Just shut it off Jamie.
Keep that shit on son.

776
00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:35.010
I'm trying to find this guys name.
Jamie.
Hey Jamie is good over there.

777
00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:39.570
Look at them.
Sexy Bitch.
Um,
see Motherfucka Jimmy Ellis.

778
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.690
Jimmy Ellis.
That's what it was.
Yeah.
Wow.
Pretty sure.

779
00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:47.240
Pretty sure if Jimmy Ellis did he deal with I was sparring Pete and two it

780
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:49.020
probably was,
that's probably what happened.

781
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:52.500
Would knock him out cause he was so my editor just beat his ass.

782
00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.540
I'm almost positive was Ellis.

783
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:59.580
I'm sure somebody will curve back to me if I'm wrong,
but if you,
um,

784
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:00.780
you watched his fight,

785
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.140
this in my opinion was like the quintessential Ali and this was,

786
00:45:04.141 --> 00:45:08.460
I believe the last fight before he went away.
Um,

787
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:12.300
they just had never seen anybody like this guy before.
He do.

788
00:45:12.301 --> 00:45:15.300
In those three years did he wasn't in prison?
No,

789
00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:19.350
I think actually I think he fought.
They fought two more times and then he went,

790
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:24.330
yeah,
he fuck Ernie Terrell.
And then Zara Foley,
um,
he went to,

791
00:45:24.331 --> 00:45:28.710
uh,
you know,
he had to fucking go to court and they look at this,
God damn,

792
00:45:28.711 --> 00:45:33.510
he was fast.
Look at this,
the legs,
pap,
pap,
pap,

793
00:45:33.511 --> 00:45:38.220
pap pap,
and then out of there,
I mean he was,
he was barely getting hit back then,

794
00:45:38.221 --> 00:45:42.360
man.
It was so fucking quick.
And then you see like his later fights,

795
00:45:42.361 --> 00:45:45.720
like when he fought Joe Frazier,
like rumble in the jungle and you know,

796
00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:50.480
there was this,
it was so much slower afoot.
Probably had knee problems by then.

797
00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:52.380
And you know,
he took a beating from Frasier.

798
00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:55.980
I mean they took a beating from each other.
Oh,
those were horrendous fights.

799
00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:57.600
Those are her rent renders,
fights.

800
00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:00.540
His daughter told me that may amaze a friend of mine,
his daughter,

801
00:46:00.541 --> 00:46:03.350
and you remember him reading shore.
She was always at the store.
She's a comic,

802
00:46:03.351 --> 00:46:04.500
right?
Yeah.
I used to,

803
00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:08.700
I remember the first time I brought her up and I said,

804
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:13.670
oh no,
she brought me up and I said,
maybe in La.
I said,
I always,
I was thinking,

805
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.020
thinking in the back,
I wonder if I could beat Ali's daughter and if fight,

806
00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:20.100
I probably know.
Yeah.

807
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:24.840
Well definitely not the other one that Laila Laila skewed Gary Too.

808
00:46:24.841 --> 00:46:28.290
She'll beat the shit out of yeah.
Beautiful.

809
00:46:28.291 --> 00:46:31.950
And to beat your ass may amazing an example of how a woman could be pretty and

810
00:46:31.951 --> 00:46:34.950
look like her father.
Yeah.
Right,
right,
right.
You know,

811
00:46:34.951 --> 00:46:38.730
he's got a son too that comes around the comedy store or used to come around the

812
00:46:38.731 --> 00:46:41.520
comedy store back in the day.
I don't remember the yeah.
May May uh,

813
00:46:41.521 --> 00:46:43.740
introduced me to him one day and I was like,
Whoa,

814
00:46:43.741 --> 00:46:48.180
this dude looks exactly like Muhammad Ali.
It was crazy.
And you know,

815
00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:51.810
at the time he was fairly young.
The kid,
you know,
this was like,

816
00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:53.760
I want to say 10 years ago maybe,

817
00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:59.480
but Cleveland Williams was like this like perfect style fighter to show like

818
00:47:00.841 --> 00:47:05.220
Muhammad Ali in his best.
Like he just wasn't there,
man.
He just wasn't there.

819
00:47:05.221 --> 00:47:09.240
It was just not nearly as quick.
Oh Man.
Like,
look at this,
look at that.

820
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:10.200
That's insane.

821
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:15.380
He was so slick and he just redefined what it meant to be a professional boxer.

822
00:47:17.131 --> 00:47:21.840
He introduced a whole new way of doing it and now like there's a lot of MMA

823
00:47:21.841 --> 00:47:24.030
fighters that use this style now.

824
00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:28.130
I mean it's different because they throw kicks and because takedowns are

825
00:47:28.131 --> 00:47:30.070
incorporated into it.
A lot of what they call,

826
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.660
they call it neo footwork movements like Dominick Cruz is probably the best at

827
00:47:34.661 --> 00:47:39.280
it.
He's the former bantamweight champion and Tj Dillashaw who's a current

828
00:47:39.281 --> 00:47:40.090
bantamweight champion.

829
00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:45.090
Both guys are great examples of people that use this kind of misdirection and

830
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:48.250
footwork like constantly left to right,
right to left.

831
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.850
But those guys also incorporates switching stances.

832
00:47:51.851 --> 00:47:54.820
Like they'll fight southpaw and then orthodox and Orthodox south by,

833
00:47:54.821 --> 00:47:55.750
they go back and forth.

834
00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:59.770
I'll get this Ali just right in front of this dude and he can't do shit to him.

835
00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:05.800
Um,
go to the knockout.
We see.
I don't know where,
where it is and this video,

836
00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:09.010
it's can't be much further than this.
When's your next fight Joe?

837
00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:13.160
The next UFC is next weekend is a big one too.

838
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:17.350
Chris Weidman versus Vitor Belfort.
Vegas.
Look at this.
Dang.
Dang.

839
00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:22.110
Oh son.
He stands over and when his hands up always.

840
00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:26.170
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
He's,
that's real.
You see that's the way he's breathing.

841
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:29.560
Very different than the way Sonny Liston went down.
See that again?

842
00:48:29.561 --> 00:48:33.550
Back it up again too.
There was,
I believe that he got knocked down twice.
I might,

843
00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:37.350
I might be wrong.
Yeah,
he got knocked down twice.

844
00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:43.170
So look,
this is dumb.
Yeah.
Back it up a little bit.
You can see the,
the flurry.

845
00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:48.930
No,
it's three times.
He got knocked down three times.
Yeah.

846
00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:52.800
And then eventually put away.
But he's just,
you know,
kept trying to chase him,

847
00:48:52.801 --> 00:48:57.570
chase him,
chase him,
pumping,
knocked him down,
walking away.
God Damn,

848
00:48:57.571 --> 00:49:01.830
that was beautiful the way he did that.
Oh,
I,
I've watched his fight.

849
00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:06.860
I don't know how many times is one of my favorite all time performances of any

850
00:49:07.111 --> 00:49:09.870
boxer.
Just cause it would just to me like,
you know,

851
00:49:09.871 --> 00:49:13.710
there's like certain Mike Tyson fights that did just the quintessential Mike

852
00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:16.530
Tyson fight like Mike Tyson,
like,
uh,

853
00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:18.860
like the one that when he won the title know,

854
00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:23.400
like that was like a quintessential Tyson fight.
Um,
fuck is his name.

855
00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:27.940
Fucking shit.
I don't remember his first flight.

856
00:49:27.941 --> 00:49:31.540
I just remember him being the most terrorizing boxer I've ever seen.
I believe.

857
00:49:31.541 --> 00:49:36.520
I can't remember this.
Um,
you know Joe,
when he was at his prime,

858
00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:41.110
he used to fight.
He used to hit through the defense.
Oh yeah,
no,
he,
well,

859
00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:45.100
he was just so God damn fast for a heavyweight.
There was,
nobody liked him.

860
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:49.210
There had been no heavyweights that were anything.
Trevor Berbick,
there was no,

861
00:49:49.211 --> 00:49:53.380
no heavyweights that were even remotely,
I got a big lumbering guy too.

862
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:57.850
He just couldn't did,
he had nothing for Tyson.
You know,

863
00:49:57.851 --> 00:50:02.110
Tyson at that time was just so fucking destructive.
He was so good.

864
00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.890
But that like,
okay,
my Roz Frasier,
that's like the quintessential Tyson fight.

865
00:50:05.891 --> 00:50:09.990
When I think of a Mike Tyson in his destructive to just,

866
00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:14.620
just on point,
motivated in shape,
just so destroyer.

867
00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.360
You seen them?
IRA's Frazier fight.

868
00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:20.230
Oh that's the quintessential Mike Tyson fight for him.

869
00:50:20.231 --> 00:50:24.220
Actually me too shouldn't have been in there.
He had no,
no business.
You know,

870
00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:28.820
his dad was just as bad mother fucker and his dad wanted him to think that his

871
00:50:28.821 --> 00:50:32.810
son was going to be the guy that beat Mike Tyson.
But you know,

872
00:50:32.811 --> 00:50:34.460
you got to realize man that these guys,

873
00:50:34.461 --> 00:50:38.810
like everybody that comes after you will have learned from everything you do

874
00:50:38.811 --> 00:50:41.180
when your momentum,
we'll take them to another level.

875
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:45.800
And that's going to happen with every,
I mean there's lulls in sports fighting,

876
00:50:45.801 --> 00:50:49.610
especially fighting,
especially as Lowell's I think basketball and football,

877
00:50:49.611 --> 00:50:52.970
they all have lulls to whether you have like your superstars and then like

878
00:50:52.971 --> 00:50:57.780
there's areas maybe where there's no,
no one that's consummate or no one,

879
00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:00.270
no one is um,
like,

880
00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:04.820
like the level of a a Jordan or a Kobe Bryant or Lebron James.

881
00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.370
Like there's only a few guys that ever hit that like super,

882
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:11.750
super athlete level rose above the sport.
This is the first time in my life,

883
00:51:11.751 --> 00:51:14.750
I couldn't name five boxes.
Really?
Yeah.
Right now

884
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:20.600
I could easily,
but it's,
it's a weird time for boxing for sure.
I remember,

885
00:51:20.601 --> 00:51:24.860
remember when all those welterweights and when Duran and pet Carlos Palomino.

886
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:27.980
Oh yeah,
there was a bunch of guys.
Well you know what,

887
00:51:27.981 --> 00:51:31.850
those are on ABC wide world of sports.
I don't know the heavy heavyweight champ.

888
00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:36.020
Vladimir Klitschko say ya and Deontay wilder.

889
00:51:36.021 --> 00:51:38.150
I think he has another one of the titles.
But the,

890
00:51:38.151 --> 00:51:42.260
the thing about Vladimir Klitschkos,
he's just big Russian guy and you know,

891
00:51:42.261 --> 00:51:44.890
you would think like a white guy that's the heavyweight champion.

892
00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:48.200
This would be a crazy time.
Like everybody be excited to see him.

893
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:53.060
He's the most boring of all heavyweight champions,
possibly ever.

894
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:57.130
He's just very smart.
I mean,
not boring to me.
Um,

895
00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:00.170
because I think he's got a very intelligent style.
I mean,
if you're six foot six,

896
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:03.910
the way he fights is the perfect way to fight.
He Jabs.
You had jabs,

897
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:07.220
you had drops her right hand and Clinches Jab,
Jab,
clinch,
Jab,
Jab,

898
00:52:07.221 --> 00:52:10.910
right hand clench,
clench in with the Mayweather the other night.
Yeah,

899
00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:15.080
I was actually looking at the time when the Moran left are so bored.

900
00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:18.410
[inaudible] 54 [inaudible] shit.

901
00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:21.920
I was watching it with my wife and she was yelling out like,
God,

902
00:52:21.921 --> 00:52:24.680
this is so boring.
She,
she actually said this.
She goes,

903
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:27.300
you should have to get knocked down in order to win.
Well,

904
00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:28.430
you should have to get and go with that.

905
00:52:28.431 --> 00:52:30.230
That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
She goes,

906
00:52:30.231 --> 00:52:34.070
well then it'll be exciting.
Like to someone who doesn't watch boxing,

907
00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:35.810
like to see that,
that would be really boring.

908
00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:38.390
It's the Kerry said something to me that I thought was interesting.
She said,

909
00:52:38.391 --> 00:52:42.860
why don't they penalize the guy for holding too much for clinicians defending

910
00:52:42.861 --> 00:52:44.970
yourself.
You're smart.
Yeah,
but I mean I liked it.

911
00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:48.500
If they took points off for that then there wouldn't be as much clinching.
Well,

912
00:52:48.501 --> 00:52:51.830
they put took points off at Klitschko in his last fight and it actually got kind

913
00:52:51.831 --> 00:52:55.790
of interesting because Klitschko is,
you know,
he's famous for that.

914
00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:59.990
He's famous for holding on to guys and he's a big fucking dude.
He's huge.

915
00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:01.430
He's six foot six.

916
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:05.030
So he'll pop you and then grab a hold of you and wrestle you and put a lot of

917
00:53:05.031 --> 00:53:08.160
weight on your neck.
You know,
like,
uh,
they,
they lean on you and put all,

918
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:09.200
make you carry their weight.

919
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:13.160
Like that's a famous way that guys will kind of try to SAP strength out of you.

920
00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:16.340
It's essentially like they're trying to grapple with you and they took a point

921
00:53:16.341 --> 00:53:17.580
away from him.
The referee was a,

922
00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:21.170
just a real stern referee and then it forced him into some dangerous situations

923
00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.940
where Klitschko was,
you know,

924
00:53:22.941 --> 00:53:26.670
he was really getting threatened flying for the first time.

925
00:53:26.671 --> 00:53:29.160
Like you've seen any of his fights for a long time,

926
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:32.340
but there's no one out there that's like a Tyson.
You know,
there's no,

927
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.470
like if you had a Lebron James,

928
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:37.260
like Lebron James became a boxer when he was young,

929
00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:41.760
instead of became a a basketball player and it was just as dedicated to boxing

930
00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:46.110
as he is to being a basketball player.
There's still some crucial elements.

931
00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:50.520
You can be a great athlete in other sports,
but you wouldn't be a great fighter.

932
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:51.061
I mean,

933
00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:54.390
you might be able to be a great baseball player or be a great basketball player,

934
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:55.830
but when it gets on the fighting,

935
00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:59.340
there's some intangibles involved in fighting that don't exist in any other

936
00:53:59.341 --> 00:54:00.030
sport.

937
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:05.030
You gotta be willing to go out there and risk your health and no one is there to

938
00:54:05.851 --> 00:54:09.750
help you.
There's no one there to how you can't pass the ball.
You can't can't,

939
00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:12.180
there's no timeouts you,
you,
you,

940
00:54:12.181 --> 00:54:15.510
you will go into the fire and you have to be able to,

941
00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:20.600
you've gotta be able to hold yourself together under just a barrage of fucking

942
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:25.440
punches and the most dangerous guy in the world.
Who's your opponent?

943
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:30.030
Who's trained for eight weeks for this moment just to kick your ass?
I mean,

944
00:54:30.031 --> 00:54:33.630
he's been not drinking,
not partying and sleeping all the time,

945
00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:36.120
just so he can have more energy to fuck you up.

946
00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:40.500
Well now there's the best athletes.
Don't go into boxing.
No,
we're baseball.

947
00:54:40.501 --> 00:54:43.800
They go into football and basketball,
I think,
well even MMA,
you know,

948
00:54:43.801 --> 00:54:47.040
we have a hard time finding the best athletes in MMA.

949
00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:50.430
There's a few of them now that are just starting to leak into MMA.

950
00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.860
Like guys who are like Olympic caliber wrestlers,

951
00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:58.030
who are tremendous athletes that that Guy Silva was really good.
Anderson.
Yeah.

952
00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.950
Anderson,
who's a very good fighter.
I mean,
he's the greatest of all time.
No,

953
00:55:01.951 --> 00:55:05.700
but no doubt about it.
And he's a very good athlete.
But you know,

954
00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:09.600
like a Jordan,
you know,
Anderson Silver was not Michael Jordan.

955
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:14.430
You know what I mean?
I mean,
he was a fantastic sight.
No,
well yes,

956
00:55:14.431 --> 00:55:18.330
but he's suspended for quite awhile because he tested positive for steroids

957
00:55:18.331 --> 00:55:19.290
after he broke his leg.

958
00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:23.970
He broke his leg and fought again and won but tested positive for steroids.

959
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:28.320
Um,
but the um,
the difference I think is,

960
00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.500
I mean there's no doubt that Anderson is a spectacular athlete,

961
00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.450
the best MMA fighter of all time.

962
00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:38.690
But I just think the level of competition that's involved in MMA or at least was

963
00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:42.480
in his division now that division's fucking stacked with killers.

964
00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:45.900
But when he was in his prime,
there was a long time,
we're like,

965
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:51.230
the title challengers were like Patrick Ota or Talis latus are these guys that

966
00:55:51.271 --> 00:55:53.460
like really weren't at his level.

967
00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:58.140
But now there's like seven or eight guys in the UFC middleweight division that

968
00:55:58.141 --> 00:56:02.280
are just murderers.
So it's one of those things where a guy like Anderson,

969
00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:06.870
who is the cream of the crop,
the best of the best,
pretty much the best ever.

970
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:11.790
And because he's at such a high level,
all those guys that are training,

971
00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:15.450
it's see him and aspire to be him or aspire to beat him.

972
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:19.920
Those guys all come up in the gym and by the time Anderson's done,

973
00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:21.990
when the new guy comes along,
Chris Weidman,

974
00:56:21.991 --> 00:56:26.950
there's like this overwhelming momentum of competition behind him because all

975
00:56:26.951 --> 00:56:31.450
these guys have been under the shadow of the greatest ever.
You know,
so it's,

976
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:32.410
it comes in waves.

977
00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:37.480
<v 0>I saw him do a WHO's losing the whole fight and then he got right at the end he</v>

978
00:56:38.511 --> 00:56:41.630
got a guy with a triangle.
His legs around his head.

979
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:46.880
<v 1>Yeah.
Chael Sonnen tell,
didn't have to tap there either,
you know?
Yeah.</v>

980
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:49.990
Oh yeah.
I mean,
I don't know if jail was exhausted or if,

981
00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:50.853
I don't know what happened.

982
00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:54.010
Chell could've got out of that because that wasn't a fully locked in triangle.

983
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:56.440
People have gotten out of way tighter triangles,

984
00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:00.070
but the fact is a bunch of factors that like,
one,
it was like chill,

985
00:57:00.071 --> 00:57:04.000
kind of was susceptible to submissions and he was a psychological thing where

986
00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:07.000
sometimes he would be winning a fight and he would just couldn't take the

987
00:57:07.001 --> 00:57:08.800
pressure or something and we'd just get submitted.

988
00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:14.290
But that fight in particular was weird because he was that close to winning the

989
00:57:14.291 --> 00:57:17.500
fucking middleweight title man.
Was He close?
You're so close.
I mean,

990
00:57:17.501 --> 00:57:20.860
he was a girl and when she was running away from it,
him running away with it,

991
00:57:20.861 --> 00:57:23.350
right?
Yep.
Yeah.
The fifth round.

992
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:26.230
And I'm [inaudible] to get caught in a triangle like that.

993
00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.970
Like he didn't have to get caught in that triangle.

994
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:31.300
He could've played it smart and just held that guy down,

995
00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:34.990
kept his posture and you know,
he,

996
00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:37.960
he got caught and you know,
he tapped pretty much immediately.

997
00:57:37.961 --> 00:57:41.640
And then he tried to like,
not say tamped.
It was like a lot of weird shit

998
00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:44.920
<v 0>that happened there.
Your career is amazing when you think about,</v>

999
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:49.390
I told you my friend would get again,
got prosecuted the Sandusky.
Mm.
He said,

1000
00:57:49.391 --> 00:57:54.010
I think Brogan's the best announcer on,
uh,
in any sport right now in TV.
It does.

1001
00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:54.940
Very nice.
And,
uh,

1002
00:57:54.941 --> 00:57:57.910
I remember when I was complimenting you on stage live factory and he said,

1003
00:57:57.911 --> 00:58:00.330
I'm brand uncomfortable with this,
but I would love to do,

1004
00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:03.190
I would love for the people to see you.

1005
00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:07.030
It's doing stand up because you're so good at being serious with it.

1006
00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:10.450
If they ever saw your rack,
that would,
it would be explosive to them.

1007
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:11.330
But you know,

1008
00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:14.680
<v 1>I think people like to define people in one way.</v>

1009
00:58:14.681 --> 00:58:17.530
Like you're either silly or serious or you know,

1010
00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:21.340
you read the sexy or you're goofy,
you know,
your whatever,
you know,

1011
00:58:21.341 --> 00:58:25.360
everybody wants to be defined in one way or another or it seems it's easier to

1012
00:58:25.361 --> 00:58:30.070
define people,
but we all have like various aspects to our personalities.
We all,

1013
00:58:30.071 --> 00:58:31.390
well I've weird,
subtle.

1014
00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:34.750
<v 0>Yeah.
But we're all in line at the same like at a high level of both.</v>

1015
00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:38.330
<v 1>Yeah.
But it's just time.
You know,
just put a,</v>

1016
00:58:38.331 --> 00:58:40.620
I put a lot of time in the doing standup

1017
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:45.680
<v 0>talent.
Joe,
don't,
don't turn away from it.
I mean it's like you don't,</v>

1018
00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:48.780
you get a lot of people we've seen a lot of people put time in and they've got

1019
00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:52.230
<v 1>worse.
Yeah,
but don't you think they're doing it wrong?
Like,
like,</v>

1020
00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:56.370
like when they put time and like people put time in both blood and what are they

1021
00:58:56.371 --> 00:59:00.330
doing with that time?
Like how,
how much are they looking at themselves?

1022
00:59:00.331 --> 00:59:01.420
How on the bar?
I

1023
00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:04.360
<v 0>just don't think they have certain gifts,
you know,</v>

1024
00:59:04.361 --> 00:59:07.810
I mean I think like one of the things I,
I I study is,

1025
00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:12.900
is us stand up comedians and there are some people you couldn't see them walk on

1026
00:59:13.271 --> 00:59:14.090
stage.
They,

1027
00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:17.050
they're putting their bottle of water down and you know they're going to be
good.

1028
00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:22.010
They got an aura about them.
There's some people that are so just needy and

1029
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.410
<v 1>not natural and you know,</v>

1030
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:27.530
the not natural thing is tough because I don't know what you do about that.

1031
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:30.670
No matter how hard you work,
just not a natural wit.

1032
00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:33.710
I was watching somebody last night and I don't want to name him,

1033
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:35.930
name him dunked on there.
No,
I don't want,

1034
00:59:35.931 --> 00:59:38.420
I don't want to name it because I wouldn't want to hurt him.
But Chris Aaliyah,

1035
00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:43.110
no.
Crystal is in natural.
Brian Cowen,
Bradshaw,

1036
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:45.470
I name all my friends I encountered should be out of the business.

1037
00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:50.970
He's a Shim is a man that mother fucker get over the years.

1038
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:53.710
He's a poor man's.
You say,
let me tell you something.

1039
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:56.800
There's no funnier guy for five days.
I'm thing try to love Brian.

1040
00:59:56.801 --> 01:00:00.890
Can I love Brian Couto he said,
well,
I go on hunting trips with him.

1041
01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:04.960
Five days of gay jokes and five relentless,

1042
01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:09.100
a nonstop hilarity.
Like he's just fucking never stops.

1043
01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:12.050
He's got that sophisticated size empty.
So field stage.

1044
01:00:12.051 --> 01:00:15.890
He's doing the Christopher Walken as a pigeon.
They had talked to them about,
uh,

1045
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:20.310
this is a really fun Chateau Breo uh,
Chad Chateau,

1046
01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.020
Neuf de pop.
You know what I mean?
He's got all these like wines.

1047
01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:27.620
He knows and he knows a lot about why he knows where the grapes come from,

1048
01:00:27.621 --> 01:00:30.520
what part of the car.
And he studies that Shit.
I just felt weird.

1049
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:35.180
I was close to the podcast last week.
I never heard from that just disappeared.

1050
01:00:35.181 --> 01:00:38.810
So him,
I told him no dub Dub David.
Oh,
so he's saying I,
you know,

1051
01:00:38.811 --> 01:00:42.260
he's my friend cause I love him,
but he's always late.
He's always,
you know,

1052
01:00:42.261 --> 01:00:43.720
but he is a character.
Oh he's,

1053
01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:47.800
but you can't be a guy like Brian count unless you're late,
unless you're flaky.

1054
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:49.760
I mean that's one of the beautiful things of them,

1055
01:00:49.761 --> 01:00:51.800
but it's one of the reasons why I like hunting with him too.

1056
01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:52.633
He can't go anywhere.

1057
01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:56.670
I'm stuck with them for five days and we're hanging out in an island in Alaska.

1058
01:00:56.671 --> 01:01:00.380
I just,
Oh,
I could never do that.
We have so much fun.
We have so much fun.

1059
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:02.960
I just watched an episode last night,
uh,

1060
01:01:02.961 --> 01:01:05.810
of us from the Prince of Wales island that I hadn't really watched a whole

1061
01:01:05.811 --> 01:01:09.200
episode before.
What's it on?
I lived to see it.
It's on the sportsmans channel,

1062
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:13.670
which is like an all hunting channel and um,
it's called,
it's called meat eater.

1063
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:17.690
And it's a Winnie and Cowen.
Yeah,
I'll send you a link to it.

1064
01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.730
I'll send you a link so you can watch it online.
Cool.

1065
01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:23.300
It's fucking great is he's so funny man.
I mean it's,
it's,

1066
01:01:23.301 --> 01:01:27.590
you don't get a sense of how really funny he is on the show because they show a

1067
01:01:27.591 --> 01:01:31.850
little of us goofing off,
but most of it's so inappropriate.
I,
you know,

1068
01:01:31.851 --> 01:01:35.060
he'd be like,
uh,
like we're to ready,
I'm gonna go kill some deer.
Tom,

1069
01:01:35.061 --> 01:01:39.000
you got a piece on,
Ya know?
And I like it.
All of a sudden it'll,
it'll like start,

1070
01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:42.290
he'll start talking about your cock for five minutes and it's one of those

1071
01:01:42.291 --> 01:01:44.930
things where it's,
it's funny and then you're like,

1072
01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:48.140
how long can you keep doing this?
Then it gets funnier and they like,
well,

1073
01:01:48.141 --> 01:01:52.460
surely this is gonna end soon.
Nope.
It gets funnier and funnier and then,

1074
01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:56.140
you know,
you'll see him an hour later and you can keep it warm for me.
I,

1075
01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.630
I just like,
it's just,
he's so ridiculous.

1076
01:01:58.631 --> 01:02:01.380
It goes out there with you besides you two.
Well,

1077
01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:04.530
this Steve Rinella who's the host of the show.
Um,

1078
01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:09.330
and then usually he brings either,
uh,
Ryan Callahan who was a,
another,
uh,

1079
01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.950
very experienced hunter and a guy runs his clothing company called first light

1080
01:02:12.951 --> 01:02:15.690
clothing company.
It's like a all hunting clothing company.

1081
01:02:15.691 --> 01:02:20.190
It's all Merino wool stuff.
It's kind of funny that like all these different,

1082
01:02:20.191 --> 01:02:21.030
you know,
synthetics,

1083
01:02:21.031 --> 01:02:24.780
all these different things that they've created for clothes and for,
you know,

1084
01:02:24.781 --> 01:02:26.790
for textiles,
wool,

1085
01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:31.800
Merino wool is still like the best shit at keeping you warm lamb's wool to

1086
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:35.520
weird.
So,
um,
that guy,
uh,
Ryan Callahan come with us.

1087
01:02:35.521 --> 01:02:39.150
Yonis we tell us who's one of the other guides that,
uh,
that,
uh,

1088
01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.790
Rinella uses and you know,
we find a place to go.

1089
01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:45.240
Like we went Turkey hunting a couple of weeks ago that was up in Napa.

1090
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:46.770
It was fucking crazy.

1091
01:02:46.771 --> 01:02:49.830
I think you told me that was great because we'd go Turkey hunting through the

1092
01:02:49.831 --> 01:02:51.840
day and then we'd go to like the best restaurants in the war.

1093
01:02:51.841 --> 01:02:56.350
I was thinking I would go there.
I would do that.
I wouldn't do the island thing.

1094
01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:01.310
Well,
Turkey hunting is easy too.
It's great.
Well,
maybe not easy for you.

1095
01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:05.380
Turkeys in nature.
Oh,
of course.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.

1096
01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:08.040
That sounds like such a stupid question.
It's a good question.

1097
01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.840
When the fuck do you ever see a wild Turkey?

1098
01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:13.260
I never in West Hollywood go to your apartment.

1099
01:03:13.261 --> 01:03:17.820
I don't see a wild Turkey on the way to your house.
See Pigeons,
um,
you sit,

1100
01:03:17.821 --> 01:03:21.030
you stick a rubber Turkey in the ground like a female Turkey and you've got to

1101
01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:24.320
hide because turkeys have really good eyesight.
So you were cam on a war,

1102
01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:27.000
like a Ghillie suit on my face.
And you know,

1103
01:03:27.001 --> 01:03:29.700
you're like completely tucked away behind this,
uh,

1104
01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:32.280
this Mesh Cammo background.

1105
01:03:32.281 --> 01:03:35.150
Like everything is like completely designed to,

1106
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:40.200
to camouflage you from these birds and um,
minimal movement.

1107
01:03:40.201 --> 01:03:42.300
You can't move.
They see you moving the fucking bolt,

1108
01:03:42.301 --> 01:03:45.620
they're out of there and you put the rubber Turkey in the ground and got a bark,

1109
01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:49.860
bark,
bark,
bark,
bark,
bark,
make these weird hen Turkey noises.

1110
01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:53.000
They have all these different kinds of a Turkey call,
uh,

1111
01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.880
things that they use to try to generate the sound to call these fuckers in.

1112
01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:01.410
And then the Turkey comes in to check out the rubber Turkey and blast them.

1113
01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:04.200
They have to shoot him,
shoot him in the head,

1114
01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:07.830
shoot him in the head with a shotgun.
You save his body for food.
Exactly.
Yeah.

1115
01:04:07.831 --> 01:04:08.551
You shoot him in the body,

1116
01:04:08.551 --> 01:04:13.020
then you're going to be pecking pellets out of the body.
But I shot him.
Perfect.

1117
01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.550
Died instantly.
Get a Turkey.

1118
01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:18.900
There's a danger you missing and hitting the attack and yeah,

1119
01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:23.670
that's true.
That's true,
dear.
Oh fuck you up.
If everything goes wrong,

1120
01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:27.510
what is it?
The wild boar that so dangerous.
Oh,
they're definitely dangerous.

1121
01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:32.370
Wild pigs.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wild boars have these big crazy tusks.
You know,
Doug,

1122
01:04:32.371 --> 01:04:34.800
Stan Hope told me that.
I didn't even know this.
Um,

1123
01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:38.760
Doug Stan hope told me that his next door neighbors dog got killed by Hava.

1124
01:04:38.761 --> 01:04:41.350
Lenas.
Do you know what a Hava Lean is?

1125
01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:44.130
This fucked up looking pig looking thing.

1126
01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:48.180
It's actually from a family called the peccary.
It looks like it's a pig.

1127
01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:51.420
Like it's,
you know,
like a distant cousin of a pig apparently.

1128
01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:56.190
Obviously I'm not a biologist,
but,
um,
there it is.
There's a Havalina,

1129
01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:01.860
those fucking evil conti looking things.
They killed his,
uh,

1130
01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:06.780
his neighbor's dog.
Like,
look at the tusks.
You see the teeth look up there.

1131
01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:10.950
Look at their fucking tusks.
Yeah,
they're freaky.

1132
01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.690
And I'm remember that joke Joe blow his fucking teeth.
Jesus.

1133
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:17.863
Oof.

1134
01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:24.190
<v 0>Hello.
Those lower fucking things.
What are we saying that joke about the uh,</v>

1135
01:05:24.191 --> 01:05:25.930
Irish kid goes up to his father,
he says,

1136
01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:30.070
can I get $5 for Guinea pig as far as it goes?
Gets $10.

1137
01:05:30.071 --> 01:05:31.270
Get yourself a nice Irish girl.

1138
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.870
People don't know a Guinea means.
It's a,

1139
01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:39.220
I soon as I heard the word pig guineas going out of style.

1140
01:05:39.221 --> 01:05:42.100
You don't hear that anymore.
It's definitely not on the west coast.

1141
01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.520
Not it was going on and the east coast.
You here?
Yeah,

1142
01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:47.680
I'm still here in best that.
I love you.
Yeah,
keep it.
It's okay.

1143
01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:50.980
Like we call each other guineas and it's all right.
Ins are very,

1144
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:55.840
they're not thin skinned about names.
Now you grow up being abused constantly.

1145
01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:00.720
You know,
I never really know.
I mean the Irish are not,

1146
01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:03.940
not thin skinned either.
No.
Now.
Well,
you know,

1147
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.970
they at one point in time where minorities immediately,

1148
01:06:06.971 --> 01:06:07.900
it's interesting when you watch,

1149
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.650
there's a parallel to boxing because if you look at boxing in the United States,

1150
01:06:11.651 --> 01:06:14.890
it's always the immigrants that are the lower end of the social ladder where

1151
01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:18.430
they're really the best at boxing and they're fighting their way out.

1152
01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:22.330
It was Jews for a long time.
There's a lot of Jewish boxers.
You know,

1153
01:06:22.331 --> 01:06:25.210
that's one thing.
A lot of Jewish basketball players too.
Yeah,

1154
01:06:25.211 --> 01:06:29.440
I heard that her back and all know his generation before that.
Yeah,

1155
01:06:29.441 --> 01:06:30.161
that's interesting.
Well,

1156
01:06:30.161 --> 01:06:35.161
choose still our big basketball fans like PSAs Sussman's a huge basketball fan

1157
01:06:35.831 --> 01:06:40.120
as a lot of,
a lot of Jews in New York especially.
There's just love basketball.

1158
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:44.740
Woody Allen sent every fight yet was 12 game.
Every game was daughter slash.
Wife.

1159
01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:49.170
You know that assessment story about Steve?
Steve Up.
Which one?
Steve Shrimp it,

1160
01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:53.230
you know it be for everybody.
He's on the Sopranos.

1161
01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:57.550
Terrific actor.
He was um,
back a law or something.
Richie,

1162
01:06:57.551 --> 01:07:00.850
is that what his name was on this promise?
I don't know.
He's a big guy.
Big Guy.

1163
01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:04.550
Really funny.
And he was working in Vegas at the time.
He,

1164
01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:06.550
before he was acting and you know,

1165
01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:09.280
Steve knew everybody in Vegas could get everything comped.

1166
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:11.470
And I remember it's us instead of them.
Steve,

1167
01:07:11.471 --> 01:07:15.280
we're going to go to lake mead on Saturday.
Want to go?
He goes,
no,
I can't go,

1168
01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:18.490
but I can get,
I can copy a boat and to Jeff says to me,

1169
01:07:18.491 --> 01:07:22.330
who I'm fucking cop a boat shoe repair.
I forgot about that.

1170
01:07:22.331 --> 01:07:24.310
I remember that though now.
Yeah.

1171
01:07:24.311 --> 01:07:28.060
She ripple used to run before he became a big actor.
Uh,

1172
01:07:28.061 --> 01:07:30.280
on the soprano's he used to run the Riviera.

1173
01:07:30.281 --> 01:07:34.110
He was a talent booker at the Riviera,
which was the first place was,

1174
01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:38.620
it was hilarious.
He still is hilarious.
He's fucking hilarious dude.
Yeah,

1175
01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.480
he's hilarious.
I'm going to get him on the podcast.

1176
01:07:40.810 --> 01:07:43.420
We've been trying to work out a date cause he's always writing books and shit.

1177
01:07:43.421 --> 01:07:46.330
He's always got something new coming out.
But I'd love that guy.

1178
01:07:46.331 --> 01:07:49.390
He's always been great too.
He's fucking hilarious guy.
Well,

1179
01:07:49.391 --> 01:07:54.190
he has no gray in him.
He either hates you and loves you.
Yeah,
that's it.
Uh,

1180
01:07:54.191 --> 01:07:55.270
he's an animal too.

1181
01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:59.170
I remember we were in the Riviera showroom and some guy threw a cigarette on the

1182
01:07:59.171 --> 01:08:00.220
ground and,
and,

1183
01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:05.280
and stepped on it like inside the showroom and he fucking screens this guy in

1184
01:08:05.441 --> 01:08:07.360
front of everybody.
You fucking moron.

1185
01:08:07.361 --> 01:08:11.620
Wait till you get to like this place on fire.
You stupid fuck,
pick it up.
Like,

1186
01:08:11.810 --> 01:08:16.210
like this is a guy who's,
you know,
up know patron,
right?

1187
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:20.010
He's telling me you got to pick it up.
You know,
shrimp is enormous.
Giant,
too big.

1188
01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:23.840
And so the guy came over and picked it up and meagerly went back to his seat,

1189
01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:29.150
but he was,
um,
he was always this character,
like the really funny character.

1190
01:08:29.151 --> 01:08:31.940
And I believe drew Carey gave him his first break.

1191
01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:35.230
Like drew Carey put them in something like they were friends cause sure up he

1192
01:08:35.231 --> 01:08:39.350
used to book the Rib and then,
um,
like you could see like,

1193
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:43.340
I feel like it was like the opening of one of drew Carey's comedy specials.

1194
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:44.203
Maybe it was,
you know,

1195
01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:49.070
I had a pilot called dom time and it was like a sports talk show.

1196
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:52.240
And Steve was my announcer.
I asked him to be my announcer,

1197
01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:53.720
and this was before I had any idea.

1198
01:08:53.721 --> 01:08:56.600
He was even interested in it because he had that voice.
Everybody.

1199
01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:00.560
And you know Tom,
I rare.
Why?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1200
01:09:00.561 --> 01:09:04.310
He's just a fucking character man.
Yeah.
Just such a character.

1201
01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:09.110
And then all of a sudden he's on the Sopranos and I was like,
whoa.

1202
01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:11.390
And he's fucking killing it.

1203
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:14.870
I wouldn't really dramatic acting really good.
He's done great.

1204
01:09:14.871 --> 01:09:16.670
I had no experience.
Well,

1205
01:09:16.671 --> 01:09:19.940
he worked hard and he works with my friend Julian Beckton.
Remember Joanne?

1206
01:09:19.941 --> 01:09:24.920
She teaches acting and you know,
I remember reading,
reading the,
uh,

1207
01:09:24.921 --> 01:09:29.630
the size for the Sopranos with him in Montreal,
and he started to act.

1208
01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:33.920
And I remember saying them,
Steve,
don't act.
They want you.

1209
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:38.150
They want you.
This is what they want you,
or you're already a character.

1210
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:41.900
You don't need to act like you know,
another Karen.
Just be yourself.
Yeah,
yeah,

1211
01:09:43.190 --> 01:09:44.750
yeah.
It's cool when something like that happens.

1212
01:09:44.751 --> 01:09:48.410
I love seeing someone who just just take off.
Like all the sudden they're,

1213
01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.930
they're doing great.
I just love that.
I love.
See,

1214
01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:53.510
I love no one had guy when they're struggling and then seeing them when they're

1215
01:09:53.511 --> 01:09:58.310
awesome to that.
Some one of them the most pleasurable things to me.
Yeah.

1216
01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:01.600
There's certain guys that kind of everybody's happy for,
yeah.

1217
01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:06.590
Like Ray Romano when he,
sure.
And you know Billy Gardendale,
he's a great guy,

1218
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:11.240
great guy.
And Billy,
his manager said,
you know,
you're so popular.

1219
01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:16.220
Even the bitter guys are happy for you.
Something like that.
It's true.

1220
01:10:16.221 --> 01:10:20.510
I never hear a bad word about Billy.
He's a great guy.
He's in a weird situation,

1221
01:10:20.511 --> 01:10:20.691
man,

1222
01:10:20.691 --> 01:10:24.740
because that Melissa McCarthy check that he's on that show with his fucking you,

1223
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:28.940
Jeb.
And she's in every movie and she's just,
she's very hot,
but he takes it.

1224
01:10:28.941 --> 01:10:33.050
He enjoys it for him.
He's,
he's cool.
Oh No,
no doubt.
But I'm saying it's,
it's,

1225
01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:36.290
it's so weird.
They're like,
he's a really good stand up.
Yeah.

1226
01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:38.960
And it's a very good actor too.
For whatever reason.

1227
01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:41.390
Everybody's paying attention only to her.
I mean,

1228
01:10:41.391 --> 01:10:42.710
the whole show was kinda written right.

1229
01:10:42.711 --> 01:10:47.060
He's like the straight man for her wacky antics,
you know?
Yeah.

1230
01:10:47.061 --> 01:10:51.110
She's in a big movie now.
I feel bad for her.
Some sort of strange way.

1231
01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.460
I feel bad for her because she's so big.
You know,
I just like,

1232
01:10:55.461 --> 01:10:57.980
she jokes around about it and she talks about,

1233
01:10:57.981 --> 01:11:02.030
you know how she's having a great time and I imagine she is,
she's a huge star.

1234
01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:07.150
She's got to get a lot of joy out of a killing and like having people love her

1235
01:11:07.491 --> 01:11:10.910
and being so funny cause she's really fucking funny.
I mean she makes that,

1236
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:14.840
that show really funny too.
She's really talented.
She's so big.

1237
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.470
She's so big and just so unhealthy.
And I see all that extra meat honor.

1238
01:11:19.471 --> 01:11:24.471
Just holiday gelatinous it happened to be wiggling or you really,

1239
01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.360
no,
no,
but I don't mind that.

1240
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:29.830
And Larry will people be surprised.

1241
01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:32.770
I'm where was always done very well.
I don't know.

1242
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:35.280
Do I did my best Joe,

1243
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:38.580
whatever happened that comedy central show you did on football,

1244
01:11:38.581 --> 01:11:41.880
that was a great fucking show.
And I don't even like football.
It was,
it was,

1245
01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:46.290
it was ahead of its time in the sense that a comedy central wasn't as big then.

1246
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.610
And frankly,
the show's ratings were good.
It was called off sides,

1247
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:52.800
but I'll NFL,

1248
01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:57.860
the NFL is so fucking rich that they charge so much for the clips that it wasn't

1249
01:11:58.141 --> 01:12:02.040
worth it for comedy central really.
So that's,
that's why it died.
It didn't die.

1250
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:03.390
A miserable,

1251
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:07.050
unpopular death that was popular when it went down and they still cut a lot of

1252
01:12:07.051 --> 01:12:10.710
it into NFL films now.
So like I woke up the other morning,

1253
01:12:10.711 --> 01:12:14.910
I saw my face with a leather helmet on and the first thing I thought of was,

1254
01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:19.590
look how thin my face was.
Like I told you,
get that Gig,

1255
01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:23.760
the truck coming up in Lake City.
Um,
I'm going down,

1256
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:27.120
I was in Philly at Thanksgiving and I'm going down to the shore and I see my

1257
01:12:27.121 --> 01:12:31.140
picture on a billboard and instead of going looking at him in a fucking kid from

1258
01:12:31.141 --> 01:12:32.880
Philly on a billboard,
I thought,
look,

1259
01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:36.640
I'll fucking thin my face was where did I get this fucking head fat.

1260
01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:41.130
You could lose it.
You just have to make a decision.
But I'm so hungry.

1261
01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:45.360
I understand.
But like the decision I made law,
I don't know.
You're right.

1262
01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:49.530
I'm sorry.
Eating healthy as tilt.
It's everything.
It's for me,

1263
01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:51.750
it's everything I went,
I like,

1264
01:12:51.751 --> 01:12:53.580
I'll go on a streak of like three or four days where,

1265
01:12:53.581 --> 01:12:56.370
and I don't eat that healthy and I feel,
I really do feel dull.

1266
01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:59.820
Like my mind feels dull.
The healthiest thing I eat is lean meat.

1267
01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:04.680
I didn't meet spray lt,
but I mean I really don't.
I Love Bacon.

1268
01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:08.730
I Love Bacon too.
I'm a huge fan of Bacon.
I love it.

1269
01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:12.150
I just think that you need moderation.
Well it's just,

1270
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:16.290
I think you and I also,
we're both of very,

1271
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:19.950
I think every comic essentially that we know of,
we're very indulgent.

1272
01:13:19.951 --> 01:13:23.670
I think that's a characteristic of comedians.
It's very,
very self indulgent,

1273
01:13:23.671 --> 01:13:27.870
very indulgent,
very impulsive.
Like comics,
like tend to do wild,

1274
01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:29.220
wacky things like you.

1275
01:13:29.221 --> 01:13:31.710
Like all of a sudden I'm in this fucking car and I'm hanging out with these

1276
01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:36.630
broads.
I'm,
Oh yeah.
Like that's the story that every comic has crazy wild,

1277
01:13:36.631 --> 01:13:41.490
were doing coke and drinking.
Every comic has some crazy indulgent story.

1278
01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:42.301
You know like you,

1279
01:13:42.301 --> 01:13:45.840
I'm setting my alarm clock for 6:00 PM so I can be at my show at eight.

1280
01:13:46.290 --> 01:13:47.190
You know what?

1281
01:13:47.191 --> 01:13:50.370
You have the best of both worlds cause you got a family life and that,

1282
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.640
well I'm pretty disciplined but I could get indulgent what I've done.

1283
01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:57.060
I'm saying you go on the road and you have a good excuse to go on the road.

1284
01:13:57.061 --> 01:14:01.440
You're not going honey,
I'm going in a row just to fuck around for a real job,

1285
01:14:01.441 --> 01:14:03.630
for real money and,
but you have the luxury.

1286
01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:07.220
You don't have to get up and do morning radio now.
That's a big one for me.

1287
01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:09.660
I still have to do morning radio.
That's hard dates.

1288
01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:12.150
That's hard because a and people

1289
01:14:12.150 --> 01:14:14.320
<v 1>who you pull a Boob,
you go to do Rodeo.</v>

1290
01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:19.060
That what's the problem is it fucks with your sleep cycle and then that dulls

1291
01:14:19.061 --> 01:14:22.180
your brain to hey,
getting up at three in the morning.
Your time.
Yeah.

1292
01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:26.200
Hot Hang Doll.
My brain too.
If I'm hung over and I tried to go on stage,

1293
01:14:26.201 --> 01:14:30.100
I am just not as good.
I'd never seen her drunk.
I don't get that drunk.

1294
01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:34.170
I try not to.
I mean,
I've been a little lit up,
but,
um,
I've never been,
well,

1295
01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:37.320
I mean,
I'm certainly have in my day,
but,
uh,
I,

1296
01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:39.130
I just don't make a practice out of it.

1297
01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:41.650
I just am too aware of the consequences physically.

1298
01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:43.990
I do too much stuff with my body.
You know,

1299
01:14:43.991 --> 01:14:46.540
it'd be like if I had a really nice car and I would just like,

1300
01:14:46.541 --> 01:14:49.240
it'd be fun to Piss in that gas tank.
Well,
I know,

1301
01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:53.370
I know what's going to happen in the fucking car,
but you know,
I'd like a,

1302
01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:57.190
you know,
a shot and a beer,
but that's like kind of where it ends.

1303
01:14:57.250 --> 01:15:01.000
Maybe I'll have a third drink tonight.
Daily.
Gentlemen,

1304
01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:05.290
we're gonna have just sold out,
shoved down my reva,
but can you have a good time?

1305
01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:07.280
Fitzsimmons Ian Edwards,

1306
01:15:07.281 --> 01:15:10.300
is that the show you and myself or that going to have to show we're going to

1307
01:15:10.301 --> 01:15:12.010
have a good time.
The Greatest Club in the world,

1308
01:15:12.011 --> 01:15:15.220
that's the oldest comedy club on the earth.
Really?

1309
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:19.210
[inaudible] the Ice House is the oldest comedy club in America,
and of course,

1310
01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:21.160
sorry,
everybody in the rest of the world,

1311
01:15:21.161 --> 01:15:25.480
but we invented this shit stand up comedies and American invention and the laugh

1312
01:15:25.481 --> 01:15:28.270
factory guarantees lives.
You see the difference by the,

1313
01:15:28.271 --> 01:15:31.270
I got a d you didn't laugh.
I laugh.

1314
01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.870
Sadi guaranteed for you.
How can you guarantee laughs?

1315
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:40.270
That's ridiculous though.
Go your money back.

1316
01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:42.790
Dave Chappelle was on stage the other night at the comedy store.

1317
01:15:42.791 --> 01:15:46.930
It was very funny,
but he was doing this bit about a bad show that he had.

1318
01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:50.440
You know,
where people would be like,
you know,
God,
it must be so hard.

1319
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:51.780
This is just recently.
Yeah,

1320
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:56.080
he had a fucking terrible show in Canada on him and stuff.
Yeah.

1321
01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.240
He's had a couple of those because you know,

1322
01:15:58.241 --> 01:16:02.260
Dave's got kind of a slow pace and if he gets heckled or if you do,

1323
01:16:02.261 --> 01:16:06.340
people will heckle him and fuck with him.
Like sometimes it goes bad,
you know?

1324
01:16:06.341 --> 01:16:08.920
And it can go bad because he's so famous too.

1325
01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:11.830
It's like it becomes like this event that he's there.

1326
01:16:11.831 --> 01:16:15.310
It's not just that they do a real long the other night.
No,
no,

1327
01:16:15.311 --> 01:16:19.260
he did like he popped in,
I want to say he did like 20 minutes.
Wow.

1328
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:24.040
But he fucking destroyed and he had the buddy of the bid about a bombing and he

1329
01:16:24.041 --> 01:16:26.920
goes,
he goes,
man,
it must be terrible.
What happens?

1330
01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.950
What happens when you get off stage?
I mean it's,
it must be awful.

1331
01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:33.160
Nothing happens.
Well it didn't work out.

1332
01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:37.270
I still get paid either way.
He goes,
I get paid for the attempt.

1333
01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:42.940
It was really funny.
It was.
It was fucking hilarious.
He did.

1334
01:16:42.941 --> 01:16:45.790
He had a joke about Floyd Mayweather too.
I don't know if this really happened,

1335
01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:46.720
but Whitney Cummings,

1336
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:50.120
he said Whitney Cummings yelled out in the middle of the Floyd with his fight.

1337
01:16:50.121 --> 01:16:50.954
She stood up,

1338
01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:56.100
Floyd Mayweather beats women and he goes and men too bitch.

1339
01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:02.170
And he's laughing while he's doing it.

1340
01:17:02.171 --> 01:17:05.680
He's like such a jovial spoke was always smokes a lot of cigarettes.

1341
01:17:05.710 --> 01:17:08.440
They smoke so on stage,
right?
Oh he smokes a lot of cigarettes.

1342
01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:11.600
Smokes a lot of cigarettes and he believes a lot of conspiracies.

1343
01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:16.310
I believe he is one of the people that believes that bill Cosby was somehow set

1344
01:17:16.311 --> 01:17:19.010
up,
set up by 30 women.
I don't think he's,

1345
01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.740
I don't think he believes that bill Cosby didn't do it,

1346
01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:24.590
but I think that there's some folks out there,

1347
01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:27.140
I had an argument with a dude last night at the comedy store about this that

1348
01:17:27.141 --> 01:17:30.290
works for live nation,
a fine fellow,
not a bad human,

1349
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:34.280
but he's made perhaps been hanging around with the wrong crowd.
And uh,
he said,

1350
01:17:34.281 --> 01:17:37.220
don't you think it's suspicious that it all happened like this?
Right.

1351
01:17:37.221 --> 01:17:41.990
When the show comes out,
I go,
he's fucking 70.
Okay.

1352
01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:47.060
He's had a career that's lasted since the 1960 [inaudible] he had a series in

1353
01:17:47.061 --> 01:17:51.920
the 1960s I spy,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
come on,
man.
No,
it's not a conspiracy.

1354
01:17:51.921 --> 01:17:52.390
That's cold weather.

1355
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:56.540
Just trying to sabotage his career after a hundred fucking years at the top,

1356
01:17:56.541 --> 01:17:59.330
like it was for black man to get a series,

1357
01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.280
but it wasn't comedically about like a Stepin Fetchit type black guy and those

1358
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:09.040
then,
well,
he was a,
he was a cop,
right?
Wasn't he?
He was a nice guy.
Yeah,

1359
01:18:10.450 --> 01:18:13.160
that's it.
That hurts me.
That one hurts me.

1360
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:15.570
It really hurts me how my daughters too,
just that,

1361
01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.870
that I've heard it from people before.

1362
01:18:17.871 --> 01:18:20.990
Girls would tell you that they got roofing and it always,
it's always like,

1363
01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:24.440
it's always terrifying,
but somehow or another,

1364
01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:28.940
like the girl is telling you he's okay and the right in front of you and you go,

1365
01:18:28.941 --> 01:18:31.490
wow.
I was like,
it's hard for me to connect to this God.

1366
01:18:31.491 --> 01:18:34.910
It's awful and it's terrible.
But it's hard for me to connect to this.

1367
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:38.000
Like I know it's real and I know it happens,

1368
01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:43.660
but when I heard that bill fucking Cosby was drugging and raping women,

1369
01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.850
allegedly,
I should say allegedly,

1370
01:18:47.170 --> 01:18:51.220
I can't make up that many stories are you could,
you certainly could Joe.

1371
01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:54.930
Three 30 you can get 30 crazy bitches,
but I don't think they are.

1372
01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:58.190
But they're not organized.
No,
no,
no.
I mean,
I'm,
I'm just,

1373
01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:01.460
I'm not saying that they are,
I'm saying you certainly could if somebody,

1374
01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:06.820
somebody like some crazy bill gates type character wanting to pay 30 people to

1375
01:19:06.891 --> 01:19:09.710
come up with the same story,
they could certainly do all right.
Right.

1376
01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:13.970
I'm not saying that they did.
Yeah,
but I mean,
that's beside the point.
I mean,

1377
01:19:13.971 --> 01:19:17.510
I'm just trying to be as open minded as possible.
I'm not a denier in any way,

1378
01:19:17.511 --> 01:19:18.344
shape or form.

1379
01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:23.560
But what freaks me out is that this is a guy that was loved by fucking aliens,

1380
01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:31.880
millions and they loved him as this fatherly sweater wearing,

1381
01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:37.310
don't tell dirty jokes,
you know,
like that famous thing from the Eddie Murphy,

1382
01:19:37.311 --> 01:19:40.070
a special where he's,
you know,
getting mad at Eddie Murphy.

1383
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:42.950
Richard Pryor tells him to not worry about it.

1384
01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:45.580
But apparently he did that to Katt Williams at that.

1385
01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:47.060
Really that with Chris Rock Rather.

1386
01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:51.140
That really bothered me the way he treated the young black guys that,
uh,
yeah,

1387
01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:52.220
because of their language.

1388
01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:56.870
And then you find out that he's a felon and unconvicted felon.
I mean,
yeah.
Well,

1389
01:19:56.871 --> 01:20:00.650
he's a rapist.
Let's say it right.
You know,
she,
when I first started,

1390
01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:05.120
I was on star search and he was the guest host and I heard shit about him.

1391
01:20:05.121 --> 01:20:08.010
Then same thing.
No,
no.

1392
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:09.840
<v 0>It just,
it just that it was,
you know,
he was married,</v>

1393
01:20:09.841 --> 01:20:12.330
but he was a womanizer and I,
and like,
you know,

1394
01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:16.920
but there was something creepy about him even in those days.
So,
wow.
You know,

1395
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:19.410
that's a long time ago.
Yeah.
I mean,

1396
01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.070
there's a big step between a womanizer and a rapist.
Yeah,
no,
I know.

1397
01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:27.020
The womanizers a guy who was an enthusiast who enjoys the lady,

1398
01:20:27.021 --> 01:20:31.560
seen Julie's the Bra.
It's sad,
but there's just,

1399
01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:36.330
there's a,
there's a lack of humanity in someone who's willing to drug a woman.

1400
01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.620
It's so fucking evil.

1401
01:20:37.650 --> 01:20:42.650
Like we were talking about rape and I was saying that there's no way I could

1402
01:20:42.691 --> 01:20:46.860
rape somebody because I have too much compassion and I could never hurt some.

1403
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:49.080
Like I,
you know,
I know it sounds like you like,
oh,
big deal.

1404
01:20:49.081 --> 01:20:51.240
You couldn't rape somebody,
but I don't even fucking get it.

1405
01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:56.340
Like how you could be that evil and had to get hard seeing somebody cry and

1406
01:20:56.341 --> 01:21:01.290
stuff,
you know?
Yeah.
I'm my,
I think in this podcast downloads.
Oh No,

1407
01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:04.500
you're not.
You know,
I think what we're talking about earlier about divas,

1408
01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:08.220
about this,
you know,
get out of my way.
I'm better than everyone else.

1409
01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:11.160
I think they're related because I think there's a,

1410
01:21:11.161 --> 01:21:15.630
there's a level of stardom that some people reach that gets,

1411
01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:16.950
the world gets very foggy.

1412
01:21:16.951 --> 01:21:21.450
Like obviously share is a very nice person and she's a very kind person to you

1413
01:21:21.451 --> 01:21:22.410
and very easy to get along,

1414
01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:26.780
but detached because of her fame and because of her popularity in,

1415
01:21:26.781 --> 01:21:29.330
well to the point where she feels alienated like nine,

1416
01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:33.570
10 she never knew what the real world it's right.
Yeah.
Sonny and Cher man.

1417
01:21:33.630 --> 01:21:36.690
Ah Fuck.
That's crazy.
If you think about it that way,

1418
01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:39.900
she's been famous for so long,
you kind of forget the thing.
But he,

1419
01:21:39.901 --> 01:21:44.000
and she was a big store.
That's nuts.
Chips is tramp sound.

1420
01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:49.180
Things can look good on that.
So I love that song,
but,

1421
01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:52.380
but it's in,
it's in tune,
but she's a nice person.
You know what I'm saying?

1422
01:21:52.381 --> 01:21:56.160
Like she made through that and stay at a nice person even though she's a quote

1423
01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:57.000
unquote diva,

1424
01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:01.230
she's a diva because she's extraordinarily talented and very respected and loved

1425
01:22:01.231 --> 01:22:02.064
and all that good stuff.

1426
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:07.270
But that thing that makes you like everyone out of my way,
you know,
uh,

1427
01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:11.400
you know that whether it would Diana Ross did it and you saw the Whitney Houston

1428
01:22:11.401 --> 01:22:14.640
thing,
the body guards pushing it right side.
Yeah.

1429
01:22:14.641 --> 01:22:17.220
The Streisand thing that John Mellencamp,

1430
01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:20.250
he did John Mellencamp friend of mine,
uh,

1431
01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:23.940
Omar that not the tent maker in other Omar from the wire?

1432
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:29.240
No,
he uh,
he was telling me that,
you know,

1433
01:22:29.370 --> 01:22:32.190
he was stage managing and you weren't allowed to talk to him.

1434
01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:34.970
He had to talk to his manager and he would say like right next to,

1435
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:38.850
there's a guy like the blue collar,
pretty guy,
you know,
you know,

1436
01:22:38.851 --> 01:22:40.380
they didn't like him in Indiana.

1437
01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:45.420
I was in Indiana for a fight and they showed John Mellon camps picture in the

1438
01:22:45.421 --> 01:22:50.310
fucking whole crowd booed.
That's what I said and they said,
cause he's a liberal

1439
01:22:53.250 --> 01:22:57.780
because he's,
I don't know what he did or said.
I don't know what I don't know.

1440
01:22:57.810 --> 01:22:59.700
I don't know what it is,
but man,

1441
01:22:59.701 --> 01:23:02.880
there was like a bunch of booze and I couldn't believe it.
I was like,

1442
01:23:02.881 --> 01:23:07.070
this is John Mellencamp.
Like we're in Indianapolis.
He's from this area.
Yeah,

1443
01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:10.530
I was born in a small town,
you know,
that's him.
Like is that,

1444
01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:14.290
that's why I hit like a ball.
Them,
those women that were talked about,

1445
01:23:14.291 --> 01:23:17.260
I wasn't surprised by any of them,
but by John Mellencamp,

1446
01:23:17.261 --> 01:23:19.540
I thought he was like the gritty rammed earth.

1447
01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.960
Like Bruce Springsteen is notoriously personable.

1448
01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.120
Like have you talked to Bruce Springsteen?

1449
01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:27.850
Like Brian Cowen had a conversation with Bruce Springsteen and he said,

1450
01:23:28.150 --> 01:23:32.230
you talked to that guy and you would think that he's a fucking,
you know,

1451
01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:36.100
whatever.
He owns a company or he's a fucking banker or is it a normal dude?

1452
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:40.150
He did,
but obviously charismatic and interesting and intelligent,

1453
01:23:40.151 --> 01:23:42.890
but he doesn't have any airs about them.
I was doing Conan.

1454
01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:46.250
I went and Bruce came up to visit Max.
The drummer into the,

1455
01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:51.100
their needs in the same group.
And uh,
I know you know that,
but,
uh,
he,

1456
01:23:51.101 --> 01:23:54.240
uh,
Bruce comes up to me and he says,
you know something about standup and,

1457
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:58.090
and I said,
I guess he met if I ever open for anybody though.
Yes,
I have.

1458
01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:02.470
And I said,
you know what,
I would never ever open for you.
So I said,

1459
01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:04.300
what a fucking nightmare.
I said,

1460
01:24:04.301 --> 01:24:06.790
the curtain goes down and they're all going Bruce,

1461
01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:09.490
than the curtain comes up and I'm standing there with a mic and I go,

1462
01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:12.610
you're not Bruce.
We want Bruce,

1463
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:16.030
whoever the fuck you are getaway.
Those are,

1464
01:24:16.031 --> 01:24:18.880
that's a hard thing when you're opening for somebody when they want the other

1465
01:24:18.881 --> 01:24:21.070
person.
That's a shitty thing to say too.

1466
01:24:21.071 --> 01:24:24.970
I've seen people open for other comics and you know,
bringing,
bring out,
you know,

1467
01:24:24.971 --> 01:24:28.870
tosh or bring out,
you know,
stabbed me on the bill.

1468
01:24:29.050 --> 01:24:33.100
So it wasn't like I was surprised I was on the bill.
I was one of the marquee.

1469
01:24:33.190 --> 01:24:37.030
That's big.
Yeah.
That's big different.
Yeah.
So people prepare,

1470
01:24:37.031 --> 01:24:38.650
they know you're part of the program.
Well,

1471
01:24:38.651 --> 01:24:42.010
you remember the whole bill birth thing,
the Philly thing?
Yeah.

1472
01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:45.660
You know that started with me.
Yeah.
You know that story?
Yeah.

1473
01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:49.480
Well those ONA crowds,
the past who I love,

1474
01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:53.350
but those guys are fucking notoriously mean.

1475
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:55.960
They're notoriously mean if things go bad.

1476
01:24:56.410 --> 01:24:58.600
But the thing that happened was they were so drunk,

1477
01:24:58.630 --> 01:25:03.160
all they way with all they wonder was Jim Norton,
Jim Norton,
even he,

1478
01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:05.380
the only one that had a great set was bill,

1479
01:25:05.410 --> 01:25:08.320
because he'd be rated the fucking people.
And I even told them,

1480
01:25:08.530 --> 01:25:12.210
a couple of people booed me.
I says,
you know what?
Make a $12,000 for 10 minutes.

1481
01:25:12.230 --> 01:25:14.470
Go back to your mother's basements.
You fucking retard.

1482
01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:18.760
You're macerated Lazarus looks.

1483
01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:23.560
And then I got to cheer.
And Bill was still made.
It goes,
he says to me like,

1484
01:25:23.561 --> 01:25:26.830
I don't let him know on me.
He goes,
they booed dot Merera.
I go,

1485
01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:28.930
I am dumb or don't worry about it.

1486
01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:32.110
And I went on the speaker and I just sat there.
I was crying,

1487
01:25:32.111 --> 01:25:35.560
laughing and the funniest thing he said,
he put down everything,
the eagles,

1488
01:25:35.561 --> 01:25:40.390
the flyers,
the Liberty Bell,
the Liberty Bell fucked the Liberty Bowl.
Oh,

1489
01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:44.160
he's talking about how racist they are all the best boxers in the world.
You,

1490
01:25:44.161 --> 01:25:47.120
you fucking,
you go after a fictitious character.

1491
01:25:47.121 --> 01:25:49.270
She is white guy was five foot five.

1492
01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.310
You know what he said to me?

1493
01:25:54.311 --> 01:25:58.120
He said he had to stop doing them because people expected him to lay into them.

1494
01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.550
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
There was a,
that was a,
I was,

1495
01:26:00.551 --> 01:26:04.070
it was a point in time after that where like that became like what?
He was

1496
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:07.370
<v 1>known for you.
It could get mad.
You could go bad like that.</v>

1497
01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:08.930
You could get stuck in a carer.
Yeah.

1498
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:12.300
Like there's guys that are stuck in characters.
Oh yeah.

1499
01:26:12.490 --> 01:26:16.110
Like dice is stuck in a character.
Imagine being a 70 year old days.

1500
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:21.560
I think he's funny.
I know you and him have problems.
I like them.
This one of my,

1501
01:26:21.670 --> 01:26:24.860
it just certain times in life you have friends that don't like each other.

1502
01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.290
That's just one of those days.
A friend.

1503
01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:30.940
I'm a way better friend of you tell you right now so that I am friends with
dice.

1504
01:26:30.941 --> 01:26:32.760
Right.
I like that.
As long as they're not easy,

1505
01:26:32.770 --> 01:26:36.920
but I love you like I love you too.
My brother right back,
I did.
Oh my friend,

1506
01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:39.620
but like you know,

1507
01:26:39.650 --> 01:26:44.650
he kind of became that guy for folks who don't know Andrew Silverstein was

1508
01:26:45.381 --> 01:26:48.500
Andrew Silverstein and Andrew Silverstein used to go on stage and used to have
a,

1509
01:26:48.501 --> 01:26:51.800
a variety of different impressions.
He used to do a tremendous,

1510
01:26:51.801 --> 01:26:55.190
John Travolta Travolta was actually,
he was actually,
he's an excellent actor.

1511
01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:56.480
Very good actor.

1512
01:26:56.481 --> 01:27:00.980
Very good impression as you do all these things and then he would do dice man.

1513
01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:06.520
Oh,
just all over it.
The Jews and the dice man character in his act,

1514
01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:09.260
you know that's from buddy love.
What's that buddy?

1515
01:27:09.261 --> 01:27:10.640
Love was in the nutty professor.

1516
01:27:10.641 --> 01:27:14.300
That's the characters to directly derivative from that.
Really?
Yeah.

1517
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:18.440
He was doing either love in the nutty professor is that the 90 professor is

1518
01:27:18.441 --> 01:27:21.900
Jerry Lewis and like he takes a serum and changes to a different guy.
Well,

1519
01:27:21.901 --> 01:27:24.500
what do change it?
I need to see that any changes to that guy?

1520
01:27:24.501 --> 01:27:28.110
That's the character that dice became.
Really?
Huh?
Paul pudge.

1521
01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:33.110
Jamie in lieu illuminate the world.
Jerry Lewis,
nutty professor buddy love,

1522
01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:36.770
and it will be in Kilkenny in two weeks.
Are you going to go there?
Ireland.
Oh,

1523
01:27:36.771 --> 01:27:40.880
you son of a pet lover.
I've only performed a Dublin and Belfast,

1524
01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:44.240
Northern Ireland and,
Oh,
did you love it up into bell fed animals?

1525
01:27:44.241 --> 01:27:49.070
They call me the godfather of Kilkenny's.
Okay.
Find it.
But look,

1526
01:27:49.071 --> 01:27:53.690
he the way he looks.
So he became like a slick guy.
Is that what it is?
Well that,

1527
01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:58.160
yeah.
See if you can find something that way.
Hmm.

1528
01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.160
Jerry Lewis as buddy love tax man steak and all my Joe,

1529
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:08.480
we've got a world that swings.
Whoa.
Oh my God.
It is.
Give me some volume here.

1530
01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:14.800
Wow.
He comes out as a cool guy with a cigarette in his hair slicked back.

1531
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:16.320
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1532
01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:24.390
<v 1>Wow.
Look at the people in the audience.
Back then chicken was beautiful</v>

1533
01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:30.620
<v 5>sleep fee and young and James [inaudible] and I've got,</v>

1534
01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:37.930
oh well that's fine.
What

1535
01:28:38.170 --> 01:28:43.120
<v 1>kind of bullshit is this?
This just shows you how culture evolves.</v>

1536
01:28:44.230 --> 01:28:49.230
Have you ever seen the look how hot she is fucking googly Mooglie but they'll

1537
01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:52.210
let the broad on the leftover.
I going to cock block.

1538
01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.520
Jerry's going to try to make nice to her,

1539
01:28:55.810 --> 01:28:59.080
come over and say hi and the other one's going to drool all over him.
But yeah,

1540
01:28:59.081 --> 01:29:01.860
he is kind of like at a see the character,
the character.

1541
01:29:01.861 --> 01:29:04.780
I mean he's still seeing and find it.
He admitted that he was uh,

1542
01:29:04.890 --> 01:29:08.310
he was doing buddy low.
Really?
Yeah.
He never said that it was,
you know,
his,

1543
01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.750
his character.
I'm,
I'm almost positive on that.
Wow.
I did not know.

1544
01:29:12.751 --> 01:29:15.660
I never saw the was one of his many impressions.

1545
01:29:15.690 --> 01:29:19.440
I never even saw the g the Eddie Murphy version.
No,
I didn't see it as I,

1546
01:29:19.441 --> 01:29:21.420
so Jerry Lewis's,
I never saw it.

1547
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:26.870
So that sit and listen and watch that old is load is wrong.

1548
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:33.400
Got Sexy Lights.
How come back?

1549
01:29:33.450 --> 01:29:34.800
We were talking about this the other day.

1550
01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:39.240
How come nobody cared about girls asses back then?
Other credit goes tits.

1551
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:41.490
There was no big assets back then.

1552
01:29:42.090 --> 01:29:46.680
Girls who aren't doing squats like you go to girls now they're all wearing

1553
01:29:46.681 --> 01:29:51.360
fucking yoga pay Melman rose as she couldn't even be one of the fly girls.

1554
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:55.680
How about that?
How about that?
Jayne Mansfield,
Marilyn Monroe,
those girls,
they,

1555
01:29:55.681 --> 01:29:59.070
I mean they had a different kind of body.
It was obviously very beautiful,

1556
01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:03.630
but they did not have like there's some ridiculous Instagram girls that have

1557
01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:06.750
like 2 million followers on Instagram and they have these giant butts.

1558
01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:08.340
Like look at Maryland and rose ass.

1559
01:30:08.730 --> 01:30:12.990
Get close up on that gym workout like women today.
That's what I'm saying.
Dom,

1560
01:30:12.991 --> 01:30:15.060
what happened?
I mean that's not a bad ass.

1561
01:30:15.090 --> 01:30:18.600
That's a very nice ass fuck Mount Moriah,
which certainly do that,

1562
01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:21.210
but it's a little on the flat side.
I'd have to look at her.

1563
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:25.410
I'd have to flip her over.
I'd have to look her eye to eye,
which is fine with me.

1564
01:30:25.450 --> 01:30:28.320
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this beautiful later,
best either,

1565
01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:30.920
but it's just there.
That's actually a pretty good sure.

1566
01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:35.400
Her back's arched up there on the upper left,
down,
down,

1567
01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:37.320
right in the middle.
There you go.
Yeah.

1568
01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:42.560
But still like you compare that to like the style of body that women ascribed,

1569
01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:48.860
uh,
aspire to today.
I mean,
everyone was like the hourglass figure.
We'll do that.

1570
01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:51.450
The hourglass is very different shaped now.

1571
01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:56.070
Like you look at like the fucking Jennifer Lopez style asses,

1572
01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:58.920
you know,
I love her body.
Yeah.

1573
01:30:58.921 --> 01:31:02.700
I mean girls have just different assets now.
I mean,

1574
01:31:02.701 --> 01:31:06.750
and it's like Reince has evolved.
It has,
I mean,

1575
01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:10.140
girls never had asses like that.
This is like a big thing.

1576
01:31:10.170 --> 01:31:14.940
Like we want big muscular asses now where it's like,

1577
01:31:14.941 --> 01:31:17.670
if you look at like playboy from just a few years ago,

1578
01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:20.940
there was no girls that had big giant assets like that.
And it was,
it was,

1579
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:23.870
it didn't exist.
This is a new fad diet.

1580
01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:27.390
I'd rather her ass be a little big than too small.
Oh,
definitely.

1581
01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:30.240
I like girls with a little body fat on them.
I think it's sexy.

1582
01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:33.210
Six sickest thing I've ever heard was a comedian friend of mine.
He goes,

1583
01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:36.190
Oh fuck shit.
She had such a nice,
it was like a little boy.

1584
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.810
Scary
Pool.

1585
01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:47.100
Did you find any uh,
buddy love?
It's gotta exist.

1586
01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:49.860
It's the youtube,
the youtube has everything.

1587
01:31:49.861 --> 01:31:53.770
God dammit just found the full movies.
Oh,
okay.
All right.

1588
01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:57.090
Cut through that shit and get to the heart of the matter.

1589
01:31:57.570 --> 01:32:01.750
So in the nutty professor,
do you take like a potion and it became this cool guy?

1590
01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:06.690
Just real well,
it's here and Geeky stuff.

1591
01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:07.721
It's just weird.

1592
01:32:07.721 --> 01:32:12.160
The style of love movies and alive of entertainment.

1593
01:32:12.161 --> 01:32:15.610
Like when he was sitting there singing that terrible song in front of all those

1594
01:32:15.611 --> 01:32:16.061
people,

1595
01:32:16.061 --> 01:32:19.630
it's like people actually went to see something like that and they enjoyed it.

1596
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:24.340
You know,
the world has changed in so many weird ways,
man.

1597
01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:27.100
So many weird ways that it's like,
it's,

1598
01:32:27.150 --> 01:32:30.520
it's hard to keep up with it or it's hard to,
uh,
to be,

1599
01:32:30.521 --> 01:32:34.390
to like put it into perspective and less.
He'd go back and watch old stuff.

1600
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:36.840
Is this his character?
I haven't got it all

1601
01:32:36.890 --> 01:32:40.460
<v 5>nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Here it is.</v>

1602
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:45.080
She's crazy about me.
Also.
No.

1603
01:32:45.081 --> 01:32:50.030
Last weekend jr you bought your drink about last night.

1604
01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:54.050
Tried to explain what happened.
I told you I was going to tell you it's a

1605
01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:57.680
why don't we kind of table it awhile sweetie?
Huh?

1606
01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:01.880
I mean all the kids that kind of waiting,
you know,
it's Dullsville out.

1607
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:07.160
I'll be back.
You take five and I love it baby.
Madison.
Seely you wait for me,
Huh?

1608
01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:10.360
Oh there ya sweets.

1609
01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:11.733
<v 1>Hello.</v>

1610
01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:17.810
So all these girls come running up to the table and he's going to play the
piano.

1611
01:33:17.811 --> 01:33:19.990
He's drinking.
Huh?
Does this shot?

1612
01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:27.810
Got Something?
She's gorgeous and she find out what it is.

1613
01:33:28.050 --> 01:33:30.820
He's got something.
I think I'll do a

1614
01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:34.290
<v 5>do a tour that I'm going to</v>

1615
01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:40.390
<v 1>record for a poverty records.
Sounds like Sinatra little.
Oh,
well he's,</v>

1616
01:33:40.410 --> 01:33:42.410
his formula is wearing off,
right?

1617
01:33:42.411 --> 01:33:45.560
Isn't that what's supposed to be happening here?
He's like Mr. Cool Guy.

1618
01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:51.020
Not hilarious.
The idea that he can't continue to act like this.
It's impossible.

1619
01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:55.850
Not a stupid premise.
See,
it's coming out.

1620
01:33:58.660 --> 01:33:59.493
<v 6>Go on.</v>

1621
01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:08.080
<v 1>Hi Laney Ribo flavoring hardware your near me.</v>

1622
01:34:12.610 --> 01:34:14.240
Hi Amanda.

1623
01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:17.433
<v 6>Uh,</v>

1624
01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:24.420
<v 1>what's happening?
Look,
she's turning to our friend.
What's happening?</v>

1625
01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:29.850
Uh,
I think that'll be it for a while.

1626
01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:35.370
Kids that just get them run away.
Turned back into the professor,

1627
01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:40.000
the nerdy professor who can't get the girls.
Oh,

1628
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:43.260
I like the girl on our wedding night who's absent minded.

1629
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:48.230
Husband goes home to his mother for dinner.
Boy movie sucked back then.

1630
01:34:48.530 --> 01:34:52.880
Jesus Christ.
Could you imagine,
I mean that's almost like a parody of a movie.

1631
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:55.360
Yeah.
I mean it's almost like a parody of you.

1632
01:34:55.361 --> 01:35:00.050
If you ever seen like some of the old stuff back when Liberace was a heartthrob

1633
01:35:00.710 --> 01:35:05.120
no.
Oh my God.
Pull up around Liberace winks at me.

1634
01:35:05.630 --> 01:35:07.280
This is one of my favorite things when I,

1635
01:35:07.281 --> 01:35:11.330
when I think about it like it was straight.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Forever.

1636
01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:14.780
For the longest time they would always ask him Liberace when you get to get

1637
01:35:14.781 --> 01:35:18.610
married.
Wow.
And just trying to find the right Gal.
But it's hard.

1638
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:21.770
But you,
when you watch this,

1639
01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:26.330
when you watch like him and you realize when Liberace winks at me like this was

1640
01:35:26.331 --> 01:35:30.990
like crank this shit.
Like when guys that are gay,
when try and act like this,

1641
01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:34.250
this is a girl sitting at home.

1642
01:35:34.251 --> 01:35:39.140
She's writing like a fan letter and Liberace is on the TV

1643
01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:45.890
and watch when he winks,
it makes a crazy noise.
Like,
watch this.

1644
01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:52.793
<v 7>Look at this.</v>

1645
01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:57.940
[inaudible] hi [inaudible].

1646
01:36:01.770 --> 01:36:02.950
Hey,

1647
01:36:05.530 --> 01:36:08.200
<v 1>you've got the other thing playing on the background,
Jamie.
Hold on.</v>

1648
01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:13.850
Get it together,
bitch.
Hold on.
Pause it.
Don't go to your Twitter shine.

1649
01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:17.860
Jesus Christ you far.
Mayawati how dare you.
What have you done?

1650
01:36:17.861 --> 01:36:21.160
You've ruined this whole Liberace moment.
There we go.
Go back to it.

1651
01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:26.780
<v 7>[inaudible] so natural.</v>

1652
01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:33.960
Luckily [inaudible] get it.

1653
01:36:35.730 --> 01:36:38.990
Liver clinked putting blame links.

1654
01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:45.830
[inaudible]

1655
01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:55.720
that's what happens when Liberace winks at me.
Here comes,
listen to this,

1656
01:36:59.490 --> 01:37:04.010
the clean,
when he wins.
This is so weird.
I'm ready.

1657
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:15.550
<v 1>I mean,
okay,
you can kill it.
But I mean he didn't even sing.
You know this a,</v>

1658
01:37:15.551 --> 01:37:18.310
is this the girl singing and his famous thing?

1659
01:37:18.311 --> 01:37:22.510
Let's play on the guitar or playing the piano.
Right,
but it was enough.
He,

1660
01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:26.020
that's all you needed.
He didn't,
I mean he sang in some other cities.

1661
01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:29.230
I don't remember saying right.
Didn't Liberace sing

1662
01:37:31.210 --> 01:37:35.980
somewhere over the rainbow?
He had to have sung man,

1663
01:37:36.010 --> 01:37:38.620
maybe it didn't.
I don't remember him saying it really.

1664
01:37:39.010 --> 01:37:43.690
That doesn't mean he didn't sing.
I wasn't a big fan drone or a huge fan.

1665
01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:47.350
I was a big fan.
Yeah,
the poster right next to the fair Fawcett poster.

1666
01:37:50.110 --> 01:37:52.450
But it's just,
it's weird when you look at old culture,

1667
01:37:52.451 --> 01:37:55.060
when you look at things that were just here he goes,
is he singing?

1668
01:37:56.370 --> 01:38:01.050
He singing deliberate hace show.
There's no,
no,
he's not.

1669
01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:05.730
He's not miked people who need people.
Oh,
he's talking to the song.

1670
01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:14.200
They're the luckiest people.
Oh,
kill that.
Kill that.
Before we go girl,

1671
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:16.230
we can all turn gay just watching that,

1672
01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:21.420
that fucking documentary or that movie rather than he did about him for Hbo with

1673
01:38:21.421 --> 01:38:25.850
Matt Damon and um,
the Fox,
his name Kirk Douglas or Michael Douglas.

1674
01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:29.770
Michael Douglas in Jesus Christ.
That was good.
Did you ever see that?
Oh,

1675
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:34.020
I heard it was really so good.
It's so good and so crazy.
Cause he's Liberace.

1676
01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:38.730
Douglas Douglas,
Michael Douglas Playing Matt Damon Played His boyfriend.
Oh God.

1677
01:38:40.110 --> 01:38:41.880
He's such a good actor.
He's so good actor.

1678
01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:46.110
But he had all this crazy plastic surgery to look like Liberace.

1679
01:38:46.110 --> 01:38:47.820
The boyfriend did in real life.

1680
01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:51.810
So they've got all this prosthetics on Matt Damon and make his Chin stick out.

1681
01:38:51.811 --> 01:38:53.940
And at the beginning of the film he's beautiful.

1682
01:38:53.941 --> 01:38:56.010
Matt Damon probably really looks,

1683
01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:59.970
but then as the film goes on,
yeah,
look at him.

1684
01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:04.020
He starts to get all of this plastic surgery.
Yeah.

1685
01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:09.000
See if they have it looks like a news.
Looks like Diane Sawyer.
Yeah,

1686
01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.460
I shouldn't say that.
It was really good.

1687
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:16.050
It's really good cause I don't think it was too overblown.

1688
01:39:16.051 --> 01:39:20.250
I think it was really like fairly realistic,
much fun.
He had played in that,

1689
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:25.050
I don't know if you're ready for Hollywood shuffle.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1690
01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:29.630
<v 0>A gay friend of mine who I went to college with and that is,</v>

1691
01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:31.340
then we just call him Vinnie the Benny.

1692
01:39:31.730 --> 01:39:34.760
And the reason I got the character was my wife and I were going down to their

1693
01:39:34.761 --> 01:39:37.520
college reunion and this is when he got gay or,
and Garrett,

1694
01:39:37.521 --> 01:39:39.830
cause he was a hairdresser on Broadway and he's really good dude.

1695
01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:43.730
He's driving me down and I go,
if any you want to be here,
he goes now,
thanks don.

1696
01:39:43.731 --> 01:39:47.390
But you have one that they did that little left,

1697
01:39:49.670 --> 01:39:53.600
<v 1>whatever happened to Robert Townsend.
He's another one now.
That guy was a killer.</v>

1698
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:55.670
I remember he used to do those HBO specials.

1699
01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:59.430
We'd have all the different comics APP and yeah.
You know,
and he would like,

1700
01:39:59.431 --> 01:40:03.620
he had these elaborate sets and he was hosting it and he had all his movies.

1701
01:40:03.690 --> 01:40:03.970
Movie

1702
01:40:03.970 --> 01:40:06.300
<v 0>was so funny with Damon and Keenan.</v>

1703
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:11.350
Wayne's and John Witherspoon and he had a bunch of good movies we had with Joe

1704
01:40:11.401 --> 01:40:13.710
when we shot that movie,
we were fucking crying,

1705
01:40:13.711 --> 01:40:18.570
laughing with someone happened to him.
Man,
I don't know.
I don't know.
Fuck.

1706
01:40:18.571 --> 01:40:21.660
You know,
he stole a bit of mine and that's how he got in the movie.

1707
01:40:21.661 --> 01:40:25.290
He remembered my school for Italians.
Yeah.
Is it a school?
I teach?

1708
01:40:25.291 --> 01:40:30.291
Italians had to be more Italian and he had a school for actors teach black

1709
01:40:30.661 --> 01:40:33.870
actors teaching black actors had to be more black.
Right.

1710
01:40:33.871 --> 01:40:37.890
So it's basically rip off and we're watching the Georgetown von over game at his

1711
01:40:37.891 --> 01:40:41.810
house and he tells me,
he shows me this thing.
And I said,
well Robert,
that's his,

1712
01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:44.610
you know,
he wanted me to do a part in the movie,
but he was also showing me,

1713
01:40:44.630 --> 01:40:48.630
you know,
just when you know,
I kind of borrowed some.
I said,
but that's mine,

1714
01:40:48.631 --> 01:40:52.380
you know.
I said,
you know,
not that it,
yeah,
I,
you even let them do it.
And he goes,

1715
01:40:52.381 --> 01:40:54.070
I never saw you.
It,
I go,
we worked together

1716
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:57.570
<v 1>every fucking night.
We did Improv on stage together.</v>

1717
01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:01.900
How could you not see it with your mind?
Shut down.
It was wasn't in pair.
Yeah.

1718
01:41:02.170 --> 01:41:04.690
People will say that.
People will say that.

1719
01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:08.530
I've seen guys say that that work with guys and then steal a bit is that I never

1720
01:41:08.531 --> 01:41:12.700
saw you do it like bitch,
you saw him do it.
Some do it a hundred times.
Maybe.

1721
01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:14.890
That was a big thing at the laugh factory.

1722
01:41:14.891 --> 01:41:17.160
That was one of the reasons why I stopped going to the left isn't happening.

1723
01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:21.820
You should come back.
Oh by the way.
Yeah.
June 9th if you're available to,
is that,

1724
01:41:22.110 --> 01:41:26.200
it's a Tuesdays.
My next one.
Oh Man,
I'm in dumb.

1725
01:41:26.290 --> 01:41:30.760
I want to get the you and Joey.
Oh,
wait a minute.
Yeah,
no,
I'm good.
I'll go ahead.

1726
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:35.620
Yeah.
The ninth I'll be uh,
um,
yeah,
I'm in Irvine that weekend.
Yeah.

1727
01:41:35.710 --> 01:41:40.120
I mean,
we'll get this with us.
Let's do it.
I loved the US do it.

1728
01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:43.780
Dia's was on fucking fire last night.

1729
01:41:44.170 --> 01:41:48.070
The funniest guy in the world ever.
He's the funniest guy of all time.

1730
01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:52.930
Fucking great.
Last night at the fucking Olr in the comedy store,
I was crying.

1731
01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:56.660
I mean,
tears were rolling down my hair,
my eyes rather.
Cause he,

1732
01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:00.370
does he say your whole name too?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Tom Or wherever.
Listen.

1733
01:42:00.371 --> 01:42:02.890
Dot My river.
I'll tell you right now,
these fucking bitches,

1734
01:42:02.891 --> 01:42:05.630
they got nothing for me.
Yeah.
He tells everybody.

1735
01:42:05.631 --> 01:42:07.360
He tells us everybody's full name.

1736
01:42:07.361 --> 01:42:12.070
How it's quite as dire guy like him peeking now.
I love it.
Love it.
Well,
you know,

1737
01:42:12.071 --> 01:42:15.480
I was the biggest Joey Diaz supporter of all time.
I was,
I was,

1738
01:42:15.490 --> 01:42:17.710
I would take him on the road.
Me when agents,

1739
01:42:17.711 --> 01:42:20.890
I used to have this old age and then fucking hated Joey and he would,
you know,

1740
01:42:20.891 --> 01:42:22.630
would say,
I just don't think the guy's talented.
I don't want,

1741
01:42:22.631 --> 01:42:24.790
you're taking him with me,
man.
You're out of your mind.
I go,

1742
01:42:24.791 --> 01:42:27.490
you're out of your mind.
I think you're,
I think this guy is holding you back.

1743
01:42:27.491 --> 01:42:30.100
I think it makes your show look bad.
Like please shut the fuck up.

1744
01:42:30.101 --> 01:42:33.250
You don't know what you're talking about.
Just stop.
Just stop talking.

1745
01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:38.420
And that guy has vanished.
Very generous you,
I mean you did it with Ari and B,

1746
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:39.850
you know,
and I love those guys.

1747
01:42:39.851 --> 01:42:43.780
But I mean it was great that you had the power and the unselfishness to help

1748
01:42:43.781 --> 01:42:45.300
those guys careers.
Well,

1749
01:42:45.370 --> 01:42:48.610
one of the things about the comedy store where we all work on a regular basis,

1750
01:42:48.611 --> 01:42:51.880
we get to see guys who are good and guys were not good.
You know,

1751
01:42:51.881 --> 01:42:54.760
and our said to me once,
he like,
when you took me on the road,
I,
you know,

1752
01:42:54.761 --> 01:42:57.550
I wasn't funny.
I go,
that's not true.
You were funny.

1753
01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.790
You just weren't funny all the time.
But the times you were funny,

1754
01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:04.520
you were really fucking Nebraska Ju yeah it was.

1755
01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:11.860
He just,
he's a fucking great comic.
He just needed to develop,

1756
01:43:11.861 --> 01:43:15.460
I mean it's all it is,
but he had that ability.
But like,

1757
01:43:15.630 --> 01:43:18.790
I mean maybe it would be like two out of three bits would be killer and one of

1758
01:43:18.791 --> 01:43:22.990
them wouldn't be so hot,
but those two were fucking killing.
You know,

1759
01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:27.160
most comics are notoriously hard on themselves.
Like I'm very,

1760
01:43:27.161 --> 01:43:30.040
very self critical.
It's one of the reasons why I don't like compliments.

1761
01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:33.730
I'm just,
I'm always,
I dissect the shit out of my act,

1762
01:43:33.731 --> 01:43:35.950
but it's also one of the what?
What makes it good?

1763
01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:38.440
Cause I try to cut it out and trim the fat.

1764
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:40.870
So that's like always opinion as well.

1765
01:43:40.871 --> 01:43:42.880
He was like looking himself like it wasn't good back then.

1766
01:43:42.881 --> 01:43:47.290
It was like just not true.
You will,
you had the ability to be very,

1767
01:43:47.291 --> 01:43:49.060
very funny.
It just didn't always work out.

1768
01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:52.970
It's because you were still learning to be a comic.
It's like guys,
I knew that,

1769
01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:54.350
I knew that about Dunkin.

1770
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:58.730
I knew that about Diaz and I knew that about Ra because I saw them there all the

1771
01:43:58.731 --> 01:44:01.730
time.
I knew they had it.
They just had to do it.
I didn't know.

1772
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:04.100
I mean I especially didn't know Dunkin cause he never mentioned it.

1773
01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:08.000
I would call it per spots.
He would take my spot.
Then we always had a good time.

1774
01:44:08.001 --> 01:44:10.490
Always like the kid,
he never even told me was a comedian.

1775
01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:15.580
Then all of a sudden he's doing it an x rated ventriloquist and then we'll do is

1776
01:44:15.581 --> 01:44:19.760
say tannic.
Ventral goes,
it's a little,
yeah,
little hobos.
Fucking awesome.

1777
01:44:19.761 --> 01:44:23.900
Somebody Stole Little Hobo.
He had to get a new little Hobo cod.
Fuck with steel.

1778
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:27.080
You're pumping asshole.
I hope whoever you are you fuck.

1779
01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:29.900
I hope Liberal Little Hobo haunts you in your sleep.

1780
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:34.580
Stole a little hoe about how rude.
Yeah,
he's a,

1781
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:37.820
those guys are just,
but just,
you know,

1782
01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:41.120
I got to see them in the beginning.
You know,
I got to see them.

1783
01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:44.300
I got to see Dunkin like one of his first times ever on stage already.

1784
01:44:44.301 --> 01:44:47.330
Same thing.
I got to see Ari when he was essentially an open miker.

1785
01:44:47.331 --> 01:44:50.120
We became friends when he was an open miker and Diaz.

1786
01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:54.770
He had had a few years in his belt in Denver and in Seattle.
He had a few years,

1787
01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:58.490
but he was still putting it together,
but I just knew,
man,
I would just see,

1788
01:44:58.491 --> 01:45:01.640
I'd see those sparks,
those moments number when he was,

1789
01:45:01.641 --> 01:45:05.210
the voice were left for them with Lyft factory when they just plants his feet

1790
01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:12.260
just has that rant.
He destroyed the laugh factory two weeks ago.

1791
01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:15.590
It was a two weeks ago we did a show.
Oh,
he destroyed it,
but I'm telling you,

1792
01:45:15.591 --> 01:45:17.440
it wasn't like last night.
Last night I,

1793
01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:20.390
I don't want to say the bits that he was doing because they're all new bits.

1794
01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:25.010
I don't want to say what the premises where,
holy fuck.
We were crying.

1795
01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:27.860
There was like,
you know,
the audience was,
it was pretty good size,
you know,

1796
01:45:27.861 --> 01:45:30.410
and maybe a hundred people,
but all the comics in the back of the room,

1797
01:45:30.730 --> 01:45:35.390
we were just crying,
just crying.
I mean literally tears pouring down my eyes.

1798
01:45:35.391 --> 01:45:39.170
I watched this whole set and then went home.
And uh,
Adam,
you know,
Adam said,

1799
01:45:39.171 --> 01:45:39.801
it's so crazy,

1800
01:45:39.801 --> 01:45:43.180
like you've known that guy for so fucking long and you still laugh that hard and

1801
01:45:43.190 --> 01:45:47.960
you still go to CSS.
He's free,
he's free.
He's so free.

1802
01:45:48.170 --> 01:45:51.170
I remember he used to follow me at the lift at the comedy store,

1803
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:56.470
so we had like a small friendship were always buddies and he used to get so

1804
01:45:56.901 --> 01:46:00.980
nervous.
Yeah.
And it was so different.
He was,
he really broke through.

1805
01:46:00.981 --> 01:46:03.440
But it shows you about this,
that doesn't happen.

1806
01:46:03.441 --> 01:46:07.680
The athletes you don't break through at 40,
50.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.

1807
01:46:08.230 --> 01:46:11.270
Yeah.
It's interesting because Joey's like 51 now I think,

1808
01:46:11.271 --> 01:46:13.550
or 52 and really never been better.

1809
01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:18.580
Never been better and didn't really catch for like maybe I just want to say like

1810
01:46:18.741 --> 01:46:21.560
five,
six years ago people started to know who he was and you know,

1811
01:46:21.561 --> 01:46:23.720
I could tell the difference when I would take them on the road,

1812
01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:26.840
I'll take them on the road.
Um,
and,
um,
people would like,

1813
01:46:26.841 --> 01:46:29.240
I would do a theater or something like that and Joey would go on stage and

1814
01:46:29.241 --> 01:46:32.730
people just wouldn't know who he was and they would start laughing after awhile,

1815
01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:35.570
but they would give a nice,
polite round of applause when he got on stage.

1816
01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:39.830
Now when Julie goes on stage,
I film it sometimes just to show people,

1817
01:46:39.831 --> 01:46:42.720
I put it on Youtube.
There's a video,
you could find it on youtube.

1818
01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:47.020
Find Joey Diaz going onstage.
It's,

1819
01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:50.430
it's fucking insane.
I think Joey Dee is going on stage in Denver.

1820
01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:54.810
One of the reasons why I did a theater in Denver was because Wendy had banned

1821
01:46:54.811 --> 01:46:57.310
Joey.
She,
she uses them now.
Like they,
they,

1822
01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:59.700
they smooth it over and he actually works at club now.

1823
01:47:00.090 --> 01:47:04.530
But he had some instance back in his old drug do using days where he's out of

1824
01:47:04.531 --> 01:47:08.100
his fucking mind and they banned him from the club,
you know,
common shit.

1825
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:09.383
Richard Pryor's,

1826
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:12.240
Sam Kinison got banned from the comedy store about a hundred times,
you know,

1827
01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:14.190
but um,
I know it was there.

1828
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:19.170
Joey goes on stage and the fucking round of applause was so crazy.

1829
01:47:19.171 --> 01:47:22.230
I had a film,
right.
It was insane.
They knew who he was.

1830
01:47:22.231 --> 01:47:27.150
And this was like two years ago maybe,
I want to say.
So it was,

1831
01:47:27.210 --> 01:47:31.560
it was a few years in and he was just starting to realize that they had caught

1832
01:47:31.561 --> 01:47:33.210
on.
So for the longest time,

1833
01:47:33.211 --> 01:47:36.090
it's like I had been singing this guy's praises and nobody had,

1834
01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:38.820
nobody knew who the fuck he was.
They didn't,
they just didn't get it.

1835
01:47:39.210 --> 01:47:43.590
And then finally you find it.
It's Toronto.
I know.
It's not Toronto.

1836
01:47:43.591 --> 01:47:47.400
That's me.
That's me.
Stop.
No,
that's not Joey Diaz.

1837
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:52.380
That's Joe Rogan goes on.
Stays at Massey Hall.
You silly bitch.
It's not me,

1838
01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:56.520
Joe.
Joey can't even get to Toronto.
Trust me,
Joey.

1839
01:47:56.550 --> 01:48:00.030
You gotta say Joey Diaz goes on stage.
There's a,
there's a video,

1840
01:48:00.930 --> 01:48:05.280
son of a bitch.
How dare you.
He can't,

1841
01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:08.790
he can't get the Canada.
Yeah,
I know.
They won't let them in.
Yeah,

1842
01:48:08.791 --> 01:48:12.690
he told me I was,
uh,
I was trying to work with him somewhere.
Armed kidnapping.

1843
01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:14.213
Yeah.

1844
01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:18.080
<v 0>Bring somebody into another room.
Kidnapping and armed robbery had a machine gun.</v>

1845
01:48:18.081 --> 01:48:20.260
He stole coke from somebody to,
they really,

1846
01:48:21.110 --> 01:48:25.090
we know we sometimes we,
we split the bill at the Ice House.
Him and I'm,
yeah.

1847
01:48:25.091 --> 01:48:26.830
Yeah.
Those are great.
Shows.
Fun.

1848
01:48:27.710 --> 01:48:30.680
I told you what he said to me the first time we did it.
I said,
Joe,

1849
01:48:30.681 --> 01:48:32.900
whatever you want to do,
want to go on for a second interview?
He goes,

1850
01:48:32.901 --> 01:48:33.920
I'll tell you what though,
Maria,

1851
01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:38.960
why don't you go to the first show and going first to go close the first show

1852
01:48:38.961 --> 01:48:42.490
close second so you don't have to follow a pig like me that late.
They get,

1853
01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:43.493
and then you go to,

1854
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:47.630
you can go to the laugh factory down the set that only you could make you give

1855
01:48:47.631 --> 01:48:52.430
me the easy spots,
but you're right in my itinerary.
He's a character.

1856
01:48:52.510 --> 01:48:56.180
There was,
nobody liked that guy.
You know?
I think we're,
we're very lucky.

1857
01:48:56.181 --> 01:48:58.040
All of us are just so we know each other.

1858
01:48:58.041 --> 01:49:00.920
I feel very lucky that I know you all right.
Yeah,
I mean,

1859
01:49:00.921 --> 01:49:04.630
I enjoyed that moment we had with me,
you and him at the comedy store in the,

1860
01:49:04.631 --> 01:49:08.900
in the parking lot.
Yeah.
I just,
it's just fun and relaxing and,
well,
you know,

1861
01:49:08.901 --> 01:49:11.870
Brian Cowen was telling him was talking about this the other night because his

1862
01:49:11.871 --> 01:49:15.140
wife made him go on some fucking horrendous double date and he's like,

1863
01:49:16.010 --> 01:49:19.220
he's hanging out with this guy who was just apparently really obnoxious and

1864
01:49:19.221 --> 01:49:22.210
annoying and he's,
you know,
and his wife was like,
I thought they were fine.

1865
01:49:22.250 --> 01:49:22.461
He goes,

1866
01:49:22.461 --> 01:49:26.660
do you understand that I could be right now at the comedy store hanging out with

1867
01:49:26.661 --> 01:49:30.320
the funniest people on earth and I'm hanging out with this idiot who wants to,

1868
01:49:30.321 --> 01:49:30.591
you know,

1869
01:49:30.591 --> 01:49:34.010
Brag about his boat or whatever the fuck you talking about some blowhard.

1870
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:37.190
So what's it like to bomb?
That must really be something.
I must be,

1871
01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:41.450
I didn't believe her rescue that.
Yeah,
I get that.
It's like,

1872
01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.580
what's it like to buy it?
That's how much you think I fucking bomb.

1873
01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:44.570
If I work all over the world,

1874
01:49:45.550 --> 01:49:47.680
we're going to get done rear over here in New Zealand.

1875
01:49:48.370 --> 01:49:50.770
<v 1>I always say it's like sucking a thousand Dick's in front of your mother.</v>

1876
01:49:51.970 --> 01:49:53.090
That's the best way to describe it.

1877
01:49:53.710 --> 01:49:56.530
But the problem is that that kind of time maybe that's a lot.
It was.

1878
01:49:56.540 --> 01:49:58.930
What'd you be?
Real card.
I'm not saying to climax.

1879
01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:02.740
You know you can get through 10 in a short period of time.

1880
01:50:02.741 --> 01:50:07.150
If you got a good head.
Got Good head movement.
Um,
we got to get out of here.

1881
01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:09.990
You're a car is supposed to be picking you up right now.
This motherfucker,

1882
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:15.310
the anger at the Tropicana next that there 23rd at Atlantic city.

1883
01:50:15.491 --> 01:50:19.030
Ladies and gentlemen,
that's dumb.
I rare his hood right next up.
Powerful.

1884
01:50:19.031 --> 01:50:23.110
Philadelphia.
Joseph.
Thank you.
Always good man.
Yeah,
we're going to have fun.

1885
01:50:23.111 --> 01:50:26.260
We're at the ice house sold out tonight.
Sorry bitches.

1886
01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:29.230
A boat would probably be doing another show next Wednesday night too.

1887
01:50:29.231 --> 01:50:33.400
Cause I've got a big Vegas show next Friday.
Got Out plucking.
Tune up.

1888
01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:38.710
Oh
Hey,
I love you brother.

1889
01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:40.960
Love you too man.
All Right Ladies Gentlemen.

1891
01:50:42.911 --> 01:50:47.350

and he'll be here tomorrow.

1892
01:50:47.650 --> 01:50:48.483
Thank you.

1893
01:50:49.330 --> 01:50:51.130
<v 6>That's fine.</v>
