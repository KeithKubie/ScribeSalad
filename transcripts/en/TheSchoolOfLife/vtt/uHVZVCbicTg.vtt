00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:07.590
We live in an age with a high regard for extraordinary
lives – that is, lives that the vast majority

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:15.110
of us will never lead. Our heroes have made
outsized fortunes, appeared on gigantic screens

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:22.550
and demonstrated unique virtue and talent.
Their achievements are both dazzling and continuously,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:30.099
in the background, humiliating. In the late
1650s, the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer painted

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:37.640
a picture called The Little Street. Doing
so was a quiet but momentous and revolutionary

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.800
act, with an impact that challenges our values
to this day. Johannes Vermeer - Gezicht op

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.690
huizen in Delft, bekend als 'Het straatje'
- Google Art Project.jpg It showed nothing

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.510
more outwardly impressive than an ordinary
street in Vermeer’s home town of Delft.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.080
Someone was doing a little sewing; some kids
were playing on the stoop, a woman was busy

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:01.570
in the yard. It is one of the greatest paintings
in the world. Up to this point, the most prestigious

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.330
cultural works had emphasised the merits and
value of aristocratic, military and religious

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.530
lives, that is, of lives filled with extraordinary
moments and advantages. The great epic poets,

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.080
Homer and Virgil, had written of heroic warriors;
Renaissance artists had produced magnificent

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.910
visions of saints and angels. And the routines
of kings, queens and aristocrats were constantly

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.700
celebrated and held up for admiration on the
most prestigious canvases. But Johannes Vermeer

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.909
went in another direction. He wanted to show
us what could be appealing and honourable

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.370
about very different sorts of activities:
keeping a house tidy, sweeping the yard, babysitting,

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:53.090
sewing or – as in his equally significant
painting of a kitchen maid – preparing lunch.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.220
Several younger Dutch contemporaries joined
Vermeer’s quiet revolution. One of them,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.140
Pieter de Hooch, focused on almost random
moments of the day, when nothing particular

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.140
is going on: a routine afternoon at home,
coming back from the shops, perhaps with a

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.140
bag of vegetables. Maybe the people will be
hanging out the washing later. Someone’s

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.140
rigged up a little arbour by the back door;
it could do with some mending at the weekend.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.140
De Hooch was the first artist in the history
of humanity to point out the charms of organising

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.641
a cupboard. He did one picture that depicted
a rather well-off merchant’s house, but

00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:14.280
the thing that really interested him was the
laundry basket and how the owner of the house

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.370
and her assistant are folding and putting
away towels and bed sheets. This, de Hooch

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.940
seems to be telling us, is also the meaning
of life, properly understood. Another of Vermeer’s

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.790
follower, Caspar Netscher, admired people
doing jobs that were often considered rather

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.610
boring and lowly: like lace-making, which
was fiddly and not very well-paid. Netscher

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.040
couldn’t himself alter what people earnt,
but he was intent on changing how we might

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.940
feel about those on a modest salary. Although
these artists are famous – their works are

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.470
in the greatest galleries and fetch enormous
prices if they come up at auction – their

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.739
tentative revolution hasn’t as yet properly
succeeded. Today – in modern versions of

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:07.040
epic, aristocratic, or divine art – adverts
and movies continually explain to us the appeal

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.800
of things like sports cars, tropical island
holidays, fame, first-class air travel and

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.569
expansive limestone kitchens. The attractions
are often perfectly real. But the cumulative

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:24.550
effect is to instill in us the idea that a
good life is built around elements that almost

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:32.459
no one can afford. The conclusion we too easily
draw is that our lives are close to worthless.

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.680
Vermeer, for his part, was insisting that
ordinary life is heroic in its own way, because

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.800
ordinary-sounding things are very far from
easy to manage. There is immense skill and

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.650
true nobility involved in bringing up a child
to be reasonably independent and balanced;

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.400
maintaining a good-enough relationship with
a partner over many years despite areas of

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.349
extreme difficulty; keeping a home in reasonable
order; getting an early night; doing a not

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.480
very exciting or well-paid job responsibly
and cheerfully; listening properly to another

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.769
person and, in general, not succumbing to
madness or rage at the paradox and compromises

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:22.340
involved in being alive. Vermeer was not claiming
that everything ordinary was invariably impressive.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.189
He was merely directing us with grace to the
idea that there are a host of things that

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:33.499
we too often ignore and that happen to be
both ordinary and good. With extraordinary

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:38.350
talent, Vermeer was convincing us of an idea
we should dare to hold on to in the face of

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.969
immense pressures to imagine that we should
be living in more exalted ways: that there

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:50.559
is already much to appreciate and venerate
in our lives when we learn to see them without

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:58.279
prejudice or self-hatred. If you liked this
