00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.310
- At a time when we're
constantly being told

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.610
that this time is unlike any other

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.590
it's critical that we confront
our past and systemic racism

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.480
and see its echos in
our present challenges.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.410
Only then will we be able
to overcome our divisions

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.780
and build a more just
and inclusive society.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.620
Mitch Landrieu has shown
us what needs to be done.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.920
Now it's up to us to make sure we do it.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.050
As we look around our country
we do see citizen activism

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.290
on the rise and a new
generation that's speaking out,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.410
running for office and
entering public service.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.810
I'm proud that they can look
to this award and be inspired

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.850
by Mayor Landrieu and those
who have come before him.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.470
And I hope that politics
will once again be seen

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.423
as my father saw it as a noble profession.
