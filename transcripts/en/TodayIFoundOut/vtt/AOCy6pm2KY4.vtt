00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.610
Initially designed and produced during WW2
for British soldiers, the Sten was developed

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.640
as a direct response to both dwindling supplies
of American made Thompson machine guns and

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.170
the evacuation of Dunkirk, during which the
British abandoned many thousands of guns.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.260
In an effort to re-arm its troops as quickly
as possible for the defense of the homeland,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.120
the British Government requested that the
Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield design

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.720
an alternative to the increasingly hard to
obtain Thompson. As the old maxim states,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.570
“You can have it fast, good, or cheap- pick
two”. Given the title of this article, you

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.430
can guess which two were emphasized.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.579
The original design for the Sten is chiefly
credited to two men, Major R. V. Shepherd

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.550
and Harold Turpin who finalised the design
in the closing months of 1940. The first Sten

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.580
prototype was reportedly of reasonably high
quality for what it was, featuring a flash

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.431
hider, a foregrip as well as wooden finishings
that gave the gun a sleek appearance. About

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:17.979
100,000 of these were produced in the summer
of 1941 before the government decided to strip

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.470
the already spartan Sten down to save money,
materials, and reduce build time even further.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.060
The result was the Sten Mark II. Just a few
months after it entered production, the Mark

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.259
II became both the bane and the boon of many
an Allied soldier’s life.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.259
On the one hand, the Sten Mark II could be
produced for less than $10 (about $160 today)

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.450
in about five man-hours. (In contrast, the
Thompson cost about $140, or about $2,300

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.320
today, to produce.) Not only that, but the
Sten used only two machined parts, the barrel

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.570
and the bolt, with the rest being made, as
a 1943 edition of Popular Science put it,

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.320
from “the cheapest kind of stamping”.
Initially the design even used common bed

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.800
springs as a main component.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.400
With the help of assembly lines, all total
an estimated two million Sten Mark II’s

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.409
were produced during the war (and approximately
four million total in the Sten line of guns).

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.500
Due to its simplistic design, the Sten Mark
II was remarkably easy to maintain and required

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.420
virtually no lubrication to function properly.
In fact, the construction was so simple that

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.920
resistance fighters who couldn’t get their
hands on the genuine article even sometimes

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.459
just made their own. Another benefit of the
Sten’s jury-rigged design was that it could

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:47.930
be easily customised to accept magazines from
other guns, silencers and viewing sights.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.989
The ammunition for the gun was also easy to
come by, given that the Mark II was specifically

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.939
designed to use the 9mm German Parabellum
bullets, which were the most commonly used

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.890
round by the various European militaries.
Needless to say, they were readily available

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.210
even to resistance fighters in Nazi occupied
territories, particularly as the Germans started

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.319
to retreat.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.770
The Mark II was also literally murder in close
combat, able to fire off rounds at a rate

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:21.060
of 500-550 per minute (though its clip only
held 32 rounds). It was also relatively accurate

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.969
up to 100 metres (if one kept a firm grip
and used short bursts) and was light and easy

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:32.629
to conceal. Essentially, the weapon was ideal
for taking out many enemy soldiers in close

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.849
range, and if you surprised them, perhaps
even before they’d have a chance to raise

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.290
their weapons.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.080
So what was the problem then?

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.379
Well, if you, say, bumped the gun hard enough
or dropped it (or just set it down too firmly),

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.900
it had a tendency to fire on its own. What’s
worse is that if it was in full-auto mode

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.109
(or sometimes even if not due to failures
in the mechanism that would occasionally make

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.040
it fire single shots when in auto-mode and
vice-versa), it would unload the entire clip

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.349
in its self-firing frenzy.

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.780
Beyond the gun firing when soldiers didn’t
want it to, it also was ridiculously prone

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.450
to not firing when they did want it to. This
was due to the inherent flaw in the magazine

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.840
feed design, which was intentionally based
on the magazines used in the German MP-38.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.090
(They did this for compatibility’s sake.)
The problem with this design was that it used

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.050
a double column, single feed mechanism, meaning
two columns of bullets would have to merge

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.389
into one for firing (requiring an extremely
precise feed angle to work).

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.780
This is in contrast to the double column,
double feed design in the much more reliable

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.610
Thompson. The former is still fine if the
parts are well manufactured and sturdy…

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.180
but the Sten parts were anything but that,
particularly in the early going when the British

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.199
were desperate to churn out as many of the
guns as possible and had little in the way

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:55.340
of quality control. (For this reason, Canadian
produced Mark II’s were noted as being much

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.669
more reliable than their British equivalent.)

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.080
This jamming problem was so bad that it was
common for soldiers to extensively test fire

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.710
each of the Sten’s they were issued before
trying to use them in combat. Units that were

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.669
determined to be more prone to jamming than
others were tossed aside.

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.599
But even if you had a Mark II that seemed
to perform well at first, small amounts of

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.490
dirt or other debris could cause the guns
to jam, which was a particular problem in

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.080
the muddy conditions prevalent across the
Eastern front. This problem was exacerbated

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.539
by the fact that the long opening that the
cocking knob ran along readily allowed such

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.310
debris to enter the gun.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.430
Heydrich-mercedesThe most famous example of
a Sten Mark II jamming at an inopportune time

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.569
was in the assassination attempt of SS-Obergruppenführer
Reinhard Heydrich, “The Butcher of Prague”,

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:46.699
in Operation Anthropoid on May 27, 1942. The
assassins waited along Heydrich’s normal

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.860
daily commute, which would necessarily pass
a certain bend where they knew the car would

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.080
have to slow to a near stop. In a move that
later resulted in Hitler calling Heydrich

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.800
an idiot, Heydrich chose to drive his daily
commute in an open-top Mercedes, rather than

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.009
in an armored car with extra guards, as you’d
expect one of the biggest mass murderers traveling

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:03.009
in, essentially, enemy territory to do.

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.770
As such, when the exposed car reached the
bend in the road, one of the would-be assassins,

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.539
Jozef Gabčík, pointed his Sten Mark II at
Heydrich at near point-blank range. He pulled

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:17.130
the trigger and the Sten gun did what it was
wont to do- jam.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.300
Luckily for the assassins, rather than order
his driver to speed off, Heydrich told him

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.650
to stop so he could go after the attackers.
While Hydrich did eventually manage a rousing

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.060
chase, when the car stopped, one of the other
assassins, Jan Kubiš , chucked a modified

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.330
anti-tank mine at it. The resulting explosion
and shrapnel severely injured Heydrich’s

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.330
spleen, left lung, diaphragm, and fractured
a rib. Nevertheless, bleeding profusely, he

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.610
still chased his attackers for a time before
becoming too weak from his injuries. Later,

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.360
surgery was partially successful, in that
he survived at first and his wounds began

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.449
to heal, but a few days later he succumbed
to infection and died.

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:55.220
Despite its many problems, the Sten Mark II
played a significant role in the Allies’

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.640
early efforts in WW2, managing to put an exceptionally
deadly close-range weapon in the hands of

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:06.170
Allied fighters, instead of the hunting and
bolt-action rifles left over from WWI, which

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.940
were all that some soldiers had to use before
the Mark II.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.500
That said, the Sten’s importance didn’t
stop soldiers from giving it colorful nicknames

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.419
like the “Stench Gun”, the “Plumber’s
Nightmare”, and the “Woolworth’s Wonder”

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:38.229
after a popular British retail chain known
for selling cheap toys and gifts.
