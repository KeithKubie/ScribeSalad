00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.010
- [Instructor] Talk a little
bit about what could cause

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.560
a supply or a demand curve
for a currency to shift.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.450
So here we have the
foreign exchange market

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.470
for the Chinese yuan which
is why we have the quantity

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.060
of yuan on the horizontal axis

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.140
and the price of the yuan in terms

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.000
of another currency on the vertical axis

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.120
and here that other
currency is the US dollar.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.060
And associated with, let's
just call this S sub one,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.570
our supply curve, and D
sub one, our demand curve,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.100
you have at the intersection
an equilibrium point.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.070
We have talked about this in other videos.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.010
Let's call that e sub one.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.150
This would be some
dollar price for a yuan.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.330
Maybe it's 10 US cents per yuan.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.130
And then associated that is also

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.550
an equilibrium quantity, Q sub one.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.880
That would be a certain amount
of yuan that is trading hands

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.980
in a certain time period,
whatever the time period

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.690
this graph or this model applies to.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.150
So one big way to think about
what would influence supply

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.270
and demand is think about
who holds the supply,

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.880
and then who is demanding that currency.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.460
So if we're thinking about the
market for the Chinese yuan,

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.690
the supply is going to be
from people who hold yuan,

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.050
so people who hold yuan.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.520
And for the most part,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.550
that's going to be people in the country.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.720
It's possible that someone
sitting in New York

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.470
has a yuan denominated account

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.300
or has some yuan sitting in their wallet,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.550
but for the most part it's going

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.880
to be people in the country.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.820
So motivated for the most part

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.380
by what happens in China,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.370
what happens in China.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.093
And on the other hand, if
we're thinking about demand,

00:01:38.093 --> 00:01:40.120
it's the other way around.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.030
These would be other
people that for some reason

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.690
want to convert their currency,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.420
their non-yuan currency, into the yuan,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.270
so people who hold other currencies,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.650
other currencies like the US dollars.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.540
And so this tends to be motivated.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.090
It's possible that someone
in Beijing is holding dollars

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.590
or has a dollar bank account,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.990
but for the most part
it's going to be motivated

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.160
by other countries.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.340
And so for example, if
we think about supply,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.550
what could shift the supply to the right

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.220
or could increase supply?

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.200
So shifting to the supply
means more Chinese want

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.830
to sell their yuan,
they want to convert it

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.520
into something else, let's say US dollars.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.770
And so this could be
an increase in demand,

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.500
so increase in demand for foreign,

00:02:39.796 --> 00:02:41.460
you could say goods,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.240
services, or assets.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.740
In this case, it might
be an increase in demand

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.160
for American goods, services, or assets.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.720
They might want American assets

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.410
because they get a better return there.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.340
Or maybe they view them
as safer investments.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.570
Maybe they want to send their children

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.060
to an American college so there's a demand

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.670
or there's an increase in
demand for sending kids

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.990
to the American colleges,
so that's a service.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.240
Maybe they are interested in
buying more American cars.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.600
Another thing that could
increase the demand for,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.620
say, American goods, is
if there's a decrease

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.680
in tariffs on those things.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.120
So those things have
become cheaper in China.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.240
So any of these things
could shift the supply curve

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.560
to the right, this is S sub two.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.540
And then associated with that,

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.300
we would have a new equilibrium
exchange rate, e sub two,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.820
and a new equilibrium quantity
that is changing hands.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.930
And notice, the price of
the yuan has now gone down

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.570
as people are demanding, in
this case, more American goods.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.963
And of course, if we
switched the arrows here,

00:03:45.172 --> 00:03:48.770
if we had a lower demand for,
let's say, American goods,

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.470
services, and assets,
then the supply curve

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.260
would shift to the left, and the yuan

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.440
would become more expensive
in terms of dollars.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.920
And so on the demand side, it
works the other way around.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.673
What could shift the
demand curve to the right?

00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:10.080
Let's call this D three right
over here to right over here.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.030
Let's assume that the supply
curve has not been shifted.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.780
So this would go to e sub three.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.300
So the yuan has become more
expensive, and that makes sense.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.970
More people are demanding it.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.590
And we have a different quantity now.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.550
Let's call that Q sub three.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.190
But what would cause it
to shift in that way?

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.190
So demand for yuan

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.600
would go up,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.860
if you have an increase in demand

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.910
for Chinese goods from foreigners.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.820
Chinese goods, actually I should say

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:47.210
services or assets.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.380
So if you have an increase
in the number of Americans

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.880
who were holding dollars
or are holding dollars,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.440
and say hey, I could get a better return

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.370
if I invest in China.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.520
Maybe it's growing faster.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.410
And so I want to convert
my dollars into yuan.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.920
I want to buy yuan with my dollars

00:05:02.357 --> 00:05:04.470
so I could participate in
the Chinese stock market

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.750
or buy shares or somehow
buy some Chinese real estate

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.610
or whatever else it might be.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.250
And obviously if demand for
Chinese goods, services,

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.570
and assets were to go
down, then the demand curve

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.870
would shift the other way.
