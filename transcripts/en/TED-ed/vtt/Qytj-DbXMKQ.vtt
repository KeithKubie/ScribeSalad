00:00:08.034 --> 00:00:13.314
Loki the mischief-maker, was writhing
uncomfortably in Thor’s iron grip.

00:00:13.314 --> 00:00:17.924
The previous night, while the rest of the
gods slept, he’d snuck up on Thor’s wife

00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:21.228
Sif and shorn off her beautiful hair.

00:00:21.228 --> 00:00:23.378
It’d seemed like a funny 
prank at the time,

00:00:23.378 --> 00:00:28.038
but now Thor was about to
break every bone in his body.

00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:31.258
Loki had to think of some
way to fix what he’d done.

00:00:31.258 --> 00:00:36.738
Yet who could replace Sif’s matchless
hair, golden like a field of summer wheat?

00:00:36.738 --> 00:00:40.938
The dwarves! – their legendary
smiths could make anything.

00:00:40.938 --> 00:00:45.328
So Loki rushed to their realm, 
deep within the mountains of the earth.

00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:49.418
Even before he arrived, the wily Loki was
already scheming

00:00:49.418 --> 00:00:52.638
how he would get the
dwarves to do his bidding.

00:00:52.638 --> 00:00:57.768
He decided that his best bet was to pit
two families against each other.

00:00:57.768 --> 00:01:01.098
He first visited the masterful
sons of Ivaldi. 

00:01:01.098 --> 00:01:05.704
He told them that their rivals,
a pair of brothers named Brokk and Eitri,

00:01:05.704 --> 00:01:09.274
had claimed that they were the best
craftsmen in the world

00:01:09.274 --> 00:01:12.484
and were determined to prove
it in a competition.

00:01:12.484 --> 00:01:17.064
The rules were that each family had to 
create three gifts for the gods,

00:01:17.064 --> 00:01:20.954
including, for the Ivaldis, golden hair.

00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:25.144
Then Loki visited Brokk and Eitri,
and told them the same thing, 

00:01:25.144 --> 00:01:29.204
only now claiming that the sons
of Ivaldi had issued the challenge.

00:01:29.204 --> 00:01:32.774
But Brokk and Eitri couldn’t 
be fooled so easily,

00:01:32.774 --> 00:01:38.794
and only agreed to participate
if Loki put his own head on the line.

00:01:38.794 --> 00:01:45.594
Literally—if Brokk and Eitri won, 
Loki would forfeit his head to them.

00:01:45.594 --> 00:01:50.234
Loki had no choice but to agree,
and to save himself had to find a way

00:01:50.234 --> 00:01:54.244
to make sure the sons of
Ivaldi emerged victorious.

00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:56.654
Both sets of dwarves got to work.

00:01:56.654 --> 00:02:02.114
Eitri set Brokk to man the bellows and
told him not to stop for any reason,

00:02:02.114 --> 00:02:04.274
or the treasures would be ruined.

00:02:04.274 --> 00:02:07.554
Soon a strange black fly
flew into the room.

00:02:07.554 --> 00:02:12.304
As a piece of pigskin was placed in the
forge, the fly stung Brokk’s hand,

00:02:12.304 --> 00:02:13.954
but he didn’t flinch.

00:02:13.954 --> 00:02:18.574
Next, while Eitri worked a block of gold,
the fly bit Brokk on the neck.

00:02:18.574 --> 00:02:20.114
The dwarf carried on.

00:02:20.114 --> 00:02:24.094
Finally, Eitri placed a piece
of iron in the furnace.

00:02:24.094 --> 00:02:30.444
This time the fly landed right on Brokk’s
eyelid and bit as hard as it could.

00:02:30.444 --> 00:02:34.854
And for just a split second,
Brokk’s hand left the bellows.

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:39.314
That’s all it took; their final treasure
hadn’t stayed in the fire long enough.

00:02:39.332 --> 00:02:44.332
Loki now reappeared in his normal form,
overjoyed by their failure,

00:02:44.332 --> 00:02:48.632
and accompanied the dwarves to present
their treasures to the gods.

00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:52.512
First, Loki presented the treasures
from the sons of Ivaldi.

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:56.422
Their golden hair bound to Sif’s
head and continued to grow,

00:02:56.422 --> 00:02:59.602
leaving her even more radiant than before.

00:02:59.602 --> 00:03:01.622
Next, for Odin the all-father,

00:03:01.622 --> 00:03:05.672
a magnificent spear that could
pierce through anything.

00:03:05.672 --> 00:03:11.663
And finally a small cloth that unfolded
into a mighty ship built for Freyr,

00:03:11.663 --> 00:03:13.313
god of the harvest.

00:03:13.313 --> 00:03:17.433
Then Brokk presented the treasures
made by him and his brother.

00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:20.793
For Freyr they’d forged 
a golden-bristled boar

00:03:20.793 --> 00:03:25.573
who’d pull Freyr’s chariot across
the sky faster than any mount.

00:03:25.573 --> 00:03:30.503
For Odin, a golden arm ring which would
make eight more identical rings

00:03:30.503 --> 00:03:32.563
on every ninth night.

00:03:32.563 --> 00:03:35.713
And for Thor, a hammer called Mjolnir.

00:03:35.713 --> 00:03:39.763
Its handle was too short,
and Loki smirked at the obvious defect.

00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:43.163
But then Brokk revealed its abilities.

00:03:43.163 --> 00:03:46.463
Mjolnir would never shatter, 
never miss its mark

00:03:46.463 --> 00:03:50.433
and always return
to Thor’s hand when thrown.

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:55.713
Despite the short handle, the gods all 
agreed this was the finest gift of all.

00:03:55.713 --> 00:04:00.953
Remembering what was at stake, Loki tried 
to flee, but Thor reached him first.

00:04:00.967 --> 00:04:03.847
But before the dwarves could have their due,

00:04:03.847 --> 00:04:09.057
clever Loki pointed out that they had won
the rights to his head, but not his neck,

00:04:09.057 --> 00:04:10.937
and thus had no right to cut it.

00:04:10.941 --> 00:04:15.941
All begrudgingly admitted the truth in that,
but Brokk would have the last laugh.

00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:20.161
Taking his brother’s awl,
he pierced it through Loki’s lips

00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:22.351
and sewed his mouth shut,

00:04:22.351 --> 00:04:27.071
so the trickster god could no longer
spread his malicious deceit.

00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:30.141
Yet the irony was not lost on the gods.

00:04:30.141 --> 00:04:33.541
For it was Loki’s deceit that had brought
them these fine treasures

00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:37.611
and given Thor the hammer
for which he’s still known today.
