00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.146
What do Euclid,

00:00:11.146 --> 00:00:12.746
twelve-year-old Einstein,

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:16.397
and American President James Garfield
have in common?

00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:20.956
They all came up with elegant
proofs for the famous Pythagorean theorem,

00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:23.206
the rule that says for a right triangle,

00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:27.086
the square of one side plus
the square of the other side

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:30.086
is equal to the square of the hypotenuse.

00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:34.717
In other words, a²+b²=c².

00:00:34.717 --> 00:00:38.297
This statement is one of the most
fundamental rules of geometry,

00:00:38.297 --> 00:00:40.536
and the basis for practical applications,

00:00:40.536 --> 00:00:45.697
like constructing stable buildings
and triangulating GPS coordinates.

00:00:45.697 --> 00:00:48.683
The theorem is named for Pythagoras,

00:00:48.683 --> 00:00:52.758
a Greek philosopher and mathematician
in the 6th century B.C.,

00:00:52.758 --> 00:00:56.157
but it was known more than a
thousand years earlier.

00:00:56.157 --> 00:01:02.186
A Babylonian tablet from around 1800 B.C.
lists 15 sets of numbers

00:01:02.186 --> 00:01:04.037
that satisfy the theorem.

00:01:04.037 --> 00:01:07.558
Some historians speculate 
that Ancient Egyptian surveyors

00:01:07.558 --> 00:01:13.698
used one such set of numbers, 3, 4, 5,
to make square corners.

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:18.180
The theory is that surveyors could stretch
a knotted rope with twelve equal segments

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.229
to form a triangle with sides of length
3, 4 and 5.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.939
According to the converse
of the Pythagorean theorem,

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.480
that has to make a right triangle,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.639
and, therefore, a square corner.

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:33.420
And the earliest known 
Indian mathematical texts

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.770
written between 800 and 600 B.C.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.847
state that a rope stretched across
the diagonal of a square

00:01:40.847 --> 00:01:44.728
produces a square twice as large
as the original one.

00:01:44.728 --> 00:01:49.350
That relationship can be derived
from the Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.241
But how do we know 
that the theorem is true

00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:54.851
for every right triangle 
on a flat surface,

00:01:54.851 --> 00:01:58.611
not just the ones these mathematicians
and surveyors knew about?

00:01:58.611 --> 00:01:59.951
Because we can prove it.

00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:02.896
Proofs use existing mathematical rules
and logic

00:02:02.896 --> 00:02:07.419
to demonstrate that a theorem
must hold true all the time.

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:11.137
One classic proof often attributed
to Pythagoras himself

00:02:11.137 --> 00:02:14.011
uses a strategy called 
proof by rearrangement.

00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:19.650
Take four identical right triangles
with side lengths a and b

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.132
and hypotenuse length c.

00:02:22.132 --> 00:02:26.174
Arrange them so that their hypotenuses
form a tilted square.

00:02:26.174 --> 00:02:29.769
The area of that square is c².

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.192
Now rearrange the triangles
into two rectangles,

00:02:33.192 --> 00:02:35.992
leaving smaller squares on either side.

00:02:35.992 --> 00:02:40.512
The areas of those squares
are a² and b².

00:02:40.512 --> 00:02:41.681
Here's the key.

00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:44.893
The total area of 
the figure didn't change,

00:02:44.893 --> 00:02:48.261
and the areas of the triangles
didn't change.

00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:51.379
So the empty space in one, c²

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.437
must be equal to 
the empty space in the other,

00:02:54.437 --> 00:02:58.329
a² + b².

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.923
Another proof comes from a fellow Greek
mathematician Euclid

00:03:01.923 --> 00:03:05.153
and was also stumbled upon
almost 2,000 years later

00:03:05.153 --> 00:03:07.344
by twelve-year-old Einstein.

00:03:07.344 --> 00:03:10.838
This proof divides one right triangle
into two others

00:03:10.838 --> 00:03:15.153
and uses the principle that if the
corresponding angles of two triangles

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:16.334
are the same,

00:03:16.334 --> 00:03:19.063
the ratio of their sides
is the same, too.

00:03:19.063 --> 00:03:21.157
So for these three similar triangles,

00:03:21.157 --> 00:03:25.074
you can write these expressions
for their sides.

00:03:33.474 --> 00:03:35.633
Next, rearrange the terms.

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:43.814
And finally, add the two equations
together and simplify to get

00:03:43.814 --> 00:03:51.644
ab²+ac²=bc²,

00:03:51.644 --> 00:03:57.744
or a²+b²=c².

00:03:57.744 --> 00:04:00.005
Here's one that uses tessellation,

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:03.856
a repeating geometric pattern
for a more visual proof.

00:04:03.856 --> 00:04:05.605
Can you see how it works?

00:04:05.605 --> 00:04:08.218
Pause the video if you'd like some time
to think about it.

00:04:10.158 --> 00:04:11.505
Here's the answer.

00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:13.975
The dark gray square is a²

00:04:13.975 --> 00:04:16.576
and the light gray one is b².

00:04:16.576 --> 00:04:19.495
The one outlined in blue is c².

00:04:19.495 --> 00:04:23.756
Each blue outlined square
contains the pieces of exactly one dark

00:04:23.756 --> 00:04:25.896
and one light gray square,

00:04:25.896 --> 00:04:28.548
proving the Pythagorean theorem again.

00:04:28.548 --> 00:04:30.877
And if you'd really like 
to convince yourself,

00:04:30.877 --> 00:04:34.542
you could build a turntable
with three square boxes of equal depth

00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:37.217
connected to each other 
around a right triangle.

00:04:37.217 --> 00:04:40.837
If you fill the largest square with water
and spin the turntable,

00:04:40.837 --> 00:04:45.536
the water from the large square
will perfectly fill the two smaller ones.

00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:50.984
The Pythagorean theorem has more
than 350 proofs, and counting,

00:04:50.984 --> 00:04:53.265
ranging from brilliant to obscure.

00:04:53.265 --> 00:04:55.229
Can you add your own to the mix?
