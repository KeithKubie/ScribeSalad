00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In a world of 7 billion people

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.500
who is most typical?

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.000
The world's most typical person

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.000
Is right handed

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.500
Makes less than $12,000 a year

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.000
Has a cell phone

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.000
But not a bank account.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Less than 25% of us do

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.250
So what does he look like?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The world's most typical person is male

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.500
Males outnumber females

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.000
but just barely

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The median age of the world's population is 28

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.000
The largest ethnic group is Han Chinese

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.500
Based on these traits 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.500
the world's most typical person is 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.200
a 28-year-old Han Chinese man

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.800
There are over 9,000,000 of them

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.000
Researchers averaged 190,00 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.500
of their photos

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.000
to create a composite image

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.250
This is the world's most typical person

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.250
But he won't be typical for long

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.250
By 2030 that person will come from India

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.000
And typical is always relative

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.000
The typical man in Holland is 5' 11"

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.000
The typical man in Peru is 5' 4 1/2"

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
In Japan, the typical woman lives nearly 86 years

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In Afghanistan, she lives 45 years

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.500
The typical American uses 100 gallons of water 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.250
at home per day

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.250
In parts of Ethiopia, it's 2.5 gallons

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And some women spend 8 hours/day collecting it

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.500
Typical people have choices to make

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.500
But they're not the same for everyone

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And our choices make a big difference

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.750
When multiplied by 7 billion

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
7 billion - The surprising face of the most typical human

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.000
