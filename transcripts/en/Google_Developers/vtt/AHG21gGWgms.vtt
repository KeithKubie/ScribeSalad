00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.769
&gt;&gt; So, after that, I'm not actually talking
about anything technical so if you want you

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:12.740
can phase out now and have a rest. I'm actually
talking about a used case where in my day

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.730
job I'm the development coordinator for the
local government and Shires Association in

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.109
New South Wales. That's sort of a representative
body for all the councils in that state. And

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.150
I've been looking at how Wave can really assist
in this area because local government is one

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:38.510
of the textbook examples of where Wave could
really work. See, in local government, e-mail

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.800
is already king. Everything gets sent out,
everything gets tracked. All interaction with

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.230
the public is tracked, every phone call that
gets--every phone call that comes in is logged,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.590
every e-mail that comes in gets added to the
document tracking system. Everything is tracked

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.350
so they also need to make sure that they know
who said what. In local government, as in

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.090
anything else public service, need to know
authoritativeness is paramount. You need to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.730
know who said what, when, and why. I'm just
going to go through the different--a few different

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.870
used cases within a local government organization.
But generally it's we need to track everything.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:29.550
Okay, the first used case is probably the
most public used case, it's the front desk.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.320
This is an image I cut from my local council's
website. As you can see we got a whole range

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.790
of different things that we could be using
Wave for, contacting council, just general

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.300
inquiries, you know, "Where has my bin gone?
Can I--when's the next garbage run coming?"

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.310
Council runs a number of venues. They run
parks, they run dropping centers, a number

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.390
of things so if people want to book venues,
property certificates. Now, development applications

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.140
I deal with in a little bit later on the talk,
but all of these needs to be authoritative,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.930
all of these needs to be tracked, and all
of these could really use Wave to do it. Okay,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:17.600
the team that I work in at the moment is the
comms team for the LGSA. Now, they are constantly

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.710
collaborating or constantly having to work
together to create press releases, information

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.230
sheets and all the rest of it, but they're
having to use Outlook and they're having to

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.630
use e-mail to do it. Now, this is a pain in
the bum. Whereas a wave system, which allows

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.770
them to, you know, real time collaboration,
tracking when changes were made, tracking

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.340
when things were sent out without having to
troll back through, you know, half a dozen

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.570
folders would make--would be a really beneficial
systems for them. The other thing that it

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.380
allows them to do is to keep track of the
conversations with media people and others.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.740
I mean, if they--if you make up the external
e-mail with an internal wave system, all of

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.420
a sudden every conversation you have with
a journalist can now be tracked in the wave

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.740
system so that someone else can come along
read the conversation in wave format, which

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.819
is a lot easier to read, and then if somebody
top posts, bottom posts, middle posts an e-mail

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:21.790
thread, and they can get on top of any problem
or any issue in a lot quicker and a lot easier.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.321
Most comms team are small especially on local
governments. So they need to be able to get

00:03:25.321 --> 00:03:34.100
in this--have this flexible way of moving
around things. Okay, one of the--see, I'm

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.930
coming at this from an Australian perspective
when it comes to local government. But I'm

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.630
pretty sure that even in America or anywhere
else, one of the main functions of local government

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.470
is assessing development within their area.
You would--you have to apply for building

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.490
permission, you have to apply for a number
of different things. Now, all of these--there

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.870
are a number of different systems in the councils
for tracking development applications. A lot

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.849
of them in Australia are starting to put developmental
applications online so people can see what's

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.819
happening. But what we need to do is we need
to keep everything in one thread. If we can

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.950
keep all the information, everything that's
said and everything that's noted about an

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.250
application, any changes that are made in
one thread, it's a lot easier to track down

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.410
all the changes rather than having to go through
the e-mail; you know, dig through all the

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.130
e-mail of a number of different systems or
even leases, anything like that. The other

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.370
thing that it needs is an authoritative conversation
model because especially with development

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.411
applications you really, really need to know
who said what and when. Now, in my local government

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:42.340
area, we recently--well, a couple of years
ago, we had a controversy because one of the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:49.660
town planners was--how, shall we say, providing
extra services to one of the developers. Now,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.990
we wouldn't be--in order for them to track
down that problem they've had to troll through

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.850
a hell of a lot of stuff. Whereas with the
Wave conversation model you can see exactly

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.130
when things were said, exactly what changes
were made to development applications or to

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.190
the notes around them without having to try
and troll through e-mails or even figure out

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:18.550
whether this e-mail is being faked or the
e-mail has been modified in some way. The

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.530
other thing is--I mean, Gov2.0 is a buzzword
that get thrown around a lot. I mean basically

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.040
for me, it means open government. The idea
that the information of the government needs

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.250
to be out there for the public to see and
that is easy to go through and Wave enables

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.180
this. Its authoritative conversation model
says, "These are the changes that were made

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.300
by whom," which is a really essential part
Gov2. 0. It means that it's easy to read.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.580
The threads are there. You can read them without
having to worry about whether they were, you

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.630
know, top, bottom, middle posting and so it's
not that hard to actually read them. The protocols

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.941
are open. Federation protocols are open. Client-server
protocols are open. Anybody can--the formats,

00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:03.740
the delta's formats are open. Anybody can
come back to this, say in ten year's time,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.310
and build--if they need to have a look at
a thread and build something that will be

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:13.050
able to read it without having to rely on
a third party, which may have gone bust in

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.710
the meantime. Wave can be extended through
robots, gadgets and so on. We can link in

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:25.270
to other systems and start bringing them into
this open system. In local government in Australia,

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.990
every document is tracked so it goes into
a document storage system. Now through extending,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.490
say, a Wave in a Box system or whichever--or
Pulse, or Vibe or whatever, we can now all

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.180
of a sudden link in to that system, pull the
documents into a wave conversation and actually

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:47.720
start working with them. The other thing it
does is in agendas apart of trust, okay? If

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.370
people know that their changes are being--their
changes are being noted, they know that things

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.220
will be kept, they're not going to start screwing
around. Well, they might. I mean, we're talking

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.350
about people. But we do know that they change--if
they do start screwing around, it'll be a

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.669
lot easier to find out where they screwed
around and actually go back and try and fix

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:15.990
it. So, really, Wave is the next step in open--opening
up government and it really helps deal with

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:21.280
a lot of the issues that e-mail has actually
managed to hide. And that's it. That's all

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:29.150
I can come up with in jetlag brain. Any questions?
Yes?

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:51.050
&gt;&gt; I just want to make a comment. I specialize
on public records access [INDISTICT] and this

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:56.650
is great coming from the [INDISTINCT] but
the reality is people who are on the inside,

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.450
they don't want these things to be exposed.
A lot of people will, you know, [INDISTINCT]

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.450
telephone and talk somebody to call in to
say something.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.820
&gt;&gt; Oh, there's no--there's no doubt that Wave's
not going to able to capture everything. I

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.539
mean the water cooler's always going to be
where, you know, the little brown paper bag

00:08:08.539 --> 00:08:15.620
might be passed around, but it does go some
way to fixing the e-mail problem. Now, e-mails

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:21.199
can be faked, e-mails can be--I mean, we had
a controversy in Australia a few years ago

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:27.930
where a public servant in our Treasury Department
was working for the opposition party and he

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:35.419
started sending fake e-mails out, right? It
was--if you ever get a chance, look up a guy

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:41.169
called Godwin Grech. But what he did was he
sent out these e-mails implicating our Prime

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:47.660
Minister at that day in a deal with a car
dealer in his home, in his electorate at home.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:53.529
Now, these were fake. But the opposition grabbed
these and said, "Look at this, we've got a--we've

00:08:53.529 --> 00:08:57.069
got this." And then, you know, all of the
sudden there's egg all over their face. With

00:08:57.069 --> 00:09:03.119
Wave you can't do that. You know, you can't
fake a Wave in a way that you can an e-mail.

00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:08.320
So it's that sort of, you know, we're stopping
up those holes which e-mail has. I mean, I'm

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:15.649
not saying that Wave's perfect by any means
but it's a lot better than the one we've got.

00:09:15.649 --> 00:09:20.377
Anything else? Cool. Thank you very much.
. Now, these were fake. But the opposition

00:09:20.377 --> 00:09:21.377
grabbed these and said, "Look at this, we've
got a--we've got this." And then, you know,

00:09:21.377 --> 00:09:22.377
all of the sudden there's egg all over their
face. With Wave you can't do that. You know,

00:09:22.377 --> 00:09:23.377
you can't fake a Wave in a way that you can
an e-mail. So it's that sort of, you know,

00:09:23.377 --> 00:09:23.393
we're stopping up those holes which e-mail
has. I mean, I'm not saying that Wave's perf
