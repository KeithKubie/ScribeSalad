00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.800
Lisa, I share your concern about climate change.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.090
This is something that’s one of the biggest
challenges that humanity has ever faced, and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.770
it’s something that in the next couple of
decades and centuries we’re going to have

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.340
to really band together and work together
to solve.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.160
And when you ask a question like you did,
about “how might you solve climate change,”

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.600
it actually gives me a lot of hope because
it means that young people like you are really

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.620
starting to think about ideas about how we
could address climate change.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.810
You said, “could you build a giant disk
and put it between the earth and the sun and

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.940
have it act as a kind of sunshade actually
cooling down the earth?”

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.190
That’s a wonderful idea.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.050
There are some things about that that would
be quite difficult and one thing is that the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.829
sun is actually very large, it’s much larger
than the earth, so it actually projects light

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.810
around anything that you put up there.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.630
You’d have to put a very, very large disk
up there.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.600
It might have to be something roughly the
size of the planet in order to shade the planet

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.770
effectively against the sun.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.470
So that’s something that might be possible,
but it would be very expensive and difficult

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.780
to construct.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.200
But I love the fact that you’re thinking
about it.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.500
It does however to me sort of not address
the underlying problems with climate change.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.730
A lot of people have ideas similar to yours
that, what if we could just block out some

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.509
of the sun’s light, would that actually
make climate change go away?

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.930
And one of the ideas people have is possibly
launching lots and lots of particles of dust

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.200
up into the atmosphere.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.420
We observed that when there’s a volcanic
explosion and the earth naturally puts lots

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.240
and lots of dust up into the atmosphere, the
earth’s climate cools.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.409
We observed this in the ‘90s when Mount
Pinatubo erupted and we actually had a decline,

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.430
a little bit of a notch on the global warming,
just due to this volcano putting lots and

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.409
lots of stuff up into the atmosphere.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.979
So could we do that artificially could we
just darken our atmosphere to actually have

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.880
less sunlight get through?

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.390
The answer is yes, we probably could, but
it would be a huge effort.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.000
A single volcano puts up many, many thousands
of tons of dust up there, so this would have

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.930
to be something continuous: lots and lots
of rockets or aircraft distributing dust across

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.470
the atmosphere.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.750
And the thing that kind of frightens me is
that we really don't understand our atmosphere

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.580
enough to know what that sort of cooling would
do.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.740
The atmosphere stores heat, it creates winds
and of course the air moves around, there

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.080
are storms; scientists spend a lot of time
studying how the atmosphere stores heat, how

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.820
the weather forms, and when you darken the
atmosphere I’m not sure what it would do

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.820
to our weather.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.890
It would be a very dangerous experiment to
do if you couldn’t control it.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.319
And the same thing with building a disk: I’m
not sure that darkening the earth is a very

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.840
good idea; it may change things like weather
patterns or even ocean currents, the winds,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.080
all of that.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.250
It also doesn’t get at the problem of carbon
dioxide.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.690
Now the reason our atmosphere is getting warmer
and warmer and warmer is because we humans

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.580
are putting lots of carbon dioxide up into
the atmosphere and this acts as what we call

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.400
a greenhouse gas.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.020
Sunlight can get through the atmosphere but
the carbon dioxide traps it and it can’t

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.040
release itself back into space so it gets
warmer and warmer over time.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.890
Carbon dioxide doesn’t just warm the atmosphere,
it also affects our oceans.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.640
When ocean water combines with carbon dioxide
it creates something called carbonic acid

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.940
and it makes the oceans more and more acidic
over time and this is a really big problem

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.370
for marine life.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.989
There are things like algae, the algae in
the oceans are responsible for most of the

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.069
oxygen that we breathe, and the algae are
having trouble forming because of the higher

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.290
acid levels in the ocean.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.890
So even if the one thing you solved was cooling
the earth down, if we continue to put more

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.460
and more carbon dioxide into our atmosphere
there will be other serious repercussions.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.680
We could end up killing the ocean life system,
for example.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.019
So the problem really isn’t an external
one, it’s not simply cooling the planet

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.970
putting up lots of dust or building a wonderful
shade like you suggest, the problem is really

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.159
getting at our emissions of carbon dioxide
and stopping those and stopping these dramatic

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.550
changes that we see coming.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.209
Some of them are going to be very difficult
to stop.

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.650
I mean right now we’re observing the ice
caps at both poles of the planet, in Antarctica

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.609
and in the North Pole, melting very quickly.

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.709
That won’t stop.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.460
Those ice caps will largely melt over many,
many centuries and the ocean levels will rise

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.430
in accordance.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.360
I do think right now the challenge is how
are we going to deal with the changes?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.550
We might not be able to change very many of
them at this point, we need to band together

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.830
as people make sure that we have ways to deal
with refugees—people need to leave where

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.960
they are because the oceans are rising.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.270
There’s going to be a lot of people that
need homes, and there’s going to be a lot

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.330
of support needed for the changes in agriculture,
in fishing, in so many parts of our economy

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.490
and our lives.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.470
There’s no easy solution.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.029
I do love that you’re thinking about it,
and we need you to keep doing that.
