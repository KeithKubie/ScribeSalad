Rochelle:
Hello.

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:03.067
I'm gonna try to do
something amazing here,

00:00:03.067 --> 00:00:06.067
which is set up for my demo

00:00:06.067 --> 00:00:07.734
while I'm talking.

00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:10.234
So I'm gonna talk
about Google Apps Script.

00:00:10.234 --> 00:00:14.901
It feels kind of natural that
you'd want to get your own data,

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:16.400
and then you
want to do things with it.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.734
And so Google Apps Script lets
you do things with that data.

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:24.400
Let's you do things
across apps.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.567
So I'm gonna actually log on
to a domain,

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:30.167
a test domain...

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.067
which has some examples on it.

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:38.734
Normally I would do this
before I came up here,

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:42.501
but we didn't have the luxury
of two machines here, so...

00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:04.734
So I'll just quickly describe.

00:01:04.734 --> 00:01:06.567
What Google Apps Script
does for you

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.901
is it lets you
automate actions across apps.

00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:12.901
That's a fairly generic way
to say

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:15.901
that it lets you do things that
you would normally do manually.

00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:17.734
It starts in spreadsheets.

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:19.234
It's intended to do
more than that.

00:01:19.234 --> 00:01:21.901
But in spreadsheets, there are
very specific things you can do.

00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:23.400
You can create
custom functions.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.400
You can access and edit data,
formulas or formats.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.067
You can do the things

00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:31.734
that you would almost expect to
be able to do in spreadsheets.

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:33.234
And then it goes
outside of spreadsheets

00:01:33.234 --> 00:01:34.400
to reach into Calendar,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.734
to be able to create
and look at events,

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:40.734
to be able to look at Mail--

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.234
in a very limited way,
to be able to send mail, okay?

00:01:43.234 --> 00:01:47.067
So there will be other things
you can do in Mail eventually,

00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:48.567
but right now
it's just sending mail.

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.734
And you can do
other things as well.

00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:53.234
Grab data from a Web page
and investigate it, look at it,

00:01:53.234 --> 00:01:55.234
do things, act on it,

00:01:55.234 --> 00:01:57.767
do URL Fetch, GET and POST,

00:01:57.767 --> 00:01:59.234
and translate
to other languages.

00:01:59.234 --> 00:02:00.834
So I'm gonna show you
some of those examples.

00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:04.067
I'm gonna focus
on three examples.

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:06.400
The first is fairly simple.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.567
It's a custom function.

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:13.400
And these custom functions
are extremely straightforward.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.067
They're written in JavaScript.

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:17.567
All of Google Apps Script
is JavaScript

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:19.067
with the extensions
of the objects

00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:21.901
that we give you access to.

00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:24.734
So the way you access
Google Apps Script

00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:26.067
is through the Tools menu.

00:02:26.067 --> 00:02:27.400
And right now, just to clarify,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.567
we're actually
in a limited test mode.

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:33.734
So you have to apply to get
your domain activated.

00:02:33.734 --> 00:02:36.067
And once it is activated,

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:38.901
you can access it
the way I'm showing you now.

00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:41.067
And I'll tell you now,
just in case you want to visit--

00:02:41.067 --> 00:02:42.234
We actually have the link

00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:44.734
linked from
the Google Enterprise Blog,

00:02:44.734 --> 00:02:47.234
which is
googleenterprise.blogspot.com.

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:50.067
It's still--I'm not gonna go
into the detailed URL.

00:02:50.067 --> 00:02:51.567
It's still the top post,

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:53.234
so you should be able
to find it no problem.

00:02:53.234 --> 00:02:55.334
But from the Tools menu,
there's a Scripts submenu,

00:02:55.334 --> 00:02:56.601
and you go to Edit Scripts.

00:02:56.601 --> 00:02:59.567
And I'll just very quickly
show you the code

00:02:59.567 --> 00:03:01.234
of these custom functions.

00:03:01.234 --> 00:03:05.067
And a script can contain
more than one function.

00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:08.067
So this script
is called Convert.

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:11.067
It's got two functions in it.

00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:14.067
The first is the
inches-to-millimeters function.

00:03:14.067 --> 00:03:15.901
It is definitely not
the best way, actually,

00:03:15.901 --> 00:03:18.567
to write a function
that's gonna do conversion,

00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:19.901
you know, to have each function

00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:21.400
for every single conversion
you'd want to do,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.234
but I just wanted
to illustrate the point.

00:03:23.234 --> 00:03:26.234
You can see
it's just plain JavaScript.

00:03:26.234 --> 00:03:28.067
There is a declaration
of variables.

00:03:28.067 --> 00:03:30.067
There's a quick test
to look at the input

00:03:30.067 --> 00:03:31.567
and to return something
in the cell

00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:33.567
that says it's an error
if it is,

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:35.234
to do the simple calculation,

00:03:35.234 --> 00:03:37.601
and then to return that value
to the cell.

00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:39.334
So when you have
a custom function,

00:03:39.334 --> 00:03:40.567
it's expecting an input,

00:03:40.567 --> 00:03:42.234
and it's gonna basically
give you an output.

00:03:42.234 --> 00:03:44.400
So what you can see here
is I'm calling that function

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.067
as a normal formula,
it's called in the spreadsheet.

00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:49.234
And it's calculating
the result for me.

00:03:49.234 --> 00:03:51.234
So if I change the input,

00:03:51.234 --> 00:03:53.834
it's gonna calculate
the output.

00:03:57.067 --> 00:03:59.234
So it's very standard.

00:03:59.234 --> 00:04:02.567
And you can basically, you know,
do everything you can do

00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:06.067
with a...

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:08.501
spreadsheet
once you have that function.

00:04:10.567 --> 00:04:12.267
Again, my formats
are a little wacky there,

00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:15.234
but I'll just show you quickly
how it would work.

00:04:15.234 --> 00:04:19.067
If I'm doing parallel
calculation, it's gonna--

00:04:19.067 --> 00:04:20.734
Oh, it didn't do
my extension for me.

00:04:20.734 --> 00:04:22.234
I messed that up.
Sorry.

00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:26.167
But you can see
what the gist of it is.

00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:32.200
So in case any of you

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.567
are looking to convert
many inches to millimeters,

00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:36.567
I'll sell you
this custom function.

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:39.234
This really, really took me
a long time to develop.

00:04:39.234 --> 00:04:40.901
Actually, it literally took
about five minutes

00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:42.067
to develop that one.

00:04:42.067 --> 00:04:43.567
The longest time
was just going to Google Search

00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:46.067
and figuring out what the factor
was to multiply by.

00:04:46.067 --> 00:04:47.567
I didn't have
that one memorized.

00:04:47.567 --> 00:04:50.901
So the second example
I want to show you goes beyond.

00:04:50.901 --> 00:04:52.734
So you saw
how to actually access Script--

00:04:52.734 --> 00:04:53.901
it's in the Tools menu--

00:04:53.901 --> 00:04:55.734
and how to do a custom function
very simply.

00:04:55.734 --> 00:04:59.734
And again, once you have data
pulled in through SDC,

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:01.567
there are things
you want to do with that data.

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:03.734
That's kind of the whole point.

00:05:03.734 --> 00:05:06.067
This example might be
a little bit more relevant.

00:05:06.067 --> 00:05:09.234
We use this one
in Google a lot now.

00:05:09.234 --> 00:05:10.734
This is generally--

00:05:10.734 --> 00:05:13.234
if you look at the generic--
the abstract of this example,

00:05:13.234 --> 00:05:17.267
it's very popular,
which is forms are used...

00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:20.901
prolifically at Google
and other customers.

00:05:20.901 --> 00:05:22.234
And one of the things
you want to do

00:05:22.234 --> 00:05:23.734
is look at the data
that came in on form,

00:05:23.734 --> 00:05:26.067
the same way you'd look at data
that came in through SDC,

00:05:26.067 --> 00:05:27.734
and do stuff with it.

00:05:27.734 --> 00:05:30.067
This one is going to send
confirmation emails.

00:05:30.067 --> 00:05:32.234
So you can manipulate the data,
potentially, that came in

00:05:32.234 --> 00:05:35.234
or look at it and prove it
and send emails.

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:37.067
What I want to show you
in this example is the two ways

00:05:37.067 --> 00:05:39.400
that you can execute a script.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.901
And this script
is not a custom function.

00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:43.734
This one is just processing.

00:05:43.734 --> 00:05:46.734
The two ways
are through a drawing object.

00:05:46.734 --> 00:05:48.567
A drawing object
can be assigned to macro.

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:50.234
So you'll see
I can have a small menu--

00:05:50.234 --> 00:05:52.200
it's a little bit hidden
under my scroll bar there--

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.234
that I can assign a script,

00:05:53.234 --> 00:05:55.067
and I assigned a name
to that script--

00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:56.567
"Email Confirm."

00:05:56.567 --> 00:05:59.067
And the other way
is through a custom menu.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.400
So you can see
the Confirm custom menu

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.901
with just one option here,
which is Send Confirm Emails.

00:06:04.901 --> 00:06:08.067
What this script does
is it looks at this field

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:10.067
to see was this confirm
ever sent?

00:06:10.067 --> 00:06:12.901
And if it was, it won't send it,
but if it's not, it will.

00:06:12.901 --> 00:06:15.400
So I'll click on that button,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.234
and it's running the script.

00:06:17.234 --> 00:06:20.234
You can see it started, and now
it's marking them as sent,

00:06:20.234 --> 00:06:21.734
and it's giving me
a time stamp as well.

00:06:21.734 --> 00:06:23.100
So if I wanted to resend it,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.400
you know, I could basically
blank this out and resend,

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.334
and it'll send it again.

00:06:30.067 --> 00:06:31.901
So I'll quickly jump to--

00:06:31.901 --> 00:06:33.901
Well, I shouldn't say quickly,
'cause I'm just not fast enough

00:06:33.901 --> 00:06:36.167
typing when I'm presenting.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.567
But I'll jump
to my Mail account,

00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:43.834
so you can see the email.

00:06:43.834 --> 00:06:48.234
The email that came in
was defined by my script.

00:06:48.234 --> 00:06:50.901
My script said, "What do I want
that email to contain?"

00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:53.234
So you can see
all those responses just came in

00:06:53.234 --> 00:06:55.234
within the last minute.

00:06:55.234 --> 00:06:57.901
And the contents of that email
is defined by my script.

00:06:57.901 --> 00:07:00.501
I put in there what I wanted to
in the format that I wanted.

00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:03.234
So it's an HTML string,
basically,

00:07:03.234 --> 00:07:04.901
that I sent out to that email.

00:07:04.901 --> 00:07:06.734
I could also create attachments

00:07:06.734 --> 00:07:08.734
and formulate those attachments

00:07:08.734 --> 00:07:11.567
and put them
in that email payload as well,

00:07:11.567 --> 00:07:13.234
and they would come through
as attachments,

00:07:13.234 --> 00:07:14.234
which is kind of neat.

00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:16.234
We actually do that--

00:07:16.234 --> 00:07:18.400
For the documentation
of this product,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.901
we're creating
the documentation

00:07:19.901 --> 00:07:21.901
in an automated way
using script.

00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:23.234
We have a spreadsheet

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:25.067
that contains
all of our documentation,

00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:27.234
and anybody on the team
can go in and change things,

00:07:27.234 --> 00:07:29.400
fix things, whether
they're engineers or not,

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.734
and then somebody
pushes a button,

00:07:30.734 --> 00:07:32.567
and it sends all that stuff
over to the Webmaster

00:07:32.567 --> 00:07:33.901
to put it in the Help Center.

00:07:33.901 --> 00:07:36.400
So it's really
an interesting way to--

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.734
I have to say, the attachment
process was created--

00:07:38.734 --> 00:07:41.734
that feature was created
specifically for the team.

00:07:41.734 --> 00:07:43.734
I guess when it's something
that they're asking for,

00:07:43.734 --> 00:07:46.000
they get to put it
at the top of the list.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.567
So the third example
is translation.

00:07:49.567 --> 00:07:53.400
This is using
another one of these objects,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.067
these beans,

00:07:55.067 --> 00:07:57.234
which also illustrates
one more point,

00:07:57.234 --> 00:07:58.734
which is just analyzing,

00:07:58.734 --> 00:08:01.567
or using,
my currently selected range.

00:08:01.567 --> 00:08:04.267
So this is a rather,
in some ways, dumb function,

00:08:04.267 --> 00:08:06.567
which is it's just gonna take
what I selected.

00:08:06.567 --> 00:08:08.734
It's gonna translate it
and throw it to the right.

00:08:08.734 --> 00:08:10.567
It's just gonna put it
in that highlighted area

00:08:10.567 --> 00:08:11.734
that I have to the right.

00:08:11.734 --> 00:08:13.567
And again, I created
a menu option for that,

00:08:13.567 --> 00:08:17.734
and I, in this case, created
four different caller functions

00:08:17.734 --> 00:08:20.067
so that the menu can be
a little bit more user friendly.

00:08:20.067 --> 00:08:22.734
And I'll say, "Let's translate
that to Spanish."

00:08:22.734 --> 00:08:24.067
It started running the script.

00:08:24.067 --> 00:08:27.734
You can see down below,
it's doing the translation.

00:08:27.734 --> 00:08:31.067
And when it finishes, it'll say
that the script is finished,

00:08:31.067 --> 00:08:33.000
and the results are there.

00:08:35.067 --> 00:08:36.234
Again, like I said,

00:08:36.234 --> 00:08:38.267
there's so much you can do
from that point.

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:39.567
This is really
just to illustrate.

00:08:39.567 --> 00:08:42.734
One of the, you know,
really obvious examples

00:08:42.734 --> 00:08:45.067
is to be able to translate
content and email

00:08:45.067 --> 00:08:46.734
to someone who's not even
on the product.

00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:48.901
So you can actually do
translation

00:08:48.901 --> 00:08:53.067
and send information
to customers or partners.

00:08:53.067 --> 00:08:55.067
I'll show you one more thing
that's just--

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:56.400
at the risk of it not working

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.567
just because I wrote it
late last night--

00:08:59.567 --> 00:09:03.400
which is a conversion function.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.400
Since I showed you the wrong way
to do inches to millimeters,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.400
I'll try to show you
a better way.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.567
This is actually translating
different things.

00:09:10.567 --> 00:09:12.067
And what I did
is I'm translating

00:09:12.067 --> 00:09:14.667
from U.S. dollar to Euro.

00:09:16.067 --> 00:09:18.400
And, you know,
that should work.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.901
Let's see if it changes that.

00:09:20.901 --> 00:09:26.067
But I can also say, "I want
to translate from feet to--"

00:09:26.067 --> 00:09:27.567
I don't know,
somebody give me--

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.400
What do you want
to translate feet to?

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.167
Yards.

00:09:34.901 --> 00:09:36.567
Hey, 30 feet is 10 yards.

00:09:36.567 --> 00:09:37.901
Yeah, I can even--

00:09:37.901 --> 00:09:41.334
You know, I can do liters
to gallons.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.567
Pretty much anything.

00:09:45.567 --> 00:09:47.734
And the way I do that
is through URL Fetch.

00:09:47.734 --> 00:09:49.567
I'm using Google Search.

00:09:49.567 --> 00:09:50.901
I'm using the in operator.

00:09:50.901 --> 00:09:52.400
I don't know
if anybody's ever used that.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.234
But I just basically formulate
the search string,

00:09:54.234 --> 00:09:56.567
and then
when the payload comes back,

00:09:56.567 --> 00:09:59.400
I look at the string,
and I came up with a very--

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.067
This is what--You know, the only
thing that took any time

00:10:02.067 --> 00:10:04.400
was I look at that data
that came back,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.901
and I find the answer.

00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:08.234
So if you look at this script,

00:10:08.234 --> 00:10:10.234
it's fairly simple
but convoluted.

00:10:10.234 --> 00:10:13.067
This is a great sign
of my horrible coding.

00:10:13.067 --> 00:10:15.734
But it's--you know,
it's mostly comments, actually,

00:10:15.734 --> 00:10:18.267
but I have to find the third
table and find the equal sign

00:10:18.267 --> 00:10:20.734
and look for the units,
and I'm there.

00:10:20.734 --> 00:10:22.234
But it's just an example

00:10:22.234 --> 00:10:24.734
of how to actually call out
to external services,

00:10:24.734 --> 00:10:26.234
whether they're your own
or something else,

00:10:26.234 --> 00:10:28.234
through the URL Fetch option.

00:10:28.234 --> 00:10:30.067
And that's pretty much it.

00:10:30.067 --> 00:10:32.901
The most important thing here,
I think, is the extensibility.

00:10:32.901 --> 00:10:36.067
We're gonna be adding--reach out
to other Google apps,

00:10:36.067 --> 00:10:38.234
as well as non-Google apps
at some point.

00:10:38.234 --> 00:10:39.567
But very shortly,

00:10:39.567 --> 00:10:41.734
you'll be seeing
enhancements to this.

00:10:41.734 --> 00:10:44.234
Like I said, go to the
googleenterprise.blogspot.com

00:10:44.234 --> 00:10:46.901
if you want to apply to have
your domain in this limited test

00:10:46.901 --> 00:10:48.734
that we're doing right now.

00:10:48.734 --> 00:10:51.767
It's likely
you can be accepted into that,

00:10:51.767 --> 00:10:54.567
and fairly soon you'll see it

00:10:54.567 --> 00:10:58.067
launched across
all of Google apps.

00:10:58.067 --> 00:11:00.167
That's it.
Thanks.

00:11:00.167 --> 00:11:03.901
[applause]

00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:05.400
Do you want to take
questions now?

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.234
Do we have time for questions?

00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:08.667
Great.

00:11:12.567 --> 00:11:14.567
Do they have the mic on?

00:11:14.567 --> 00:11:16.234
man:
There we go.

00:11:16.234 --> 00:11:19.567
Question about--two quick ones,
one about the email.

00:11:19.567 --> 00:11:23.067
You mentioned that you
can put attachments on that

00:11:23.067 --> 00:11:25.434
before sending out the email.

00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:28.901
Can you format the attachments
to be in-line

00:11:28.901 --> 00:11:31.400
or just payload attachments
on an email?

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.734
Are there ways
of configuring that so that--

00:11:33.734 --> 00:11:36.734
Say, can you format it as HTML?

00:11:36.734 --> 00:11:39.067
Rochelle:
You can pretty much do anything.

00:11:39.067 --> 00:11:41.567
In other words, that attachment
is really, literally,

00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:43.234
just a bitstream.

00:11:43.234 --> 00:11:45.067
It's a blob.
man: Okay.

00:11:45.067 --> 00:11:47.067
The other one is,
you mentioned--

00:11:47.067 --> 00:11:50.067
In the little script
you wrote to convert,

00:11:50.067 --> 00:11:52.234
you looked
for the unit character.

00:11:52.234 --> 00:11:53.901
How do you find the units?

00:11:53.901 --> 00:11:55.734
Rochelle: It's really
just pattern matching,

00:11:55.734 --> 00:11:58.100
and it just took some testing,
to be honest.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.167
I mean, if you could see me
writing this thing,

00:12:00.167 --> 00:12:02.067
it was almost funny,
'cause I just kept returning

00:12:02.067 --> 00:12:04.234
whatever I could find
until I narrowed down,

00:12:04.234 --> 00:12:07.901
and then I had to find
some crazy ASCII character

00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:09.400
that represents a comma.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.734
It was insane.

00:12:10.734 --> 00:12:13.567
But it was simple to write
and then hard to perfect,

00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:15.567
and I would say
it's still not perfect,

00:12:15.567 --> 00:12:17.400
but it is useful, actually.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.901
man: So one thing I haven't seen
yet or heard anyone talk about

00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:23.567
is what are the scalability
and deployment guidelines

00:12:23.567 --> 00:12:25.901
for the Secure Data Connector
on my server?

00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:28.901
I mean, it's deployed to one box
is what it looks like here

00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:31.234
via 50,000 employees.

00:12:31.234 --> 00:12:32.234
How is that gonna work?

00:12:32.234 --> 00:12:33.400
How many boxes
does it deploy to?

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.567
What's failover?

00:12:34.567 --> 00:12:36.234
Can you guys talk
about that at all?

00:12:36.234 --> 00:12:39.067
man #2: There's more
documentation on the site,

00:12:39.067 --> 00:12:42.734
but in short, basically,
you can run multiple instances

00:12:42.734 --> 00:12:45.734
of the SDC agent
and the failover

00:12:45.734 --> 00:12:47.567
to each other.

00:12:47.567 --> 00:12:49.667
man: Okay.
man #2: Yeah.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.567
Rochelle:
Any other questions?

00:12:53.567 --> 00:12:55.501
man #2:
Any other questions?

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.901
man: When is this
gonna be broadly available?

00:12:59.901 --> 00:13:01.400
Rochelle: I'm sorry.
Say that again.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.067
man: Accessing data,
say, you know,

00:13:04.067 --> 00:13:05.767
behind corporate firewalls
and whatnot.

00:13:05.767 --> 00:13:07.067
Rochelle: Secure Data Connector?
man: Yeah.

00:13:07.067 --> 00:13:09.234
man #2: What I have demoed today
are all in production,

00:13:09.234 --> 00:13:10.634
so you can do it today.

00:13:10.634 --> 00:13:14.567
And all the--The two products
are Open Source products,

00:13:14.567 --> 00:13:17.067
so you can download
and configure them yourself.

00:13:17.067 --> 00:13:18.901
Rochelle: Yeah, so the limited
test that I was talking about

00:13:18.901 --> 00:13:20.400
was literally
for Google Apps Script,

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.901
not for Secure Data Connector.

00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:27.000
man: What about dynamic data
in forms?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
man #2: What--Oh.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.067
man: Spreadsheet forms.

00:13:29.067 --> 00:13:30.300
Rochelle: I'm sorry.
man: Forms?

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.567
Spreadsheet forms.
Rochelle: Yeah, what about them?

00:13:32.567 --> 00:13:34.901
man: I don't know if there's
a talk specifically on forms,

00:13:34.901 --> 00:13:38.934
but a big need we have
is making dynamic forms--

00:13:38.934 --> 00:13:42.734
are more, you know,
responsive to actual data.

00:13:42.734 --> 00:13:44.234
Rochelle:
Yeah, so one of the things

00:13:44.234 --> 00:13:46.234
that we expect to add
to Google Apps Script

00:13:46.234 --> 00:13:47.901
is event processing.

00:13:47.901 --> 00:13:49.901
So I'm thinking--
Tell me if I'm wrong,

00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:51.901
but what a lot of people
are asking for is to do things

00:13:51.901 --> 00:13:54.167
like when a form submission
comes in, do something.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:55.234
Is that what you mean?

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:57.734
man: Well, no,
actually pulling data,

00:13:57.734 --> 00:13:59.901
creating dynamic questions...

00:13:59.901 --> 00:14:01.234
Rochelle: Ah, okay.
man: from a data source.

00:14:01.234 --> 00:14:02.567
So, yeah, that's interesting.

00:14:02.567 --> 00:14:04.400
Since we don't yet have
a good API

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.567
into the forms capability
of spreadsheets,

00:14:07.567 --> 00:14:10.734
we don't have anything on Script
that reaches into that.

00:14:10.734 --> 00:14:12.734
But we do expect to do that.
It's just not there yet.

00:14:12.734 --> 00:14:17.400
Yeah, forms is an incredibly
popular feature right now,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.167
so we expect to do
a lot more with that.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.400
Okay, looks like we're done.
Thanks.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.067
man #2:
Thank you.

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:31.000
[applause]
