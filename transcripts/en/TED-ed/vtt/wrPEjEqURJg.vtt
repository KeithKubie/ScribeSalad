00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:11.283
You may take them for granted, 
but your teeth are a marvel.

00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:14.433
They break up all your food 
over the course of your life,

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:18.263
while being strong enough
to withstand breakage themselves.

00:00:18.263 --> 00:00:21.183
And they’re formed using 
only the raw materials

00:00:21.183 --> 00:00:24.403
from the food they grind down 
in the first place.

00:00:24.403 --> 00:00:26.834
What’s behind their impressive strength?

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:31.313
Teeth rely on an ingenious structure 
that makes them both hard and tough.

00:00:31.313 --> 00:00:35.631
Hardness can be thought of as the ability 
to resist a crack from starting,

00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:39.444
while toughness is what stops 
the crack from spreading

00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:42.338
Very few materials have both properties.

00:00:42.338 --> 00:00:46.214
For instance, glass is hard but not tough,

00:00:46.214 --> 00:00:48.963
while leather is tough but not hard.

00:00:48.963 --> 00:00:51.979
Teeth manage both by having two layers:

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:57.444
a hard external cap of enamel, made up
almost entirely of a calcium phosphate,

00:00:57.444 --> 00:01:00.632
and beneath it, 
a tougher layer of dentin,

00:01:00.632 --> 00:01:04.293
partly formed from organic fibers 
that make it flexible.

00:01:04.293 --> 00:01:08.201
This amazing structure is created 
by two types of cells:

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:10.995
ameloblasts that secrete enamel

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:14.075
and odontoblasts that secrete dentin.

00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:17.103
As they form teeth, 
odontoblasts move inward,

00:01:17.103 --> 00:01:21.554
while ameloblasts move out 
and slough off when they hit the surface.

00:01:21.554 --> 00:01:25.567
For enamel, this process produces long, 
thin strands,

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:28.934
each about 60 nanometers in diameter.

00:01:28.934 --> 00:01:32.295
That’s one one-thousandth 
the width of a human hair.

00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:35.695
Those are bundled into rods, 
packed together,

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:38.393
tens of thousands per square millimeter,

00:01:38.393 --> 00:01:41.525
to form the shield-like enamel layer.

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:45.264
Once this process is finished, 
your enamel can’t repair itself again

00:01:45.264 --> 00:01:48.745
because all the cells 
that make it are lost,

00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:52.224
so we’re lucky that enamel 
can’t be easily destroyed.

00:01:52.224 --> 00:01:58.434
Odontoblasts use a more complex process,
but unlike ameloblasts, they stick around,

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:01.845
continuing to secrete dentin 
throughout your life.

00:02:01.845 --> 00:02:05.176
Despite the differences in teeth 
across the mammalian order,

00:02:05.176 --> 00:02:10.004
the underlying process of tooth growth 
is the same whether it’s for lions,

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:11.035
kangaroos,

00:02:11.035 --> 00:02:11.964
elephants,

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:13.566
or us.

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:17.074
What changes is how nature sculpts 
the shape of the tooth,

00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:19.389
altering the folding and growth patterns

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:23.234
to suit the distinct diets 
of different species.

00:02:23.234 --> 00:02:28.513
Cows have flat molar teeth with parallel 
ridges for grinding tough grasses.

00:02:28.513 --> 00:02:34.192
Cats have sharp crested molars, 
like blades, for shearing meat and sinew.

00:02:34.192 --> 00:02:39.083
Pigs have blunt, thick ones, 
useful for crushing hard roots and seeds.

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:41.502
The myriad molars of modern mammals

00:02:41.502 --> 00:02:45.271
can be traced back to a common form
called “tribosphenic,"

00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:47.972
which first appeared 
during the dinosaur age.

00:02:47.972 --> 00:02:51.961
In the 19th Century, 
paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope

00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:55.442
developed the basic model 
for how this form evolved.

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:59.002
He hypothesized that 
it started with a cone-like tooth,

00:02:59.002 --> 00:03:02.382
as we see in many fishes, 
amphibians, and reptiles.

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:06.892
Small cusps were then added, 
so the tooth had three in a row,

00:03:06.892 --> 00:03:10.634
aligned front to back,
and connected by crests.

00:03:10.634 --> 00:03:15.524
Over time, the cusps were pushed out 
of line to make triangular crowns.

00:03:15.524 --> 00:03:21.193
Adjacent teeth formed a continuous 
zigzag of crests for slicing and dicing.

00:03:21.193 --> 00:03:25.114
A low shelf then formed 
at the back of each set of teeth,

00:03:25.114 --> 00:03:27.721
which became a platform for crushing.

00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:32.545
As Cope realized, the tribosphenic molar 
served as the jumping-off point

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:35.894
for the radiation of specialized
forms to follow,

00:03:35.894 --> 00:03:38.392
each shaped by evolutionary needs.

00:03:38.392 --> 00:03:40.899
Straighten the crests 
and remove the shelf,

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:44.503
and you’ve got the conveniently 
bladed teeth of cats and dogs.

00:03:44.503 --> 00:03:50.335
Remove the front cusp, raise the shelf, 
and you’ve got our human molars.

00:03:50.335 --> 00:03:54.025
A few additional tweaks get you 
a horse or cow tooth.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:58.234
Some details in Cope’s intuitive
hypothesis proved wrong.

00:03:58.234 --> 00:03:59.435
But in the fossil record,

00:03:59.435 --> 00:04:03.164
there are examples of teeth 
that look just as he predicted

00:04:03.164 --> 00:04:08.275
and we can trace the molars of all living
mammals back to that primitive form.

00:04:08.275 --> 00:04:11.743
Today, the ability to consume 
diverse forms of food

00:04:11.743 --> 00:04:14.119
enables mammals to survive in habitats

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:17.045
ranging from mountain peaks 
and ocean depths

00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:19.269
to rainforests and deserts.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.705
So the success of our biological class 
is due in no small measure

00:04:23.705 --> 00:04:26.295
to the remarkable strength 
and adaptability

00:04:26.295 --> 00:04:28.795
of the humble mammalian molar.
