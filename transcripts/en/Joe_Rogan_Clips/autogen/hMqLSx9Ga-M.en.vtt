best time I know a couple people that
 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.190
best time I know a couple people that
have done on mushrooms

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200
have done on mushrooms

the trees are so though the first time I

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650
the trees are so though the first time I
 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.089
the trees are so though the first time I
did it I was like super grandma you know

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099
did it I was like super grandma you know
 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.619

like everybody's like what's wrong with

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629
like everybody's like what's wrong with
 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.949
like everybody's like what's wrong with
him like no no just because the snow is

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959
him like no no just because the snow is
 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.740
him like no no just because the snow is
all the same - right so now it just fox

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750
all the same - right so now it just fox
 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.240
all the same - right so now it just fox
fur you depth perception so bad you know

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250
fur you depth perception so bad you know
 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.610
fur you depth perception so bad you know
you don't see whether divots in the snow

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620
you don't see whether divots in the snow
 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.879
you don't see whether divots in the snow
yeah everything gets pixelated yeah oh

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889
yeah everything gets pixelated yeah oh
 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.950
yeah everything gets pixelated yeah oh
you're a really trippin hard then oh man

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960
you're a really trippin hard then oh man
 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.080
you're a really trippin hard then oh man
everything is like the same and I can't

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090
everything is like the same and I can't
 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.700
everything is like the same and I can't
really see the bumps and then I I don't

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710
really see the bumps and then I I don't
 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.420
really see the bumps and then I I don't
see the bumps I just feel him in all

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430
see the bumps I just feel him in all
 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.680
see the bumps I just feel him in all
right I'm gonna need the toughness one

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690
right I'm gonna need the toughness one
 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.420
right I'm gonna need the toughness one
now in the story you know and then the

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430
now in the story you know and then the
 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.219
now in the story you know and then the
next time I did it it allowed a little

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229
next time I did it it allowed a little
 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.140
next time I did it it allowed a little
less of a dosage had a blast you know

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150
less of a dosage had a blast you know
 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.000
less of a dosage had a blast you know
yeah they say it's a it's a micro dose

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010
yeah they say it's a it's a micro dose
 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.280
yeah they say it's a it's a micro dose
thing yes just like don't take like

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290
thing yes just like don't take like
 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.920
thing yes just like don't take like
three grams take like a half a gram yeah

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930
three grams take like a half a gram yeah
 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.570
three grams take like a half a gram yeah
something like that well the first time

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580
something like that well the first time
 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.550
something like that well the first time
I was doing the bro science it was like

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560
I was doing the bro science it was like
 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.080
I was doing the bro science it was like
yeah I think it's like four grams is

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090
yeah I think it's like four grams is
 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.230
yeah I think it's like four grams is
cool man let's go like on a fat I'm done

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240
cool man let's go like on a fat I'm done
 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.969
cool man let's go like on a fat I'm done
like a slight fast you know you're the

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979
like a slight fast you know you're the
 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.129
like a slight fast you know you're the
problem with it that division thing when

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139
problem with it that division thing when
 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.570
problem with it that division thing when
things when you do the mushrooms and

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580
things when you do the mushrooms and
 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.250
things when you do the mushrooms and
things get pixelated well you see like

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260
things get pixelated well you see like
 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.159
things get pixelated well you see like
almost like a matrix around you that

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169
almost like a matrix around you that
 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:10.689
almost like a matrix around you that
yeah I would imagine that that would

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699
yeah I would imagine that that would
 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.400
yeah I would imagine that that would
fuck you up skiing you wouldn't be able

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410
fuck you up skiing you wouldn't be able
 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.110
fuck you up skiing you wouldn't be able
to see all the creases in the snow and

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120
to see all the creases in the snow and
 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.939
to see all the creases in the snow and
shit and you just feel it all of a

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949
shit and you just feel it all of a
 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.300
shit and you just feel it all of a
sudden you have a snowboard I did it for

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310
sudden you have a snowboard I did it for
 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.800
sudden you have a snowboard I did it for
like half a day I was pretty cool but I

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810

parks you know like on ramps on half
 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.550
parks you know like on ramps on half
pipes probably yeah so I could like jump

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560
pipes probably yeah so I could like jump
 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.279
pipes probably yeah so I could like jump
on rails and half pipes and I could even

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289
on rails and half pipes and I could even
 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.589
on rails and half pipes and I could even
do like a front flip on on my skate but

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599
do like a front flip on on my skate but
 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.140

skateboard as a kid but i've never
 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.279
skateboard as a kid but i've never
snowboarded but the people that do it

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289
snowboarded but the people that do it
 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:46.779
snowboarded but the people that do it
they say it's easier to get better at

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789
they say it's easier to get better at
 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:48.640
they say it's easier to get better at
snowboarding there's to get better at

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650
snowboarding there's to get better at
 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.610
snowboarding there's to get better at
skiing they say it's like it's hard in

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620
skiing they say it's like it's hard in
 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.870

you fall a lot of latitudes fall this

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310
you fall a lot of latitudes fall this
 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.890
you fall a lot of latitudes fall this
the snowboard goes up in the air your

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900
the snowboard goes up in the air your
 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.210
the snowboard goes up in the air your
feet are stuck on it you land right on

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220
