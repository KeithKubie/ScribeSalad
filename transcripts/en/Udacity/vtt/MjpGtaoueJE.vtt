00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.390
One example where we want to have more precision is a keyword search.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.090
You may have given some other examples.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.320
Look in the forum to see what other students have to say.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.500
In the case of the keyword search we might want some

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.550
documents retrieved that we are interested in.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.240
In this context precision corresponds directly to something you care about.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.740
How many of the documents you're showing your user

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.030
are actually relevant to them?

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:36.045
One thing to note here is that precision depends on the positive outcomes only.

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:39.260
Thus if you are interested in the positive class,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.380
precision is a good metric to use.
