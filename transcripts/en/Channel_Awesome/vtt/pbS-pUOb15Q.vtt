Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic!

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.600
I remember it so you don't have to!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
When you're a kid,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.100
a lot of strange stuff seems normal.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.700
Ninja Turtles was average,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.800
tea parties on the ceiling was mundane,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.400
and being forced to dance in a banana suit dripping goat's blood was just Tuesday.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.500
Oh!

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.400
Only my parents had me do that?

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.700
I... should've asked more questions.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.000
Regardless, a lot of those things when you get older seem... charming.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.700
Some of them.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.800
Some you put in the "Whimsical Enchantment" category,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800
Others you put in "What the Hell Was I Thinking Watching This" category,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.200
And then there's those...

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200
You don't know where to put.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:48.700
Japan's 1974 English dub of Jack and the Beanstalk  falls into that category of not knowing the category.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.100
Like a fair amount of kids, I grew up with this bizarre adventure on VHS.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.500
It was available at a lot of rental stores at the time.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.500
We watched it,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.300
it kept us quiet,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.300
and then we'd go about our everyday lives.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.000
But what we didn't know was that "What-the-Christ-ness"

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.500
was leaving an impact on our memories that years later we'd say,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.400
"Was that really as freakin' insane as I remember it?"

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.900
I'm hear to report,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.000
it freakin' is.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.400
It starts off similar enough:

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.700
Jack is doing his chores,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.700
skipping through the woods,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.200
usual fairy tale benign-ness.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.300
We find out his dog used to be part of the Grand Army...

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.200
I think.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.300
He has a symbol on his collar that's similar to an army he fantasizes about in the clouds...

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.900
so there's that.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.600
Trust me, that's the least of the questions you will be asking while watching this!

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.100
And par for the course, Jack is asked to sell the cow and comes across a mysterious man

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.400

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.600
and doesn't talk after it either.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.300
And yet, he somehow has this big musical solo.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.500
He not even really good.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.600
Crosby (roughly singing): ♪ ALWAYS WE AGREE ♪

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.900
♪ YOU AND I ♪

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.000
NC: I guess should be really harsh on that voice, but

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.600
a DOG is singing!

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.700
I really shouldn't be that critical!

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.500
And what's Jack's reaction to all this?

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.700
Jack: You can speak.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.000
How come you never said anything to me?

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.200
Crosby: *woof*

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:16.760
*woof*

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.100
Jack: Or maybe

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.500
it's another miracle.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.100
A sign that I should have stayed to help.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.000
NC: Sometimes it just takes a singing dog.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.000
Yeah! There is no other explanation outside of that.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.400
The dog singing was a MIRACLE!

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.200
A very,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.800
VERY random miracle.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.800
But, Jack takes it as sign to go back

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.400
and figure out how to snap Margaret out of her trance.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.500
Harp: THE PRINCESS MUST BE KISSED

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.000
by someone who is truly brave and courageous!

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.700
Only THAT will break the spell!

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.700
Jack: Someone truly brave?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.600
Gosh!

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.600
I wonder if I'm brave enough to even try.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.500
Harp: Ew!

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.200
NC: Yeah. This gets

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.700
possibly Ew-y.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.300
We know Jack's  gotta be like nine

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:00.800
or ten

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.900
or something like that,

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.300
but, they never say how old Margaret is.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.900
I guess old enough to marry

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.200
but even that varies in terms of time period and location.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.800
So, while you might be feeling awkward about

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.700
not really knowing if you should feel awkward about this,

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.300
don't worry.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.800
It will quickly disappear

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.500
after the STRANGEST SCENE IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE.

Why all the paper people?

Why all the trippy animation?

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.200

It's all just pure madness!

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.300
to a point where when Jack comes in and finally kisses her,

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.900
you've TOTALLY forgotten about the age thing!

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.700
It's not even a spark in your mind.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.500
All you thinking is:

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.400
(imitating Priest): Are you hapPYYY?!

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.500
Are you hapPYYY?!

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.100
(normal) NO!

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.700
I'm very confused and rather afraid!

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.100
WHAT IS THIS?!

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.900
The kiss, of course, breaks the spell and the giant chases after them.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.700
Mmn, Okay. You know where this is going.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.100
The giant chases after 'em

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.200
he cuts down the beanstalk

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.800
and they live happily ever after.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.200
Well!

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.700
Not after an out-of-nowhere,

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.200
totally pointless conversation between our two heroes.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.800
Jack: Aren't you angry with me?

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.400
I mean, after what I did?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.900
Margaret: Angry?

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.800
Now why would I be you, Jack?

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.300
Jack: I wouldn't blame you if you WERE angry though.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.600
I know what I did was–

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.300
NC: Yeah. My kids are getting restless.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.400
Can we wrap this up here?

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.300
They run from the giant again only to be confronted by Hecuba.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.200
[lightning strike]

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.900
[lightning strike]

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.100
Okay, no joke.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.100
If I saw you at the end "The Shining" hallway instead of the two little girls

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.400
I'd be more afraid of you.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.100
But, the giant comes in and

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.200
(confused): weirdly enough doesn't stomp our heroes

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.000
but instead goes over to stomp the mother.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.300
Kind of randomly out of left field.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.200
[stomp]

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.100
Hecuba: *screams*

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.000
Tulip: Goodbye!

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:49.900
NC: It's...

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.400
made even stranger by the fact that's she's NOT technically under there!

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.100
But!

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.000
The movie TREATS IT like she's under there!

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.200
He's right in front of her,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.300
he says goodbye,

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.400
he put his foot down,

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.700
black smoke comes out presumably destroying her evil, I guess

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.100
turning everyone else back to normal, and

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.400
in the ultimate twist,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.400
SHE WAS A ROBOT THE WHOLE TIME!

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.500
If you're confused by this, kids;

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.100
I'm sorry.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.300
No adult can EVER help you.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.200
NONE of these ravings make ANY sense!

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.400
You might as put on a David Lynch film to get a dose of reality.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.500
But, okay.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.100
Margaret has to stay with her people and Jack has to go back home.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.700
Now leading to him chopping down the beanstalk and killing the giant.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.260
Right?

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.200
Well,

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.400
In yet another strange mood shift,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.200
it suddenly turns into a Road Runner™ cartoon!

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.800
Yeah, with the slapstick,

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.000
his head getting smacked in,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.800

Like, none of the scene are supposed to connect?

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.000
Even when we DO get the climax of Jack chopping down the beanstalk,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.900

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.400
And that was

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.400
in my opinion

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.200
the WEIRDEST Jack and the Beanstalk
film.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.700
Is it any good?

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.700
Well

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.600
...parts are.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.600
There is a lot of good animation,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.400
backgrounds,

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.100
atmosphere,

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.100
imagination.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.240
But.. yeah, it's pretty inconsistent when it comes to story, characters,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.900
and ESPECIALLY the tone.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.460
But honestly, that's one of the things that makes it so interesting.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.720
The lack of consistency makes it kind of hypnotizing.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.980
I can't think of any other fairy tale adaptation on the big screen with choices this...

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.200
specifically ODD!

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.200
So in a weird way, I DO kinda recommend checking it out.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.380
If you're curious to join in the madness like me, you can find it on DVD–

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.080
Oh, my GOD!

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.580
...find it on YouTube!

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.620
