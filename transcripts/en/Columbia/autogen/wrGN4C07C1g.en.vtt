that and this was a way of actually

00:27:39.419 --> 00:27:39.429
that and this was a way of actually
 

00:27:39.429 --> 00:27:42.450
that and this was a way of actually
trying to illustrate that in a more

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:42.460
trying to illustrate that in a more
 

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.060
trying to illustrate that in a more
graphic way and the the idea is imagine

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:45.070
graphic way and the the idea is imagine
 

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:47.730
graphic way and the the idea is imagine
that there's a parade of people and that

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:47.740
that there's a parade of people and that
 

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.200

the people's height is actually
 

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.879
the people's height is actually
represented by the proportion of wealth

00:27:50.879 --> 00:27:50.889

so if we were to start at this end of
 

00:27:55.149 --> 00:27:56.519
so if we were to start at this end of
the parade here for sis to be the end of

the parade here for sis to be the end of
 

00:27:56.529 --> 00:27:58.529
the parade here for sis to be the end of
the parade you know this would be the

00:27:58.529 --> 00:27:58.539
the parade you know this would be the
 

00:27:58.539 --> 00:28:01.019
the parade you know this would be the
ninety nine point nine nine fifth

ninety nine point nine nine fifth
 

00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:03.930
ninety nine point nine nine fifth

hundred and thirty three feet tall so

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:06.250
hundred and thirty three feet tall so
 

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:06.899
hundred and thirty three feet tall so
we're just seeing the

00:28:06.899 --> 00:28:06.909
we're just seeing the
 

00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:09.299
we're just seeing the
shoes and the individual goes way up

00:28:09.299 --> 00:28:09.309
shoes and the individual goes way up
 

00:28:09.309 --> 00:28:11.190
shoes and the individual goes way up
there someplace well above the the

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200
there someplace well above the the
 

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.289
there someplace well above the the
campus and then as soon as you get to

00:28:13.289 --> 00:28:13.299
campus and then as soon as you get to
 

00:28:13.299 --> 00:28:16.499
campus and then as soon as you get to
the 99.9 fifth percentile we drop down

00:28:16.499 --> 00:28:16.509
the 99.9 fifth percentile we drop down
 

00:28:16.509 --> 00:28:20.940
the 99.9 fifth percentile we drop down
to them to to a very short 181 feet and

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:20.950
to them to to a very short 181 feet and
 

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.099
to them to to a very short 181 feet and
then when you get down to the 97th

00:28:23.099 --> 00:28:23.109
then when you get down to the 97th
 

00:28:23.109 --> 00:28:25.919
then when you get down to the 97th
percentile we get down to the 21 foot

00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:25.929
percentile we get down to the 21 foot
 

00:28:25.929 --> 00:28:27.779
percentile we get down to the 21 foot
person and if you actually look at the

00:28:27.779 --> 00:28:27.789
person and if you actually look at the
 

00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:31.409
person and if you actually look at the
entire parade this is what the parade

00:28:31.409 --> 00:28:31.419
entire parade this is what the parade
 

00:28:31.419 --> 00:28:32.759
entire parade this is what the parade
would look like so actually we'd start

00:28:32.759 --> 00:28:32.769
would look like so actually we'd start
 

00:28:32.769 --> 00:28:36.119
would look like so actually we'd start
out here and as the author points out at

00:28:36.119 --> 00:28:36.129
out here and as the author points out at
 

00:28:36.129 --> 00:28:37.229
out here and as the author points out at
the beginning of the parade you wouldn't

00:28:37.229 --> 00:28:37.239
the beginning of the parade you wouldn't
 

00:28:37.239 --> 00:28:38.460
the beginning of the parade you wouldn't
see anybody because they'd actually be

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:38.470
see anybody because they'd actually be
 

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:41.159
see anybody because they'd actually be
underground there but their heads would

00:28:41.159 --> 00:28:41.169
underground there but their heads would
 

00:28:41.169 --> 00:28:42.509
underground there but their heads would
be below the ground because they

00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:42.519
be below the ground because they
 

00:28:42.519 --> 00:28:44.310
be below the ground because they
actually owe people money or their being

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320
actually owe people money or their being
 

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.320
actually owe people money or their being
there being subsidized in one way

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:46.330
there being subsidized in one way
 

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:49.080
there being subsidized in one way
another and then we have all of these

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:49.090
another and then we have all of these
 

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.450
another and then we have all of these
people be a long long long parade and

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:51.460
people be a long long long parade and
 

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.830
people be a long long long parade and
then you'd get to the end and like boom

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840
then you'd get to the end and like boom
 

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.930
then you'd get to the end and like boom
all the wealthy people would go by very

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:54.940
all the wealthy people would go by very
 

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:58.649
all the wealthy people would go by very
very quickly and this is as you can see

00:28:58.649 --> 00:28:58.659
very quickly and this is as you can see
 

00:28:58.659 --> 00:29:01.019
very quickly and this is as you can see
it log a beautiful beautiful log normal

00:29:01.019 --> 00:29:01.029
it log a beautiful beautiful log normal
 

00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:04.139
it log a beautiful beautiful log normal
distribution in and of course and this

00:29:04.139 --> 00:29:04.149
distribution in and of course and this
 

00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:06.469
distribution in and of course and this
came up a lot during the recent election

00:29:06.469 --> 00:29:06.479
came up a lot during the recent election
 

00:29:06.479 --> 00:29:09.629
came up a lot during the recent election
the debates about you know how who we

00:29:09.629 --> 00:29:09.639
the debates about you know how who we
 

00:29:09.639 --> 00:29:11.549
the debates about you know how who we
would tax what's the base and so forth

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559
would tax what's the base and so forth
 

00:29:11.559 --> 00:29:13.919
would tax what's the base and so forth
and of course in our country I think we

00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:13.929
and of course in our country I think we
 

00:29:13.929 --> 00:29:16.469
and of course in our country I think we
recognize that everybody here plays a

00:29:16.469 --> 00:29:16.479
recognize that everybody here plays a
 

00:29:16.479 --> 00:29:19.950
recognize that everybody here plays a
role but this wealth distribution is

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:19.960
role but this wealth distribution is
 

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.509
role but this wealth distribution is
something that we're quite familiar with

00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:21.519
something that we're quite familiar with
 

00:29:21.519 --> 00:29:23.940
something that we're quite familiar with
the article argues however that the

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:23.950
the article argues however that the
 

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.190
the article argues however that the
wealth distribution is much more skewed

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.200
wealth distribution is much more skewed
 

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.109
wealth distribution is much more skewed
than you would expect and I'll leave you

00:29:28.109 --> 00:29:28.119
than you would expect and I'll leave you
 

00:29:28.119 --> 00:29:29.789

about that my main point is that you can

00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559
about that my main point is that you can
 

00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:35.339
about that my main point is that you can
see that it fits a lot of a lot of

00:29:35.339 --> 00:29:35.349
see that it fits a lot of a lot of
 

00:29:35.349 --> 00:29:36.930
see that it fits a lot of a lot of
things that that we know about the world

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:36.940
things that that we know about the world
 

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.969
things that that we know about the world
so I know I want to talk about some just

00:29:38.969 --> 00:29:38.979
so I know I want to talk about some just
 

00:29:38.979 --> 00:29:40.589
so I know I want to talk about some just
a couple of examples because there isn't

00:29:40.589 --> 00:29:40.599
a couple of examples because there isn't
 

00:29:40.599 --> 00:29:42.210
a couple of examples because there isn't
very much time about the science that I

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:42.220
very much time about the science that I
 

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.489
very much time about the science that I
do but I wanted to start out by by

00:29:44.489 --> 00:29:44.499
do but I wanted to start out by by
 

00:29:44.499 --> 00:29:46.379
do but I wanted to start out by by
acknowledging in case I forget that I'm

a chair I don't really do very much I

00:29:49.229 --> 00:29:49.239
a chair I don't really do very much I
 

00:29:49.239 --> 00:29:51.210
a chair I don't really do very much I
sort of write the grants and try to

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:51.220
sort of write the grants and try to
 

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.339
sort of write the grants and try to
stimulate people to write papers and go

00:29:53.339 --> 00:29:53.349
stimulate people to write papers and go
 

00:29:53.349 --> 00:29:55.560
stimulate people to write papers and go
out and get grants and fellowships and

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:55.570
out and get grants and fellowships and

out and get grants and fellowships and
things like that and so you know really

00:29:57.839 --> 00:29:57.849
things like that and so you know really
 

00:29:57.849 --> 00:30:00.960
things like that and so you know really
it's my lab and this is my lab here we

we can you know I think that if you have
 

00:30:05.739 --> 00:30:07.409
we can you know I think that if you have
talked to any scientist they recognized

we know it in Salford and you know I I

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:36.110
we know it in Salford and you know I I
 

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:37.660
we know it in Salford and you know I I
actually haven't said anything about

that tactic but the very first paper I
 

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.720
that tactic but the very first paper I
did this was back when I was a postdoc

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:01.730
did this was back when I was a postdoc
 

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:03.880
did this was back when I was a postdoc
in England and we worked on this machine

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:03.890
in England and we worked on this machine
 

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:06.280
in England and we worked on this machine
called the eco Tron and we knew the

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:06.290
called the eco Tron and we knew the
 

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:08.530
called the eco Tron and we knew the
power of naming something like that and

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:08.540
power of naming something like that and

that we built of many different species

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:23.420
that we built of many different species
 

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.390
that we built of many different species
and then we built a variety of other

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:25.400
and then we built a variety of other
 

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.880
and then we built a variety of other
communities which had fewer and fewer

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:27.890
communities which had fewer and fewer
 

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:30.880

there were sixteen chambers you would

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.320
there were sixteen chambers you would
 

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.110
there were sixteen chambers you would
find that there were smaller numbers of

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120
find that there were smaller numbers of
 

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.460
find that there were smaller numbers of
species and we actually asked the

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:36.470
species and we actually asked the
 

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:38.890
species and we actually asked the
question what would happen if you were

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:38.900
question what would happen if you were
 

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.110
question what would happen if you were
to lose biodiversity and believe in a

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120
to lose biodiversity and believe in a
 

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.330
to lose biodiversity and believe in a
lot in 1994 that was the first time that

lot in 1994 that was the first time that
 

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.799
lot in 1994 that was the first time that
anybody had ever asked that question

00:31:44.799 --> 00:31:44.809
anybody had ever asked that question
 

00:31:44.809 --> 00:31:46.900
anybody had ever asked that question
trust postdocs who don't know any better

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:46.910
trust postdocs who don't know any better

to say gosh you know nobody's asked that

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:49.010
to say gosh you know nobody's asked that
 

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.860
to say gosh you know nobody's asked that
question why don't we try it out and

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:50.870
question why don't we try it out and
 

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:52.600
question why don't we try it out and
there are about 10 of us who worked on

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:20.250
that's about 1,600 species of mammals
and birds and reptiles so there are no

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:20.260
and birds and reptiles so there are no
 

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.870
and birds and reptiles so there are no
insects or anything like that in here

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:21.880
insects or anything like that in here
 

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.660
insects or anything like that in here
but you can see that you know in 1970

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:24.670
but you can see that you know in 1970
 

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.130
but you can see that you know in 1970
we're not sure if things were getting

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:26.140
we're not sure if things were getting
 

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.810
we're not sure if things were getting
better because we were actually setting

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:27.820
better because we were actually setting
 

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.240
better because we were actually setting
up more parks or conservation biology

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:30.250
up more parks or conservation biology
 

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.010
up more parks or conservation biology
was growing or whether we're just

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:32.020
was growing or whether we're just
 

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.360
was growing or whether we're just
getting more and more data about more

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:33.370
getting more and more data about more
 

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:35.760
getting more and more data about more
species out there but it's clear that

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:35.770
species out there but it's clear that
 

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:39.320
species out there but it's clear that
right here as we got into the 1990s that

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:39.330
right here as we got into the 1990s that
 

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.510
right here as we got into the 1990s that
things started to go downward and

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:42.520
things started to go downward and
 

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.160
things started to go downward and
started to go downward at an alarming

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:44.170
started to go downward at an alarming
 

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:46.530
started to go downward at an alarming
rate and if you look at these two other

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:46.540
rate and if you look at these two other
 

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.170
rate and if you look at these two other
indices one which is called the

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:49.180
indices one which is called the
 

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.270
indices one which is called the
ecological footprint and the other which

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280
ecological footprint and the other which
 

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.520
ecological footprint and the other which
is called world biocapacity the

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:53.530
is called world biocapacity the
 

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:55.200
is called world biocapacity the
ecological footprint sort of tells you

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:55.210
ecological footprint sort of tells you
 

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:57.270
ecological footprint sort of tells you
how much it is we need to consume what

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280
how much it is we need to consume what
 

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.160
how much it is we need to consume what
are the resources that each individual

00:41:59.160 --> 00:41:59.170
are the resources that each individual
 

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:00.630
are the resources that each individual
would need in this case we're actually

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640
would need in this case we're actually
 

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.280
would need in this case we're actually
asking about the entire human population

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:02.290
asking about the entire human population
 

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:05.130
asking about the entire human population
and they're saying here that if you

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:05.140
and they're saying here that if you
 

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.660
and they're saying here that if you
consider that the world was able to

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:06.670
consider that the world was able to
 

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:08.580
consider that the world was able to
provide those needs and we standardized

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:08.590
provide those needs and we standardized
 

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:10.230
provide those needs and we standardized
that to one that somewhere in the

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240
that to one that somewhere in the

the real credit crunch and the credit
 

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:33.810
the real credit crunch and the credit

you love log normal distributions I

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:46.300
you love log normal distributions I
 

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.700

so the units here let's cut off a little

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:03.340
so the units here let's cut off a little
 

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:05.580
so the units here let's cut off a little
bit at the top there but it tells you

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:05.590
bit at the top there but it tells you
 

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:07.290
bit at the top there but it tells you
what the cut the bio capacity is

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:07.300
what the cut the bio capacity is
 

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.680
what the cut the bio capacity is
available per person and its measured in

very very well when you get down to the

00:43:26.559 --> 00:43:26.569
very very well when you get down to the
 

00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:28.690
very very well when you get down to the
United States we're still above this

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:28.700
United States we're still above this
 

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.849
United States we're still above this
this line here but you'll notice that

00:43:30.849 --> 00:43:30.859
this line here but you'll notice that
 

00:43:30.859 --> 00:43:33.789
this line here but you'll notice that
the line the the the bar is red and gets

00:43:33.789 --> 00:43:33.799
the line the the the bar is red and gets
 

00:43:33.799 --> 00:43:35.859
the line the the the bar is red and gets
increasingly red if the reason you're by

00:43:35.859 --> 00:43:35.869
increasingly red if the reason you're by
 

00:43:35.869 --> 00:43:37.539
increasingly red if the reason you're by
capacity is actually high is because

00:43:37.539 --> 00:43:37.549
capacity is actually high is because
 

00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:39.460
capacity is actually high is because
it's being subsidized so we're actually

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:39.470
it's being subsidized so we're actually
 

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:40.989
it's being subsidized so we're actually
importing food from a lot of other

00:43:40.989 --> 00:43:40.999
importing food from a lot of other
 

00:43:40.999 --> 00:43:43.359
importing food from a lot of other
countries so our bio capacity is

00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:43.369
countries so our bio capacity is
 

00:43:43.369 --> 00:43:45.579
countries so our bio capacity is
actually sort of inflated by the fact

00:43:45.579 --> 00:43:45.589
actually sort of inflated by the fact
 

00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:47.049
actually sort of inflated by the fact
that we import a lot of our resources

00:43:47.049 --> 00:43:47.059
that we import a lot of our resources
 

00:43:47.059 --> 00:43:48.460
that we import a lot of our resources
and if you look at the ecological

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:48.470
and if you look at the ecological
 

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:51.910
and if you look at the ecological
footprint you'll see that in contrast we

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920
footprint you'll see that in contrast we
 

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.620
footprint you'll see that in contrast we
are right up there with the United Arab

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:53.630
are right up there with the United Arab
 

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:56.049
are right up there with the United Arab
Emirates in terms of the number of

00:43:56.049 --> 00:43:56.059
Emirates in terms of the number of
 

00:43:56.059 --> 00:43:57.880
Emirates in terms of the number of
hectares it takes in the world to

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:57.890
hectares it takes in the world to
 

00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:00.190
hectares it takes in the world to
support a single individual there's that

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200
support a single individual there's that
 

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.019
support a single individual there's that
line where we would like not to cross

00:44:02.019 --> 00:44:02.029
line where we would like not to cross
 

00:44:02.029 --> 00:44:03.549
line where we would like not to cross
and you can see I don't know if that's

00:44:03.549 --> 00:44:03.559
and you can see I don't know if that's
 

00:44:03.559 --> 00:44:05.109
and you can see I don't know if that's
something I could you know go America go

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119
something I could you know go America go
 

00:44:05.119 --> 00:44:07.989
something I could you know go America go
once again we topped the world in

00:44:07.989 --> 00:44:07.999
once again we topped the world in
 

00:44:07.999 --> 00:44:09.940
once again we topped the world in
exceeding the bio capacity of our own

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:09.950
exceeding the bio capacity of our own
 

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:12.279
exceeding the bio capacity of our own
home country it's interesting to take a

00:44:12.279 --> 00:44:12.289
home country it's interesting to take a
 

00:44:12.289 --> 00:44:14.380
home country it's interesting to take a
look at these because if you contrast

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:14.390
look at these because if you contrast
 

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:16.509
look at these because if you contrast
that with the fact that we looked at a

00:44:16.509 --> 00:44:16.519
that with the fact that we looked at a
 

00:44:16.519 --> 00:44:18.579
that with the fact that we looked at a
log normal distribution for species and

00:44:18.579 --> 00:44:18.589
log normal distribution for species and
 

00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:20.289
log normal distribution for species and
most of our species are rare yet they're

00:44:20.289 --> 00:44:20.299
most of our species are rare yet they're
 

00:44:20.299 --> 00:44:22.029
most of our species are rare yet they're
very important to the way our ecosystems

00:44:22.029 --> 00:44:22.039
very important to the way our ecosystems
 

00:44:22.039 --> 00:44:23.859
very important to the way our ecosystems
work which is the studies I showed you

00:44:23.859 --> 00:44:23.869
work which is the studies I showed you
 

00:44:23.869 --> 00:44:25.930
work which is the studies I showed you
and you look at wealth distribution now

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:25.940
and you look at wealth distribution now
 

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:26.910
and you look at wealth distribution now
you look at these ecological

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:26.920
you look at these ecological
 

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.930
you look at these ecological
distributions in terms of footprint and

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:28.940
distributions in terms of footprint and
 

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:31.180
distributions in terms of footprint and
by capacity it gives you a picture of

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:31.190
by capacity it gives you a picture of
 

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:33.819
by capacity it gives you a picture of
the way our world looks today and this

00:44:33.819 --> 00:44:33.829
the way our world looks today and this
 

00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:35.739
the way our world looks today and this
this one here is broken down by sort of

00:44:35.739 --> 00:44:35.749
this one here is broken down by sort of
 

00:44:35.749 --> 00:44:37.960
this one here is broken down by sort of
large geographic regions which shows you

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:37.970
large geographic regions which shows you
 

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:39.700
large geographic regions which shows you
that there are still some regions of the

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:39.710
that there are still some regions of the
 

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:41.890
that there are still some regions of the
world where the bio capacity hasn't been

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:41.900
world where the bio capacity hasn't been
 

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.650
world where the bio capacity hasn't been
exceeded

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:43.660
exceeded
 

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:46.839

but there are other places where it has
 

00:44:46.849 --> 00:44:49.150
but there are other places where it has
and it's interesting to think about if

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:49.160
and it's interesting to think about if
 

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.099
and it's interesting to think about if
we are trying to pursue this new path of

00:44:51.099 --> 00:44:51.109
we are trying to pursue this new path of
 

00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:52.900
we are trying to pursue this new path of
sustainable development how we might

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:52.910
sustainable development how we might
 

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:55.059
sustainable development how we might
take into consideration by capacity and

00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:55.069
take into consideration by capacity and
 

00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:56.349
take into consideration by capacity and
ecological footprint into those

ecological footprint into those
 

00:44:56.359 --> 00:44:58.960
ecological footprint into those
deliberations and try to do that okay so

00:44:58.960 --> 00:44:58.970
deliberations and try to do that okay so
 

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:00.609

we get back to these little these these

00:45:00.609 --> 00:45:00.619
we get back to these little these these

me it seems that when we are going out
 

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.210
me it seems that when we are going out
and looking at bio capacity when we're

meeting here in December last year and
 

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.279
meeting here in December last year and
we were overwhelmed by what it is we

00:51:21.279 --> 00:51:21.289
we were overwhelmed by what it is we
 

00:51:21.289 --> 00:51:22.599

and you might imagine that if you look

00:51:26.319 --> 00:51:26.329
and you might imagine that if you look
 

00:51:26.329 --> 00:51:27.999
and you might imagine that if you look
closely down on it that there would be

00:51:27.999 --> 00:51:28.009
closely down on it that there would be
 

00:51:28.009 --> 00:51:29.890
closely down on it that there would be
an app as they are called that you would

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:29.900
an app as they are called that you would
 

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:32.410
an app as they are called that you would
download called biodiversity and that if

00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:32.420
download called biodiversity and that if
 

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:34.059
download called biodiversity and that if
you clicked on that app that it would

00:51:34.059 --> 00:51:34.069
you clicked on that app that it would
 

00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:36.009

actually you know locate where you are

00:51:36.009 --> 00:51:36.019
actually you know locate where you are
 

00:51:36.019 --> 00:51:38.740
actually you know locate where you are
with the GPS unit and then you could

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:38.750
with the GPS unit and then you could
 

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:40.960
with the GPS unit and then you could
actually if you didn't want it I think

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:40.970
actually if you didn't want it I think
 

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:42.009
actually if you didn't want it I think
wouldn't be too interesting looking at

00:51:42.009 --> 00:51:42.019
wouldn't be too interesting looking at
 

00:51:42.019 --> 00:51:43.660
wouldn't be too interesting looking at
biodiversity in Manhattan we do have a

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:43.670

00:51:45.049 --> 00:51:46.960
red-tailed hawk that lives outside of
our apartment but you know we might

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:46.970
our apartment but you know we might
 

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.670
our apartment but you know we might
scoot down and I'm only gonna do this

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:48.680
scoot down and I'm only gonna do this
 

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.559
scoot down and I'm only gonna do this
because I have a number of photos and I

00:51:50.559 --> 00:51:50.569
because I have a number of photos and I
 

00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:52.299
because I have a number of photos and I
know you can do this I have webcams that

see it now because the talk I look at

00:51:57.609 --> 00:51:57.619
see it now because the talk I look at
 

00:51:57.619 --> 00:51:59.650
see it now because the talk I look at
the birds at my bird feeder on my iPhone

00:51:59.650 --> 00:51:59.660

so I know you can do this if you just

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:01.640
so I know you can do this if you just
 

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.910
so I know you can do this if you just
get enough resources to make it happen

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:03.920
get enough resources to make it happen
 

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.410
get enough resources to make it happen
so here we are zooming in in the

00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:05.420
so here we are zooming in in the
 

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.970
so here we are zooming in in the
Dominican Republic because I was there

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:06.980
Dominican Republic because I was there
 

00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:08.829
Dominican Republic because I was there
and I have lots of photos of it and then

00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:08.839
and I have lots of photos of it and then
 

00:52:08.839 --> 00:52:11.170
and I have lots of photos of it and then
we can you know turn it into his natural

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:11.180
we can you know turn it into his natural
 

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:13.749
we can you know turn it into his natural
habitat and then after that we would be

00:52:13.749 --> 00:52:13.759
habitat and then after that we would be
 

00:52:13.759 --> 00:52:16.420
habitat and then after that we would be
able to say we want to look for the

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:16.430
able to say we want to look for the
 

00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:18.069
able to say we want to look for the
spiders because we've come across a

00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079
spiders because we've come across a
 

00:52:18.079 --> 00:52:19.809
spiders because we've come across a
spider were curious about the spider

00:52:19.809 --> 00:52:19.819
spider were curious about the spider
 

00:52:19.819 --> 00:52:21.249
spider were curious about the spider
diversity that's there I happen to have

00:52:21.249 --> 00:52:21.259
diversity that's there I happen to have
 

00:52:21.259 --> 00:52:22.930
diversity that's there I happen to have
lots of pictures but there are lots of

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:22.940
lots of pictures but there are lots of
 

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:24.579
lots of pictures but there are lots of
spiders in Dominican Republic otherwise

00:52:24.579 --> 00:52:24.589
spiders in Dominican Republic otherwise
 

00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:26.140
spiders in Dominican Republic otherwise
I would have done something else and

00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:26.150
I would have done something else and
 

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:27.789
I would have done something else and
then you would further click and then if

00:52:27.789 --> 00:52:27.799
then you would further click and then if
 

00:52:27.799 --> 00:52:29.230
then you would further click and then if
you really cared about it which I don't

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:29.240
you really cared about it which I don't
 

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.660
you really cared about it which I don't
you could get the systematics in great

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:31.670
you could get the systematics in great
 

00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:34.900
you could get the systematics in great
detail already but then I think you'd

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:34.910
detail already but then I think you'd
 

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:36.460
detail already but then I think you'd
really want to know more about you know

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:36.470
really want to know more about you know
 

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:38.230
really want to know more about you know
what's there trophic level what do they

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240
what's there trophic level what do they
 

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.849
what's there trophic level what do they
feed on how many species are what the

00:52:39.849 --> 00:52:39.859
feed on how many species are what the
 

00:52:39.859 --> 00:52:41.349
feed on how many species are what the
population what the biomass of the

00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359
population what the biomass of the
 

00:52:41.359 --> 00:52:42.490
population what the biomass of the
individual is so we could actually

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:42.500
individual is so we could actually
 

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:44.890
individual is so we could actually
figure out what those things in the tail

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:44.900
figure out what those things in the tail
 

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:46.809
figure out what those things in the tail
of the distribution are doing for the

00:52:46.809 --> 00:52:46.819
of the distribution are doing for the
 

00:52:46.819 --> 00:52:48.970
of the distribution are doing for the

this working

01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960
this working
 

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:59.370
this working
and we will try to find rings too

01:01:59.370 --> 01:01:59.380
 
 

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:27.860
 
especially modern

01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:27.870
 
 

01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:43.140
 
it's

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:43.150
 
 

01:02:43.150 --> 01:03:00.089
 
the question is about the role of

01:03:00.089 --> 01:03:00.099
 
 

01:03:00.099 --> 01:03:02.740
 
and we all know that if you leave meat

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:02.750
and we all know that if you leave meat
 

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:06.160
and we all know that if you leave meat
you're actually

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:06.170
 
 

01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:28.290
 
look

01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:28.300
 
 

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.270
 
so

01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:30.280
so
 

01:03:30.280 --> 01:05:01.910
so
is that

01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920
 
 

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:07.590
 
we're their size

01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:07.600
 
 

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.740
 
for that

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:10.750
for that
 

01:05:10.750 --> 01:06:21.890
for that
we've been talking about here

01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:21.900
 
 

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:30.980
 
for a while

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:30.990
 
 

01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:49.670
 
I

01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680
 
 

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.190
 
I mean here Columbia you you might be

01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200
I mean here Columbia you you might be
 

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.770
I mean here Columbia you you might be
able to correlate our focus on

01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:54.780
able to correlate our focus on
 

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:56.030
able to correlate our focus on
environmental science with certain

01:06:56.030 --> 01:06:56.040
environmental science with certain
 

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:59.569
environmental science with certain
biases to the left I don't know I think

01:06:59.569 --> 01:06:59.579
biases to the left I don't know I think
 

01:06:59.579 --> 01:07:02.329
biases to the left I don't know I think
that might be accurate and if you look

01:07:02.329 --> 01:07:02.339
that might be accurate and if you look
 

01:07:02.339 --> 01:07:04.640
that might be accurate and if you look
at the history of the US we as you

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:04.650
at the history of the US we as you
 

01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:07.670
