JANET RANKIN: One
active learning strategy

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.690
that I use in 595
are called mud cards.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.300
And they are a really
easy activity to use.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.900
Anyone can implement them,
and it's a really low barrier.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.940
So I like to introduce
that early in the class

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.580
so that students can see
that it doesn't necessarily

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.849
disrupt the class flow.

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.390
It doesn't really
take a lot of prep.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.848
It doesn't take a
lot of resources.

00:00:29.848 --> 00:00:34.960
So a mud card is, at
minimum, is an index card.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.230
And at the end of
every class, I ask

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.530
them to write down on the
index card what they might want

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.710
to know more about, what
they're still confused about,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.320
or something that they
found particularly

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.880
compelling or interesting.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.567
I ask them to specify that so
that I know if they just say,

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:53.650
active learning, I don't
know whether they thought

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.820
it was really interesting
or whether they

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.110
thought it was confusing.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.820
So I asked them to specify.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.300
But we use we use that because--

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.140
and then I also talk to them
about why it's so effective.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.490
They're able to anonymously
identify what they understood

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.530
or what they're
still confused about.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.970
I can go back to my
office afterwards,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.340
I can look through the cards.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.460
I can sort them out really
quickly, even in a large class,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.590
and I've used them in
a class of 100 people,

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.200
even though 595
is just around 15.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.440
And generally speaking, the
cards fall in three categories.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.140
You get three main problems.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.180
And so you know that
maybe you didn't

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.790
do a very good job of
helping students understand

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.910
a particular topic, or that
students are really interested

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.160
and want more information
about something.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.440
I know that really
easily, really quickly.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.820
So I can make a decision to
either get more resources,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.350
write something up that I can
post on our course website,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.970
or I can come to
class the next time

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.170
and say, hey, looks
like most of you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.450
were confused about X.
Let's talk a little bit more

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.950
about that.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.520
And I can prepare
ahead of time and be

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.430
totally ready to go in
with multiple explanations

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.080
or multiple examples
of whatever it

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.580
is people are confused about.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.102
I looked over some of the mud
cards we had from last time

00:02:09.102 --> 00:02:11.560
and there were some really good
questions, some really good

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.060
points.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.470
Someone asked if all those
learning theories that we

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.450
discussed were equally valid.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.570
They get they get
targeted feedback based

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.640
on what they don't understand.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.740
And it's really easy.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.530
It takes two minutes
at the end of class.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.692
I have a colleague who
calls them tickets to leave,

00:02:28.692 --> 00:02:31.150
meaning he doesn't let people
leave the class until they've

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.310
handed him an index card
with something on it.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.290
But they're very,
very effective.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.110
I believe they were first used
in the Aero-Astro department

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.730
here at MIT, but they're
used all over the place now

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.980
and they're extremely,
extremely effective.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.900
For instructors
that are thinking

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.720
about using mud cards
in their classes,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.050
I would say the biggest
issue or the biggest concern

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.220
would be to make sure that you
use them early in the semester

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.810
and that you use them often.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.940
If you use them one
day and then you

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.720
don't use them for another two
weeks or even another week,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.420
students really won't
get in the pattern

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.180
of filling them out and
filling them out thoughtfully.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.790
And they won't see the
utility, because you really

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.740
need to come back the next time
with useful information saying,

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.280
I looked at these cards.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.780
I understand you don't get this.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.920
Let me help you.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.460
And that act really
encourages students

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.860
to keep filling them
out, and it's just

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.340
a win-win for everyone.
