00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.400
 [Funny Music] 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.233
 Yugado: My name is Josh Yogado, 

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:11.100
 Founder and partner of SGN. 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.066
 SGN is the fastest growing mobile games development company 

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.900
 Widely in the West. 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.533
 The company has founded four of us, and then, 

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.100
 The number of employees increased to more than 200 employees. 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.166
 Our goal is to continue this growth. 

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:26.166
 Now, we have four games that achieve the highest revenue, 

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.933
 We want to continue to expand our portfolio 

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.533
 Games that earn the highest revenue. 

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:33.200
 All our products are launched via 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.066
 Multiple platforms simultaneously. 

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.000
 Getting it right can be very difficult. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.200
 If you want to achieve success in the industry, 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.566
 Make sure your design is repeated 

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.000
 Constantly improving it. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.900
 When your game is widely spread, this is very difficult 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.866
 Because there are tens of millions of players 

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.500
 Who enjoy your game every day. 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.866
 Casertano: My name is Matthew Casertano, 

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.933
 Senior Vice President of Gaming Operations at SGN. 

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:57.566
 The test has already helped us move from subjective standards 

00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.166
 To objective criteria. 

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:02.133
 Where the inability to conduct the test was done 

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.733
 Make multiple quality decisions. 

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.333
 Now, using our tools, 

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.766
 We can make quantitative decisions 

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.133
 The loop uses very short comments. 

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:13.500
 For Cookie Jam, we did a really interesting test of the icons 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.733
 Where we made a change on the background of the code. 

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.966
 This has resulted in an 8% increase in the conversion rate. 

00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:23.133
 We use a specialized agency in Preferences 

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:26.166
 Japanese consumers, we have reached the code design 

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.333
 Uses dense pink and yellow colors to achieve 

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.233
 12% better performance in the Japanese consumer market. 

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:35.066
 Another game we are testing is Panda Pop. 

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:38.400
 We had a code previously in the form of a small panda 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.300
 Which flies in the air surrounded by bubbles. 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.233
 Then our designers came up with a great idea, 

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:43.933
 As for the small panda, instead of flying, 

00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:45.766
 He was dancing happily among the bubbles. 

00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:47.166
 When we changed the code, 

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:50.433
 We saw a 25% increase in traffic from organic search results 

00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:54.300
 And a 4% increase in installation rate. 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.300
 We had a really interesting test of the symbols in Book of Life. 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.833
 Maria's character achieved a better performance of 10% 

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:03.033
 More than the code we used earlier, 

00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:05.233
 Which was characteristic of Xiu. 

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:06.566
 In addition, for Book of Life, 

00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:08.833
 We tested a different version of our description. 

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:12.366
 We discovered that the version was improved 

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:14.733
 Directly and concisely a little more has achieved a better performance of 4% 

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:17.133
 About the existing version that we used in our store. 

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:21.566
 The store's experiences helped SGN improve the return on investment equation 

00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:25.233
 By improving costs through high conversion rates 

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:28.233
 And improve the ratio of loan amount to market value through high retention rates. 

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:30.666
 With every test we have, we learn something new. 

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:34.366
 Each test provided us with achievable results 

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:36.133
 Which helped to improve our business. 

00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:38.566
 Yugado: My first advice is 

00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:40.533
 No matter how great you are, you must remain proficient in your business, 

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:44.066
 And be prepared for innovation and failure. 

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.066
 You should also love what works, 

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:49.633
 Therefore, we like to play simplified games. 

00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:52.166
 I think that is the essence of successful company formation 

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:55.366
 And game design that users want to play. 

00:02:55.366 --> 00:03:01.433
