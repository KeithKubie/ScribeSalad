00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.590
The second key concept is the event. Once again it's an abstraction, and

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:12.730
we'll say it's a single, instantaneous, noticeable occurrence. And

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.830
also, and also, think of it as some kind of stimulus because the system is going

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.800
to respond to it. Events in these kinds of systems can either be asynchronous or

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.660
synchronous. Asynchronous events you can think of as kind of randomly occurring,

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.880
they can come in bursts, they can be spread out.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.170
Synchronous events are more likely to come at periodic intervals,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.920
often the system has some sort of clock or event loop that controls.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.060
The current events when they can be dealt with in our

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.750
approach to modeling these systems the events can

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.819
serve as the reason or the stimulus for a change of state in the system.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.720
That, that change of state is sometimes called a state transition. For example,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.430
when you got your envelope through the mail that said you were admitted to

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.890
college, that's a significant state transition in your life. Events can

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.360
occur as the results of user actions like hitting a, hitting a button on the,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.460
on the graphical user interface. They can occur because of changes in the data,

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.670
in the, in the state space the temperature getting above 90 degrees.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.490
Or they can be queued by the passage of time.
