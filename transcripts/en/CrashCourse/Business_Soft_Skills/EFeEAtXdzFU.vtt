00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.719
Picture this: a businessperson.

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:09.719
What do you see?

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.640
A grey suit in an office job?

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.629
A former advertising agent who quit her job
to be a freelance YouTuber?

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.530
Maybe you picture someone who looks like you.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.530
Or maybe you don’t.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.660
But when it comes down to it -- everyone’s
a businessperson.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.859
Like, have you ever decided on a chore schedule
with roommates?

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.539
That’s a negotiation.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.620
Have you told someone about yourself on a
first date? I know it's uncomfortable.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.749
But, that’s an elevator pitch.

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.570
Have you organized a bar crawl and made sure
your friends all got home in one piece?

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.020
You’ve planned an event and held a management
position.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.811
So in this series, we’re going to help you
hone those day-to-day business skills, look

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:49.660
for a job, get along with your coworkers,
and really take your career to the next level.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.460
We’re not turning you into a ‘business
robot.’ I mean, do I look like a suite? No.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.960
We want you to succeed on your own terms and
identify what works best for you.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.270
As they say in the business world, we’re
here to help you “capitalize on your core

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.570
competency” -- or use what makes you special
to really strut your stuff!

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.530
And before anything else, we need to sit
down and have a chat about trust.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.800
I’m Evelyn from the Internets, and this
is Crash Course Business: Soft Skills.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:25.620
[Theme Music Plays]

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.520
Trust may seem like a basic idea, but it’s
actually a challenging and fundamental concept

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.840
like the bottom level of a business pyramid.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.840
Not a pyramid scheme.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.960
Trust forms the basis for your reputation,
which is the foundation of working relationships,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.569
promotions, and job offers.

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.649
Your decisions about whom to trust are affected
by how confident you are in someone, as well

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.909
as what you know about them and your experiences
with them.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:50.909
How have they acted?

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.829
What have they said?

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.480
What kinds of decisions have they made?

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.500
If you’re planning a road trip, who would
you trust to navigate and also make a fire

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.450
playlist: Your best friend who you’ve gone
to concerts with since high school, or her

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.630
roommate who blasts techno and wrecked his
car last Tuesday?

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.150
When you trust someone with your AUX cord,
your car, or your career dreams, you’re

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.170
being vulnerable.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.180
And when you start a new job, you’re trusting
that organization to treat you fairly as much

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.420
as they’re trusting you to do the work.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.170
Trust can also make or break professional
relationships.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.659
When a team is running smoothly, coworkers
rely on one another to get their jobs done.

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.320
But if you don’t trust someone, it can create
an imbalance of work, or you might feel like

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.829
you have to double-check everything they do.

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.240
And that can make for a rough work environment.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.830
Lack of trust can even close the door on opportunities.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.579
If people don’t see you as trustworthy,
they won’t want you on their team or suggest

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.799
you for that promotion.

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.610
So how do you decide who’s trustworthy,
and what can you do to make others trust you?

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.830
Now, I do not have all the answers.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.760
But I can tell you that there are a few
different kinds of trust, like cognitive,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.830
dispositional, and emotional.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.550
They all blend together to form a picture
of how trustworthy someone actually is.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.640
It’s like a trust and reputation smoothie,
y’all.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.450
Trusting or not trusting someone for rational
reasons is known as cognitive trust.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.569
And what do you look for when you’re analyzing
a person’s character?

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.629
It’s elementary, my dear Watson.

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:19.629
You need evidence!

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.069
That’s why it’s important for your hard
work to be seen by others.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.240
Your reputation can’t improve if people
don’t know what you’ve been up to.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.200
To build up cognitive trust, you can focus
on its three basic elements: competence, intent,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.580
and integrity.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.950
Let’s imagine you’re paying off those
soul-crushing student loans and take up a

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.090
side-hustle at a local coffee shop.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.140
[Too real?]

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.150
First up is competence -- are you capable
of doing the things that your employer needs?

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.500
Can you make an extra-hot, double foam, non-fat
caramel macchiato, with two pumps caramel

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.400
and one pump cinnamon dolce, in under 3 minutes
flat?

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.459
Or are you going to give up during the morning
rush and slap down a plain black coffee with

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:59.689
a misspelled name.

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.400
[It’s Evelyn with a V and a Y.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.250
Not Ellen or anything else.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.299
I’m salty.]

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.040
If you want to build your competence, think
about how to demonstrate what you can do,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.989
hone your skills, and acknowledge your shortcomings
so you can work on them.

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.880
Find new ways to showcase your work, or take
classes to build skills -- like a workshop

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.880
on latte art.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.570
And if you don’t have the time or money
to sign up for something official, you can

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.930
keep watching free educational content on
YouTube.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.150
Next up is intent -- are you looking out for
others’ interests, as well as your own?

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.870
Intent is sort of on a sliding scale.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.639
You’re generally not taking a job for incredibly
pure or nefarious reasons.

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.569
Maybe you mainly just want to be able to pay
rent.

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:41.840
And that’s okay!

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.199
If your interests align with someone else’s,
you can work together.

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:47.990
Although one of you may be less invested.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.870
So while you’re probably not going to be
begging your boss to explain how the coffee

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.780
beans are farmed, ground, and shipped, you
can still demonstrate intent.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.840
Show genuine concern for others, be tactful,
and help your coworkers.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.639
Chatting with them or doing favors like picking
up an extra shift can help build your reputation.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.970
Finally, there’s integrity -- can you talk
the talk and walk the walk?

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.060
Do you show up to your 5am shifts and open
the store, make sure the tables are set, and

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.980
write the daily special with a pun on the
chalkboard?

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.160
Or do you show up late and forget to spell-check
“frappuccino”?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.590
It's okay, it's hard.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.960
Remember that consistency matters.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.810
Doing an amazing job 90% of the time and falling
flat 10% of the time is sometimes worse than

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.790
doing an acceptable job all the time.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.419
Little mistakes can make a big impact on your
integrity, so follow through with what you

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:39.740
say you’re going to do.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.870
A helpful trick is under-promising and over-delivering.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.389
If you’ve ever started something last-minute,
you’ll know that it takes longer than

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.200
you expect to get things done.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.460
So manage your time wisely, and don’t deliver
half-baked work or miss your deadlines.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.730
It kills cognitive trust.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.729
These three parts of cognitive trust are like
the legs of a tripod.

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.400
If one’s missing, trust collapses and you’ve
got a mess on your hands.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.870
But just because you’ve done your best
to make sure your tripod can stand on its

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.130
own, doesn’t mean you’ll immediately earn
someone’s trust.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.919
Like we mentioned earlier, cognitive trust
is only one ingredient in this trust smoothie

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.360
-- although it’s a big one.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.190
There’s also dispositional trust: a person’s
baseline level of trust in others.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.699
Some people will trust you automatically,
while others take a bit more time and evidence.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.960
To see what I mean, let’s go to the Thought
Bubble!

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.580
Imagine you’ve just joined a fashion magazine
as a junior assistant to the editor-in-chief,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.830
and you don’t know if you’re meeting her
expectations.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.180
Your boss is hard to read, and she keeps giving
you menial work like picking up her dry cleaning.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.530
You want to help out with the fall fashion
show in Paris, but you’re not sure she trusts

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.530
you enough.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.900
So let’s go back to our tripod.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.539
You were hired with a gleaming resume and
great recommendations, and show up with her

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:00.000
coffee in hand every morning -- so you’re
obviously competent.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.370
You care about the magazine’s reputation
and applied because you love writing, so your

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.740
intent is good.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.220
And you’ve shown this intent by protecting
your boss from embarrassment at charity functions.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.349
Despite her doubts, you consistently achieve
her impossible last-minute demands, like a

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:18.070
signed first edition of The Deathly Hallows.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.240
And that shows some stellar integrity.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.240
So what gives?

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.110
Well, your boss may just have low dispositional
trust.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.669
Like we said, trust involves vulnerability,
which involves risk.

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:34.800
So dispositional trust is tied to an idea
called risk aversion -- or how much you avoid

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.800
risks.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.090
It’s not particularly bad to have high or
low risk aversion.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.979
But, like anything, there needs to be balance.

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:47.379
Having high risk aversion can protect you
from being exploited, but too much can stunt

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:48.500
your relationships.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.939
And having low risk aversion may open up more
opportunities, but if you’re too trusting

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:56.539
you could easily be taken advantage of.

00:07:56.539 --> 00:08:01.470
So, your boss might think that taking a chance
on a journalist fresh out of college is an

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:05.349
uncomfortably high risk, and have low dispositional
trust.

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:09.419
And you just have to try not to take it personally
and give it time.

00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:15.550
Be conscious of how others perceive your actions,
do your job well and consistently, and build

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.790
your reputation.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:20.400
You don’t need to overwork yourself -- work
smart, not just hard.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.830
And if you can go above and beyond by getting
ahead of deadlines, that’s great!

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.740
Before you know it, you’ll be helping with
the next big project.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.419
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:08:29.419 --> 00:08:31.690
Now, let’s say you’re great at your current
job.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:37.880
You’ve shown competence, intent, integrity
and jumped over dispositional trust hurdles

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.300
to build your reputation.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.289
That doesn’t mean you’ll be trusted in
every situation.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.540
Trust also depends on the circumstance.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:51.390
A competence mismatch is when someone may
trust your skills in one area, but not others.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:56.290
For example, you might trust an actor to deliver
high-quality entertainment.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:01.310
But no matter how well they played a loveable
but crotchety E.R. doctor, you wouldn’t

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.829
trust them with your knee surgery.

00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:07.550
An intent mismatch is if you might help someone
in one way, but not others.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.529
Like, you might ask the English major down
the hall who roots for a rival basketball

00:09:11.529 --> 00:09:13.810
team to read over your essay.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.420
But you’re not going to ask her to seed
your picks for March Madness.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:22.220
Building trust in all these ways can take
years of time and effort, so it’s important

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.320
to protect your reputation and act professionally
in all your jobs.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:32.200
Treat others with R-E-S-P-E-C-T, hold yourself
to high standards, and think about how your

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.950
actions will be perceived.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.460
But it’s okay to make mistakes.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:40.120
We’ve all shown up late to work some point,
or had to ask for an extension on a deadline.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.990
Like I’ve said before, no one is perfect.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:48.010
And if you have a solid track record of delivering
on promises, you’ll have earned a stock

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.089
of idiosyncrasy credits.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:53.350
Think of these credits as a sort of bank account,
but for trust.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.590
Improving your reputation adds credits, but
you’ve got to pay for your mistakes.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:02.930
Serious mistakes can quickly drain your account,
while smaller mistakes can be built back up

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.870
with patience, time, and careful attention
to spending.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.240
So, hopefully you have a positive balance
and some credits saved up for when you need

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.240
them.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.290
Because if you want to do anything in the
business world, you first need to understand

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:17.910
and build trust.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:23.050
If you remember nothing else from this episode,
here are some key takeaways:

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.510
Trust is the building block of all relationships.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:30.250
It’s tricky to navigate, and involves risk.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.399
Pay attention to how your actions are perceived
and make sure they’re being recognized.

00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:40.490
Building your reputation takes time and effort,
but it pays off.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:45.540
Cognitive trust can be earned from competence,
intent, and integrity, so use that to place

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.910
your trust in the right people and earn the
trust of others.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:54.060
But, like we said, cognitive and dispositional
trust are just part of the puzzle.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:59.639
Next time, we’ll talk about how emotions
can influence trust, and what else you can

00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:02.450
do to make sure you’re trusting people for
the right reasons.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:08.270
Crash Course Business is sponsored by Google and is filmed in Missoula,
MT and it’s made with the help of all these

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.760
nice people and Thought Cafe is our amazing
animation team.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.160
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.350
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us, you can check out some of our other

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:24.040
channels like SciShow, and delve into the
scientific subjects that defy our expectations

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.019
and make us even more curious!

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:30.740
Also, if you’d like to keep Crash Course
free for everybody, forever, you can support

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.870

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:36.870
