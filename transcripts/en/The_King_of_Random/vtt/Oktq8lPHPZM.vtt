00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.420
What was that

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.420
The YouTube invited us to a creator summit

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.220

So we are both going to be there

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.080

So I'm just sitting here ready to do some editing

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.800
We got an hour drive because I thing here the traffic is terrible

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.840

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.540
Right under the Brooklyn Bridge

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.200
It's going to take a while to get there but

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.900
It's this beautiful place right on the river so

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.900
