00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.620
- Good afternoon, everybody, and
welcome to Righting the Record

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.440
on behalf of the
Schlesinger Library

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.079
and the Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.140
I'm Jane Kamensky.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.370
I'm the four-timer foundation
director of the Schlesinger.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.400
And the event this afternoon
culminates a really wonderful

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.860
day of meetings
with the panelists

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.850
who have been extremely
generous with their time,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.210
sharing the day with staff
at the Schlesinger with lunch

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.580
with students from
across the university

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.160
and with many of our colleagues.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.500
My role here this afternoon
is to get off the stage so

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.690
that the dialogue can begin.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.810
I'm going to introduce
each of the panelists

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.070
much more briefly than their
important work deserves,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.090
beginning with our
moderator and then going

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.630
in alphabetical order,
which is the order they'll

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.240
be speaking in.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.330
But first, I want to say a
little bit about the impetus

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.750
behind this event, which my
library colleagues and I began

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.760
to organize about a year ago.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.990
As the nation's leading
special collections library,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.885
documenting the history of
women and gender in America,

00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:15.160
Schlesinger preserves
and make accessible

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.870
the papers of women ranging
from Amelia Earhart to Susan B.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.650
Anthony to Doctor Mildred
Jefferson to Harriet Beecher

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.740
Stowe, as well as the records
of institutions working

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.070
in just about every facet
of every wave of the woman's

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.180
movement and much else besides.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.190
We hold more than 3,500
manuscript collections,

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.960
stretching across approximately
16,000 linear feet, which

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.870
is more than enough
to fill three

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.060
vaults, the largest of
which is housed right

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.270
here below us in the
sub basement of what

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.940
used to be the
Radcliffe gymnasium,

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.790
towering more than 20 feet from
the bottom of the College's

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.050
former swimming pool.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.960
It's called the pool vault.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.480
As a woman's history archive,
Schlesinger is in the business,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.110
as the London tube announcements
have it, of minding the gap.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.530
The history of women has always
figured in archives and museums

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.500
but it hasn't always
been featured.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.340
My colleague Laurel
Aldridge recently

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.900
reminded me that not
very long ago you

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.470
could walk into a
major repository

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.000
and ask to look at collections
relevant to women and families

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.310
only to be told that
there simply weren't any.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.260
Even today, women and
ideas about women, gender,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.300
and sexuality remain
under-represented

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.780
in the documentary record.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.990
This is partly because, over
the long arc of history,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.640
women have saved men's
records much more often

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.660
than the reverse
has proved true.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.730
Within this landscape,
politically conservative women

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.190
and grassroots
conservative organizations

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.860
focused on the household
have been doubly hidden

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.400
by gender and by ideology.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.070
Family values conservatism
isn't by any means

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.460
undocumented but it
has been and remains

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.020
under-documented, relative both
to progressive social movements

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.350
and to conservative
movements led by men

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.010
and/or focused on geopolitics.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.970
This is not by design
on either the archival

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.070
or the activist side.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.540
I think our panelists
today are far from alone

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.730
in thinking about the legacy
of their movement work,

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.080
and Schlesinger,
likewise, has company

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.240
in thinking about these issues
among our peer institutions.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.720
The obstacles, I
think, have stemmed

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.370
from a combination of path
dependency and mistrust.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.750
And I hope we can begin to
remedy both of those today.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.330
The gathering could
not be more timely.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.610
The death last month
of Phyllis Schlafly,

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.820
in arguably one of the
most significant figures

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.530
of the second half
of the 20th century,

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.380
reminds us that even the longest
lived activists eventually

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.520
pass into history.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.720
We're at a generational
turning point

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.710
where records of
the heated family

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.070
values contests of the
post World War II era

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.200
will either make their
way into institutions

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.150
or suffer the fate of most of
the records of most of humanity

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.160
over most of history,
which is to be lost.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.540
We're also at a moment when the
necessity of cultivating trust

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.030
across the political spectrum
could not feel more urgent.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.120
Two weeks before the
presidential election,

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.600
it seems safe to say that the
United States is not suffering

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.620
from an epidemic of civility.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.150
Whether that's a laugh
line or not, you decide.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.410
There's a saying in the
world of special collections.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.620
Archives describe,
they don't prescribe.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.490
Schlesinger and many, though not
all of our peer institutions,

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.880
see it as our duty to safeguard
as complete and multi-sided

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.030
a record of the history
of American women

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.650
as we are able to assemble.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.450
It's our job to think
about the future as much

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.940
as the present and
the past, to imagine

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.150
how researchers a century from
now will understand our moment

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.980
and how we can help anticipate
that important work.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.670
Our panelists this afternoon are
uniquely well-qualified to open

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.960
a new chapter in this dialogue.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.480
Moderator Ross Douthat has been
a leading conservative voice

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.330
since before he
graduated from Harvard

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.580
College in the unseemly
recent year of 2002, magna cum

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.740
laude and Phi Beta Kappa
with a degree in History

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.100
and Literature, and
an honors thesis

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.210
on the imperial fictions of
adventure writer, H Rider

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.160
Haggard.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.540
In addition to his bi-weekly
columns in the New York Times,

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.440
Douthat is the
author or co-author

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.160
of three books,
including, most recently,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.720
the 2012 Bad Religion, How We
Became A Nation of Heretics.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.360
His columns often wrestle
with difficult issues

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.490
at the center of our
conversations today,

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.930
the politics of universities,
and the moral legacies

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.170
of the 1960s.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.960
After which, as he
puts it in privilege,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.000
his clear-eyed memoir of his
undergraduate years, we quote

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.040
"accepted the sexual
part of the revolution

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.560
and put the rest of it aside."

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.250
Donald Critchlow, professor
of History and director

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.460
of the Center for Political
Thought and Leadership

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.440
at Arizona State is the
author most recently

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.820
of Future Right, The Forging
of a New Republican Majority,

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.840
and is, in addition,
the author or editor

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.200
of more than 20 other books,
including When Hollywood

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.160
Was Right, The
Conservative Ascendency,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.110
and the important political
biography, Phyllis Schlafly

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.850
and Grassroots Conservatism.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.790
He has long been a very
public-facing scholar,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.930
appearing on C-Span,
NPR'S Talk of the Nation,

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.970
and BBC World News, as well as
in the pages of the Washington

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.570
Post, the New York Post, the
New York Observer, Market

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.960
Watch, and National Review.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.180
Jennifer Marshall serves as
Vice President of the Heritage

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.220
Foundation where
she runs the think

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.810
tanks Institute for Family,
Community, and Opportunity.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.100
In that capacity,
she oversees research

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.480
into a variety of
issues, ranging

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.160
from marriage, family life, and
religious liberty to health,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.480
education, and welfare.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.890
Marshall collaborates with
her Heritage colleagues

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.280
to explore how moral
values and civil society

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.500
relate to issues of political
economy and foreign policy.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.410
She also edits
Heritage's annual Index

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.660
of Culture and
Opportunity, which

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.150
tracks indicators of opportunity
in the United States,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.210
ranging from marriage,
fertility, and abortion rates

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.300
to labor force participation,
subsidized housing

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.460
levels, and student loan debt.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.970
An accomplished
scholar and teacher,

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.190

and a bachelor's
degree in French

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.900
from Wheaton College in Wheaton
Illinois, where she also earned

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.000
a teaching certification.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.200
She is currently, in
her copious spare time,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.480
pursuing a PhD in Religion and
Culture at Catholic University.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.600
Michelle Nickerson is
associate professor

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.474
of History at Loyola
in Chicago where

00:08:34.474 --> 00:08:38.409
she teaches the
history of women of US

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.860
politics, social movements,
and cities and suburbs.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.870
She developed her
interest in the history

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.050
of American social and
political movements

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.020
as an undergraduate at Rutgers.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.680
And then, despite my efforts to
recruit her to Brandeis, where

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.890
I then taught, pursued her
graduate studies inexplicably

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.000
at Yale.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.330
She is the author of Mothers
of Conservatism, Women

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.180

She's currently studying the
Camden 28, a Catholic anti-war

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.380
group so named for their arrest
following a raid on the Camden,

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.330
New Jersey draft board in 1971.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.260
Finally, Charmaine Yoest,
longtime President and CEO

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.270
of Americans United for
Life is now senior fellow

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.480
at American Values.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.850
She is a second generation
grassroots conservative,

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.810
the daughter of
scholar and writer

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.080

and has served in many
facets of political life,

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.360
including the Reagan White
House and Mike Huckabee's 2008

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.880
presidential campaign,
before heading up

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.160
a national nonprofit.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.820
She has appeared as
spokesperson or commentator

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.090
on every major television
network and cable outlet

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.380
and, in print, in leading
national publications.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.880
She has been profiled
by the New York Times

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.800
Magazine, the Christian Science
Monitor, the New Republic,

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.690
and Mother Jones, among others.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.220
Yoest holds a PhD
from the Department

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.940
of Politics at the
University of Virginia,

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.400
where her dissertation was
Empowering Shakespeare's

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.240
Sister, The Politics
of Parental Leave.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.370
She is the co-author of Mother
in the Middle, Searching

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.240
for Peace in the Mommy
Wars, and is currently

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.770
working on a new book
related to modern feminism.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.250
I've asked the panelists to
keep their prepared remarks

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.320
short, about 10 minutes, to
allow for plenty of discussion

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.780
among this accomplished
group of thinkers

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.520
and with you, our audience.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.440
I hope that the
historians will tell us

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.670
something about their
research strategies

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.450
for uncovering the important
history of conservative women.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.750
And I've asked them to
think, among other things,

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.780
about records they wish
they had had access to

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.240
and how we might change
those paths in the future.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.990
I've asked the movement
leaders to think

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.120
about what we might call the
other side of the coin, what

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.850
you wish researchers
and future generations

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.180
knew about your
work and how you're

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.040
tending your own records
so that your story will

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.020
be discoverable.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.710
Together, I hope we can
both discuss and exemplify

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.610
the work of building
trust with stakeholders

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.900
and with political opponents.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.960
Let this afternoon's work
be a paradigm instance

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.500
of taking each other's
other side seriously

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.680
in hopes of a more civil present
and a better documented future.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.180
Thank you.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:52.700
- All right.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.590
So I guess I'm in
charge here now.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.120
Thank you all so
much for coming.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.140
Thanks for that
wonderful introduction

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.310
and for all the labors
that went into putting

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.420
this panel together.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.560
It's wonderful to
be back at Harvard.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.310
I do a fair amount
of public speaking

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:11.290
and it has been a very long time
since anyone referenced Rider

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.460
Haggard or my senior
thesis in the introduction

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.970
or the history of literature.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.680
I shouldn't say department,
but the Harvard technicalities

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.430
escaped me.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:31.620
Anyway, I am here, essentially,
as a mediator and observer

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.270
who hopes, like you,
to learn something

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.460
interesting from these
distinguished academics,

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.670
these accomplished activists.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:43.790
I'm also here as someone who
has some experience with some

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.790
of the interesting gaps
that separate liberalism

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.960
from conservatism
in American life

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.560
and what you might call
elite liberal culture

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.790
from populist
conservative culture.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:01.320
I was not particularly
influential as a Harvard

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.330
conservative
columnist, but I was

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.160
the token conservative columnist
for the Harvard Crimson,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.760
a newspaper then and now that
may have a slight liberal bias

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.570
in its editorial stances.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.970
And I have graduated from there
to my current bad eminence

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.220
as the token conservative
columnist for another newspaper

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.570
that might have a
slight liberal tilt,

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:25.590
occasionally, in some of
its editorial positions.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:27.750
And in both of
those roles, perhaps

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.550
my role for the New York
Times slightly more so,

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:35.850
I do find myself often acting
as a cultural go-between

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:39.620
for the group's
constituencies and positions

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:44.650
that I tend to agree with and
end up defending and the, I

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.400
would say, this slight majority,
perhaps, of the audience that

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.270
actually reads my
column every week.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.400
So I spend a certain amount of
time explaining conservatism

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.560
to liberals, a certain amount
of time trying to explain

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.870
liberalism to conservatives.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.630
And, of course, in the last
couple years everything

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:08.300
has gotten topsy-turvy because I
assumed that I would inevitably

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.760
spend my time, a New York Times
columnist, vehemently defending

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.930
Republican nominees and the Pope
of the Roman Catholic Church

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.020
to New York Times readers who
would loathe and despise them

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.210
both.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.340
But, instead, I've
ended up as a critic

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.050
of the Republican nominee
and of Pope Francis

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.880
himself, which is a
very strange place

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.580
for a Catholic
conservative to end up.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.620
So it's been a long year,
a long year for all of us,

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.340
I think, in American
politics, the world at large.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.730
But we're here now.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:40.610
And I think that
conversations like this

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.530
are immensely important.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:46.740
And projects, broader
projects of the kind

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.530
that the Schlesinger
Library is pursuing

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.460
are immensely important.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:55.020
Because the work of mediation
that I do, not particularly

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.790
effectively in my
professional life,

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:02.070
I think does try and fill a very
real and important gap that,

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:05.470
independent of issues of
partisan polarization,

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.920
intellectually weakens our
culture and our politics.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:15.030
I think that we have a
level of the bastions

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:19.110
of our high culture for not
out of any sort of malign

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:25.810
conspiracies but for reasons of
self-segregation and inevitable

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:29.480
ignorance of cultures that
lived beyond their gates

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.690
sometimes have more
limited knowledge

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.670
than they should of
political conservatism

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.910
and, I would say, of
particular relevance

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.740
for this conversation,
religious conservatism.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:47.740
I think that there is a gap
in the mind of the American

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.050
and Western Academy
where religion,

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.420
in general, and
especially conservative

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.670
religious values,
conservative religious ideas,

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.730
and the history of grassroots
political conservatism

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.080
is concerned.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.780
So there's that gap.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.170
But then there's also a gap in
the conservative mind, which

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:11.470
reflects, again, not a
deliberate refusal of knowledge

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.070
and intellectual life but
an understandable sense

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.810
that if the Academy is
a bastion of liberalism,

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.850
then the work that is
done in the Academy

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.040
must be inevitably
tainted by liberal bias.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.630
And, therefore, all of it can
be set aside and all of it

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.590
can be dismissed with
a wave of the hand.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.900
And, again, we won't make this
a conversation about Donald

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.360
Trump, but perhaps in the
story of Donald Trump's rise

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.750
you can see some of the limits
of a populist conservatism that

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.810
takes it's
understandable skepticism

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:43.380
of the liberal Academy and turns
it into anti-intellectual writ

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.020
large.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.940
I think those gaps in
the conservative mind,

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.180
the conservative populist
mind, the liberal academic mind

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:57.890
are hopefully a useful
backdrop for us to keep in mind

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:01.950
as we listen in on a
conversation between academics

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:05.859
and activists about
the specific work

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.119
that they do, the projects
that they're engaged in,

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:11.240
and the ways that they, in their
own professional lives, try

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.359
and bridge those gaps, and
the way that they think,

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:19.780
as Jane suggested, about
their legacies and the ways

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:24.079
in which the strange realities
of being an academic,

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.220
studying movements
that regard the Academy

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.020
with particular suspicion,

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.550
the strange reality
of being an activist

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.600
thinking about your
own legacy and knowing

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.000
that it will be scrutinized
in institutions that

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.280
have a reputation for being
hostile to the causes to which

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.840
you've devoted your lives.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.370
And then, finally, I think
the particular issue,

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.750
particular to Radcliffe,
Jane brought up, of sex

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.810
and gender is also
just a fascinating one

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:58.710
because it isn't just that
there is this broad-based gap

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.780
and gulf of understanding
between populist conservatism,

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.020
religious conservatism,
and the Academy.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.170
There's a particular gap,
particular in comprehension

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:14.030
I would say, between,
in certain ways,

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:18.830
the academic, feminist mind
and the female, religious,

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:19.840
conservative mind.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.090
And I say that
meaning no disrespect

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.500
to either of those minds,
which I have engaged

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.150
with from the outside as a
member of the opposite sex

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.160
for much of my life.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.280
I was born and raised
by a mother who

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.110
is in the first class
of women at Yale

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:39.220
and cast the first presidential
ballot of my young life

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.630
for Walter Mondale
and Geraldine Ferraro.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.560
And she was very insistent
that she was mostly

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.910
voting for Geraldine Ferraro.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:49.310
So, going back a
long way in my life,

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:56.470
I've had exposure to
the two complexities

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.400
of the female experience
and the complexities

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.700
of feminist thought
as it interacts

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.900
with religious experience
and with the politics

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.480
of conservatism and family
in the United States.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.747
And we had a lot of arguments
as a family, and most of those

00:19:12.747 --> 00:19:14.330
were arguments
sometimes my mother was

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:19.280
having with herself but around
the dinner table as I grew up.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.430
So that, I think, is the final.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:26.900
That specific issue is a
fascinating fraught and vexed

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.970
one, and one that, I think,
is amenable to much more

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.410
interesting academic and
intellectual discussion

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.680
than maybe it's
experienced to date.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.670
So, with that slightly
rambling introduction,

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.187
I see I'm two minutes ahead.

00:19:41.187 --> 00:19:43.020
And I'm going to turn
those two minutes over

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.170
to the panelist in the hopes
that they use them wisely.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.200
But I intend to be a
ruthless moderator.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.740
They have a clock that they
can watch that will tell them

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.480
when their time is up.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.900
Each of them will speak.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.322
And when they're
done speaking, I

00:19:55.322 --> 00:19:56.780
will try and guide
what I hope will

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.500
be an absolutely fascinating
discussion for about

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.180
20 minutes.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.860
And then we will open
the floor for questions,

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.460
friendly, hostile, or
somewhere in between.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.670
So thank you all very
much for your attention.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.980
And I turn it over to
Professor Critchlow.

00:20:18.952 --> 00:20:20.410
- We're supposed
to sit, aren't we?

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.340
- I mean, already I'm
the bad moderator.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.320
But, yes.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.070
I think we're in a
casual, informal way.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:30.680
I'll be shirtless by
the end of the talk.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.430
- Well, we don't want
that, I don't think.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.600
- Probably not.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:40.340
- I want to thank Jane Kamensky
and the staff of the archives

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:44.520
for a really splendid,
well-organized event.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.520
So we've been treated very well.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.150
And I want to thank Jane
Kamensky for mentioning

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:56.650
my book, Future Right, Forging
of a New Republican Majority.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.420
I think it could be found in
the science fiction section

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.300
of Barnes Noble's.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.560
That book got trumped, I think.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:11.620
But, anyway, I want
to say a few words

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:16.560
as the political biographer
of Phyllis Schlafly

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.010
and use that as a
segue into talking

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:22.190
about the difficulties
of writing

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:26.580
a biography of a controversial,
political figure,

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:32.300
but also using those
as an opportunity

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.110
to see about
expanding collections

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.930
of conservative women.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.580
A long-time political
activist, Phyllis Schlafly

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:49.910
who died, as was
mentioned, in September,

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:54.250
she's best known for
her work on her activism

00:21:54.250 --> 00:22:00.410
in defeating the Equal Rights
Amendment in the 1970s, which

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:04.390
was a major defeat for
second wave feminism,

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:07.810
or at least perceived
so at that time.

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:13.450
Phyllis Schlafly's activities
in the defeating of the ERA,

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:17.450
I think, are of some
historical importance,

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:21.260
especially at the
time and today.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:26.330
How it's going to be its actual
importance historically and 100

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:32.180
years from now, I think,
will have to be determined.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:38.250
Her activities, though, extended
well beyond anti-feminism.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.900
She was active in the
anti-communist movement

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:47.680
prior to this in debates
over nuclear strategy

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:53.270
before she became
involved in the ERA fight,

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:58.320
and then helped organized
the pro-family movement

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.870
and grassroots activism.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:06.260
I think in order to place
Phyllis Schlafly into a broader

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.730
context, we need to
understand her abilities

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:15.670
as a political organizer
and personality that

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:22.840
went into that as well
as herself personally,

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.430
as a person that is.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:31.390
The one thing that I think was
important about, to begin with,

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:36.480
I think one of the most notable
characteristics of Phyllis

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:41.900
Schlafly is that she was a
ferocious debater, anyone

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.020
who knew her.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:50.820
And she was exceptionally
thick-skinned,

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:55.920
with a very strong ego,
very strong ambition.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:01.520
She wasn't an especially
reflective personality,

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.030
thinker.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:09.080
She prided herself on
her political abilities.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:16.460
She saw herself as the
Thomas Payne of the Right.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.740
She was quite
adept at balancing,

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:26.880
I think, throughout her career,
the Republican establishment

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:33.230
and party leaders, as well
as the Grassroots Right,

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:39.252
which was often at odds with
the Republican establishment.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.920
Ideologically, and
I don't think she

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.360
had a systematic ideology,
what was important

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:53.360
for her was her
Catholicism, but also

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.700
the model that her parents,
and particularly her mother who

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:04.830
was college educated, presented
to Phyllis and her sister.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:08.080
They instilled upon their
two young daughters,

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:13.450
in the depression, that
they should achieve success.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:22.580
And Phyllis Schlafly
rejected a scholarship

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.830
to go to a local
Catholic school in order

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:31.640
to go Washington University,
the harbor of St. Louis.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.790
And then she went
to Radcliffe where

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:36.200
she studied political science.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:42.300
When she left Radcliffe,
she was a Republican.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.030
But she was also an
internationalist.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:48.300
She was a strong supporter
of the United Nations.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:54.180
She returned to St. Louis after
failing to get a government

00:25:54.180 --> 00:26:00.240
job, turning down an offer by
faculty in political science

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.950
to get her into law school.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:08.460
And there, returning
to St. Louis,

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:12.530
she became politically active,
running a political campaign,

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:18.290
a successful one, in '24, that's
when St. Louis had Republicans

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.370
in the proper city.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:28.740
And then she pursued a
successful career in banking.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.900
When she married her
husband, Fred Schlafly,

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.430
who came from a regionally
prominent family,

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:38.720
her politics changed.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.410
Fred Schlafly was
older than she was

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:49.340
and he came out of the
isolationist right.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:54.440
And she imbibed,
there, his politics,

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:59.400
and she basically became part
of the old Right, very strong,

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.580
non-interventionist
points of view.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:06.750
In fact, she told me, when I
was working on her biography,

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:11.420
that after the Second World
War and the Korean War,

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:17.640
she'd never supported another
American military intervention.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:24.580
And that included Vietnam
and recent excursions

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:31.030
into the Middle East under
both Bush presidencies.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:41.130
She became involved in
Republican politics as well as

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:44.440
grassroots activism.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:50.060
So she was kind of
balancing between the two,

00:27:50.060 --> 00:28:00.230
this kind adeptness
in getting both sides

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.900
to work with one another.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:06.650
Many grassroots anti-communists
were very suspicious

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:10.730
of the Eisenhower
administration, for example,

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.960
and, later, Richard Nixon.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.980
She told me later, after
I completed the biography

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:27.530
and it was published, that,
initially, the Stop ERA

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:31.550
Campaign did not
focus on abortion

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:36.920
because many of the
conservative women, especially

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.650
Republican women, actually
supported abortion.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:44.690
This was a strong,
long-standing tradition

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:50.180
in our sentiment within
the Republican Party

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:53.440
up until the mid 70s.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:29:00.720
They believed in reducing
global population as well

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.920
as population in
the United States

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:10.360
for reasons of trying to
address social problems.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.540
She gained fame on
the national stage,

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:17.910
obviously, with the book
on A Choice Not An Echo.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:26.190
And that made her
into a public persona,

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:32.460
which was later carried into
the campaigning of the ERA.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.330
She was--

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:39.080
So I think to understand
Phyllis Schlafly is

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:46.400
to understand a public persona
as well as a private persona.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:51.010
And, privately, Phyllis
Schlafly-- and I

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.800
know this might be very
hard to believe-- had,

00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:05.930
exceptionally, a good sense
of humor, was a foodie.

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:12.690
Her daughter, in fact, runs
a major cooking conservatory

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.940
in St. Louis.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:21.420
She was also a health nut in
the 1950s, eating organic food.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:30.110
So there was this private
side to Phyllis Schlafly.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.370
And in that private
side she was totally

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:35.930
devoted to her children.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:41.440
She held a view that
really, I think,

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.850
has been misunderstood by
many historians and scholars

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:51.090
writing about Phyllis
Schlafly and her followers.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.770
But Phyllis Schlafly
didn't believe

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:55.390
that women shouldn't work.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:58.260
After all, her mother
worked in the depression.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:04.590
She worked her way through
university and afterwards.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:10.190
What she did believe is
that when married women have

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:14.550
children, their primary devotion
should be to their children

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:16.160
and not their career.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:23.940
And I think that's
important to understand

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.510
about Phyllis Schlafly.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.870
So just a couple points
and we can pick this up

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:32.560
in discussion a bit.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.320
I had serious differences
with Phyllis Schlafly

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:43.010
politically, although she
knew I was a rare conservative

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:46.150
in academia.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:52.930
So why did she agree to have
me write a political biography

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:55.350
and allow me to
have complete access

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:59.240
to her extensive
archival collections

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:04.270
as well as the personal
financial papers of records

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.340
of Stop ERA?

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.730
And there were two
reasons, I think.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.800
First of all,-- and I think
this is important for getting

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.160
collections Jane--
there was ego involved.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:25.170
She wanted her legacy to be
known by future generations.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:30.940
And I think that's important for
trying to attract collections

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.710
that you're going to be
able to convince people

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:40.580
that they'll have a legacy
beyond their own activist

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.890
lifetimes.

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:45.240
The other thing,
I think, that was

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:51.140
important in allowing me to get
such as access to her papers

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:56.340
was that we established a
personal rapport, even though I

00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:00.210
was in St. Louis at that time.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:06.150
I hadn't met Phyllis Schlafly
prior to one meeting,

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:10.120
and she had given me a biography
written by a journalist.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:14.760
And then I suggested to
her full-scale biography,

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.120
a political biography
by [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.740
I had become interested in
after writing on federal family

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:27.750
planning on the submergence
of the anti-abortion movement

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.343
in the grassroots conservatism.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:35.110
So she understood
that I was a scholar.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.060
She understood that
I was going to use

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:42.700
about 40 other archival
collections across the country

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:47.460
to check on her views
in correspondence

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:53.160
with politicians and
grassroots activists.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.910
She didn't oversee the
writing of the book.

00:33:55.910 --> 00:34:01.620
We agreed early that she
wouldn't final consent on it.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.030
But she did understand
that it wasn't

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.940
going to be a
hatchet job on her,

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:14.025
painting her out to
be right-wing nut.

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:20.650
Just two other
points, very quickly,

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:27.139
is that what I found in talking
with Phyllis Schlafly, when

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:32.060
I tried to conduct formal
interviews with her,

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.679
she put on her public persona.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:39.750
Very, very guarded,
basically gave me

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:43.090
what you would expect in how
she want to be portrayed.

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:45.420
What I did find in
working in the archives,

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:51.409
however, if I could catch her
between walking the halls,

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:54.699
I could ask her a question
about what I had just seen.

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:59.210
And she was much more relaxed
and would tell me things.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:02.120
In fact, I realized--
and I'm not

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:09.000
postmodernist-- there's a
real problem for historians

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.350
working in archives.

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:13.400
And this was
contemporary history.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.490
I think it's even more
difficult in the 18th,

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:20.640
19th, or ancient history.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:27.580
But you base your
work on untaxed,

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:31.820
either archival documents
or written texts that have

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:34.850
survived from ancient times.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:37.720
And so if you get a
series of letters,

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.730
for instance, talking
about an issue,

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:48.300
you might think it's even more
important than it actually was.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:54.560
And I'll tell you a story about
that, of mastering discussion.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.500
I think the other problem,
she was exceptionally

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:07.240
well-organized, had extensive
archives of about 50

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.760
metal cabinets
full of documents.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:15.610
I convinced her that they should
be archived and be preserved.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:18.660
But after I was
able to use them,

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.550
she subsequently closed them.

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:27.000
She was concerned
that researchers

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.630
would come in and
find things that

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:35.470
could be used against her in
her own political activism.

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:40.080
The archives are still closed,
at least they were preserved.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:50.460
And I think her supportive
endorsement of Donald Trump

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:56.630
has caused a family
dispute within the family.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:01.250
And so there's legal action
going on, I think, right now.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:03.910
What's going to
happen to the archives

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:08.810
will be seen for the future.

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:12.740
So I think I'm a minute
and a half early.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.760
So I think I'm
right on pace here.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.820
No reason to take off
your shirt yet, Ross.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.760
- Thank you.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.680
- Well, very fascinating
to hear about a great lady

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:25.910
and her work.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.960
I want to thank you, Jane,
for planning this day.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:32.100
It's been remarkable,
really, and thoroughly

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.070
enjoyable to be
hosted well and to be

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.880
in the midst of
conversations that I

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.970
think represent the best of the
academic and civil discourse

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:42.070
traditions.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.710
And, as already been
mentioned today,

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:48.330
those seem to be in
short supply in our world

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:49.680
today in our country today.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.760
So it is a true joy to be here.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.260
And thank you all who
are part of putting

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.260
on this important conversation.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:58.280
I want to thank
you, in particular,

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.200
for putting together
this program, which

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.630
provides, as Paul
Harvey would have said,

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:04.350
the rest of the story.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:05.790
We've been asked
to talk about how

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.760
the diversity of the
documentary record

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.780
could be increased so
that researchers would

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.640
be able to compile more
complete and balanced

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.700
histories of our times.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:21.880
My answer to that is to take
conservatism on its own terms.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.040
Investigate and present its
stated principles, rationale,

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.260
and aims.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:31.580
Discern its internal
coherence rather than imposing

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.850
extrinsic theories on it.

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:37.700
Identify authentic
representatives and emblematic

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.940
expressions of it.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.660
As the best teachers
remind us, we

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.760
should be able to
understand and articulate,

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:50.140
fairly, an opponent's case in
order to effectively engage it.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.810
As the best
archivists explain, we

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:55.780
should understand both
sides of a social debate

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.770
to do justice to its history.

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:01.400
Indeed, public discourse
and civic harmony

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.500
depend on such open mindedness.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.094
In the case of
the social history

00:39:06.094 --> 00:39:07.510
we're discussing
here today, there

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:09.280
are some particular
obstacles that

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.980
get in the way of taking
conservatism on its own terms.

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.590
And in this light,
I was intrigued

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:16.970
by some concluding
remarks in my co-panelist,

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:21.200
Dr. Michele Nickerson's book,
Mothers of Conservatism.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:25.340
She suggests that feminism's
dominance in recent women's

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:28.720
history may present an
interpretive obstacle

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:32.150
to understanding competing
movements and worldviews.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:35.790
Quoting from Michelle,
"Has it, feminism,

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:38.000
become a central
logic for determining

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.370
the value of female
political identity

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:44.210
well beyond the scope of
its own historical influence

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:47.510
in ways that possibly distort
our understanding of women's

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:50.330
history by simplifying
representations

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:52.260
of human actions?"

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.670
She goes on to note,
"Feminism assumes itself

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:58.810
to be freer of outside
determinants than anti-feminism

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:02.860
to clearly see the world
through women's eyes."

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:06.220
Well, theories that assumes
sex is the explanatory factor

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:10.310
in worldview ideology and
political expression cannot

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:13.690
make entire sense of the
diversity that we see around us

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:15.250
in the world today.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.420
We need investigative
methods that

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:20.440
acknowledge ideological
and political differences

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:24.670
among women and among any
other group for that matter.

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.910
So I agree with
Dr. Nickerson when

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:29.190
she concludes that we
need to investigate

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:33.850
how subjects came to see the
world as they actually saw it.

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:37.290
And that is, I think, what our
hosts here today are proposing

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:39.600
with regard to
preserving the records

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.296
of conservative individuals
and institutions.

00:40:43.296 --> 00:40:47.500
So what should
investigating and collecting

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.850
look for when it comes to the
conservative movement for life,

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:54.500
marriage, and religious
liberty, in particular?

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.580
Let me mention three things.

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.960
The first is to take seriously
the conservative account

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.030
of the principles and
rationale for our perspectives

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:04.540
on these issues.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:09.510
To begin with, this means taking
conservatism on its own terms,

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:13.130
literally in its
self-description

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:16.140
rather than applying
pre-determined labels.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.590
It also requires attention
to its basic concepts,

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:24.096
such as its understanding
of rights, for example.

00:41:24.096 --> 00:41:25.720
On the conservative
account, government

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.500
is not the source
of rights but merely

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.780
the guardian of
inherent natural rights

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.710
to which each and
every human being

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:35.680
is entitled by their
very existence.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.000
Endowed by their creator is how
the Declaration of Independence

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.120
and how the framers
of the Declaration

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.220
understood the origin
of these rights.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.340
These are terms
understood by reason.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:50.220
And, indeed, reason is a common
currency to which conservatives

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.360
appeal as we seek to make
our principles and our goals

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.030
accessible and evident to all.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:58.410
Any investigation
or collecting should

00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:02.860
look for such a reasoned case in
the midst of any public debate.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.990
In addition, religious
conservatives' perspectives

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:09.690
are often deeply shaped by a
biblical account of the nature

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:14.380
and purpose of human beings and
human flourishing and the way

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.310
that God has made us
to exist in community

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:19.620
as a part of that flourishing.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.260
As a result,
investigating conservatism

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:26.880
means taking religion
seriously, not as a construct

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.770
to wield social power but
as a reasonable response

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:35.160
to the questions of meaning,
purpose, and ultimate ends that

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.510
face all human beings.

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:41.500
Second, take seriously the
conservative explanation

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.200
of our aims.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.170
Conservatives stand for life,
marriage, and religious liberty

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:49.250
because of our interest in
the natural rights, freedom,

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.880
and good of all.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.130
This is not an argument of a
self-serving interest group

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:57.804
but a coherent account
of the common good.

00:42:57.804 --> 00:42:59.220
The right to life,
for example, is

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:02.820
grounded in the same principle
as the equality of women

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.900
and men.

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.720
The original purpose
of marriage policy

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.710
was to preserve,
as far as possible

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:09.630
in law, the right
of a child to be

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:13.100
raised by the mother and father
who brought her into the world.

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:14.800
The protection of
religious liberty

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.160
is essential to guarding
fundamental freedoms

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:22.370
of conscience, speech,
and association for all.

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:26.910
Third, discern authentic
representatives.

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:31.020
Any investigation must identify
accurate representatives

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.670
of a movement to study.

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:35.780
This requires an understanding
of the principles,

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:39.200
rationales, and aims, which I've
been describing, and others,

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:45.100
in order to discern who are the
exemplary proponents of them.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.540
This is not to suggest that
a movement can be reduced

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.490
to a single figure,
or should be,

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:51.930
but it does mean
being able to discern

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:54.280
between central and
peripheral or fringe

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.410
aspects of a movement.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:59.810
So I wanted to point
to a couple of examples

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:02.601
that I thought did a good
job of some of the things

00:44:02.601 --> 00:44:03.600
I've been talking about.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.170
One happened just recently in a
Slate article, The New Culture

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:09.660
of Life that ran on
the 11th of this month

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.749
by an author named Ruth Graham.

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:14.040
She's talking about the future
of the pro-life movement

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:18.610
growing support for life among
the millennial generation.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.800
And the article
described a diversity

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.620
of different strands of
efforts in the movement,

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.970
but they were all around
this central theme.

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:31.570
And I thought that did a good
job of capturing the diversity.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.790
I also want to
commend the planners

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:36.820
of this event for the choice
of image that they chose.

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:41.790
Pro-woman, pro-baby, pro-life
as the emblem of this event.

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:44.250
That does a fair job,
I think, of capturing

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:47.420
how pro-life, women,
and men would express

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:50.060
our viewpoints on this issue.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:53.160
In conclusion, I'll just note
that Paul Harvey's coverage

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.750
of The Rest of the
Story didn't merely

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:59.050
supply a trivial
postscript to something

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:01.310
that was already a full story.

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:05.540
Often, it shed a whole
new light on the subject.

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:08.710
In the same way, taking
the conservative account

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:11.190
of the last half century
of cultural history

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:14.730
on its own terms provides
the interpretive key

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:18.380
that makes today's
challenges intelligible

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:21.570
and offers us the tools
for better public discourse

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:23.810
on these critical
matters going forward.

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:24.520
Thank you.

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:33.950
- Good afternoon.

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:36.160
I want to start,
also, by saying thank

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:41.750
you very much to the Schlesinger
and Radcliffe Institute.

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:45.650
I can't express to you what
a pleasure it is to be here.

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:52.700
I would have never imagined back
in the late 90s and early 2000s

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:56.200
that a problem that
caused me so much

00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:02.530
stress as a researcher, trying
to find conservative women

00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:08.090
in the archives, would land me
in a discussion on this stage

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:12.970
with such distinguished
company that I

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:15.120
get to talk about with you.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.260
So thank you.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.400
As a way to talk about
this problem as I see it,

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:24.070
I want to do three things.

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:27.380
The first is to
outline why I think

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:31.330
it's in our interest as
a historical community

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:36.550
to collect the papers
of conservative women.

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:42.280
Second, I want to explain,
if I may be so brazen,

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.940
why I think it's in the
interest of conservatives

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:49.680
to deposit their papers
in university archives,

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:55.610
particularly places that
are open to the public.

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:58.600
And, third, I want
to raise a question

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.160
about some difficulties
that we need

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.580
to address for moving ahead.

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:07.290
But before I get to
these items on my agenda,

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:10.880
I'm going to talk just briefly
a bit about my experiences

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.690
of trying to find conservative
women in the archives

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:17.410
to set up these agenda items.

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:20.960
So this goes back to my
years as a graduate student

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.800
when I was trying to do
research for my dissertation.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.790
It was the turn of
the 21st century

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:31.550
and I was enthusiastically
joining a wave of new scholars,

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:34.040
studying American conservatism.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:40.070
And unlike most other ABDs and
newly minted PhDs in the field,

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:43.360
I was also interested
in women and gender.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.800
And I say most.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.070
I had a very important
predecessor here, Lisa McGiir,

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:52.340
who's in the audience who wrote
another very important book

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.300
on women in conservatism.

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.150
I was actually interested
in how Cold War era

00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:01.800
housewives of the 1950s
built important institutions,

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.740
networks, and organs of
grassroots conservatism

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:08.560
from their suburban
Los Angeles homes

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:12.720
and how they established
important building

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:16.410
blocks for the emerging
movement to come.

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:19.790
My earliest forays into
historical archives

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:21.230
were difficult, though.

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:23.420
It took many months
for me to get my legs

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.410
because when I first
talked to archivists

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:28.650
they would tell me
that they really

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:30.970
didn't have anything for me.

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:34.160
No collections on
conservative women.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.130
There was always a but.

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:40.930
I discovered that there were, in
fact, women in these archives.

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:46.270
One just needed to know
how and where to look.

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:49.250
They would tell me
things like, well, we

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:52.420
don't have conservative
women, but we do have

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:54.300
this radical right collection.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.590
That was at the Hoover.

00:48:55.590 --> 00:49:00.670
Or we do have the Sarah Diamond
collection at the Bancroft.

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:04.352
And you might find
women in there.

00:49:04.352 --> 00:49:07.520
Or there were the spy
reports of the Los Angeles

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.020
Jewish Community Relations.

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:15.010
These are groups spying on
conservative groups and so on.

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:19.590
And I found some
incredible riches this way.

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:21.350
But for the most
part, women were not

00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:22.600
jumping out of these papers.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.180
I found the papers
by finding the real,

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:30.680
live, breathing women.

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.180
Every day, as I combed through
the records of organizations,

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:37.180
government documents,
political documents,

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:40.490
I would keep a list
of names of women.

00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:46.180
And, after lunch, I would
sit-in front of a computer

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:48.730
at the archive and I would
look up phone numbers

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:50.480
in the online white pages.

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:53.200
And then when I would
go home in the evening,

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.320
I would make cold calls.

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.750
I would just call people.

00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:00.420
And eventually I
would get a hit.

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:04.920
And I met some really important
women, some really fascinating

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.680
activists.

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:10.010
I managed to record
their oral histories

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:14.210
and examined troves of
historical documents

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:16.550
that many had stored
in their homes.

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:19.697
And if there are
archivists in the audience,

00:50:19.697 --> 00:50:21.030
you know what I'm talking about.

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:26.790
People who just would go to
events and collect things.

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:29.100
And this brings me
to my first point.

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:33.090
Why it is in our interest,
as a historical community,

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:36.180
to collect the papers
of conservative women?

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:39.930
Now, by historical
community, I mean all of us

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:43.910
in the business, scholars,
activists, public historians,

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:45.120
teachers.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:48.700
Because this problem that I had
finding conservative women's

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:52.230
papers is the problem
of conservatism as

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:55.120
outlined by Alan
Brinkley in 1994

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.810
in the American
Historical Review

00:50:56.810 --> 00:51:01.210
essay that, among other
things, inspired my research.

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:03.780
This article is literally
called The Problem

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:05.670
of American Conservatism.

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:07.720
US political
historians, he argued,

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:12.380
had failed to basically
explain the success and nuances

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:16.750
of the American right in
history, a problem he correctly

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:21.780
attributed to failure of
the "historical imagination"

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:26.970
and "basic lack of sympathy for
the right among most scholars."

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:30.030
And to further apply this
interpretation by Brinkley

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:32.930
to our problem
here today, there's

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:36.540
just no way we can fully
capture the national fabric

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:38.990
or political
landscape if we don't

00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:43.040
seek a diversity of
voices in the record.

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.390
In that vein, it's
necessary to emphasize

00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:49.040
that we need to collect the
material of conservatives

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:54.861
who we don't necessarily
see every night on Fox News.

00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:55.360
OK.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.650
So what I'm saying is it's
not just elite conservatives.

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:01.190
It's not just the
people who you think

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:05.040
of when we say conservative,
who we have to collect.

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:08.920
And that category doesn't
just include women.

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.280
It also includes
black Republicans,

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:14.520
Korean Christian
conservatives, and others

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:18.380
who don't come to mind when
we think of Phyllis Schlafly.

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:22.150
Second, although I'm
not conservative myself,

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:25.300
I am, nevertheless, going
to make suggestions here

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:27.760
to my conservative
colleagues of why

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:33.080
I think it's good to leave
collections in the archives

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:35.030
and to leave them in
public institutions

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:37.740
rather than places
that restrict access.

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:39.410
I think it offers
the best chance

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:43.130
of inserting oneself
and asserting oneself

00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:45.070
into the historical record.

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:49.450
To make the papers of
a person or institution

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:53.270
available for research
is to put names

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:56.740
on a particular set of
events before scholars even

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.710
look at the materials.

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:01.560
It is, moreover, a
good way to determine

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:04.280
how the very meaning
of conservatism

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:08.460
itself will be
defined for posterity.

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:12.380
We historians, it is true,
have the right and duty

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:18.000
to produce our own original
work based on the application

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.040
of disciplinary analysis.

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:24.880
And it will often not square
with the ideas and intent

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.930
of our subjects.

00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:31.750
However, to have influence on
what a collection is named,

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:33.930
to determine what
gets put in there

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:39.500
is one way of setting terms
before the scholar even

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:42.160
sees the materials.

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:48.740
Historical archives are the
first places we go for sources.

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:53.480
My last item today concerns
the internet, social media,

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.880
and talk radio.

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:56.830
Since it seems to me
that so much of what

00:53:56.830 --> 00:54:01.100
constitutes the conservative
movement, and basically

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:05.840
all politics today, is
taking place online.

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.320
And what I found out
really encouraged me today

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.300
on my tour of the
library because it's

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:15.360
starting to happen.

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:20.600
The Schlesinger is figuring out
how to collect these materials.

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:26.690
And so I think that,
moving forward,

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:30.840
we need, if we're
going to document

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:36.130
the record of American
politics, its institutions,

00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:38.560
like this one and
others, that are

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.820
accessible to the
public, where we

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:44.197
need to be able to find
the conservative movement.

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:51.210
And I would invite the audience
members, for example, just

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:53.390
Google conservative mom blog.

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:57.490
I mean, see how much comes up.

00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:59.680
And with these
questions, I'm not only

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.750
going to point to the
difficulty of pinning down

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:06.430
what conservatism is and will
be, especially coming out

00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:10.350
of this election cycle, but how
the archive of the near future

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:14.250
is going to represent
politics in the new media age.

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:14.750
Thank you.

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:24.430
- Well, let me start
by adding my thanks

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:27.510
as well to each of you for
taking the time to be here.

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:31.590
It's deeply encouraging
to see an event like this,

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:35.150
to have pretty much
every chair filled.

00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:38.310
And for someone like
Professor Mansbridge

00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:40.630
to take the time to
be here, Dean Cohen,

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:42.440
it's a testament
to your leadership

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.900
that this is happening.

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:47.100
And, Jane, I want to talk about
my deep admiration for you

00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:47.743
in a minute.

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:53.780
Jane mentioned my
mother, and I wasn't

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:55.000
planning to talk about her.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.640
But I thought I might start
with her because my earliest

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:02.830
memory of my mother
is falling asleep,

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:08.240
listening to the sound of a
typewriter in the other room.

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:12.320
And I love my
MacBook, but there's

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.310
something about the
sound of a typewriter.

00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:16.240
And, to me, it's a
very maternal sound

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:19.010
because my mother worked on
her doctoral dissertation

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:22.850
after my brother and I
went to bed at night.

00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:26.930
And I think that's
important for you

00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:29.350
to know about me as a person.

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:30.900
It might also be
important for you

00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:34.010
to know that my mother
was a teacher when

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:36.510
she became pregnant with
me and subsequently lost

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:39.000
her job as a result.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.160
I tell you these stories
because I am an embodied woman.

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.940
I live as a woman
in this culture.

00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:48.340
And I've had many of
the same experiences

00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:51.720
that my liberal feminist
friends have had.

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:55.630
There was quite,
almost, an earthquake

00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:59.860
online this last weekend
after the Trump tape surfaced.

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:01.960
And there was a
Canadian author who

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:05.560
asked women to tweet at
her their experiences

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.520
of sexual harassment.

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:10.830
And she started off by
telling a story that

00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:14.800
had happened to her on a public
bus when she was 12 years old.

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.840
And it stimulated in me-- I
hadn't thought about the fact

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.780
that I had had almost the
exact same experience when

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:23.600
I was 12 years old when
a man exposed himself

00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:28.730
to me in public, rubbed
up against me in a crowd.

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:30.940
And the reason I
tell you that is

00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:33.920
because I had a visceral
reaction as I read

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:37.080
9.7 million women, the
last time I checked,

00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:40.560
had responded to that thread.

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:45.020
And the point was to
talk about the fact

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:48.780
that, as women, we have
these unique experiences that

00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:52.320
are-- no offense, gentleman, I
appreciate your presence here

00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:56.350
today-- some unique
vulnerabilities that we have.

00:57:56.350 --> 00:57:58.470
My daughter, when
she was in college,

00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:00.340
was attacked by
a sexual predator

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:01.920
and, fortunately, she was OK.

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:08.770
But, anyway, these are
experiences that we have,

00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:13.630
and I share that in common
with women, in general.

00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:16.260
The reason I start with
that is because I've

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:20.680
titled my brief remarks
Trust and the Other.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:22.520
Trust and the Other.

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:25.920
Because, Jane, in inviting
me to come to this,

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:27.680
she mentioned the word trust.

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:30.530
And in our exchanges,
putting this panel together,

00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:32.620
we've talked a lot about trust.

00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:34.310
And that's a real issue.

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:37.320
And I thought I might tell you
a few stories that illustrate

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:41.440
the challenge of trust
from my perspective

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:44.740
as a conservative woman,
engaging with women's issues

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.650
throughout my career.

00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:48.770
Because, despite
all of these stories

00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:53.380
that I tell of holding in
common a feminine experience

00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:56.600
in this culture,
I've been accused

00:58:56.600 --> 00:59:02.100
of internalized misogyny,
of not being a real woman.

00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:04.160
I've been told on
multiple occasions

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:08.060
that because I'm pro-life
I can't be a woman.

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:13.430
And those kinds of
experiences create a feeling.

00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:16.650
It's a way of generating,
of distancing,

00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:20.880
of saying that you, as a woman,
you're not really a woman.

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:22.030
You're the other.

00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:24.450
You're this other
category over here.

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:28.410
You can't be a part of
our movement over here.

00:59:28.410 --> 00:59:31.960
And so it decreases trust.

00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:35.720
That's why, as I lead into
saying, that I do really

00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:39.150
appreciate Jane putting
this event together.

00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:43.010
Frankly, when you first called
me, Jane, I didn't trust you.

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:45.590
It took several conversations.

00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:50.640
And it was really so
fascinating to me.

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:53.020
We had a chance to have
breakfast this morning.

00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:55.630
And just before we ended
up talking about the panel,

00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:58.510
we talked about a whole range
of just personal things.

00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:02.300
We ended up talking about
some issue kinds of things.

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.350
And it's always
fascinating to me

01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:09.360
when you can sit down and talk
as real people, real person

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.350
to real person.

01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:13.280
There are so many
areas of agreement,

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.420
of agreement about issues.

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:18.600
That doesn't mean that you end
up coming out on the other end,

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:22.690
agreeing about what should
be done about issues.

01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:25.230
But it's a productive
conversation

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:28.390
when you can surface
common experiences

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:32.370
and common emotions
and common challenges.

01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:36.640
That helps you to build
a groundwork of trust

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.470
and a platform to talk
about how you move forward

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.860
and to brainstorm about
different ways of moving

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:44.990
forward.

01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:47.680
And the reason
that, frankly, I've

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.710
always really liked the
concept of the other,

01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:53.530
because it generates
so much that's

01:00:53.530 --> 01:01:00.500
helpful about clarifying how we
can undermine our conversations

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.890
with each other.

01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:04.090
Because what happens
when we throw away

01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:06.800
round terms like
internalized misogyny

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.310
is that those of us who might
hold different positions

01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:15.990
from the prevailing ideology
become a caricature.

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:18.200
We're not real people.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.410
There's this idea that
somehow we haven't experienced

01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:22.840
some of the same things.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.350
And so suddenly
you're not interacting

01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:28.310
with a real person who
has real motivations,

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.480
but you're interacting
with a cartoon,

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.710
and that's not productive
and that's not helpful.

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:37.350
And the other thing about
the other that's important

01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:42.170
is that it generates an
unreasonable fear that

01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:45.130
also undermines productivity.

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:50.640
I was absolutely fascinated
going through the Holocaust

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.820
Museum in DC.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.090
I learned a lot.

01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:57.480
I actually had
never been exposed

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:04.180
to the propaganda
that preceded, really,

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:06.260
the rise of World War II.

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.542
Just having that
wonderful experience

01:02:08.542 --> 01:02:10.000
today of going
through the library,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.740
it makes a difference
to get to see

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:14.130
the actual materials
of something

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:16.610
and to see the
pieces of propaganda

01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:19.050
about the Jewish people
that were put out

01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:21.030
prior to World War II.

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:23.980
There was this
generation of fear

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.410
of what their motivation
was and what they were going

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:30.890
to do to the German culture.

01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:32.980
And I think that's what happens.

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:38.210
I see this a lot, in my
experience as a pro-life woman.

01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:40.860
I'll read something
that is meant

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:43.800
to be a descriptor
of what's going on

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.410
in the pro-life community.

01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:48.990
And I don't recognize
anything in it

01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:52.740
because there'll be this fear
that permeates the article.

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:56.270
And I've actually sat with some
colleagues and leave laughed.

01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:59.040
And I've said, have
you ever sat in one

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.630
of those conspiratorial meetings
where that particular agenda

01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:04.320
was being discussed?

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.290
And I can tell you that
many of the articles

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:11.610
I read about these
conspiratorial meetings,

01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:12.960
they don't happen.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.500
And the agendas
are not as they're

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:18.670
described in these
more fear-laden kinds

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:20.210
of descriptions.

01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:22.990
And I believe that's
completely rooted

01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:28.900
in a caricature of who
the people involved are.

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:30.190
Let me give you an example.

01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:32.750
And this is
light-hearted, and I hope

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:35.090
you'll find it as funny
as I did at the time.

01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:37.900
But here's a personal
experience that I had with this.

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:40.630
So you mentioned Mother Jones.

01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:41.630
So they were coming in.

01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:44.650
And, of course, there
was a little concern

01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:47.050
about the interaction
with Mother Jones.

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:52.180
And so in order to
hopefully communicate

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:55.830
a pro-women message,
I made sure that there

01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:59.820
were several of the female
attorneys that worked with me

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.400
who were part of the meeting.

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.970
So it was me and, I think,
two female attorneys.

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:06.830
And I actually invited
my daughter in, too.

01:04:06.830 --> 01:04:09.790
So it ends up being
an all-female meeting

01:04:09.790 --> 01:04:12.210
because the reporter
was as well.

01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:16.090
So I like salad.

01:04:16.090 --> 01:04:20.340
And so we ordered a big
bowl of salad from CHOPT.

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.020
Do you have CHOPT
in Boston, too?

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:22.520
Yeah.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.090
Of course.

01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:26.220
So the female reporter walks in.

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:27.830
And I'm just trying
to be jovial,

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:29.190
so I make a joke with her.

01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:31.220
And I say, well, hey,
since we're all women,

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:33.040
we're going to have salad today.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.570
Oh, ha, ha, ha.

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:39.915
And she laughs and it was a
throwaway comment on my part.

01:04:39.915 --> 01:04:42.490
I hope now you all don't
think terrible of me

01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:45.010
because I like salad.

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:46.900
So here's the funny part.

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:49.800
The fact checker
from Mother Jones

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.330
followed up with our
media person and said,

01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:58.445
is it true that you only serve
salad to female reporters?

01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:04.170
And our media person
responded and said, well,

01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:06.265
we're really a fan of
all of the food groups.

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:11.270
I appreciated her.

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:13.530
So, anyway, that's been
one of my favorite jokes,

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:17.210
is that I actually
really like steak.

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:22.490
But, in any event,
I really don't

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:25.420
want to repeat too many of
the wonderful list of things

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.160
that Jennifer has
already laid out.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.080
But two points that
I thought of that I

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.710
would want to underscore
is as we interact

01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:35.960
and try to understand each
other's positions better,

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.160
I think it's really
important to ask ourselves,

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.830
are we assuming bad
faith on the other part?

01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:46.020
And I challenge pro-lifers
and pro-family people on this

01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:49.870
as well because I
don't mean to assert

01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:52.630
that this is a one-way street.

01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:55.850
On either side of a very
contentious political issue,

01:05:55.850 --> 01:05:59.840
you tend to project
off bad faith.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:03.570
And, similarly, a
parallel question

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:05.820
would be, how do we
interpret motivation?

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:11.090
What are the assumptions
we make about why

01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:15.890
a particular person is engaging
on the issues that they are?

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:18.770
I was deeply affected by
another life experience I had,

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:22.180
which was I had the opportunity,
after the Reagan White House,

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:26.690
to spend a couple of terms doing
an independent study at Oxford

01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:30.390
with Dr. David Cook.

01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:31.600
They have the wonderful--

01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:35.130
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:39.931
- Thank you-- and a very
different learning process than

01:06:39.931 --> 01:06:40.430
ours.

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:41.190
And so it's challenging.

01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:42.790
And I sit with him
and he says to me,

01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:45.610
so tell me why you're pro-life.

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:46.800
I'm like, oh, this is easy.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:50.200
I'm off to a good
start here at Oxford,

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.310
because I'm a
little intimidated.

01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:53.370
And I start talking.

01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:57.360
And I start trying to
tell him why I'm pro-life.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:01.010
And he brutally cuts
me off and he says, no.

01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:02.360
That won't do at all.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.550
Your first writing
assignment is to go

01:07:04.550 --> 01:07:07.140
write a paper on why a
woman should have a right

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.750
to choose abortion.

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:10.960
And I was like, what?

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.454
That's not what I came here for.

01:07:13.454 --> 01:07:14.870
And I have to tell
you that it was

01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:20.430
one of the most formative,
professional experiences I

01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:22.340
had in my entire life.

01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:24.650
It was a very difficult
paper for me to write.

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:27.060
And I learned so very much.

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:31.170
And in my time teaching,
I've assigned that paper

01:07:31.170 --> 01:07:33.300
to a few people,
tried to flip it,

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:37.020
whichever person
you're dealing with.

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.310
We need to challenge
our students.

01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:40.910
We need to challenge
our young people.

01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:43.960
We need to challenge
ourselves to constantly

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:49.720
be working to understand
our-- I hate to say,

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:55.150
opponent-- those with
whom we are interacting.

01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:59.735
Why are they engaging in
the way that they are?

01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:06.160
And I'll try to bring
this to a close.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:09.980
Jane also mentioned the New York
Times and the Christian Science

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:11.660
Monitor, profiles of me.

01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.550
It's always really
interesting to go back

01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:18.210
and see what a reporter takes
away from interacting with you.

01:08:18.210 --> 01:08:20.800
But I tell you, in both
of those experiences,

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.319
I had really intense
conversations

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:25.430
with the reporters.

01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:29.260
And their reaction was that
they had never really heard

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:32.870
the rationales that
I was articulating,

01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:36.010
the idea that somehow
you could be involved

01:08:36.010 --> 01:08:39.600
in the pro-life movement
because you were motivated

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.819
from a pro-woman perspective.

01:08:41.819 --> 01:08:46.450
And, like Jennifer, I, too, was
really struck by your image.

01:08:46.450 --> 01:08:48.520
Things like this
make a difference

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.089
when you create an event.

01:08:50.089 --> 01:08:51.630
I can't tell you
how many events I've

01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:54.310
been to where, from
the very start,

01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:56.569
the imagery, the
framing, everything

01:08:56.569 --> 01:09:02.040
is meant to bracket
you off as the other,

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:06.790
as someone who is in some way
engaging in a diabolical way.

01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:10.950
To give us the dignity of
articulating our position

01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:13.109
that we are pro-woman,
we're pro-baby, pro-life,

01:09:13.109 --> 01:09:17.939
that is what I try to
articulate professionally.

01:09:17.939 --> 01:09:21.750
And I appreciate you doing
that in the event poster.

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:27.479
And I think as we
move into a situation

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:30.710
where we may actually have
the first female president

01:09:30.710 --> 01:09:33.540
of our country,
these issues are only

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:38.560
going to become more
intense as we grapple

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:45.260
with that potential reality and
what it means to be pro-woman

01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:49.390
and how we engage together,
moving forward, deeper

01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:50.660
into the century.

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:55.770
So thank you for your integrity
and your welcoming spirit.

01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:57.962
And I'm very grateful
for this event

01:09:57.962 --> 01:09:59.920
and for your leadership
in putting it together.

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.660
- Well, that was a
very positive note

01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:14.240
to finish up on and
finish up phase one.

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.740
So to begin phase two,
I'll try and introduce

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:19.470
not negativity but
some areas of tension

01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:23.290
that I think I picked
up on in the course

01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:25.400
of these wonderful
presentations.

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:29.130
So I have a couple
that I'd like to raise.

01:10:29.130 --> 01:10:33.930
But I thought I'd start with
something that I heard come up

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:35.570
in interesting ways.

01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:37.340
Both Jennifer and
Charmaine talked

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:40.810
a lot about the
importance off-- I

01:10:40.810 --> 01:10:42.960
think that when
Jennifer was talking

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:48.120
about it-- the idea of grappling
with the other side or the side

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.350
you were studying, whatever
term you want to use,

01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:52.740
grappling with their
best arguments,

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:56.140
their real arguments,
taking ideas seriously

01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:58.760
on their merits, not
just always looking

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.680
for the hidden motivation,
the hidden secret and so on.

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:05.550
And, obviously, Charmaine
picked up on that idea as well.

01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:08.410
But that argument,
it's an argument

01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:11.050
that I agree with and
find very powerful.

01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:15.150
And in my work as a journalist,
I spend a lot of time

01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:17.680
effectively, I think,
urging my readers

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.336
to grapple with conservative
ideas at the highest level

01:11:21.336 --> 01:11:23.210
that I can raise them
to, which is not always

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:27.480
very high, but high enough,
hopefully, for newspaper work.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:32.300
But that cuts in interesting
ways across the reality

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.100
that both our academic
participants are

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:37.300
talking about and embodied
in their own careers, which

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:42.790
is the grassroots versus
elite divide in any politics

01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:46.020
but in conservative
politics, in particular.

01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:48.740
Where you are, as
an academic, you

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:51.810
have an obligation not
to look for the weakest

01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:53.730
argument or the most
sinister argument

01:11:53.730 --> 01:11:56.290
that the other side
might be marshaling but

01:11:56.290 --> 01:12:02.160
to look for the arguments
that individuals and movements

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.720
actually believe at the
grassroots level that may not

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.650
always be identical to the
arguments that are made

01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:11.500
at the elite level, whether
in academia, newspaper

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:15.080
columns, policy papers,
or anywhere else.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:18.370
And I think that this tension
is of particular relevancee--

01:12:18.370 --> 01:12:21.510
I'm sorry to bring it
back to crass politics--

01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:25.200
in the age of Donald Trump
where a lot of what's happened

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.490
in conservative politics
over the last year

01:12:27.490 --> 01:12:34.160
has been a revelation of the gap
between what people like myself

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:38.130
and Jennifer and Charmaine
in different ways

01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:41.880
argue and believe in and
what many conservative and

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.700
Republican voters preferred
to have argued for

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:48.124
and believed in by their
presidential standard bearer.

01:12:48.124 --> 01:12:50.540
And this obviously isn't the
first time this has happened.

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.720
And much of the history
of Phyllis Schlafly

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.430
and the rise of the
Grassroots Right

01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:58.510
reflects a tension between the
grassroots and the elite level.

01:12:58.510 --> 01:13:01.480
So I guess this is maybe first
a question for professors

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:06.260
Critchlow and Nickerson,
but really for anyone.

01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:10.870
How hard is it to
finesse that balance

01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:14.750
where you're simultaneously
trying to take ideas

01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:17.500
as seriously as possible
and deal with the most

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:20.960
serious articulations
thereof while also being

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:28.390
alert for the deep tensions that
open between populist currents

01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:31.870
and what the elites say--
conservatism or liberalism,

01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:34.300
it's obviously highest
across the spectrum--

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:35.490
is and should stand for?

01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:44.410
- I think it's important to
begin with an understanding

01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:50.920
that most historians,
scholars, and academics tend

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.315
to view the world through
ideology and ideas.

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:03.120
So they'll look for
offing inconsistencies

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:06.000
in ideas, whether
it's textual analysis

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.450
or in a person's career.

01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:14.250
But I think ideology needs to
be separated from politics,

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:18.040
the actual nature of politics.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.830
And what I mean by
that is politics

01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:25.390
is about power, winning power.

01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:28.580
And in democracy it's
about winning the election.

01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:35.870
So you'll find politicians
and political actors,

01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:42.820
such as Phyllis Schlafly,
are sometimes inconsistent

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:50.350
but not just driven by a
consistent ideological view.

01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:53.030
When Phyllis
Schlafly, for example,

01:14:53.030 --> 01:15:01.580
began her career in politics
in the 1950s in St. Louis,

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:04.220
she organized a discussion club.

01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:08.520
And on that discussion
club roster were speakers,

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:12.000
were libertarians,
traditionalists, just

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.250
a whole mix of different
kinds of people.

01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:18.930
So if you were in
New York at the time,

01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:20.880
reading National
Review, you would

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:23.330
think the world
was being filtered

01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:28.460
between this debate between
libertarians and traditionalist

01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:32.200
and ways of fusing the two.

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:35.360
But out in the
hinterland, people

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:38.820
weren't debating
those kinds of issues.

01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:44.190
It was passion at the time
about anti-c0ommunism,

01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:46.400
and then it was going
to be other issues.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:53.960
So my point is that I think
historians, too often, want

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:58.830
to look at political
figures just in solely

01:15:58.830 --> 01:16:01.470
ideological kinds of ways.

01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:05.480
And they want to also
look at politicians

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.800
in this kind of away.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.740
And I also think, in our
political discussions,

01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:15.140
we tend to often focus,
especially within the Academy,

01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:16.390
on ideas.

01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:18.310
But politics is about passion.

01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:22.010
It's about winning elections.

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:25.140
It's about getting
those kinds of votes

01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:27.700
necessary to win the election.

01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:32.390
There's general, what we
call in political science,

01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:36.950
political beliefs, a
general view of how

01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:43.020
the world should work, but
not a consistent systematic

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:44.410
worldview.

01:16:44.410 --> 01:16:47.500
And there's not a lot
of strategy, actually,

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:51.960
in politics, that is
long-term strategy.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:57.000
It's basically I know
a lot of politicians,

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.150
and it's basically a
strategy a year out

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:04.996
on how to win an election, and,
often, it's closer than that.

01:17:04.996 --> 01:17:07.370
- But the distinction to--
I'm going to take my privilege

01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:10.710
and just leap to Charmaine for
one second because-- Or no, go.

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:11.210
Sorry.

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:11.650
Go with that.

01:17:11.650 --> 01:17:13.358
- Sorry, I wanted to
follow up with that.

01:17:13.358 --> 01:17:16.720
Because I think Don raises
a really important point,

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:20.880
especially when he talks about
Schlafly's discussion groups.

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:23.840
And it actually points
to an important tension

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:28.440
that Jennifer raised about
who is going to represent

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.940
conservatism in the archives.

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:35.150
Because when
Jennifer talks about,

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:40.310
OK, you want people who
represent what conservatism

01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:44.550
really is rather
than, let's say,

01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:48.000
maybe people you would
call the reactionism

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.630
of the current political
crises of the moment.

01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:55.300
- I identify with
reaction, personally.

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:56.580
But, no.

01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:57.320
But, yes.

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:57.820
No, no.

01:17:57.820 --> 01:17:58.210
I take your point.

01:17:58.210 --> 01:17:59.430
- I was going to say, wow.

01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:01.710
But OK.

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:03.380
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:07.910
- What this gets to is the
fact that this becomes really

01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:12.380
difficult. So when we
talk about the differences

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:15.460
between the grassroots and
elite, one of the things

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:18.700
that historians have done
over the past, let's say,

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:22.680
20 odd years is introduced
what we call social history

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:24.180
to the work of
political history,

01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:28.690
where we're looking
at the kind of work

01:18:28.690 --> 01:18:32.030
and the everyday
lives of activists.

01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:37.820
And so we're also finding
non-elite actors and the work

01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:40.410
that they're doing
in their homes

01:18:40.410 --> 01:18:44.090
that you're not going to read
about in the National Review,

01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:48.270
even though those activists
themselves are reading

01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:49.680
the National Review.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:56.320
But that's not what I
found in my research, Don.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:56.820
But--

01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:58.236
- I'm sorry,
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

01:18:58.236 --> 01:18:58.740
- Oh, OK.

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:02.030
But in the 1950s, they were.

01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:04.440
But they were also
doing some things

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:10.390
that elite political actors
would refer to as crackpot.

01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:11.810
They had some ideas.

01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:15.230
They were spinning
conspiracy theories.

01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:20.280
In fact, you might even call
it reactionism at the time.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:23.410
It was pretty populist.

01:19:23.410 --> 01:19:26.330
But yet they were very
important to the emergence

01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:29.040
of the John Birch Society
and the Goldwater Movement.

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:33.800
So it's really hard to determine
who are the real conservatives

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:39.440
and how do we decide whose
papers we need to place, right?

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.100
And I'm not saying
that what I have to say

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:44.130
about it is the most important.

01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:46.960
I just think that it's just
a little bit difficult.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:48.350
- This is a minor interjection.

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:51.800
Even to recognize that those
different strands exist

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:55.410
is a step in the
right direction.

01:19:55.410 --> 01:19:57.480
- But you also come
to these moments,

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:01.250
and we've had one in this
election cycle, where

01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:04.820
some version of the grassroots
that is not supposed

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:09.640
to be official conservatism
suddenly becomes politically,

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.490
immensely important.

01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:10.990
Right?

01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:14.210
And I keep thinking of watching
the Republican presidential

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:14.710
debates.

01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:17.240
And how many times did
Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:20.650
desperately explain that Donald
Trump was not a conservative

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:22.960
in capital letters, basically.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.520
And that made a
difference to a slice

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.680
of the Republican
electorate, but not enough

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.960
to deny Donald Trump
the nomination.

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:34.920
I just wanted to ask Charmaine,
as someone as someone

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.940
active in a cause.

01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:42.600
The pro-life
movement is obviously

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.150
a deeply political movement.

01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:45.240
Any movement would be.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:48.550
But it's a movement organized
around a single issue,

01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:52.990
a single philosophical position,
a single idealistic worldview.

01:20:52.990 --> 01:20:54.430
When you hear
Professor Critchlow

01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:58.630
talking about the idea that,
well, this is just politics,

01:20:58.630 --> 01:20:59.970
right?

01:20:59.970 --> 01:21:02.760
I don't mean to say
that you're downgrading

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.080
idealism in any way.

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.580
And when you think
about the year

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:08.720
that religious conservatives
have just been through

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.800
with Trump, I'm just curious
what your reaction is

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:17.480
and how you see that playing
out, maybe specifically,

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:20.300
and the different ways that
people in your movement

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:25.180
have tried to negotiate
the rise of Donald Trump.

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:33.260
- I think there's more strategy
among politicians than--

01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:37.550
I want to gently disagree with
Don's characterization there.

01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:41.560
I think, certainly, they
will be more caught up

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:45.090
in the immediacy of the
tactics of whatever election

01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:46.960
happens to be in front of them.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:51.130
But I think that both
movements and politicians

01:21:51.130 --> 01:21:53.820
who endure for
any amount of time

01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:56.220
have to have a longer horizon.

01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:58.890
And certainly in the
pro-life movement right

01:21:58.890 --> 01:22:01.580
now, there's a lot of
ongoing conversation

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:04.020
about what the
next horizon looks

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:09.130
like in the wake of the June
decision in the Texas case,

01:22:09.130 --> 01:22:10.710
for example.

01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:15.660
So there will be a lot
of strategy around that.

01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:18.240
And, certainly,
following November,

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:21.210
regardless of whether
Trump wins or Clinton wins,

01:22:21.210 --> 01:22:26.080
there'll be a much
longer horizon.

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:28.450
- Yeah, I guess what
I'm getting at, though--

01:22:28.450 --> 01:22:34.940
not to put you on the spot-- but
there a very specific civil war

01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:38.760
over how you marry
idealism to tactics,

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:41.300
basically with the specific
question being should

01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:45.220
pro-lifers and religious
conservatives more generally

01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:47.990
support Trump?

01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:54.950
And I guess I'm wondering--
and anyone can take this up--

01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:58.920
but from the vantage point
of 25 or 30 years from now,

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.610
I mean, do you think
that this moment is

01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:05.030
a real crisis for
the movement or do

01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:08.090
you think it's one of these
political moments that

01:23:08.090 --> 01:23:11.250
will fade into the
landscape of, oh,

01:23:11.250 --> 01:23:13.950
that was sort of a tactical
debate that came and went

01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:16.230
once Trump was defeated?

01:23:16.230 --> 01:23:16.730
- No.

01:23:16.730 --> 01:23:21.200
I think that elections are
always a crack in time.

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:23.220
They're significant.

01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:25.600
They make a difference.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:29.160
They are, in many ways,
an organizing structure

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:32.060
around which we
create our history.

01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:37.440
And so it will be significant.

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.240
And it does make a difference.

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.990
We were talking a
little earlier, though.

01:23:40.990 --> 01:23:44.310
I think that we
can, in many ways,

01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:48.760
downgrade history by thinking
it's completely unique.

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:52.450
We go through these cycles
in American politics.

01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:55.324
It's one of the reasons
that I study politics.

01:23:55.324 --> 01:23:57.240
I think our founders
were brilliant in the way

01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:02.130
they set up our system and that
it is resilient in its ability

01:24:02.130 --> 01:24:04.430
to reform and recreate.

01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:07.720
And I think that that is
what you will see happening.

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:11.480
But the other thing
about elections

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:15.090
is that the results do
matter and winning matters.

01:24:15.090 --> 01:24:17.290
And so I don't think
anybody can really

01:24:17.290 --> 01:24:21.030
tell you what's going to happen
with these different factions

01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:24.750
that have materialized and
revealed themselves until we

01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:26.070
see what the results are.

01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:29.190
Because the results
themselves will

01:24:29.190 --> 01:24:32.645
make a difference in how
people interpret what happened.

01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:41.130
- If I may, I wasn't suggesting
that ideas don't matter.

01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:45.230
I think ideas do matter.

01:24:45.230 --> 01:24:47.730
But they matter in degree.

01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:52.870
And what I was suggesting
is that the politicians who

01:24:52.870 --> 01:25:00.940
are running for office, and
they arrive at policies,

01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:03.020
it's not necessarily calculated.

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:08.860
I'll give you two very
quick examples of this.

01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:14.200
There's a large
literature in history

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:23.070
that Republicans in the South,
after desegregation and then

01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:29.110
integration had come,
albeit slowly and not fully,

01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:34.670
that Republican strategists
decided to tap and orchestrate

01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:39.660
campaigns against busing
and affirmative action.

01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:44.390
And that was the
way of defending

01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:48.020
this segregationist,
white privileged order.

01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:54.020
And I disagree with that kind
of narrative in this way.

01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:56.970
The Republicans were able
to win the South beginning

01:25:56.970 --> 01:26:00.630
in the 1950s on the
presidential level.

01:26:00.630 --> 01:26:05.880
And then, very gradually,
down into the local level,

01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:07.970
it was going to
be a long process.

01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:10.780
But where they
tapped into voters,

01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:14.900
was primarily Republican
voters, was in the suburbs.

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:20.560
Newt Gingrich wasn't elected
from mule-driven, redneck

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:27.230
farmers but from fairly
Atlantic, wealthy suburbs.

01:26:27.230 --> 01:26:30.300
The Republicans were able
to win the South primarily

01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:31.740
on the suburban vote.

01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:36.570
And, obviously, people had
moved to the suburbs, many

01:26:36.570 --> 01:26:39.950
to get away from
sunbelt suburbs,

01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:46.350
to get away from problems of the
inner city, which were racial.

01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:51.080
But the major force, I think
drive, moving to the sunbelt

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:56.530
was better jobs, cheaper living,
cheaper houses, safer schools,

01:26:56.530 --> 01:27:00.360
and better schools
for their kids.

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:02.550
So there was a racial component.

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:11.990
And the anti-busing and
the anti-affirmative action

01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:17.330
sprang up in the 1970s.

01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:20.840
And Republicans decided
to tap into those issues

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:22.850
as a way of winning elections.

01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:28.560
More to the point, Phyllis
Schlafly and her followers

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:33.570
challenge the Republican
establishment on ERA.

01:27:33.570 --> 01:27:40.180
The Republican's leadership
from Ford, and even Reagan,

01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:44.240
although he waffled on
the issue, were pro ERA.

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:53.370
So, as the grassroots movement
and ERA movement spread

01:27:53.370 --> 01:27:55.310
and it was learned
that you could

01:27:55.310 --> 01:28:01.420
tap into religious voters,
white women voters who got

01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:06.270
mobilized around ERA because
it had become a symbol attack

01:28:06.270 --> 01:28:11.970
on themselves, motherhood,
their roles in society,

01:28:11.970 --> 01:28:15.190
and a large buildup,
accumulation,

01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:19.250
of what they saw as attack
on their religious beliefs.

01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:22.530
Republican operatives,
at that point,

01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:25.480
who were basically outliers,
not within the party

01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:28.330
but political
strategists, decided

01:28:28.330 --> 01:28:32.400
to tap into that in order
to win the elections.

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.400
That's how politics works.

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.620
It's much more
complicated, as I was

01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:43.170
suggesting, than just
systematic, ideological, views.

01:28:43.170 --> 01:28:45.190
And I think that's
important to understand

01:28:45.190 --> 01:28:48.480
the dynamics of
grassroots activism

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:52.720
and how it plays into politics.

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:55.550
- And then, quickly-- I do want
to open it up to questions--

01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:58.440
but I guess this can be a
question for both Jennifer

01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:00.350
and Michelle in different ways.

01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:07.470
But the idea of
studying, whether it's

01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:11.610
the grassroots or
the elite ideas,

01:29:11.610 --> 01:29:13.810
I noticed Jennifer was
talking about a piece

01:29:13.810 --> 01:29:16.484
about the pro-life
movement that you liked.

01:29:16.484 --> 01:29:17.150
It was in Slate.

01:29:17.150 --> 01:29:18.850
It was written by Ruth Graham.

01:29:18.850 --> 01:29:22.700
Ruth Graham is, I believe, like
you, a graduate of Wheaton.

01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:25.130
And she's not a member
of the religious right.

01:29:25.130 --> 01:29:28.270
She's not a religious
conservative in her writing.

01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:31.087
But, as a journalist, it's
very clear to me at least,

01:29:31.087 --> 01:29:32.670
as someone who's
read her for a while,

01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:36.700
that this sympathy and
seriousness of her writing

01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:39.080
on religious issues is
informed by the fact

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:43.180
that she has personal,
friendly, lifelong exposure

01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:46.030
to actual, evangelical
Christians.

01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:50.210
And so I wondered, both for you
as a professional conservative

01:29:50.210 --> 01:29:52.870
and for you as an academic,
studying conservatives,

01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:56.560
to what extent is the
imaginative sympathy

01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:59.880
necessary to really
write about ideas

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:03.820
possible in the absence
of a real, lived, personal

01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:05.710
experience?

01:30:05.710 --> 01:30:08.610
And I think this is, in
certain ways, the big question

01:30:08.610 --> 01:30:13.440
for the professional Academy
with its general, liberal tilt

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:17.300
as it approaches the study
of conservative politics

01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:18.342
and ideas.

01:30:18.342 --> 01:30:19.670
- Good question.

01:30:19.670 --> 01:30:23.270
- That was the most exciting
challenge of my research,

01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:24.790
I thought.

01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:28.040
Well, when I started,
I felt like I

01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:30.790
had two really good examples.

01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:35.060
Kristen Luker's Abortion and the
Politics of Motherhood, which

01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:39.050
was sociology when
I started, and then

01:30:39.050 --> 01:30:45.320
Jane Duhart and John Matthew's
book on the anti-ERA movement.

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:49.560
And I have to say, Professor
Mansbridge, your work

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:50.930
was also very influential.

01:30:50.930 --> 01:30:52.179
I think you're here somewhere.

01:30:52.179 --> 01:30:53.770
I wouldn't even recognize you.

01:30:53.770 --> 01:30:54.543
Thank you.

01:30:59.610 --> 01:31:02.720
To me, this is such
an incredible feat

01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:07.210
of scholarly imagination,
if you can put yourself

01:31:07.210 --> 01:31:13.730
in the shoes of someone who
you don't agree with at all.

01:31:13.730 --> 01:31:17.940
To me, it's incredibly rich.

01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:25.080
It's an incredible opportunity
for you as a writer,

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.210
I would say.

01:31:26.210 --> 01:31:30.910
And I felt like that was
the gift of my project,

01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:34.730
that I could be given
the chance to do that.

01:31:34.730 --> 01:31:37.890
Whether I succeeded or
not, I have no idea.

01:31:37.890 --> 01:31:39.720
The only reason I
think I might have,

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:42.710
somewhat, is I've been
in some graduate seminars

01:31:42.710 --> 01:31:46.930
where the professor would
say, OK, to the students.

01:31:46.930 --> 01:31:51.230
Do you think she's
conservative or liberal?

01:31:51.230 --> 01:31:53.880
And the students didn't know.

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:56.890
I was like, are you kidding me?

01:31:56.890 --> 01:32:01.440
And so, I mean, at
least I fooled them.

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:05.580
But whether I was able
to really transport

01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:10.790
the readers in the way
that I felt like Luker did

01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:15.670
or Duhart and Mathews and
Mansbridge, I don't know.

01:32:15.670 --> 01:32:20.920
But I think that if political
historians could do it

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:23.670
and do ethnography in
that kind of way, then

01:32:23.670 --> 01:32:26.270
we'd all be very well-served.

01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:30.040
- I'll just say that
it's difficult for me

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:33.980
to answer this outside
my voice as a scholar,

01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:39.100
doing what we hope as working
in thought leadership.

01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:43.190
I'm going to answer inevitably
from that perspective.

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:44.930
I suppose it would
be just to tell

01:32:44.930 --> 01:32:47.770
the researchers and the
archivists out there

01:32:47.770 --> 01:32:52.710
that our sector exists, people
who came to this movement out

01:32:52.710 --> 01:32:58.580
of ideas and wanting for
the true exchange of debate

01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:00.360
on ideas.

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:03.140
My work has nothing
to do with elections

01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:06.840
and with the political
machinations of getting 50%

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:09.100
plus 1, those kinds of things.

01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:12.210
And so it's neither
that populist thread

01:33:12.210 --> 01:33:13.990
that ebbs and flows.

01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:17.240
It's not the how do you
do the election formula.

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:21.140
It is day in, day out,
season in, season out ideas.

01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:25.700
And in that, anybody on my team
who's writing and I'm editing,

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:28.290
I'm pushing them,
we don't do motives.

01:33:28.290 --> 01:33:29.500
We do ideas.

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:32.720
I want you engaging the
ideas in what you write.

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:33.770
We don't do ad hominum.

01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:35.390
We do ideas.

01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:40.480
And so, in that regard,
I guess, that hopefully

01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:42.540
illuminates something
that's out there

01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:50.780
as a distinct category of social
history that ought to be told.

01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:52.290
- All right.

01:33:52.290 --> 01:33:55.770
We're going to take
questions for the next--

01:33:55.770 --> 01:33:57.490
the clock is moving
and telling me

01:33:57.490 --> 01:34:02.225
exactly how long-- four
minutes and 39 seconds.

01:34:02.225 --> 01:34:04.600
- You can probably do 10 and
the fire marshall wouldn't--

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:06.570
- The fire Marshal
wouldn't-- Oh, 13.

01:34:06.570 --> 01:34:08.525
You have just gained us 10 more.

01:34:08.525 --> 01:34:09.740
It's amazing power.

01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:12.010
So, please, I'll
just call on you.

01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:14.970
Please, obviously, as
always-- oh, there's a mic.

01:34:14.970 --> 01:34:16.261
OK.

01:34:16.261 --> 01:34:16.760
Yes.

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:19.110
Anyone who would like
to ask a question

01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:21.380
should rise, proceed
to the microphone,

01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:23.660
introduce yourself,
ask a brief question

01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:25.610
or at least raise
your voice at the end

01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:30.170
so it sounds like a question,
and, above all, be pithy.

01:34:30.170 --> 01:34:32.570
- I just want to-- My
name is Jordan Jancosek.

01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:34.610
I'm an archivist at
Brown University.

01:34:34.610 --> 01:34:38.180
I work in the John Hay library
in Special Collections.

01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:41.600
Thank you guys so much for
that fantastic discussion.

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.580
I really enjoyed it
for several reasons,

01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:46.450
but one being-- and
Jennifer and Michelle,

01:34:46.450 --> 01:34:49.200
I think you might find this
of particular interest--

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:50.910
before my current
position at Brown,

01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:53.540
I was actually the
project archivist

01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:56.460
for the Hall-Hoag Collection
of Dissenting and Extremist

01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:58.230
Propaganda.

01:34:58.230 --> 01:35:03.150
And it is a collection that
has over 40,000 organizations.

01:35:03.150 --> 01:35:04.821
Gordon Hall was a collector.

01:35:04.821 --> 01:35:06.820
He was the person who had
donated the collection

01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:07.480
to Brown.

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.660
He has since passed.

01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:12.990
But he collected from both
the right and the left.

01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:16.220
We have a lot of information,
actually, about ERA.

01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:19.385
And we have both women
for ERA, information

01:35:19.385 --> 01:35:23.070
of women against ERA,
Massachusetts for ERA.

01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:27.980
We have information on
pro-life organizations, also

01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:33.340
pro-- I guess not pro, but for
women's rights organizations.

01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:35.360
And it covers the
entire spectrum.

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:39.150
But in order for Gordon
to give us the collection,

01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:40.610
they had to do a
lot of convincing.

01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:42.068
He was very nervous
about giving it

01:35:42.068 --> 01:35:46.450
to a liberal organization
in a liberal university.

01:35:46.450 --> 01:35:47.310
And I think--

01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:49.287
- Brown is considered
liberal now?

01:35:49.287 --> 01:35:50.120
So much has changed.

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:51.953
- I don't know if you
know much about Brown,

01:35:51.953 --> 01:35:55.000
but it's considered--
But, in any case,

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.070
he was nervous about a
collection of that nature going

01:35:58.070 --> 01:36:00.750
to a place where
it is perceived.

01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:04.260
And it does have that
stigma attached to it.

01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:07.810
And I think our job as
archivists and historians

01:36:07.810 --> 01:36:09.820
and researchers is
to explain to people

01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:12.380
that that's not what we do.

01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:14.910
We make everything
open to the public.

01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:17.320
We make all of these
records open to the public.

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:21.140
And I guess my question
for you is what do you

01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:24.350
think about
organizations like that

01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:28.690
and convincing
donators to release

01:36:28.690 --> 01:36:30.490
their collections
and their information

01:36:30.490 --> 01:36:31.532
and putting it out there?

01:36:31.532 --> 01:36:33.531
You mentioned that it
needs to be collected need

01:36:33.531 --> 01:36:34.290
to be out there.

01:36:34.290 --> 01:36:36.206
But what about people
that are reluctant to do

01:36:36.206 --> 01:36:41.340
so because of the bias they
think that may be put on it?

01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:43.930
- Jennifer I'm going
to let you take that.

01:36:43.930 --> 01:36:45.930
- Tell me the full name
of the collection again.

01:36:45.930 --> 01:36:50.050
- It is the Hall-Hoag Dissenting
and Extremist Collection

01:36:50.050 --> 01:36:50.730
of Propaganda.

01:36:50.730 --> 01:36:51.880
- Dissenting and extremist.

01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:52.380
OK.

01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:54.730
I guess that's a
little wider category.

01:36:54.730 --> 01:36:57.880
I only heard the word
extremist at first.

01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:03.430
So this is a
conversation that hardly

01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:10.240
enters the room in my world,
in conservative policy.

01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:12.940
And so this is why
we're commending Jane

01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:15.870
and her team to such a
degree is because these

01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:17.790
are important questions
that you should know

01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:21.620
are not being asked, perhaps,
outside the handful of people

01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:24.200
in this room and a
few others that you

01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:26.620
interact with at your schools.

01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:29.926
So I do I think
it's a new question.

01:37:29.926 --> 01:37:32.770
In some ways, we've
been talking today

01:37:32.770 --> 01:37:35.350
a little bit about the modern
conservative movement, which

01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:40.090
is only now beginning
to have papers

01:37:40.090 --> 01:37:44.120
to relinquish and to pass on
to second and third generations

01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:45.290
of that movement.

01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:47.980
So it's an opportune time to
start asking that question

01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:50.610
and having those conversations.

01:37:50.610 --> 01:37:53.640
It will be exposure, I
think, to Ross's last point

01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:57.770
that-- and the illustration
Charmaine gave earlier--

01:37:57.770 --> 01:37:59.760
it is the face-to-face
conversations

01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:01.860
that I think will
build the trust

01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:05.640
to make that a potentiality.

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:08.230
- I was also thinking it's
important to think about how

01:38:08.230 --> 01:38:11.050
you're going to organize these
collections in different series

01:38:11.050 --> 01:38:12.970
to attract researchers.

01:38:12.970 --> 01:38:17.780
It's interesting to me that--
What kind of involvement

01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:21.590
did the donor have in
naming the collection?

01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:23.630
- He was actually very involved.

01:38:23.630 --> 01:38:25.660
Before he passed,
he was actually

01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:27.390
organizing the
collection himself

01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:29.810
with organizational categories.

01:38:29.810 --> 01:38:32.090
And he had over 50
organizational categories,

01:38:32.090 --> 01:38:34.670
which after he passed
away, we realized

01:38:34.670 --> 01:38:38.010
that that was a little much.

01:38:38.010 --> 01:38:39.970
But, really, anything
you can think of,

01:38:39.970 --> 01:38:42.170
he had a category for it.

01:38:42.170 --> 01:38:42.990
- Wow.

01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:44.120
Yeah.

01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:49.430
- I want to say that that
collection at Brown as well

01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:54.720
as University of Kansas,
University of Oregon,

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:58.900
as well as Hoover, are really
important collections that

01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:05.650
include quite a few women
in these collections that

01:39:05.650 --> 01:39:08.980
date far back.

01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:15.740
So what we're discussing is
there are collections out

01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:17.440
there, quite extensive.

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:19.965
And the Brown collection
is just absolutely

01:39:19.965 --> 01:39:23.660
an extraordinary collection.

01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:29.700
It needs to really attract
considerably more researchers.

01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:33.001
But just one other
very small point.

01:39:33.001 --> 01:39:36.320
One of the problems is
institutional collections,

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:40.230
not only individual
collections but institutions.

01:39:40.230 --> 01:39:43.810
And institutions really
don't think very much

01:39:43.810 --> 01:39:45.780
in terms of archives.

01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:49.880
When I was a guest scholar,
writing my dissertation,

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:52.900
a guest scholar on the
Brookings Institution,

01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:55.710
they actually didn't have
an archives at that point.

01:39:55.710 --> 01:40:01.120
And they had papers floating
around in the institution.

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:06.340
And I suggested that they create
an archives, which subsequently

01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:09.020
did.

01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:14.620
But institutions don't think in
terms of historical archives.

01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:17.250
They might have
corporate archives

01:40:17.250 --> 01:40:19.190
so they could look
at correspondence,

01:40:19.190 --> 01:40:24.690
but that's, I think, a
major issue for any archives

01:40:24.690 --> 01:40:27.280
because institutions want
to protect themselves

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:32.130
while, at the same time, they
don't think historically.

01:40:32.130 --> 01:40:37.760
I mean, the Brookings people
who are quite wonderful

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:40.660
and gave me access
to their papers,

01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:42.720
they don't think
historically at all.

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:47.300
And when I talked to them
about their archives-- and AEI

01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:49.250
was like this, too, by the way.

01:40:49.250 --> 01:40:53.180
Heritage came along
later-- they're like,

01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:58.000
most policy wonks are not
too interested in history,

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.814
although some are
historically informed.

01:41:00.814 --> 01:41:02.480
- The danger of history
is it might show

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:04.000
that your policy doesn't work.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.320
So you can't have that.

01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:08.380
- I might just throw
in there, there

01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:10.860
is no real shortcut to it.

01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:13.710
It's human-to-human
interaction, like anything.

01:41:13.710 --> 01:41:15.320
And it's over time.

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:18.190
And I can't tell
you how many times

01:41:18.190 --> 01:41:23.410
you will see events where there
is no conservative included

01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:24.410
at all.

01:41:24.410 --> 01:41:28.676
And it's that layer after layer
and accretion of lack of trust.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:37.260
There was a study the other
day showing 0% Republicans

01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:42.130
and I don't know in
some political science

01:41:42.130 --> 01:41:43.330
something or other.

01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:46.740
So things like
this is if you just

01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:49.330
need to be really intentional.

01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:51.540
Particularly, at
lunch time, we were

01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:56.460
talking about how technology
can separate and divide us.

01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:59.950
There's this increasing
problem of having your silos

01:41:59.950 --> 01:42:05.820
and your filter bubbles online.

01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:07.870
None of us are getting
as much information

01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:10.710
that comes at us because
we do have more choice now.

01:42:10.710 --> 01:42:12.780
So we have to be
much more intentional

01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:15.810
in our personal news gathering.

01:42:15.810 --> 01:42:19.160
But I would say that's the
same analogy for you in terms

01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:25.140
of you're trying to resist
this increasing balkanization

01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:28.310
that we have in our
culture because everybody

01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:32.570
has so much choice
in what they consume.

01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:33.290
- OK.

01:42:33.290 --> 01:42:35.760
I'm a really fast talker,
so I promise I'll be quick.

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:36.910
I'm Lea Wright Rigueur.

01:42:36.910 --> 01:42:39.560
I'm a professor at the Harvard
Kennedy School of Government.

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.740
And I know a couple
of you, so hi.

01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:42.450
Good to see you.

01:42:42.450 --> 01:42:45.180
So the first is a
really quick comment

01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:47.570
that leads to my question.

01:42:47.570 --> 01:42:53.130
And I'm specifically
thinking about another reason

01:42:53.130 --> 01:42:56.690
we might think about this
kind of work being important.

01:42:56.690 --> 01:42:58.430
And I think it's
important to think

01:42:58.430 --> 01:43:00.980
about how these things
change over time

01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:04.340
and how they don't necessarily
nicely and neatly line up

01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:07.350
with partisanship the way
that we imagine them to be,

01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:10.550
which brings me to my
question, which this plays out

01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:14.010
in particular ways when we
talk about intersectionality

01:43:14.010 --> 01:43:16.780
and when we talk not just
about women and conservatism

01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:19.690
but about African Americans
and conservatism, Latinos

01:43:19.690 --> 01:43:23.390
and conservatism, LGBTQ
and conservatism, Asians

01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:26.390
and conservatism,
and on and on and on.

01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:29.990
So I was just wondering, maybe,
if the panel could comment

01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:31.680
on some of the ways
that we can think

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:34.500
about an archival
perspective of getting

01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:37.920
to those narratives that are
really, really hard to get to.

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:39.510
And, particularly,
I'll just give you

01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:43.320
an example that I'm
familiar with, getting

01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:48.230
the papers of black women who
are conservative is really,

01:43:48.230 --> 01:43:49.490
really, really hard.

01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:52.740
Not because black women aren't
necessarily conservative,

01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:53.610
in fact they are.

01:43:53.610 --> 01:43:56.650
There are streams of
them and strains of them,

01:43:56.650 --> 01:43:58.830
but because that
conservatism rarely

01:43:58.830 --> 01:44:01.500
translates into partisanship.

01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:06.860
So the assumption is, or
the accurate assumption

01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:09.960
is, that black women are
the least likely to vote

01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:11.540
Republican.

01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:13.660
But actually, when we
look at conservatives,

01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:15.840
self-identified
conservatives, they

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:18.640
are most likely
to be Black women.

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:20.861
So how do you
solve that problem?

01:44:20.861 --> 01:44:21.360
Panel?

01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:31.780
- I'm sure many people in the
room know you here, at Harvard.

01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:34.910
But you're just not
being a good academic.

01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:39.460
You need to put a
plug-in for your book.

01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:42.450
It's a really quite good book.

01:44:42.450 --> 01:44:45.080
- I wrote a book called
The Loneliness of the Black

01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:46.030
Republican.

01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:50.300
It's not a memoir, but it's a
scholarly look at black voters,

01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:52.690
race in the Republican
Party, and conservatism,

01:44:52.690 --> 01:44:55.530
1936 through roughly 1981.

01:44:55.530 --> 01:45:00.300
And starting round two in
looking at similar things,

01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:02.355
1981 to present day.

01:45:02.355 --> 01:45:03.230
- You're on your way.

01:45:05.950 --> 01:45:09.340
- Number one, let's
just underline the fact

01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:12.650
that you're pointing out an
important research methodology

01:45:12.650 --> 01:45:16.520
question for all of
conservatism, which

01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:18.660
those are not
synonymous categories,

01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:20.160
conservative and Republican.

01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:22.410
So, number one, we need to
get that category straight.

01:45:22.410 --> 01:45:25.700
And then number two, heartily
concur with what you're saying.

01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:28.450
And so I guess, as
conversations of this type

01:45:28.450 --> 01:45:30.480
are starting with
all conservatives,

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:32.250
the diversity of
those conversations

01:45:32.250 --> 01:45:34.140
needs to be kept in mind.

01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:36.040
- Yeah.

01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:40.040
So I am thinking, first of
all, through personal papers

01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:41.700
of particular women.

01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:46.660
Also through nonpartisan
organizations of women

01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:49.670
who-- and you might
know of some--

01:45:49.670 --> 01:45:53.510
don't identify as Republican
but might identify

01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:56.270
in more conservative terms.

01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:58.640
And you better
than anybody might

01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:02.620
know what those terms were,
even if it wasn't conservative.

01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:06.090
So, from my work, women would
call themselves patriotic.

01:46:06.090 --> 01:46:08.320
That was their word
for conservative

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:11.860
before conservatism
was a movement.

01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:14.870
And so when we
raise this question

01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:18.930
of how do you
define conservatism,

01:46:18.930 --> 01:46:21.500
you would be one
of the people that

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:25.040
could help try and identify
and set those terms.

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:28.960
Do you have any ideas of
what those terms might be?

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:31.050
- I mean, there are a
lot of different terms.

01:46:31.050 --> 01:46:34.240
I know we're short
on time, but I

01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.870
think it's worth
thinking about how

01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:40.910
some of these organizations
that identify as, like you said,

01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:44.530
patriotic or identifying
coalesce around certain issues

01:46:44.530 --> 01:46:47.660
but then argue that they're
nonpartisan or political

01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:50.600
or what have you,
are undergirded

01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:53.410
by a number of
these people that we

01:46:53.410 --> 01:46:56.300
see doing this kind of work
that, again, doesn't translate

01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:57.750
into partisanship.

01:46:57.750 --> 01:47:00.330
I also think it's
worth looking within--

01:47:00.330 --> 01:47:06.040
and that's the grassroots part--
looking at a top-down approach.

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:09.030
And so looking at how certain
policy initiatives are

01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:10.790
developed, political
initiatives,

01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:15.170
program initiatives that don't
necessarily look on their

01:47:15.170 --> 01:47:17.044
face a particular way.

01:47:17.044 --> 01:47:18.710
But when we look at
the nuts and bolts--

01:47:18.710 --> 01:47:24.240
and, again, maybe this is a plug
for the Kennedy School-- of how

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:25.980
these things are
developed, it's not

01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:27.960
that it's republican-democrat,
but instead

01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:32.806
people who are coalescing
around very specific ideas.

01:47:32.806 --> 01:47:35.430
And I do think it's important as
we think through these things.

01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:39.457
In particular, when we think
about intersectionality

01:47:39.457 --> 01:47:41.790
and when we're within this
conversation on conservatism,

01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:45.320
we tend to think of these
various racial groups.

01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:48.780
But especially amongst
this emerging conversation

01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:53.380
on LGBTQ issues and conservatism
and how they're intersecting

01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:57.410
in very different ways.

01:47:57.410 --> 01:47:59.910
- I'm going to try and
squeeze in one last question

01:47:59.910 --> 01:48:02.364
with permission from
the powers that be.

01:48:02.364 --> 01:48:03.280
- Thank you very much.

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:06.270
I'm a 45-year-old mother
of three daughters.

01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:09.300
And I want to thank
you all for this panel.

01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:13.360
I saw the billboard up on
the midst of Harvard yard,

01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:16.250
amidst my lunch
hour during work.

01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:19.890
And I'd like to speak because
abortion, I don't really think,

01:48:19.890 --> 01:48:23.300
falls between,
necessarily, party lines.

01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:27.770
Because life circumstances
can reach a vortex.

01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:33.180
And it can create a very
difficult and complex

01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:35.320
confluence of circumstances.

01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:37.660
And what I would
like to speak to

01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:41.310
is how there is a barbell
effect within abortion

01:48:41.310 --> 01:48:44.870
within our country that
no one wants to discuss.

01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:47.650
And if we're going to talk
about archival records,

01:48:47.650 --> 01:48:50.870
where are the
archives of those who

01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:52.240
have been through abortions?

01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:56.660
Because abortion in our society
is considered forbidden grief.

01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:58.850
It is not one that
can be vocalized.

01:48:58.850 --> 01:49:02.240
It is not one that you can talk
about in public with friends.

01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:07.370
It is not one that is for
open dinner discussion.

01:49:07.370 --> 01:49:12.170
It's not even one where, in
the pulpits of our churches,

01:49:12.170 --> 01:49:16.150
nationwide, our own
religious leaders

01:49:16.150 --> 01:49:20.070
feel comfortable addressing the
constituents and parishioners

01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:22.180
within our diocese.

01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:32.450
So it's a very multi-faceted
and, obviously, complex

01:49:32.450 --> 01:49:36.730
condition and
tragic circumstance.

01:49:36.730 --> 01:49:42.330
But the barbell effect, the
end result, is the same.

01:49:42.330 --> 01:49:46.680
For those abortions that
occur between 18 and 25,

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:48.930
it's usually from many
different circumstances

01:49:48.930 --> 01:49:52.070
than for those that
occur between 35 and 50.

01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:53.540
And if you study
abortions, you'll

01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:57.050
see that there's a great
number in that bracket that

01:49:57.050 --> 01:50:01.340
fall towards single women
that it's not for them.

01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:04.020
They don't want to have
a child and they're

01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:08.240
pursuing their collegiate
career and academics.

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:09.660
And then it thins out.

01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:12.200
And then you have
fetal abnormalities.

01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:15.870
You have family make-up.

01:50:15.870 --> 01:50:19.200
There can be gender
discrimination that goes on

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:23.530
within a family if it's a family
of, say, three boys or two

01:50:23.530 --> 01:50:27.700
boys or three girls and there's
an unexpected pregnancy.

01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:31.120
And these are real
issues that no one is--

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:32.600
- They are, indeed.

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:35.840
I'm just wondering if there's
one particular aspect,

01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:39.160
if it's the archival aspect,
the nature of stories

01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:41.420
and narratives about the
experience of abortion

01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:43.935
that I could just have
the panel address.

01:50:43.935 --> 01:50:44.980
Would that be the issue?

01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:45.520
- Yes.

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:49.021
I would like to know where
these archives are held.

01:50:49.021 --> 01:50:49.520
- OK.

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:52.350
Well, if I could just--
both that specific

01:50:52.350 --> 01:50:54.980
question but also more,
generally, for anyone,

01:50:54.980 --> 01:51:00.420
anyone on the panel-- I
think the issue of abortion,

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:02.990
in particular, so
much of this surface

01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:07.840
political debate coexists
with these hidden stories

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:09.400
or stories that exist.

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:11.540
In my personal
experience, I would

01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:13.780
say I encounter the
most stories of abortion

01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:18.520
either in very explicitly
feminist writing

01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:22.060
or very explicitly
regretful project,

01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:25.240
Rachel-style, pro-life writing.

01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:27.570
Those are the two
places, both of them

01:51:27.570 --> 01:51:30.820
clearly outside the
mainstream media.

01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:32.200
But, please.

01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:35.470
- And I was going to say, unless
historians can correct me,

01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:40.900
but we don't have
much documentation

01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:48.250
in US women's and gender history
on what you're talking about.

01:51:48.250 --> 01:51:50.850
There is a book coming out with
the University of California

01:51:50.850 --> 01:51:56.110
Press by Jennifer Holland on
the history of abortion crisis

01:51:56.110 --> 01:51:57.970
centers.

01:51:57.970 --> 01:52:00.430
It's not going to be out
in the next year or so.

01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:06.120
But there is coverage of much
of the experience and testimony

01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:08.240
that you're talking about.

01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:11.420
And it does fill
in some of this gap

01:52:11.420 --> 01:52:14.450
in the historical literature.

01:52:14.450 --> 01:52:17.890
But because of the
problem of the fact

01:52:17.890 --> 01:52:24.440
that we can't access medical
records where women talk

01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:26.870
about these things,
it's really only going

01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:30.070
to be in those places
where women have testified,

01:52:30.070 --> 01:52:35.940
often in intimate or
religious settings,

01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:40.200
where we can find their voices.

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:43.690
And it represents a challenge
to us as a historical community.

01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:49.130
I don't know of any
historical archival sources.

01:52:49.130 --> 01:52:50.560
And I'm--

01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:56.190
- And my question is because
do they not exist for a reason?

01:52:56.190 --> 01:52:58.910
And, secondly, I'd
like to just say

01:52:58.910 --> 01:53:02.360
that I admire the
course and topic

01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:04.950
of the paper, the dissertation,
that you have to give.

01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:10.190
And as it pertains to our
Republican-forced candidate

01:53:10.190 --> 01:53:12.680
that we all have this
upcoming election,

01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:19.440
we have life before birth and
then there's life after birth.

01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:23.750
And I would like to say that
the idea of this person taking

01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:27.100
office-- I have three
daughters that are in a very

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:29.760
diverse public school.

01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:32.660
- I appreciate it very
much, but I'm afraid

01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:35.540
that as my role as
moderator is not

01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:37.620
to end with a condemnation
of Donald Trump

01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:40.230
but to end by
thanking the panel.

01:53:40.230 --> 01:53:41.730
And thanking you
so much for raising

01:53:41.730 --> 01:53:43.260
a very important question.

01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:44.020
So thank you.

01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:46.420
And we thank the panel.

01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:48.870
Thank you all so
much for coming.
