00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:09.740
[Yawning] Where are my car keys?

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.290
Hey sleepyheads, Jules here for Dnews!

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.580
We’ve all been there.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.970
You stay up until 5am studying because you
forgot you had a final worth 60% of your grade

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.970
the next morning.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.110
Then, after just an hour or two of sleep,
you wander around in a dull haze, like you’re

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.360
drunk or something.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.750
Also you fail your final.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.980
In fact, being sleep deprived is not altogether
different from being drunk, in regards to

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.450
feeling impaired, and being unable to complete
basic tasks.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.460
One study from 2000, done by researchers from
Australia and New Zealand, took a group of

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.320
volunteers and kept them from sleeping for
up to 28 hours.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.870
Then progressively gave them a series of tests,
in areas such as cognitive demand, reaction

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.790
speed, hand-eye coordination, memory, and
perception.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.489
At another date, they got the same group of
participants drunk, first to a blood alcohol

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.239
level of .05, then to .1, and gave them the
same series of tests.

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.800
The researchers found that at around the 17
to 19-hour sleepless mark, the participants

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.590
scored similarly to when their blood alcohol
level was around 0.05, or slightly worse.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.970
Some participants even showed impairment equivalent
to 0.1, past the legal drinking limit for

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.490
driving in the United States of 0.08.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.760
What that means is if you stay up late and
decide to go for a drive, you are effectively

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.760
drunk driving.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.560
So what’s happening in your brain when you’re
sleep deprived?

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.500
Well another study from 2000 out of UC San
Diego, used fMRIs to look at sleep deprived

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.340
brains while performing verbal learning tasks.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.170
They found that the prefrontal cortex, which
is involved in personality, planning, decision

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.320
making, and social behavior, was working overtime,
lighting up much more than it would in the

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.770
brain of a person who’d had a restful night
of sleep.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.780
While it may seem counterintuitive, this higher
activity is actually a bad thing, since it

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.310
shows that the brain has to work harder to
perform the same tasks.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.300
Then they looked at the temporal lobe, which
controls your hearing, speech, and vision,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.330
as well as long term memory.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.190
In sleep deprived subjects, this part of the
brain was relatively quiet, when otherwise

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.730
it would have been lighting up in restful
subjects.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.230
If you’ve noticed, sleepy people tend to
slur their speech, not unlike drunk people,

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.380
and for both, that process is related the
temporal lobe.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.741
Meanwhile, to make up for this lack of activity,
the parietal lobe steps in, and while it also

00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:18.260
deals with sensory input, it doesn't do as
good of a job at the specific tasks the temporal

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.489
lobe deals with.

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.459
Which is why you are still able to do those
tasks, just really really poorly.

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.590
Clearly, your brain works differently when
you’re sleepy.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.220
Sleep let your brain’s neurons rest and
regain sensitivity by shutting off your neurotransmitters.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.650
To quickly explain: the neurons in your brain
are individual cells capable of communicating

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.620
information using electricity and chemicals.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.739
Some of those chemicals are called “neurotransmitters”,
including serotonin, dopamine, and histamine.

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.709
After being bombarded with chemicals all day,
your neurons lose sensitivity, which has been

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.280
proposed as the reason your brain seems to
be working more slowly, the more tired you

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.280
are.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.200
Basically, staying up past your bedtime is
pretty bad for your cognitive function, and

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200
so is drinking.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.629
That’s pretty scary, because according to
Harvard Medical School, roughly a quarter

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.269
million drivers fall asleep at the wheel every
single day.

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.099
So remember, if you’re going to be staying
up late, get yourself a designated driver.

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.560

untreated wastewater from cesspools of poop

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:16.829
are hurting coral reefs.

Sakowin camp at Standing Rock where water

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.599
protectors are standing strong after their
