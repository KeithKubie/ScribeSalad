00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.990
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.970
explore the notion
of a matrix outside

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.290
of the context of a
surprisingly good movie that

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.289
involves Keanu Reeves.

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:11.830
And it's actually
the first of three.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.250
I guess we could call the three
movies combined The Matrices.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.100
And there is a relationship
between the movie, which

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.990
is about a virtual
reality constructed

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.080
by super-smart
computers, and the notion

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.090
of what a matrix is when
you study it in mathematics,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.800
or when you study it
in computer science.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.020
And the connection
really is that matrices

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.390
are used a lot when you
are simulating things

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.770
or when you're constructing
things in computer science,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.000
especially in, frankly,
computer graphics.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.740
So the super-intelligent
robots that

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.610
made the matrix in
the movie Matrix

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.230
were probably using
matrices in order to do it,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.500
if they actually did exist.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.460
Now, what is a matrix then?

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.640
Well, that's a
fairly simple answer.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.330
It's just a rectangular
array of numbers.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.170
So for example, this
right over here.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.470
If I have 1, 0, negative 7,
pi, 5, and-- I don't know-- 11,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.670
this is a matrix.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.570
This is a matrix where 1, 0,
negative 7, pi-- each of those

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.310
are an entry in the matrix.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.450
This matrix right over
here has two rows.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.680
And it has three columns.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.290
And because it has two
rows and three columns,

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.660
people will often say that
this is a 2 by 3 matrix.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.470
Whenever they say it's
something by something matrix,

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.370
they're telling you that it has
two rows-- so you see the two

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.790
rows right over there.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.820
And they are telling you
that it has three columns.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.010
You see the three
columns right over there.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.580
I could give you other
examples of a matrix.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.270
So I could have a 1 by 1 matrix.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.360
So I could have the matrix 1.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.930
This right over here
is a 1 by 1 matrix.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.860
It has one row, one column.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.450
I could have a matrix
like this-- 3, 7, and 17.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.870
What is this?

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.539
Well, this has one row.

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.080
This is the one row
that we see here.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.820
And it has three columns.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.509
This is a 1 by 3 matrix.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.050
I could have a matrix-- and I
think you see where all of this

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.919
is going.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.950
Figuring out the dimensions of
a matrix are not too difficult.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.230
I could have a matrix that looks
like this, where it's 3, 5, 0,

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.850
0, negative 1, negative 7.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.450
This right over
here has three rows.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.910
So it's three rows,
and it has two columns.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.340
So we would call this a 3 by 2.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.150
Let me do that in
that same color.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.490
We would call it a 3
by 2 matrix, three rows

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.115
and two columns.

00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:46.740
So fair enough.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.441
You know that a matrix is just
a rectangular array of numbers.

00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:52.940
You can say what
its dimensions are.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.910
You know that each
of these numbers that

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.569
take one of these positions--
we just call those entries.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.860
But what are matrices good for?

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.780
I still might not be
clear what the connection

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.040
is between this and
this right over here.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.180
And at the most
fundamental level,

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.860
this is just a
compact representation

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.780
of a bunch of numbers.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.730
It's a way of
representing information.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.950
They become very valuable
in computer graphics

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.750
because these numbers could
represent the color intensity

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.572
at a certain point.

00:03:18.572 --> 00:03:20.530
They could represent
whether an object is there

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.590
at a certain point.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.662
And as we develop an
algebra around matrices,

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:25.495
and when we talk about
developing an algebra

00:03:25.495 --> 00:03:27.777
around matrices, we're going
to talk about operations

00:03:27.777 --> 00:03:30.360
that we're going to perform on
matrices that we would normally

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.470
perform with numbers.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.790
So we're going to
essentially define

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.040
how to multiply matrices,
how to add matrices.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.010
We'll learn about taking
an inverse of a matrix.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.630
And by coming up with an
algebra of how we manipulate

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.319
these things, it'll
become very useful

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.860
in the future when you're trying
to write a computer graphics

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.090
program or you're trying to
do an economic simulation

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.530
or a probability
simulation, to say, oh,

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.531
I have this matrix
that represents where

00:03:55.531 --> 00:03:56.905
different particles
are in space.

00:03:56.905 --> 00:03:58.510
Or I have this matrix
that represents

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.840
the state of some
type of a game.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.670
And I know the
algebra of matrices.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.770
And I know ways of doing
it very efficiently

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.590
so that I can multiply
a bunch of them.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.040
Or I could come
run a simulation,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.420
and I can actually come
up with useful results.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.740
So that's all matrices are.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.010
But as you'll see
through this, we

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.790
can define operations on them.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.019
And then later on, when
you take a linear algebra

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.940
course in college, you'll
learn a lot more of the depth

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.490
of how they can be
applied and what

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.527
you can use them to represent.
