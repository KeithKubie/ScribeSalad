00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.430
&gt;&gt; Hi YouTube. This has been the most fascinating
conference. In a way however sounded for uncertainty

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.400
because in terms of where the economy is going
on the world wide basis, we still have some

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.790
major moans and I think that when we come
to London with the conference in London, the

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.910
economic conference in April will be able
to hopefully advance our state of knowledge.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.470
The one thing that's important even in this
time of great uncertainty is the sense of

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.480
values, every part of the store is maintained.
That we go back to our companies and emphasize

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.480
the importance of real moral values, moral
obligation to the community at large. That's

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.890
what we must do out of here. When we go to
London we hopefully, we take our views of

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.940
the economy and end the recession further.
