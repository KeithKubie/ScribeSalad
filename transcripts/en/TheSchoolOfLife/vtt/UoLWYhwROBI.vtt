00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:08.940
We’re not talking about the extreme, most paralysing, regions of despair – where external medical help is vital.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.020
Our target is rather the times when we feel

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.500
– as indicated by Thoreau’s phrase –

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.860
mired in moods of ‘quiet desperation’:

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.160
a large, grey hinterland in which beneath an outward surface of endurance,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.220
we feel exhausted, close to tears, beyond the sympathetic understanding of others,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.820
easily irritated and daunted by the simplest tasks.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.120
There will probably have been certain triggers for our melancholy:

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.960
an intimate rejection;

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.040
a humiliation around work;

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.280
the growing realisation that the ambitious plans of earlier years have come to very little...

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.500
Unfortunately, sadness feels very taboo.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.440
Societies tend slyly to insist on cheerfulness.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.960
We end up not only struggling, but humiliated that we are in such difficulties.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.240
Yet, in truth, there is nothing more natural or routine than grief.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.880
We have so much to feel morose about:

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.960
simply by virtue of being alive, we will inevitably so often feel badly misunderstood,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.580
unfairly criticised, overlooked and rejected.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.520
We will be struck by our own stupidity and appalled by our inner ugliness and cowardice.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.080
We will make some shockingly poor decisions,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.660
we will let others down

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.520
- and will witness those we love suffer and die before ourselves having to give up the keys to life.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.520
The reasons for feeling low and demoralised touch more or less every one.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:49.760
It is the universality – the normality – of suffering that makes the sight of small happy children so poignant;

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.300
we know, as they cannot yet, how much they are going to suffer

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.320
– we don’t know the precise details

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.720
but we know that in some way or another a distinctive range of horrors will, in time, befall them.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.100
Every day, almost without noticing it, we have to fight off a range of incoming powerful reasons not to despair.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.560
We rely on an internal engine or muscle of hope to pump out consoling thoughts.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.000
Then one day the task seems too much; the muscle can’t take it any more.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.220
At such times, we need to keep a few ideas in mind:

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.760
For a start, that sorrow is not an individual failing;

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.140
it is a basic reality for our entire species.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.380
We are so extremely sensitive, such fragile constructions, constantly exposed to danger;

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.620
for the most part blind, hopeful without regard to reality and with unquenchable needs for love and sympathy.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:58.340
Our tribulations are a symptom of being human, never just a curse attached to our sliver of existence.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.180
Others, who might seem successful, buoyant and composed will travel, at moments they shield us from,

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.580
to the same places of despair we have been exiled to.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:18.180
We live so close to ourselves, we know so much about our private failings, we miss that our flaws are general:

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.320
present even in the outwardly placid, the beautiful, the rich, and the people next door.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.180
If only we could see into their minds, we would feel so much less alone.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.820
We are, it’s true, sometimes hard to be around.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.220
We’re easy to caricature as grumpy and a pain.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.020
But in truth, we’re sad rather than mean, anxious rather than bad.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.060
It’s hard to make our despair sound charming,

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.300
to present ourselves in the way that would win us the compassion we so require.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.160
Yet we’re being harder on ourselves than we would be on a friend.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:00.640
We should – at the least – accord ourselves the same degree of forgiveness we wouldn’t hesitate to direct to an acquaintance.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.480
In the end, however tempting it is, we can’t just abandon our lives.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.840
There are too many people who rely on us (even if their presence doesn’t feel real right now).

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.880
Above all, we don’t know the future.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.860
It’s the other side of our dependence on chance.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.300
Things can get slightly better for reasons it’s hard to foresee.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.740
Just as pleasures fade and can seem meaningless in retrospect,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.280
so pains (at least sometimes) can pass or soften.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.780
Things we thought we’d never be able to get over gradually become bearable;

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.580
we adjust our mental posture, we stoop to accommodate a new reality.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.160
Being miserable does not exclude us from the human community.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.180
It’s a sure sign that we are very normal

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.300
- and that life is progressing, in its own dark way, more or less exactly to plan.
