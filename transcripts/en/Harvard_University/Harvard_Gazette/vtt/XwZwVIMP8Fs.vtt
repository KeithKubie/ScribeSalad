mindfulness is really the practice of
being aware of what's going on in the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.750
moment
some people add you know without judging

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.480
it so just really observing and then the
practice of meditation is a more you

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.380
know kind of structured disciplined
practice often with some kind of an

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:39.690
anchor where you're resting attention
the breath or something like that

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.750
in some specific conditions the evidence
is a little bit stronger on the effects

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.230
of mindfulness meditation and those are
depression anxiety and chronic pain

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.370
the idea behind mindfulness based
cognitive therapy is that by training

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.050
people in mindfulness meditation we
increase their capacity for inter

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.420
reception and for being able to listen
to their body so to speak and to drop in

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.979
the body and that will actually help
them disengage from this cognitive

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.890
rumination with negative thoughts about
self

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.250
we're testing these hypotheses in the
brain by looking at the brain networks

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.229
that are involved and having people do
specific tasks in the scanner to test if

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.040
they engage in these tests differently
after having received the mindfulness

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.000
training

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.910
the purpose of this research is to find
out the mechanisms of mindfulness

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.310
training in the brain and from that
information hopefully make some changes

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.380
to the intervention that take those
mechanisms into account for example

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.070
doing more of certain types of practices
if we think these are the ones that are

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.330
key and perhaps doing less of other
aspects of the mindfulness training if

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.640
science finds that these elements don't
actually have so much of an impact I

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.030
think you kind of have this daily
practice so that as you go about your

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.260
day you're able to be mindful and
present or notice when you're not

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:24.939
because it's nobody does it 100%
