00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.040
MARTY: I'm going to predict
that it is pre-1840.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.330
NARRATOR: Marty Lagina joins
his son Alex and his friend

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.540
and business
partner Craig Tester

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.120
as they travel some
50 miles northeast

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.540
to Saint Mary's University
in the city of Halifax.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.790
Thanks, Craig.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.290
NARRATOR: They are
eager to find out

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.580
if the antique brooch that
was discovered on Lot 21

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.750
is, in fact, partially
made of gold.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.920
Dr. Brosseau.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.170
Nice to see you, Christa.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.420
Welcome down to
the microscope lab.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.170
Xiang.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.040
Hi.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.830
Nice to see you again.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.580
Nice seeing you.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.250
Hi, how are you?

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.710
We have something here that
I think you're going find

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.250
quite interesting, actually.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.880
A piece of jewelry of some sort.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.540
And I'll let--

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.540
NARRATOR: Dr. Christa Brosseau
is an associate professor

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.040
of chemistry with
expertise in the field

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.080
of electoral
chemistry, as well as

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.500
the study of metals and
their chemical compositions.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.500
Today, she is joined by your
colleague Dr. Xiang Yang.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.380
CHRISTA: Very nice.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.080
MARTY: Pretty, isn't it?

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.380
CHRISTA: Yeah.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.880
MARTY: The brooch
was found this year.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.380
And we've had it looked at
by a gemologist already.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.290
And it did appear that there
were places that had gold.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.380
CHRISTA: OK.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.920
Where did you guys find this?

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.620
MARTY: Kind of the
western end of the island.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.290
CHRISTA: It's in
really good condition.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.960
Have a look, and we'll
see what your machine says.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.120
NARRATOR: Using a high-powered
scanning electron microscope,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.040
doctors Brosseau
and Xiang will be

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.040
able to magnify the brooch
up to tens of thousands

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.580
of times its actual size.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.960
They also will be able
to examine its chemical

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.420
composition and determine
whether it's made of gold

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.960
or any other precious metals.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.040
Should be good.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.290
So the dark area
here is pure copper.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.960
That's interesting.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.000
But the bright area?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.290
Yeah.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.170
Gold.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.790
That's gold.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.790
Well, how about that?

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.580
Gary can go do his gold dance.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.960
He found some gold.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.500
You've definitely struck gold.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.960
MARTY: Yeah, I guess
I'd have to say

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.330
that's the first piece
of verified gold found

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.500
on the island.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.580
ALEX: It's a first
for us, right?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.420
It's a first for us, for sure.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.670
I think this would be
considered actual treasure.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.000
- Yeah.
- OK.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.080
Yeah.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.290
MARTY: Well, here's the deal.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.500
We've found treasure
on Oak Island.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.500
Yeah.
We did.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.460
Woo-hoo.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.170
MARTY: Woo-hoo, woot-woot.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.580
And we've proven it right
here in this lab today.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.460
Excellent.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.290
So that's pretty cool.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.380
It's not bad.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.380
I mean, yeah.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.210
That's a pretty good day.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.120
[chuckles]

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.790
MARTY: The brooch that
was found this year

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.790
is motivating and
exciting because it's

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.500
a real piece of treasure.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.620
You just can't deny that.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.000
It's a piece of treasure
in the elaborate setting

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.500
found on Oak Island.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.540
This is just the
tip of the iceberg.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.120
There's more that
awaits us this year.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.960
Now we need to bring
in the mother lode.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.040
Yeah.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.790
Thank you very
much, as always.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.170
Xiang, a pleasure.
- Congratulations.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.540
I'm going to think
up all kinds of things

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.540
to put in that machine.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.830
NARRATOR: Returning to the
island later that afternoon,

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.290
Marty Lagina calls a
meeting in the war room.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.040
He is eager to share the
exciting news with his brother

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.750
Rick and members of their team

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.500
Guys, I am freshly back
from Saint Mary's University.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.420
Craig and Alex and I
went up there, and I--

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.670
I shouldn't be excited about
this, really, in a sense.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.540
But I am, because--

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.500
David-- this little
gem has gold on it.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.000
[chuckles]

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.380
MARTY: We have found our
first gold on Oak Island.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.750
DAVE: I want more
gold than that.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.920
Well-- come on, man.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.380
Small victories, right?

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.880
NARRATOR: For Rick,
Marty, and their team,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.250
the discovery of an actual
piece of golden treasure

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.750
is a momentous development in
the 223-year history of the Oak

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.620
Island treasure hunt.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.540
It is also a major step
forward in their quest

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.250
to prove that something
of even greater value

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.920
may have been buried
here centuries ago.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.460
MARTY: So we have this
brooch, which could be a lot

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.540
older than we ever thought.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.790
We have the lead cross,
not mined in North America.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.620
So these artifacts are pushing
us back farther in time

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.290
than I ever thought
we would see here.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.120
We're finding answers.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.120
Way back.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.750
Way back.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.790
NARRATOR: As far as Rick,
Marty, and their partners

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.580
are concerned, as close as
they are to getting answers,

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.290
the 223-year-old
Oak Island treasure

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.790
hunt has only just begun.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.620
So, guys, you're up to speed.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.170
You all have all the data.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.830
We've discussed where
this might lead.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.670
I think we should get
back to actual work.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.170
Let's go.
