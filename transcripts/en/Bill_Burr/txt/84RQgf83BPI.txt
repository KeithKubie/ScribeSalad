Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? Is Bill Burn? It's time for the Monday morning podcast. I no, what is it? What am I talking about? It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast at [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:00:14       Huh. Huh? I'm just checking in on you. I'm just checking in to see how your Goddamn Day is going. I know lately the podcast has been a little bit quiet. I understand. All right. I was transitioning from one part of the country to another part of the country. I didn't have my, my technologies with me. Uh, speaking of technology now these fucking movies that I want to see right now and I just don't have the God damn time. I want to see that Mr. Rogers movie. I want to see mission impossible and I want to see a, there was some movie called eighth grade where they were like, this is what it's like to be an eighth grader in the, during the social media time. I'm like, oh, I should see that. You know, cause I need to relate to some sorts, Pete young people. So my jokes keep working with them.

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       I mean, not eighth graders, but you know, in a blink of an eye, the way I'm aging, that kid will be in fucking college, right? You can't ignore the youth, the ignore the you, you grow old with your fucking crowd. And then next thing you know, you're doing shows at three in the afternoon on a little fucking booze cruise going around the marina, you know, five foot two wiser blue, but oh, what those five foots could do you singing that song. Hey had a body, Shane mind. Yeah, right up there in some fucking mustard stain tuxedos yelling at your agent players to sell tickets at this town. They ain't happen to make. Um, I'll tell you what did happen to me. This is very embarrassing and it's of a physical nature. It's a part of my body. And this is a time when I feel everybody has been emoting and, and we've gotten rid of the shame.

Speaker 1:          00:02:03       So I just wanted it. Before I tell you this, I just want to thank all of you for being considerate and thoughtful of my feelings during this difficult time. All right. So my, my sciatic nerves came back. Oh, it came back with a vengeance because I didn't keep going to them as suits to keep fucking making sure you know, that, you know, whatever the fuck happened the first time didn't happen again and it got all messed up again. And uh, we were trying to figure out what triggers it and I'm like, well, flying helicopters, you know, I fly the smallest one that exists, so this, there's nothing about it that's has to do with comfort and all has to do with weight and balance and get in the fucking thing off the ground. As long as you can sit down, they don't give a shit if you're on a bed of nails.

Speaker 1:          00:02:52       And I think it's just maybe that, that's what's aggravating it. She's like, all right, what else you got? I played drums. I'll sit there for an hour, an hour and a trying to figure out how that cute little Asian girl played good times, bad times, so easily, effortlessly, right. What else do I sit in a writer's room? I fly in planes and all that type of shit. And she goes, all right. And she was listening to and she just basically told me and, uh, you know, debt. My problem is, is I have no ass all over the years. I've just sat down so long, what little ass I had is now gone. So a bill, Billy, no Goop, no glucose, right? Is Al Pachino would say he's got no ass. Right? So it's just, it's just essentially bones, nerves, veins, atoris in skin. There's no muscle tone back there.

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       I basically have Michael Douglas's ass in basic instinct, whatever that one was, where he was like fucking 65 and decided to do the yet. Remember that was like a big thing with like white guys back then, be it happy in an old guy and just showing your ass Dennis Franz on fucking Nyp de Bleu, fucking, uh, Michael Douglas and basic end state, one of those movies where he was just fucking throw in chicks around, which you could never do anymore. Like it was, he was beating them and fucking them at the same time. And I'll tell you the bride's back in the day, they loved it. It was considered a hot seat. Now a days off. Oh Jesus. What was that couch made of? Dead. He bent her over. Was that fucking made of ostrich for that's offensive to women in nature, right?

Speaker 2:          00:04:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       Now I don't know what you do. I don't know. I haven't seen a love seat in this new progressive time.

Speaker 1:          00:04:51       I imagine the guy is sitting there with his hands folded Eq skills base. Would it be alright if I leaned across the table and got a little closer? Do you? Hi, I'm offended. Um, anyways, what am I talking about here? Oh, so I have to do some fucking squats, you know, and I got a bone bruise. I'm falling apart here. People. I've got a bone bruise on my left knee because, uh, my beautiful daughter, or I'm loving as I'm teaching her how to play catch. And we got this giant bag of these plastic balls, right? And I think she's right handed, which I'm not gonna lie to you. I want her to be a lefty. You're a lefty. You can get to the show with an 85 mile an hour fast ball. We all know it. Okay? You start throwing right handed. You gotta come with the guests.

Speaker 1:          00:05:35       It's gotta be fuck it. I don't know. It's gotta be like fucking 102 miles an hour at this point. So anyways, she just, she'll pick up two at a time and then she runs at me and just throws them both at the same time. And I just play like goalie and we got hard wood floors and I was crawling around on the hardwood on my knees and uh, I dunno. I, I thought I fucking towards something, but thank God. Yesterday I found out it's just a bone bruise so it's going away. But um, yeah, so here's a big deal. I got it. I have to go on the Internet and I got to make sure I do my squats right. Okay. And I have to get my pasty flat ass. I gotta get some padding back. There are, evidently this is going to, it's going to become even worse. You know what I mean? I've decided that I'm going to get fucking, uh, um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ass back. I've decided that rather than be that old white guy who has the inflatable cushion that he fucking sits on, I can't be that guy. You know what I mean? Taking people up in a helicopter, like looking like a Badass, like, hang on a second, guys just fucking may know. Everybody just loses all confidence. Does this guy know how to fly this fucking thing? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       anyways, uh, that's my deal. You know, and I'm also a child of the 80s and you know who's kidding who? Let's all be honest. Nobody did legs in the fucking eighties unless she wrote bodybuilder. Everybody just, you barely even did your back. You know, everybody was just fucking, everybody just did like, what are your benching? What's your bent? Dodi put up to 25 fucking 36 times.

Speaker 2:          00:07:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:22       Kay could try out for the patch stowed. Right. That's all it was about. And it was, I'll tell you, you go to a fucking gym, all right? And if you have to bench, if you're waiting for the [inaudible] going to stand there like a line at Starbucks at like eight in the fucking morning waiting to get on the bench. But I'll tell you where there's no fucking, I'll tell you right now with, there's no line. You go into the leg room. Oh my God. It's like walking into a furniture store. Go ahead buddy. Try them all out. See which one you like. Right? It's like going into lightened leisure. The purple building. Does that play still exist? Um, I'm making a lot of Boston references and you probably like, why bill? Are you a Ho? Oh, you fucking cunt.

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       The battery thing just fucking beat. Are you fucking kidding me? I swear to God. I just can't get a God damn fucking break. I'm just going to talk to, this runs out, I guess in 43 seconds. 42 seconds. I'm talking Boston ship because the uh, the Yankees, oh, when they're Yankees come to town. The Red Sox Yankees stats tonight and prices and in judges out, right? But all they're missing is a hitter were mentioned missing our star pitcher. And I needed that guy cause I got, I got a hundred bucks riding on every game with these two different Yankee fans. 50 bucks each. I need a price to go in there and shut those fucking pin. Stripe comes down. Now we don't have our and and uh, not price with the fuck am I talking about? Uh, the other guy, their prices. The Guy I need not to fuck up.

Speaker 1:          00:09:06       All right, I'm back. You know what? It wasn't a battery issue. It was, the memory was full full of me running my fucking Yap. I'm sitting there saying, prices out a sale is out. Is it Chris Sale? I've only been on the bandwagon here for the last month. He's out. He said he had something that's been building something that's been bothering him. You know what'd you get your period? Um, he can't play fucking a Mike Judge. Aaron judge is out for the Yankees, right? He's standing there like a fucking Paul Bunyan. I mean, how do you not hit the guy? I mean, Jesus Christ, he's like the size of the goddamned backstop, got a bone chip in the palm of his hand. He's an amazing a guy that that fucking pig, all you have to do is throw ball in his hands and all of a sudden he can't play a game of baseball. I mean, you're talking about a guy who could literally rip the pillars out of the fucking parking lot, you know, but then you hit him in the hand. He's like, how am I going to play Patty cake? I can't come out for the red sox series, but you know, that is the history of the Yankees. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:10:12       You know, they got a lot of free agent guys and they're all really soft, just like a, all their fans out in the bleachers. All those fatties out there that do the roll call. Like that's the big thing in life fe area and wave at us, those neck fat fucking jerk offs out there. Um, it's unbelievable that you can have a team that, that's, that's successful, that they would, they would, uh, be involved in something. Well, I just don't get it. I don't get the fucking why MCA. I don't get why we have a fucking mascot. I don't get why we sing sweet Caroline. I don't, you know what it is that they're trying to get rid of the animals. You know what I mean? I mean, the Yankees fence, they borderline doing a fucking musical. I thought it was an advertisement for that. What was that show they had all those years? Uh, with the puppets avenue Q. That's what I thought it was. I was looking at the scoreboard. Guns are coming out of that. No, those are full grown adult males. A tow yard. We'll you fuckers by fuel. Would you roll call lunch. I got to charge up. Get aligned. We're going to say your name until you acknowledge us. And I know I'm coming down hard on the Yankee fence. I realized this is not all of you guys. This is he fucking 12% of you, um, with your little gang of baseball fans.

Speaker 1:          00:11:42       But as much as I do that, I don't think anything's worse than watch should fucking do, but do Buddo Dubar too. When that song comes on and you see all those women putting their head on their boyfriend,

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:11:57       That right there, that moment there is why women in general are not in positions of power. They sit there, they try to blame guys specifically bald, blue eyed white males like myself, which by the way, I'm really offended. Okay. I mean, and I got to tell you something right now. If I hear one more feminist interrupting my privilege during the day, me just walking through one open door after another and I have to listen to her fucking rhetoric. I swear to God I am. I am going to, I will pull all of my money out of the stock market and cause it to crash money that I didn't earn money that was given to me from my ancestors by stealing it from people who did not look like me. Okay. Sorry, I'm just steering into the stereotype.

Speaker 3:          00:12:51       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       Oh really? Bill, we thought you were fucking serious. Uh, what am I talking about here? This is why women, so many of them do not attain a position of power because all you have to do is put on sweet Caroline and it makes them want to tilt their head and put it on their man's shoulder. Okay? That is not leadership quality.

Speaker 3:          00:13:12       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:13:13       That's just what the fuck I would do if I was running a company right now and God knows it be all this fucking pressure as the guy who started the company to step aside and let a woman run it so you can act like you're fucking progressive. You know what I mean? Where are the ladies when it's all being built? They're nowhere to be found then when it's built, we want it now that you completed it. We want to fly planes too. Now that all the guys died and we figured out what not to fucking dope. No offense to Amelia Earhart, the chick that fucking, uh, also crushed it, but for some reason nobody talks about it.

Speaker 3:          00:13:55       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       I want to talking about, I'm just fucking around everybody. I have no problem with people of Eddie. Fuck it back. [inaudible] but, um, where am I? Let me, uh, let me, let me complete this. I have to do a fucking radio tour for two hours starting at eight minutes. And how long have I done in the podcast? Is it going to work out with a math workout? Nine and five or 14 son of a bitch. I still got half a podcast to go. I'm gonna have to wait till the end of this shit. Um, Oh bill, why are you doing a radio tour? Because I'm promoting rough and rowdy going to be in Youngstown, Ohio. All right. There's no women. They're putting their heads on their guy's shoulder. They put their head in their ear to the guy's chest after they hit him with a fucking pen and make sure it's fucking heart's still pumping.

Speaker 1:          00:14:45       Okay. I'm talking a tough town and Youngstown. It's going to be great. We got pride verse prejudiced. All right. We have a gay man who's fighting a convicted felon who does not like gay people. All right? We got a cop fighting a skateboarder and then we've got a bunch of Cleveland Brown fans getting in the ring with Pittsburgh Steeler fans. Now, God knows the browns cannot beat the Steelers on the grid iron, but can the people of Cleveland beat up the people of Pittsburgh? Now you'd think generally speaking, the people of Pittsburgh are a little softer than the people in Cleveland. All right? They have six super bowl titles. They haven't had a fucking steel mill in generations out there. Okay, I've gone there. It's a tech city now. All right? They got all the beautiful bridges. They got rid of three rivers. That team plays on natural grass now. I mean, it's one of the quaintness towns you'll ever go to. Nobody can walk up this fucking hill. So they've got a goddamn elevator trolley thing that brings you up. I think Pittsburgh is ripe for the taking

Speaker 1:          00:15:51       and uh, go to rough and rowdy brawl to order the fight. I'm telling you right now, hang with your recorded or hanging that night with your buddies. Watch it. It's going to be, I will be commentating. Forgot to mention that. That says a little cherry in there that I just throw. Okay. A little fucking sugar cube. Oh, freckles. We'll be sitting down on his lack of an ass evidently. And uh, I'll be there with the big cat in the El Pres. Uh, two wonderful individuals, you know, who are preventing a lot of bar fights. I feel, I feel like, um, people with headgear and gloves are going to be able to get all their frustrations out. It's going to be a wonderful night of entertainment. I am not going to miss a second of it. And um, you know, I would appreciate if you guys would order it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:37       It would make me look good if I could help pump up their fucking numbers. I love what they do over there. I hope you do too. If you do, please order the fight and that's the end of this promo. How do you like that? And right the day before the fucking fight, I'm going to be in Rochester, New York home, Steve Gadd, or at least he played with the Rochester Crusaders according to his, according to his drum instructional video of that I actually own on VHS and on DVD. All right. I never could commit to the laser disc. I was afraid of unpopular technologies. After Robert Kelly talked me into getting a mini disc player, which I still have with the t shaped microphone. I can't find the chat, but I have all these little fucking cassettes of, uh, you know what happened? Many cds of my sets from years gone by and I want to listen to them. And people are like, well, why don't you take him somewhere? It's like, cause I have no idea what I'm saying on these fucking things, right. I used to mutter to myself between sets, thrown out all kinds of crazy shit and in this fucking today's climate, God knows what, what the, the shit you said fucking I'm, when we're at 20 years ago,

Speaker 4:          00:17:52       I mean, 20 years ago I was dating this woman. I used to literally drag around the city by her hair and nobody had a problem with it. Okay. You think I'm going to dump off my fucking mini disc player to somebody's Yeti mind?

Speaker 1:          00:18:04       It's not happening. All right. Anyways, so I am a, hey, by the way, guess what? I made another month, month of July, not a drop of booze. Not One fucking drop. You got damn cuts and uh, it really affected my mood. I was in such a good mood when I would wake up in the morning, but I was so grumpy at night, you know, just having to sit there and fucking stare at the wall.

Speaker 1:          00:28:35       comedy. Um, Megan, why don't, why am I hyping his Goddamn Instagram page? What does Joe de Rosa ever done for me? Other bench other than being being a pal for the less fucking 15 years. Um, all right. What the what to talk about? I was just promoting rough and rowdy by the way. The cop first to skateboarder, that fight is actually, that one's called pig verse punk. So you get pride verse prejudice, pig verse punk Ed. Uh, where could you go from there, Paul Luca versus [inaudible] it old boxer fight. Say a politician. That could be a good one. They should have just sort of an uh, an endless ones with, with the letter P. Huh? You could have a, somebody with a bladder problem. Peer Verse Poor. Go with a bladder problem. Fight somebody who's a economically in the shit. I don't know. Okay. Maybe there's not an endless one. I Dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:29:44       Maybe I'm wrong. I'm just spit balling here people, that's all I'm trying to do. Just spit balling. So anyways, I got to, uh, I'm going to go see a nutritionist for the first time ever tomorrow and uh, I'm going to get that taken care of. I did the lat pull down machine 70 fucking pounds. Gradually I'm putting it back together the way it really happens. Not like on Dr Phil where he's like, yeah, oh yeah. Or Nay to stop punching her in the fight. And like somebody who I would actually, yeah, punching a in the face. The fact that he said that like it's going to get rid of everything that he saw as a child in that moment on Dr Phil, stand out works. That's going to be, it's going to take that guy an entire lifetime to stop punching women in the face or shooting heroin or jacking off in public whatever the fuck it is he stealing.

Speaker 1:          00:30:33       Right, but not all Philly. Philly makes it seem like he solves it. Right then in there with the little fucking catch phrase is some bullshit. That's why, you know, back in the day when I used to watch police academy and I would see private hooks number, the cute little black girl, you know what I mean? It should be all mousy. Like, yeah, he hit that guy again, the guy you got to get a scream and then in the end she get her nerve up and she jumped out of nowhere with a gun out and she goes, don't move dirt bag. And then you'd see police academy to when she'd go back to being this little mousy person again. You're like, what the fuck? That's bad writing. That's what I thought. That's lazy, you're going to have to do the exact same arc all the way to don't move dirt bag again.

Speaker 1:          00:31:14       And I used to think that that was lazy writing, but now having tried to, to fix, to control my temper, flip out, be like, I don't want to do that again. And then I'm fucking, you know, working on or working on or working on and I'm, I'm good for three weeks and then I, I have a relapse. You know, private hooks is one of the most accurate characters ever, ever written because you seeing somebody trying, they have a breakthrough and you think, is this it that I finally break through? And then, uh, nope, it was just a blip. Now you're going back to being mousy again. And she had to work on it through like 1819 police academies. And I don't know if she ever got there, but I think we all could relate simply by the fact that she was just out there trying.

Speaker 1:          00:32:02       There you go. So that's nine minutes. Nine minutes in 13 minutes. That's 31 minutes. Jesus Christ. People, I think I'm done here. I'm back up to regular volumes. Tune into the red sox, Yankees. Do you want to check that out? Um, but definitely this Sunday, man, make me look good. Make it seem like I drove some traffic to this wonderful event. Go to rough and rowdy brawl.com to watch pride verse prejudice. Pig first punk and Cleveland Brown fans trying to do with the browns have never done on the, which is beat something from Pittsburgh. Ah, Bell. Why did you have to be mean? Because you know what? It makes people listen. All right. Enjoy

Speaker 7:          00:32:48       music. And then we'll have another half hour of greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon podcast just before Friday.

Speaker 8:          00:34:10       like a boss.

Speaker 4:          00:34:12       It's like the beginning of fucking $6 million man. You know when that little fucking kite that he's flying, why don't they ever show that fucking show in reruns? That's one of the greatest goddamn shows ever. Do you guys ever see that? Do you have any idea how fucking huge it was when the $6 million man fought the $7 million man

Speaker 2:          00:34:39       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:34:39       and he punched his fucking face off his face came off

Speaker 2:          00:34:47       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:34:48       on television in like 1974 do you have any fucking idea? Think about that. Pre Internet, pre cable, pre any sorta special that you look how bad the graphics were in Star Wars.

Speaker 9:          00:35:00       The adjustments between frames of all the tiny moving parts are minuscule but projected at the proper speed. 24 frames per second. These individual movements will flow seamlessly together. [inaudible] actually models which can be carried in the palm of your hand.

Speaker 4:          00:35:19       So this is like three, four years before that Lee Majors Punch this dude who was the fucking bad guy and everything. Oh Man. Do you remember the one with the $6 million man fought? Fought in the snow? Yeah. Your first Karen as an expert and a French art I'll set up outside that mansion. They had everybody in slow motion in that black dude jumped like 10 feet in the air was going to kick him. He's gone flying through the fucking air.

Speaker 2:          00:35:59       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:35:59       well you got to stand how sheltered I was as a kid. I didn't even know who Bruce Lee was. I didn't even know what Kung Fu fighting was and I didn't realize that TV shows were ripping off, you know, enter the dragon and all that shit that people were flipping out about. Cause I was just a little kid. So I saw that shit. I, it was the most unbelievable thing ever. He fought big foot. He fought a black Bruce Lee and he fought the $7 million man and he punched his fucking face off and a tele. They just don't, they don't make, it's impossible to compete now. There's just, they've just done too many things. You know, it's kind of like when you go to write a movie script and like, oh, everything's been done and they act like all these guys back in the forties and fifties were brilliant.

Speaker 4:          00:36:41       It's like fuck you. There was only like five movies where ever made, how hard was it to be brilliant back then? It's like inventing shit and eat and the 1800 oh look, it's a coat hanger. You can hang your coat on it. Holy Shit. Let's put his name in the history books. Everyone can fucking remember this for the rest of the time. I don't even know what you could event. You always great. It's still inventing a simple shit. Is that Billy Mays guy? You know that bear did fuck every night. He just starts swab. Billy Mays, I, Billy Mays here for the Jupiter Jack the most can be in hands free device for any cell phone guaranteed. That dude, he doesn't even event the shit. I think he invented like three things and then he's just got a sweat shop of like smart fucking kids from Thailand. He just comes walking in.

Speaker 4:          00:37:29       I keep borrowing and myself on the iron. Come up with some shit. Then like three weeks later he's on TV up. Billy Mays. Are you doing tired of burn their hair off your forearm or your art in your button down? Cause your third marriage didn't work out and you still have to date in your 50s hey drug dosing, the fucking thing you stick in front of the iron that doesn't burn your forearm but still irons the fucking shirt. Um, anyways. Oh let me get, let me get back to this thing. Sorry. Huh? See like that. There you go. I want to stand up. Mo gave you some fucking laughs. Okay. And his left eye. What does his I do, it's like a zoom lens on a camera. A Zoom Lens. Amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:38:35       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:38:50       it's like a boss. So anybody watch 60 minutes. This past week they did a, they did this feature and that feature on mountain lions and now California is the only state that has mountain lions. Just walking around.

Speaker 10:         00:39:10       Los Angeles ended suburbs are home to 19 million people, the only mega city in the world where mountain lions, also known as cougars and Pumas live side by side with humans. For 13 years, the national park service has been studying the animal.

Speaker 4:          00:39:27       Uh, I'm going to fuck this up in a, in a park, I guess maybe the size of like Griffith Park or Runyon Canyon or, or whatever those ones are out in, uh, out in the valley.

Speaker 10:         00:39:40       P 22 wanders the hills of Griffith Park, a small enclave in Los Angeles, frequented by hikers and visitors to the parks. Famed Observatory.

Speaker 4:          00:39:51       I guess they have these fucking things. And um, so anyways, I was watching it because a few of the places where I hike with my dog and this thing has intermittently this, this, this group of fucking mountain lions has been around there. But fortunately they, they try to avoid you, I guess

Speaker 10:         00:40:08       a trail camera caught this one. A stone's throw from the rooftops of suburbia.

Speaker 4:          00:40:14       And these animals do their best to, you know, stay elusive and away from us. Um, at least during the day if they're not fucking hungry. But they showed this fucking, uh, these people, these mountain lion, right. Okay. They were having some work done. So they had somebody going underneath the house into the crawl space of their house and they all ran up against this park and the guy went down there and he immediately came back up and he was fucking like white as a ghost and they were like a dawn, the A's, you know, fucking white people trying to speak Spanish. Right. Oh eight. Um, is it French? I don't know. Um, and a guy comes out of the fucking hole and was like, yeah, man, I fucking, uh, is a mount line down there. I just came faced tonight, get outta here. You shy? And they will let, he's like, yeah, it's fucking down there. And so anyways, they interviewed this fucking La couple and they had the quintessential fucking la couple, a mountain lion in your house, Bro.

Speaker 11:         00:41:18       I'm sorry you said that. All the melee and he goes, yeah, man. Face to face, eye to eye came out of I with any music. Terrified.

Speaker 4:          00:41:27       You know what I mean? He looks like the leading man of a B movie. Right? She's got like bleach hair. She's

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       wearing fuck me pumps. She's on 60 minutes. Where in fuck me pumps. It's fucking hilarious. Walking round, done up to the nines. And um, I actually, uh, was pretty cool. I was trying to figure out where the house was. I Google mapped it and I think I was able to find it, but I'm gonna fuck this state is so fucking insane with the droughts, the fires, the rattlesnakes, the coyotes, the mountain lions, you know, and everybody's in this place. It's so phony and so plastic. Well, you know, it can get, uh, that can all go away pretty damn quick with the wildlife.

Speaker 2:          00:42:34       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:42:34       hey, what's going on? It's built borrower and it is the Monday morning podcasts from Monday, August 2nd, 2010. Oh my God. Martha, can you believe it? It's already August. Could you believe it Martha? Actually, I cared Karen because it was just July in my entire life. August has come after July, so yes, I can believe that it's August 2nd. Why do you have to do that? Do what that, you know, why can't you just, you know, have frivolous conversation. Why do you have to pay? Why do you have to be such a cunt? No, I'm sorry. Well that's what's your big, um, anywhere. Oh Gee. Oh Gee. Oh my God. What the fuck did I do last night? I was going to do the podcast last night. That was the plan. Boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages. I was going to do the podcast last night. I was going to upload this motherfucker, midnight my time, you know, for all my friends out there and the fucking, uh, Great Britain out there in Ireland and Iceland, you know, that'd be like eight o'clock in the morning for you, right?

Speaker 4:          00:43:55       You get up, you people in Iceland throwing down some hay for your fucking JAKKS taken out your pan flute. Skipping around, looking for the gold. Isn't that what you do out there? Yeah. Well that's what I think you'd do. Cause I took geography in America. So you know what's up Holland? How's your windmills? Ah, you're clicking. Your fucking wouldn't shoes together. That's my version. That's my version of Holland. They don't even have cell phones out. Their cell phones is still using pitchforks to get their point across. Um, that's an even make sense. But what did I do instead? You know, this is the classic life of the loser, all right? And if you are a loser, not saying you are, okay? Hypothetically, if you are a loser, you're going to recognize this pattern, okay? And this is the pattern of the loser. They'll see the loser knows what he or she is supposed to do, and the, and, and then you never do it.

Speaker 4:          00:44:58       And that is a pattern of a loser. All right? Did they make any fucking sense? It started like I was going to make this huge fucking point and then my headache really just kicked in there. But let's, let's try it. Let's try to put the wheels back on the cart here. All right? Just like those people, um, out there in Finland right now and all the people down in fucking Australia wrestling those poisonous snakes as the aborigines fucking sit there with that. That white God damn tooth sticking through their nose. You know that shark tooth that Greg Brady had around his fucking neck when he was going to be the next Johnny Bravo. Huh? Just sitting there fucking staring at me. They're aborigine, man. You think I need that shit? You think you think I'm the one who kicked you off your fucking land?

Speaker 4:          00:45:52       I'm a Goddamn indentured servant to the fucking banks. They're half naked aborigine dude. All right. To Stop fucking staring at me. All right with your Thong. You fucking sad face. All right. I didn't create plastics. I'm just dealing with it. Why don't you show me how to fucking join whatever it is you're thinking about rather than fucking judging me. And by the way, could you help me with this fucking snake over here? Um, anyways, this is what the loser does. Um, yeah, I, I was gonna, I was, I was going to do x, Y, and Z, but instead I did fucking d and f fucking idiot. Instead of doing the goddamned podcast, I went out and I drank last night. Oh Gee, I wish I had two whiskeys. And to Miller highlights. Why did I have Miller highlights? You know what? Because the bottle looked good.

Speaker 4:          00:46:53       I like the way the bottle look. It's one of those nights there's a shiny looking bottle. I like that. I'm going to have that. I'm going to block out those fucking awful Miller highlife commercials. I hated those commercials. That fucking plumber with his greasy fingers picking up that deviled egg. It's like, are you trying to stick Budweiser? Right. These fucking ads. All right. This is just anger. Just of frustration at myself. I don't know why I did the things I did last night. I shot pool. You know like I'm fucking Willie Mosconi. You know that's it. Yeah, we don't, we as a man, you just walk up to a pool table even though you know you suck and you're just thinking it'd be like, you know, seven ball corner pocket. It's going to fucking go right in and never goes in. You know, just like your life.

Speaker 4:          00:47:42       You think it's on target. You think it's heading right towards your weight, where you want it to go and Bam bounces off the fucking wall. And next thing you know, it's all the way on the other side of the fucking table. This is ridiculous. I shouldn't be doing this right now. I resent, I'm resenting. I'm blaming you guys. I'm fucking blaming you sitting in your Goddamn cubicles. What do you think about that? What do you do? He can't fucking do anything about it. What do you do? Are you going to send me fucking emails complaining? Yeah. Well I don't give a shit. I don't fucking Ivy had breakfast, Jeff sitting in my pajamas doing that thing. When you're hung over, you know, we just sort of rub your feet together, trying to give yourself some sort of soothing feelings on the other end of your party because your fucking head is throbbing so much. Well, maybe I can offset the headache with a soothing feeling between my footies and of course it's not working. Oh Fuck Jesus Christ. Two whiskeys and two bears. I feel like I fucking, uh, I dunno. Like, I dunno what, like I had a fight in the parking lot and I lost. And last thing I remember was somebody grabbing my big ears and bouncing my head off the asphalt as I'm going, I write a right, you won, you won. And then you just slip off into a dream.

Speaker 12:         00:48:58       Ooh. Do, do, do, do, do, do.

Speaker 4:          00:49:01       Um, you know, it's weird. I woke up whenever I wake up, hung over. Um, you know, one of the first things I do is I just start cursing out the woman in my life. You know, this is my remedy for getting over a hangover. You know, you wake up and you see them, you know, and you're trying to get the fucking, you know, that goddamn cement out of the eyes is you're trying to open them up. And of course, because you're hung over and you want to be alone, the vibe you're putting out is you want to be alone. What happens? You create, you attract what you fucking fear. Not only another human being right in your goddamn face. It's gotta be a female. Okay? And God knows, can they ever stop running the yaps. It's like even when they don't have something to say, they're gonna fucking talk because as much as they talk a good game, I'm an independent woman and I got my money, mother Fucker, all that shit.

Speaker 4:          00:50:06       At the end of the day, all these broads are afraid of the same thing. They're afraid of silence. That's what it is. You know that when you watch one of those goddamn shows or in my life, you walk by and your girls watch and one of those goddamn shows. Why and why am I bringing my voice down? Like she's still in the apartment? She isn't, but you know what? He just want to bring my voice down here. This is, I'm either talking about the Illuminati or I'm talking about these fucking bitches. Um, this is all hangover talk here. So I'll fuck all you guys if you're taking this seriously. All right. Rule number one, or is it number two at this point? You don't fucking take the podcast seriously. Okay. Oh, you girls out there, you get your panties in a bunch. It's ridiculous. Why does he make fun of men? Well, it is the balance it out because that's life sweetheart. And Life isn't fair. Why don't you go listen to one of those fucking 2012 podcasts with the fucking broad over there running her goddamn yet between her cleavage. Ah, why don't you go do that sister town with your tampons in your purse just in case. Whew. I am in a mood. Um, yeah. So I'm sitting there and I got fucked. They're afraid of silence. Stay on target.

Speaker 4:          00:51:29       They are, they're afraid of silence. And that's why they talk about nothing. Oh, that's what I was trying to say. You walk by the TV and your girlfriend's sitting there, right? She do. You know, sitting there on the couch right in the couch side saddle. You know, they sit, leaned up against the arm with their legs to the side, rubbing their footies together. That of peeking out of the Afghan. What? I like this show. You Watch your shows. Do I say anything when you're watching your shows? I don't. So why didn't you extend? Shut up.

Speaker 4:          00:52:04       So, you know, you walk by the fucking TV, you walk by the Goddamn TV and what and what is it? What is on the TV? You know what? I don't even remember. I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about. Oh yeah. They're just running their yeps. Oh the, I got it. Here we go. I'm hooked. Backed up to it. There we go. There was a little awkwardness there like you ever see when, uh, when a jet tries to refuel in mid flight, you know, and that Shark Dick is hanging down. I know what a shark Dick looks like. What do they think about that? Is that scandalous enough to get on TMZ and my low level of notoriety? I do. I was watching this fucking a nature show and these fucking creepy humans cause that's what we are. Pull this great white shark out of the fucking sea.

Speaker 4:          00:52:57       And the sharks lie in, they're like, I can't fucking breathe over here. Right. And they got this little garden hose going into his mouth and it seemed the shocks looking like, really this is the same as in h isn't fucking hailing a mouthful of ocean, your little fucking true value hardware garden hose that you got my fucking mouth. What are they doing? Get away from my deck please. And they literally reached down and between a couple of faults, they pull out this shark cock, which amazingly enough looks just like the fucking, uh, that, that tube that they refuel in the air for with or whatever the fucking preposition. Is that a preposition? I don't fucking know. Trying to complete a sentence over here and that's what it looks like. All right, there you go. That Porsche was dedicated to all our troops over there in Afghanistan, in Tuscaloosa, um, in as a weird thing of sitting in the airport.

Speaker 4:          00:53:53       The other, I'm going to get back to the broads. I'm going to give them a break right now. Okay. I, I tried, I tried to knock them out in that round and now I'm fucking winded. I'm taking around off. Is this starting to score points? I'm just giving them, I'm just giving them hope. Taken a round off, but I'm coming out with the next one, um, foot in a glove in their face like Larry Holmes and I'm coming with the overhand right. My favorite fucking thing in boxing. Um, ah, God, what was I just talking about? I was talking about Shark Dicks and then I have to shark dicks. Oh, I know. I'm in the airport. All right, good. This is just going to be all momentum. I'm going to just try to not stop talking for 50 minutes because when I stopped talking, the throbbing in my head is actually audible.

Speaker 4:          00:54:34       All right. Slow it down, Bill. Let's take it down a little bit. A little fucking, some fucking smooth jazz here. All right, so I'm sitting in the fucking airport. This was an awkward thing, right? Uh, all these troops came walking by and these people spontaneously started to applaud, you know, and I didn't know what to do. Do I join in? It just didn't seem right. But then you don't want to not fucking show your appreciation, but applause just seems weird. It just seemed weird. And I was trying to put myself in their fucking position. Like, you know, you just came out of Fallujah, did what you had to do over there and then you get fucking however it works. Next thing you know you're on jet blue and you land at an airport and there's a soccer mom. Whew. Good game. Good game. You know, I don't know what to do.

Speaker 4:          00:55:25       Definitely appreciate him. But, so that's for the troops out there. Do you want applause in the airport or is it fucking weird? You know, cause we don't want to do that shit that happened to the troops when they came back from Vietnam and all those fucking hippies were like, hey man, that was cool when you burned down that dudes hut me and we don't want to do that, but I don't want to have an overcorrection, you know where you're like Dan [inaudible] bed in it in it is that fucking song they played up. I'm trying to think of like college football songs, you know, here come the troops, but Aminah bomp bomp Bam. In order to want to go, he had a Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. You don't want to go like two high energy. There's gotta be a happy medium between sitting there being like, oh, the leaves are brown.

Speaker 4:          00:56:20       And then sitting there, you know, applauding like somebody just sank a putt. It just didn't seem right. All right, so anyway, so you walked by the TV and there's the in the broad's always. They're always talking about how much more, uh, I guess how much, what better communicators, females are, which I've probably proven to the last fucking 14 minutes of this podcast. Um, and now he did know of a woman actually says 20,000 more words a day. Then a guy does serialize that yet. Do you think? I didn't notice. I thought it was 40,000 more. Okay. Let me tell you something. They have fucking sink hole. We just, because you're saying more words doesn't mean you're saying anything. All right. You basically filler buster your way through silence with your girlfriend because both of you are sitting there

Speaker 4:          00:57:17       afraid that if you stop talking, you're going to hear the sound of your boob sagging. All right? Oh yeah. Well that's what I think it is in my own fucking ignorance. All right, let's get on with the podcast here. People, I'm sorry. I had to, I had to do a little cardio there just to get myself through the first 15 minutes, you know, now I can fucking chill. So I woke up, hung over today. Obviously, man, I'm attacking the broads because I'm hung over and for the most part I don't like them. Um, I like to look at them. I like to come over and stick my dick in them, you know? But after that, it's like, why don't you get out in the kitchen and make me one of them fucking, we'll log the sandwiches when she just fucking love to be that guy. You know? Just find some little fucking mouse of a woman to live with. Just blame your entire afternoon on her. Where the fuck is a fucking room up? Oh, you had it last. What the fuck did you say? I guess it was my fault. This is terrible. This isn't even comedy anymore. This is just mean. So I woke up this morning, hung over as I've mentioned 98 times. And for some reason I woke up and uh, this song was in my head. I just woke up. But this was the song. It was in my head right here.

Speaker 2:          00:58:48       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:58:50       Hung over off my ass. And all of a sudden I just hear Elvis.

Speaker 4:          00:58:59       What's your woe? Shake me your big hitch. Oh Hoo. That's one of the greats fucking songs by Elvis Presley and a, when you really listen to the lyrics, um, it's, he's a fucking psycho. He stuck in this broad hot in the kitchen. Holly in the whole, let me go a little dude, you're headed all because, well, saw kitchen and the kitchen kitchen in the kisses starts a team of wild horses couldn't pull us apart. He's singing about rape everybody. But he gets that. Oh, and it's yet, it just smooths it all out. And that's why he was the king. Only the king can make rape seem, uh, like it's, it's the right thing to do for both parties. Let's just be clear on that for both parties.

Speaker 4:          00:59:51       All right, let's get on with the podcast. Okay. I, I fucking love that song. I really do. And I was working the Orleans and a casino with Tom Papa in the marriage. Refs, Tom Papa. Um, I was coming out on stage like that and I felt that for half a second. I felt like 1 million bucks. If I have a fucking second. Can you believe it's August? Um, all right. So let's get on with the podcast. Last week, ladies and Gentlemen, I had the pleasure of performing on the David Letterman show and most of you went out, you watched it and you all sent me wonderful emails about it. And I would read you the wonderful emails, but they're not funny, but you are in luck. You know what ones are funny? The ones where people did not like my performance. So let's read a couple of those, shall we? All right now I fucking nose is running.

Speaker 4:          01:00:48       Okay, here we go. Here we go. I did a little coke last night. Everybody know, never had the balls, never had the balls to mess with that shit. Okay? Uh, this is, uh, this is somebody and I was always, um, for those of you whenever I read my hate mail, um, both of these, the two hate mail emails that I would be reading this morning, all of a sudden I sound like right now like a teacher teaching a really boring class. You know that year and F, you know, first class of that semester, right? You finally get yourself a little bit a poon Tang. You're happy, you're floating around, everything's going to be great. You're thinking, okay, let's see all my teachers are going to be, and then that douche comes out. Well, going to meteorology in the media. My name is Mister Kahn face and Mr can face what? I'm in third grade. I'm sorry, I'm hung over. I couldn't come up with, my name is Mr McGillicutty. Now, over the course of the next three months, we're going to be that way against all the wonderful world of meteorology in the media. You'll be required to write two to 27 page papers on theorists, clouds in the Dakotas.

Speaker 4:          01:02:13       Okay. So cirrus clouds were first discovered ever since the Hydrus via that, whether they love and they picks up the fucking marker, please writing across that fucking bored. Sir Makkah is largest Catholic yet the third, uh, at first, before I said mark is the Catholic author, they thought a cirrus clouds.

Speaker 4:          01:02:43       We're actually the God's sake that your wife was account. I've got nothing. What's the breathing and knowing it was supposed to be? Um, all right, let's read the hate mail here. So what happens with all of all of my hate mail is when people don't like my act is you can't just write me evidently and just say that you don't like my act. You don't appreciate what it is that I do on the stage. What you have to do first is you have to establish what an incredible sense of fucking humor you have and how open you are to all different forms of humor. You know, it's that classic thing like those douchebags on Youtube. Obama is a fucking idiot. And I'm a Democrat, right?

Speaker 3:          01:03:27       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:03:27       So then we can be like, wow, this guy is left. And even he doesn't like this lefty guy. So this is what they do. All right, so here and so these uh, both these emails follow to a Goddamn fucking t did the mother fucking UNV um, they follow it here at it. They follow that pattern bill. Just read the fucking thing. Okay, here we go. All right. Hi there. Oh, this one starts. Starts off. Nice enough. Hi there. I've been a fan for awhile. You seem to have a unique take on things. Look at this, Huh? Pat me on the head, but me. Sniff her hand making me nice and fucking relax. I loved your bit about the muffins and the mass vehicular murder.

Speaker 4:          01:04:18       So there you go. She just showed how we, it just, her sense of humor spans the globe, whether I'm attacking food are actually running over human beings on the sidewalk. She finds it all funny though. And here's the rub though. As a stay at home mom, I now completely despise you. I did this bit about being a stay at home mom. Um, so anyways, she says the hardest part about being a stay at home mom is being respect is being disrespected by everyone. I now hope the worst for you, despite what funny acts you may think up in the future, you are a jerk and deserve the worst that life has to offer.

Speaker 4:          01:05:09       I don't fucking, I don't, I don't understand like these, this is a classic fucking person where everything is funny until it comes around to some shit in her life and I make some fun and some shit that she's doing being a stay at home mom and now all of a sudden she goes from being a fan of mind to now I am a jerk and deserve the worst that life has to offer. That's, that's a fucking hard courts that you deserve. The worst that life has to offer. So what? I'm going to get leprosy and uh, be constipated all at the same time and fucking survive a plane crash, but not in a good way, you know? Anyways, I don't fucking know really. You're going to take it to that level. So I wrote her back and I said, a sweetheart, Oprah Winfrey called your job the toughest job on the planet, on national television, and got an applause break of approval. How much more respect do you need? I think that's a great point. If I can step outside the email, break the fucking fourth wall. Is that what it is? The third wall? I never knew what the fuck it was. Huh?

Speaker 4:          01:06:19       Oprah Winfrey's on TV saying you have the toughest job on the planet and everybody claps. All right. Did she say being a standup comedian is the toughest job in the planet? You think you know what it's like to be fucking disrespected. You Apron wearing sheltered son of a bitch? Huh? You want to talk about being disrespected? Looking fucking comedians anytime they show a comedian in a movie. Is it a Chris Rock level comic? It never is. It's the fucking hack with the lampshade on his head going Wakawaka. Right. Then the fucking comedian gets shot in his gut during Scarface. Ah, did a fucking stay at home. Mom gets shot in the fucking stomach with that Mr. Potato head mask on her face during that show. No. You know why? Cause she was at home taking care of the fucking kids. Ah, Jesus Christ. I'm just gonna read the rest of the email. I didn't even fucking make sense. It started off funny and then it just went right off the rails like a Prius that you can't fucking stop. Um, anyways, uh, she says, so I wrote, I wrote a, how much more respect do you need? And then I said, meanwhile there are children working in sweat shops. Would you rather be a stay at home mom or an eight year old sewing Adidas together for 16 hours a day?

Speaker 4:          01:07:37       I came up with another great example that I, I wish I had used on TV. How about, how about you work on one of those fucking oil rigs? Like those poor bastards who worked for BP. Then all of a sudden out of nowhere the fucking thing explodes. You standing on a metal structure in the middle of the goddamn ocean and next thing you know blows up, probably blew out both your air drums. He had deaf now and you're on fire. All right? And your only option is either burning to death or jumping off of basically the equivalent of the top of a brownstone trying to enter the water without doing the biggest flaming belly flop, right? You land in the water, second and third degree burns in salt water. All right? Pus and blood is oozing into the water and now all you can do is pray to God that the coast guard gets there before is see as sharks eat you alive. All right? You want to do that or you want to watch Bob the builder for the 800 time? Lighten up.

Speaker 4:          01:08:45       And then I wrote, Oh, and don't despise her hope that works for me. That causes premature aging hugs. I know that was kind of mean to say, but you know what? Go Fuck Yourself. All right, here's another one. Once again, we have to establish credibility at the top of the email. Are you guys ready for the credibility to be established? Jesus Christ. I know I am. Here we go. Ah, Bill, I am never appalled or capital letters offended by comedy that I see in here. All capitals. This sentence, I have a great sense of humor. Wow. This is unbelievable. Isn't that amazing podcast listeners, this person is never appalled or offended by comedy that she sees or hears. She has a great sense of humor. She is such a great sense of humor. People that she had to yell at at me and emails. All right, so tis no way.

Speaker 4:          01:09:41       She had a problem with my act, right? Let's read the rest of the email, however, oh gee. Your appearance on the David Letterman show that I just watched, just put down women and motherhood to an extent that is just downright unbelievable. Dot Dot. Dot. Now she's going to yell again and tasteless. Now she yells for the rest of this email, but I'm going to spare you guys. All right. I'm going to read it and soothing tones, but she's screaming the entire time. That's what I'm guessing because it's all capital letters. Um, this is what she says. I challenge you to be a single parent and raise a child and work and attend college alone without any help. Just in case you don't know what being a single parent meets. All right? Um, you have no idea how hard it really is. I am disgusted with your act and will not ever buy any of your DVDs, et Cetera.

Speaker 4:          01:10:48       For the first time in my life, I am disgusted with comedy. Your comedy, that is like if she starts speaking like in film, nor I'm disgusted with his comedy. Your comedy that is say, Eh, 23. Skidoo all right. Your Act touched on many topics that you were disgraceful and very unappealing. I think she got so mad she stopped writing sentences. Um, first of all, sweetheart, I wasn't making fun of a single single parents that was making fun of single parents. Nobody would laugh. I was talking about stay at home moms. All right? You don't remember that line hanging out all day making grilled cheese sandwiches. You given a puppet show, you dress like a dragon and then some other adult comes home and gives you money. You like a big kid. That's some other adults coming home, giving you money. Is Your fucking husband. You dumb broad drug on a fucking spell it out to you. So I just wrote her back. I just said I wasn't talking about single moms. I was talking about stay at home moms. You weren't listening.

Speaker 4:          01:11:55       Well listen, I'm not going to do this show anymore. If I have to put up with this. I'm just kidding. I love these fucking hate mail things and that's all I got. I got, I got to to uh, bad emails and then I had one guy who wrote like a five page dissertation on, uh, on the shirt I was wearing under my suit or something like that. And uh, then I just went homophobic with him. I just wrote a, that's one of the gay ass emails I've ever received. Uh, thanks for the fashion advice. And then he wrote back trying to act as if I got a bunch of emails from guys telling me to wear a carnation in my front pocket or whatever the fuck he was saying and he wrote this big long fucking four page email and then I just hit him with, come on sweetie, don't be like that. And then it ended it. I got, I got a lot of a little weird emails this week. Somebody saw a date night and said I need to be more choosy when I pick my roles, which I thought was fucking hilarious. Like someone who has eight lines in a movie is actually getting offers around town. We got to get this guy. The way I'm telling you, the way he stands next to other people talking in the film is incredible. He is the best at it. Yeah, no, I got to be more choosy with with a fucking,

Speaker 2:          01:13:16       yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:13:18       Evidently because I wasn't doing stand up in the movie date night. Like the role of my character was the straight man and the more [inaudible] or I played it, the more opportunity for the other person to be funny in the scene. That's your fucking job, you know? And I did the job and I think that wasn't the job that I was supposed to do. I would think that the director might have said something and just because I'm a fucking comedian doesn't mean I'm going to walk around, you know, with a lamp shade on my fucking head.

Speaker 4:          01:13:48       I'd love to be in a bad ass fucking movie. What do you think I want to do? You know, you think I want to be in raising Arizona part to actually I would, but I'd also like to be in a, they can ever make a movie as good as a good fellows. I'd love to do some shit like that. Play a fucking psycho. Put the lotion in the bucket but wouldn't want to do that shit. All right. You dumb. Fuck am I, I don't need to be more choosy about my roles. I need to take anything anybody gives me, you know, fucking shot that movie a year ago. I haven't done another one. Is that choosing enough for you? Not been up guns. Not like I'm not trying. All right, let's uh, let's plow ahead here. Let's get on with, uh, what else do we got going on?

Speaker 4:          01:14:33       Oh, by the way, if I want to thank everybody. Seriously, I was just fucking around there with the, uh, the Letterman stuff. I had an unbelievably great time and uh, that was my best Letterman if I do say so myself. I finally figured out the pacing that I have to go on TV and uh, what I always used to try to do is I used to try to go comedy club speed, but TV audiences for some reason laughing clap a lot more. And then I would, I would try to do was plow through the applause and get the tag of the joke in there. And uh, I dunno, it's like a whole different animal. You got to figure out what do you do when they're applauding, you know, why did the chicken cross road to get the other side? Woo Woo. Maybe that's why I didn't applaud when the troops came by because I thought that they would feel as awkward as I do when you're just standing there going, okay.

Speaker 4:          01:15:32       Thank you. Yes, I know that was the greatest joke in the history of the world. I am tremendous. Where do you get a load of this one? Um, all right, let's read some. Um, let's read some match. Oh, and by the way, um, later on that night, um, in celebration, I had the most ridiculous fucking weekend, um, that an adult can have and part of most of his, because, uh, you know, I chose what I wanted to do in life was exactly what I wanted to do. And secondly, I'm not married and I don't have any fucking kids, so I don't have any responsibility. Hence, I, uh, I get to live the life of a, a gay guy. Give me notice how happy fucking gay men are. You know why that is is because they got the fucking double whammy. There are fucking man. So they can earn way more an hour than the fucking broads over there and then they don't have any God damn kids.

Speaker 4:          01:16:33       So once you get around 40, if you've done grading your, your career, you have all this disposable income, you know, and the only way to kill the voices in your head that you should have had a fucking kid by now is to go out and do frivolous bullshit to fill up the free time. And that's what I've been doing. So I actually this weekend, um, one of the things I got to do this past weekend is so fucking unbelievable. I can't even tell you how I even went down, but I did take video of it. And if you want to watch the video, you can only go place everybody. And that's the MM podcast.com. Huh? You like that? look@thatandexclusivemondaymorningpodcastvideothatwillonlybeshownonthemmpodcast.com of course, until some douche bag takes it and puts it up on Youtube. So go to the [inaudible] podcast.com and a watch a video of something that I got to do.

Speaker 4:          01:17:37       And, uh, I, I don't even, I can't even begin to tell you how that whole fucking thing went down and how I got to do it, but, uh, was one of the great things I got to do in life. So I got to do that, which I won't be telling you because I'm trying to become a smarter businessman here. All right? The only way you should hit pause right now and go to the MM podcast right now, if you're not following along anyways. Um, I got to do that unbelievable activity. And then, uh, what did I do? I did Letterman on Monday and then Monday night I went down to the bitter end and I watched that fucking amazing guy, Oz noy this guitarist, if you ever get a chance, if you ever in a New York one Monday a night, this guy, Oz noy goes down and he, I don't know, I can't even describe what the fuck it is.

Speaker 4:          01:18:28       He does very, very unique guitarist and he, uh, I don't mean you got to see him live. You have to fucking seem live as youtube videos. Do not do him justice. He got to go down and seem live and um, and he's always playing with these top notch musicians. He had a will leave from the Letterman band was there. Steve Ferrone from the average white band actually went up and got a fucking picture with them and Shit, uh, from the average white band and now Tom petty and he's played with a zillion other people. One of my drumming heroes got to meet him that fucking night. And uh, the guy on keyboards is one of the original guys from the East street band, but I'm not into the e street band. But this guy was the shit and I just watched these fucking unbelievable musicians and sat in the crowd. These guys were so fucking good that actually had the comforting thought that, you know what, robots will never take over fully. Robots will never fully fucking take over because they'll never be able to do what I just fucking saw. I mean when he, you're gonna write a program for passion. God, no, some fucking egg head with no passion is probably figuring that shit out. Figure out how to make a robot sweat. Will it plays fucking guitar?

Speaker 3:          01:19:45       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:19:47       that'll be, that'll be the big fucking breakthrough. That's why drum machines never fully took over cause it's just somebody programming the shit. You know, it's not a human being playing it. Right. Is that where, I don't know. I'm too fucking hung over to actually have a fucking, a fucking touching moment here in the podcast all a couple of weeks ago I told you guys how to dump, how to get out of a fucking relationship. All right. Um, and if you ever want to learn how to not get into a relationship, go download a Andrew dice Clay's live album at Dangerfield, did the, uh, the day the laughter died. And one of my favorite bits of all time that he does is a, I think it's called hot n how to not get into a relationship. So if you don't even want to deal with how to get out of relationship, listen to dice Clay's bit on how to not get into into relationship and a, but then if you fuck up and you get into one, listen to my podcast from a couple of weeks ago and I'll give you the blueprint on how to get out.

Speaker 4:          01:20:51       All right? So anyway, so this brought up the whole getting dumped and people have been sending me emails about getting dumped or breaking up in the awkwardness and all that type of shit. These are some great stories. Here's one for you getting dumped. Hey Bill, how's listening? Last week and wanted to tell you about the worst way I was dumped. Uh, when I was in high school, I had a friend who was a girl and I was in love with her in a pathetic, never getting laid way while she was banging and half the football team.

Speaker 4:          01:21:22       Oh Dude, that's like that movie last, uh, last American Virgin, right? Then I already use that reference on the podcast. I don't give a fuck. I'm hung over anyways. I, after high school graduate graduation, we started dating even though we went to different colleges, seven hours apart, um, over I yeah, I love how she starts dating you then because the football team left her and went to 47 different colleges, so she just needed a dick to ride. Um, over fall break I went to visit her and stayed at her place for the weekend. On the last night at midnight, she told me she was seeing someone else and then expected me to stay at her house that night. Oh, what a cunt. Um, I got up and pack my shit and as I was about to leave, I did my best Brando impression to let her know how she, how she fucked up. Um, and as I started to go out the door after making my dramatic statement, she said, don't you need your keys?

Speaker 13:         01:22:25       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:22:26       Oh, this poor bastard. He goes, I forgot my keys on the table all the way across the room. So I had to walk all the way across, back the pack, across the room in shame to grab my keys and then drove seven hours back to college in the middle of a, in the middle of the night. Dude, let me tell you something. You got, you got half a victory there. Um, because you did leave and you know, and you did, you had the ability to walk all the way across the room to get your keys. And at no point during that long fucking did you break down in tears. You didn't. All right, don't you need your keys? Ugh. Ah, that's fucking brutal. That's like, that's like mean. Yeah. Because you know what she thought, I guess that you were going to stay there for the night. So I guess she went mean there. Don't you need your keys? Obviously you need your keys. If she was trying to let you down easy when she'd be like, mmm, you forgot your keys here and just would have the decency to look down at the floor. Don't you need your keys?

Speaker 13:         01:23:45       Ugh,

Speaker 4:          01:23:47       that this is what I want to know from you on that seven hours drive back. How many different snappy comebacks did you come with for don't you need your keys? I bet you were so fucking distraught. They didn't even make sense. Don't you need your keys? Don't you need your current, right. That doesn't even make sense. But you know, it's something you'd say. Aww, you poor bastard, whatever. You know what the good news is? She probably has three kids right now. Our bodies looking like she's standing in a fun house mirror and she probably has some sort of fucking STD. So, you know, there you go sir. It all worked out in the end, didn't it? All right. Uh, bad covers. This is from back in the day we're talking about, um, when, when an artist comes around like a lady Gaga, you know, when she comes around and she wraps herself in toilet paper and holds a fucking dildo and everybody's like, she's thinking of fashion state, but she shocking Middle America, uh, holding like a black baby while playing chess. Is there anything worse than that? Paint by numbers. Shock. You know, and then, then the fucking douchebags who cover it, just stand right in line. She's pushing boundaries. She's rejecting what it is to be a woman. Oh God. Shut up. She's wearing a silly outfit. Isn't that what she's doing as a fan? Blowing on her Twat, hanging off her belt buckle. And then I'm supposed to sit there and be like, oh, I can't even process this. This is cutting edge art. I mean, what is she really doing?

Speaker 13:         01:25:35       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:25:39       Oh, good faith poke phase. Oh my God, I can't handle it. This is like when Jimmy Hendrix came out. No, it isn't. There's like, when Cindy Lopper came up, she braided half her fucking head, right. And dance down the street with their fucking shoulders going up and down, yelling at Captain Lou, I'll bottle. It's, it's kind of on that level. I remember when Cindy Lopper did that shit and then she didn't do anything. And next thing you know, she's on, she's on that fucking, uh, who wants to be a CEO getting fired by that guy who I don't even think has any money or any Donald Trump fans out there. I don't think that guy is rich. I really don't. I don't. I don't buy it. If this guy is such, if he so fucking rich and has all these goddamn businesses, how does he have time to do a reality show and in critique?

Speaker 4:          01:26:33       Who's better at running a lemonade stand? Cindy Lopper. Bret Michaels is, is that what a fucking a fucking whatever the hell he is. What? What is, what do you call a guy like that? He's, he's, he's a uh, a conglomerate. A media conglomerate. What, what the fuck is he called? A A, I can't think of the word. I'm too fucking hung over. It's not like one of those ingenue names then. I know it's not that way. I know what that, that's not what it is. A knew means you're a, you're a good looking gore. Gore. Good looking whore. Who Someday my brain is so fucked right now. I just combined good looking in horror and she's a good, she's a Gore Al Gore.

Speaker 4:          01:27:17       Al Gore. Who is a bitch or your fucking body. Al Gore or fucking Bill Clinton. Both of them. They're big mother and hips sachet and around the White House with their fucking suits on Eaton Stouffer fucking pies. Um, I am so off the track right now. Um, we're talking about bad covers now on this is, this is, this is what I really believe about Donald Trump for all his fucking Trump water. Trump tower, Trump casino, Trump helicopter, Trump, te toenail clippers. I don't think that that guy, if you gave him fucking, if you gave him 12 hours, I don't think that he could come up with more than 6,500 bucks in cash. I think he's just completely leveraged out, but his projects are so big. He's like the banks. Like he, he's too big to fail. Oh, Jesus Christ. What the fuck am I talking about? Where the hell am I? Let's get back to bed covers.

Speaker 4:          01:28:17       All right. Bad covers. Here's one for you. Uh, Madonna when she did a American pie, um, yeah, that song kind of sucked to begin with. And then, um, just in case you didn't realize it's sucked, Madonna came in and proved it. Yes. This song did suck. Even if you completely switch it up and put that club beat underneath it, it's still gonna fucking suck of Jesus. I'm just running on a momentum, you know? Did I really just do a lady Gaga impression? I'll fuck you. You enjoyed it. You enjoyed it. You know, you, you do a podcast hung over. I want to see how good you do. Yeah, I didn't think so. I didn't fucking think so. Um, here's the youtube videos for the week. We're just blowing through the topics here. Youtube videos for the week. A pug. Pug Sings Batman theme. Look that one up there, right?

A wasted guy at Coachella, Coachella is CEO, c h e l l a. And here's one for you, uh, do something difficult. And you know what? I actually forgot the most fucked up one of the week. I have to just bear with me here. I have my, the microphone laying on my chest right now. I want to say somebody used to do that didn't like one of those. Those guys late at night when they're trying to sell your shit before they came up with the Janet Jackson Mcdonald's drive through headset. Then they have like that hands free device with the microphone just dangled from your neck. I want to say that they had that. All the other guys, that's a movie coming out that the other guys, I actually had an audition for that movie and I got all the way down to the part where the guy who got the part was fucking he.

Speaker 4:          01:30:26       I think he went in before me and killed it. So now when I see that movie, I'm like, ah. It looks so fucking funny. I could've been in there with eight lines. God dammit. All right, the fucking, all right. What's the name of this video woman finds man in bed, something like that. Oh, here. Women. Woman wakes up to find intruder in her bed. You got to see this one. It's so fucked up. I don't even know if it's real. It looks like a fucking in living color sketch. Um, all right. Overrated, underrated for this week and the overrated underrated this week. Uh, you guys really took it to another level here. This is fucking phenomenal. All right. Underrated. Ah, first kid in your junior high that admitted to jerking off.

Speaker 4:          01:31:22       That might be one of my favorite underwriters of all time. What a fucking champ that kid was. You know, you know some people are still trying to find themselves at 35 or possibly 42 like myself. That kid knew who the fuck he was in junior high. Hey, jerking off I do it. Fucking feels good. Fucking rub one out. Next class. I liked the teacher. She's still with something for me. One, I'm the last guy in the, in the, in the fucking row. Just don't turn around. You'll be fine. I'm number two. Whoever commented that Roger Ebert now looks like one of the muppets from the land of video. Jesus Christ. On a side note, that is one of the creepiest videos ever. Yeah, man. Poor Roger Ebert, Jesus Christ. You know what I mean? How ironic is that? That he spent his life criticizing people and then he gets fucking mouth cancer.

Speaker 4:          01:32:15       You know, and he's, he's still criticized and shit. He's like, he's like the Goddamn a terminator. Um, Jesus Christ. And if that's true, what the fuck am I going to get? The fuck's going to happen to me. All this shit that I spew. Um, number three, Leopold butter's Scotch next to Cartman the best character on South Park. I hope I said the dude's name right. I love South Park. I really love that. And I'm actually, I'm going to, uh, I'm starting to watch the boondocks because everybody told me that's the shit. So watch it with me. And, uh, let's watch a quality show together. What do you say people, anybody else watching? Breaking bad? I can't believe I've been watching it for three fucking seasons and I haven't, um, I haven't, uh, haven't really talked about it. I fucking love it. It's a God damn. It's a great show.

Speaker 4:          01:33:07       But I've yet to get into that advertising a mad, mad, mad men. Mad Money. The fuck is it? I Dunno. Everybody walks around smoking. Um, I heard it's great. And everybody on that show is dressed in suits, which I like a number four underrated. This is another great one. This is a new, this is, this is, this is this person's first contribution to the podcast. And a, I think this person should be a staff writer, is another fucking gem number four station wagons in the 80s with the rear seats facing out the back window. Kids have everything today, but they missed out on that one. Do you know my parents had an 83 caprice classic maroon with the fake wood going down the side, top of the line, the wire wheels, cloth, Maroon fucking, uh, interior. We drove all the way out to Chicago one time, all the way up to Chicago.

Speaker 4:          01:34:06       I was in the Middle Cup of my siblings were sitting in the back and I was jealous that they got to sit, you know, seeing what we just fucking saw. And then my parents sat in the front and that bench seat that blocked the AC and they wouldn't let us put the windows. Dad, my fucking dad would sit there with his hands in front of the, you know, he's hands on the event, like an inch away from the vent, failing the AC coming out, you know, completely fucking selfish. And will they, can we turn it on? We couldn't put the windows down. They're like, no, we got the AC on. Yeah. With the big cloth bench seat is fucking blocking it. And we just sat there looking at farmland wisdom by my brother's actually got to stick their heads out the window in the back, you know, like a couple of fucking months and I sat there in the middle, just had to sit there taking it all right.

Speaker 4:          01:34:59       Number five under rated kids in the hall. Absolutely. When people bring up the greatest sketch shows of all time, you know, they'll say Mr show, they'll say Dave Chappelle and uh, the people in the know also say kids in the hall and I'd have to definitely go with that. Alright. Overrated humping in the shower apps. A fuckin lutely. That's exciting. When you're in college, you know that sensation of water, you know? Yeah. Hopping in the showers. Weird. Then the water's hitting her booty crack. It starts making a weird noise. You know, as a water shoots up from her fucking ass crack, it's hitting you in your lower jaw, you know, who can concentrate. Um, number two, uh, bartenders that claim to have created their own drink.

Speaker 4:          01:35:49       Is it ever good? It's never fucking good. Uh, overrated Bourbon Street I got to go with yet. That is overrated. You fucking go down there. It's a bunch of Goddamn tourist who can't hold their fucking alcohol. And then there's a bunch of Goddamn wolves on the side streets waiting to fucking stick a knife in your neck. Uh, also overrated national spelling. Bee contests are overrated. Uh, I dunno, I dunno if I go, I actually liked those ones and I think it's great that those kids learn how to fucking spell. It's something that I wish I learned how to do and um, I root for him. I want him to win the spelling bee. And I also want him to get laid before the 36. Um, and here's a random one. Go on Google maps and you know when you can hit satellite then actually looked down, you know, and actually bring yourself down on the street with that little man.

Speaker 4:          01:36:41       Here's one for you in the middle of France. This is what you want to look up his, the address eight rue, which means Street d, You have duct here. [inaudible] Doc, t. E u. R. G. R. A. N. D. J. And that was one word, g. Uh, Grand Joel, which means big Joel. Um, five, four zero, zero, zero Nancy, n. A. N. C. Y. I just realized how long this is and now I can't stop. I've got to give you the whole thing. Comma, m e U R t. H. E. You guys write this down like Morse Code Dash e Dash M o. S. E. L. L. E. And then Lorraine France. L. O. R. R. A. I. N. E. All right. Okay. Google map that hit the satellite. Bring the little man down on the street and tell me what the fuck that is on that porch. Tell me that's not a fucking alien. There's an alien on the porch and the satellite cut the picture of it. I Dunno. Who knows? It's probably a goddamn beehive.

Speaker 4:          01:37:54       That was a fucking way to go, but I like it. I think that has a lot to do to good theme for this podcast. You know, for a hung over son of a bitch with nothing in his, in his, in his stomach. Other than the two slices of pizza that I ate at one in the morning. La Pizza, by the way. See, you know, it was good. Um, you know, something I just realized, I feel like I haven't said anything funny in the last 20 minutes. How long ago was that? Clinton Gore with they're bitchy bodies sachet and around the White House. I know that, that was funny, Huh? The sound of their milk wide hips hitting that fucking suit material.

Speaker 4:          01:38:34       Nationwide healthcare. She's walking around the Oval Office, both of them. Eh, you know something I'm going to, I'm going to vote them that in my lifetime. The too bitchy is that's the bitchy is tandem. That is ever, ever been in the White House. You know what I mean? I'll tell you right now, I, and I didn't vote for four, actually [inaudible] 96 actually in [inaudible] 96 I did vote for Clinton, but after that I've just gone rogue because then Clinton just turned out to be the same fucking dude that, that, that, that other guy, the angry guy with the pen bombed. All right? He, he did the same shit. They all do the same shit. Oh, you fucking morons who voted for Obama and now you're surprised. Can you believe he's pretty much doing what Mccain would have done? And I'm not talking about the taxes. Shit. I'm talking about the Afghans.

Speaker 4:          01:39:30       Yana fucking, I don't even know what I'm talking about, but I'm sick. All you douchebags bitching about all the taxes. Do you really think you're going to have to fucking wars? And at some point when all the rich people get up from the table after that, they fucking chewing scroll. And when you did that, you walked in with your buddies and you ordered a big fucking meal and when the waitress went up to bar, y'all ran out the door and you jumped into your fucking AMC Gremlin and drove away laughing, laughing your ass off. And that poor broad had to pay for it.

Speaker 4:          01:40:03       Do you know that there's a place in Norwood, Massachusetts called the Cafe Venice and I did that 20 years ago and I still feel guilty about it. I went in there, and I'm not going to name names, but it was a bunch of names. There's too many names to name and we stood up and we were going to pay and we end. The waitress was just not there and we just waited and waited and waited and waited and I'm like, where the fuck is she? And then there was that tension and there was somebody, there was this weird laugh and somebody out of the group walked out the door and then there was that panic. Oh my God, it was like that musical chair game. You didn't want to be the last one standing when the music's playing, playing cause then you got to pay for check and then we all just fucking just bursted out the door.

Speaker 4:          01:40:59       And I remember, cause it was really dark in the cafe Venice, I don't even know if it even exists anymore. And then we went out into the sunlight, couldn't fucking see shit just running towards something that looked like the shape of our car. Just that young fucking energy that you had. We could actually be stuffed with food and still run and laugh and still get away, you know? And we just got in the car and just laughed our asses off the hallway. And I immediately, afterwards I felt guilty because I knew that she would have to pay for it. And uh, this is how young I was. I actually ordered a large milk with my Italian meal.

Speaker 4:          01:41:42       I was like 18 or 19 and I was one of those guys who just never stopped drinking milk. I didn't stop drinking milk until I was like, I dunno. Somewhere in my fucking late twenties. I used to drink. I loved it. I loved the nice cold glass of fucking milk. And I had it with like every meal. And it was, you know, my first time at 18, we're all the same. Not realize that you're hanging out with the adults. I had just graduated high school and everybody's ordering and they're going, yeah, let me get, let me get a, you know, some folk eleague atony with the fucking meat sauce over, then I'll get a fucking coke in a while. Every is ordering coke's a bear and blah, blah, blah. And I was like, uh, oh, have this spaghetti and meatballs and I a have a large milk.

Speaker 4:          01:42:27       And there was this pause and then, ugh, the ball breaking began in, it never fucking ended for the rest of it, you know, and uh, whatever. I Dunno what the fuck I'm saying. What the fuck am I saying? Oh yeah, yeah. So they, they, we got to fucking wars for eight goddamn years. And then all the corporations got up from the table, ran out to their fucking, uh, top of the line, bulletproof SUV. And they drove off and yet they left us with the tab and all you guys think that we're not going to have to pay it back. You think the taxes aren't coming to fuck. They're coming. Oh, they're coming. There you go. That was my fucking what's going on with the world now? Fuck you go fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:43:13       Yourself's whatever. I made it to an hour. I made another one. That's all it is. That's all it is. It's like the drew Carey show the last nine seasons where they'd just go and whatever. It's syndication money. Who gives a fuck? Let's just bring in some fat, broad with crazy makeup and have drew yell at her. When people watch it, great. We'll all get fucking paid. We're all going to get fucking paid hate. Anybody read that story in that magazine? I think it was Esquire magazine about that guy who fucking went on the prices. Right and like a card counter. He, he just fee broke the bank. He won both showcases in the 37 years or whatever. This shows the

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       prices right, has been on the air. No one has ever guessed the exact amount of Ah, the showcase that they bid on and this guy did it. And all you have to do is come within 50 bucks or 100 bucks. And you went both showcases. And this guy, he fucking, he nailed bullshit. He hit it right on the head. And so the point they thought he was cheating because everybody was winning that day and they can't figure it out if it was him or if it was this other guy in the audience who was fucking tip and people off because they were given away cars. And I guess the price is right, has to pay for the prizes. So evidently drew Carey didn't think that the episode was going to air. So he was kind of a Dick when he said you won both. And then I guess they ended up fucking airing it during like a sweeps week.

Speaker 4:          01:44:38       So he kind of looked like a dick, but, uh, I guess, uh, prices, right? People were not thrilled. So is this, this whole article and he's saying the, uh, he's only guilty of being an avid fan of the show. And the prices right fucked up by, they would have reoccurring prices. I'm re re reoccurring prizes. Like they had some sort of smoke around there, one of those eggs, smokers. You've ever seen those fucking things. Um, and he knew the exact fucking price of it. So when he was in contestants row, they will like the egg smoker and somebody was like 1500 and he goes, you know, and if you don't know the exact prices, suddenly says 1500, you think it's about 1500? Usually go 15. Oh one. Okay. Or you say 1200 to try and get the next, you know, 300 in your favor. He said like, fucking a, I'm going to go with the 1478 and he nailed it first.

Speaker 4:          01:45:35       Fred fucking flat. Am I really going to go through the whole episode? It's out there people. But we'll have go to the [inaudible] podcast.com this weekend I'm going to be down in La Jolla, California, just outside of San Diego playing the comedy store, my home away from home out here in La. I'm going to do the one down in La Jolla. And, uh, bring your ass down there. I got a brand new hour shit. And uh, I cannot wait to go down there. I'm going to spend the fucking weekend down there, get a sunburn on the beach, maybe do a little golfing. And, uh, even though I don't golf, I just like fucking, you know, going out there and slowing it down for the other cuts on the course. And that's it. That's the podcast for this week. God bless all he is. And, uh, by the way, in two weeks, I want to be at the Newport Yannick Center in Newport, Rhode Island, and I'm going to be at the Hampton Beach Ballroom Casino in Hampton, New Hampshire. Uh, I got to sell a ton of fucking tickets. So if you're not doing anything for the love of God, you and all your friends come on down, get hammered. If you're the waitress from the cafe Venice, please show up. I'll give you a DVD and I'll give you the fucking hundred bucks with interest that I, Oh yes,

Speaker 14:         01:46:43       from fucking goddamn 22 years ago. All right, everybody have a good week.
