Hello, I'm Rena. Nice to meet you and thank you for clicking on this video. Today, I am going to

00:00:13.137 --> 00:00:19.587
talk to you a little bit about asexuality, as well as aromanticism. And, I will be referring to two

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.788
articles on psych2go.net called, Asexual Orientation by Heather Rayburn, as well as Asexuality,

00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:30.797
Aromantic and Everything In Between by Casey Hildago.

00:00:30.798 --> 00:00:36.520
So, if you don't know what asexuality is already, according to asexuality.org, asexuality is

00:00:36.523 --> 00:00:42.144
someone that doesn't experience any sexual attraction. But, just because someone doesn't

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:48.735
necessarily feel the attraction, doesn't mean that they can't have sex or engage in sexual

00:00:48.738 --> 00:00:54.555
activities. As well as, it's not like they can't engage in romantic relationships either. That would

00:00:54.557 --> 00:00:56.050
be with aromantic people.

00:00:56.051 --> 00:01:01.667
Aromantics have no desire for romantic relationships. However, just because someone has no

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:06.076
desire for a romantic relationship, doesn't mean they can't form other relationships like platonic

00:01:06.078 --> 00:01:10.839
relationships or relationships with their family. They're just not interested in maintaining a

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:17.297
relationship that has to do with romance. As it's still a very vague concept on is it considered an

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.019
actual orientation? Some people believe that it's not an orientation at all. They believe that it's

00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:29.935
gender identity disorder called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD.

00:01:29.938 --> 00:01:36.333
There are a number of different studies that try to divulge deeper into the idea of asexuality. One

00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:41.711
such study decided that they were going to divulge a little bit deeper into asexuality by polling

00:01:41.713 --> 00:01:48.886
102 individuals online that identified as asexual. Through this, they were able to divide and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:52.922
categorize asexual people as being aromantic and romantic.

00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:57.722
If a person says that they're straight, it usually is implied that they're both heterosexual and

00:01:57.724 --> 00:02:03.835
heteroromantic. Similarly, if a person identifies as gay, they're believed to be homosexual and

00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:09.576
homoromantic. But, the thing with asexuality, as well as any other sexuality or romantic

00:02:09.578 --> 00:02:17.750
orientation, is that you can be asexual and you can be panromantic. Or, you could be demisexual

00:02:17.754 --> 00:02:25.767
and you could be biromantic. There's lots of different mixes and matches that you can be from

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.064
your sexual orientation and your romantic orientation.

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:35.322
I think, generally, the idea of asexuality and aromantics is very foreign. When you look into

00:02:35.324 --> 00:02:41.103
society and you turn on the radio, or you turn on the television, there's a lot, a lot, a lot of songs

00:02:41.106 --> 00:02:47.857
and TV shows and movies that are all about romance, and you know, the guy gets with the girl,

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.431
or the guy actually likes the guy in the end that doesn't really like the girl. Or, you know,

00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:59.064
songs about sex. But, society pounds that into you and makes you feel like you need to like this

00:02:59.067 --> 00:03:04.947
stuff. You want to get married, you want to have relationships with people, and you want to

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.969
cuddle and hold hands, and spend Valentine's Day with your boyfriend or your girlfriend. But,

00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:13.282
not everyone's like that.

00:03:13.283 --> 00:03:20.152
And, because of that, and because of the way that society pounds this onto you, a lot of ases and

00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:26.417
aros tend to believe that they are broken, something is wrong with them, which is definitely not

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:32.432
the case. The other problem, of course, is a lot of people confuse asexuality with celibacy.

00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:36.601
Celibacy is a choice that people make, not to have sex.

00:03:36.603 --> 00:03:42.356
So, first of all, I want to ask you, have you ever heard of asexuality? Have you ever heard of

00:03:42.358 --> 00:03:49.541
aromantics? And if you have, has it been out of the idea of like trees being asexuals? The other

00:03:49.544 --> 00:03:56.083
question that I want to ask aro and ases, before you knew that you were asexual or aromantic, did

00:03:56.086 --> 00:04:00.751
you believe that you were heterosexual and heteroromantic due to heteronormativity?
