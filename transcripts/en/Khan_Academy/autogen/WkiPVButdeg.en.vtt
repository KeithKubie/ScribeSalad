00:00:00.107 --> 00:00:01.512
 Draw a rectangle 

00:00:01.512 --> 00:00:03.560
 ABCD in the coordinate plane. 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.962
 The three of the top of the rectangle are the following. 

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:08.249
 The coordinates are given. 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:10.211
 What are the coordinates of point D? 

00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:12.230
 Okay, a good way to get started is like 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.202
 just put these three tips that are given to us. 

00:00:15.202 --> 00:00:17.605
 It seems they are in the first quadrant, so 

00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:21.491
 I will focus the coordinate axes on the first quadrant. 

00:00:21.491 --> 00:00:24.807
 This will be the axis. 

00:00:24.807 --> 00:00:29.288
 And this will be the axis x. 

00:00:29.288 --> 00:00:31.179
 Let's see. 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.648
 The highest x value I have, 

00:00:33.648 --> 00:00:35.521
 I have two, I have five, I have five, 

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:36.723
 it looks like we're going to five. 

00:00:36.723 --> 00:00:38.852
 I could say one, 

00:00:38.852 --> 00:00:43.814
 two, three, four and five. 

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:45.571
 So, that's five, I can just write 

00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:48.621
 one, two, three, four and five. 

00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:50.565
 Let's see, the highest value, 

00:00:50.565 --> 00:00:51.793
 I have one, one and six. 

00:00:51.793 --> 00:00:52.866
 We're up to six. 

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:56.482
 One two Three, 

00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:59.609
 four, five, and six. 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.145
 I can mark them with numbers. 

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:05.818
 One, two, three, four, five and six. 

00:01:05.818 --> 00:01:07.439
 Now let's put the dots. 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.327
 Let us first put point A, which has coordinates two and one. 

00:01:11.327 --> 00:01:14.057
 x is equal to two, y is equal to one. 

00:01:14.057 --> 00:01:16.319
 Hence this is the point. 

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.209
 Now let's apply point B. 

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:22.006
 Point B is at five and one. 

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:24.912
 So x is equal to five, y is equal to one. 

00:01:24.912 --> 00:01:26.655
 That's right there. 

00:01:26.655 --> 00:01:29.084
 Now let us apply point C. 

00:01:29.084 --> 00:01:32.017
 Point C, maybe I have to find another color for her. 

00:01:32.017 --> 00:01:35.387
 Point C is equal to five, equal to six. 

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:39.239
 x is equal to five, y is equal to six. 

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:42.291
 This takes us almost there. 

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:45.878
 And now we have to find where point D will be. 

00:01:45.878 --> 00:01:47.726
 Well D will be ... 

00:01:47.726 --> 00:01:48.806
 This is a rectangle. 

00:01:48.806 --> 00:01:50.611
 The sides are parallel, all the peaks, 

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:52.784
 we have right angles at all peaks. 

00:01:52.784 --> 00:01:57.045
 So point D will have the same x coordinate 

00:01:57.045 --> 00:01:58.728
 such as this point here. 

00:01:58.728 --> 00:02:00.784
 So it will have the same x coordinate. 

00:02:00.784 --> 00:02:03.988
 She will have the coordinate x, let me write it. 

00:02:03.988 --> 00:02:06.270
 D will have the x coordinate in two. 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.471
 And she will have the same coordinate 

00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:10.620
 as this point above. 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.674
 Therefore, it will have a y coordinate equal to six. 

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.785
 Six. 

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:18.339
 So D will be at point two and six. 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:19.267
 You see that by doing this, 

00:02:19.267 --> 00:02:22.390
 we formed a nice rectangle. 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.946
 We can draw a rectangle, 

00:02:23.946 --> 00:02:26.234
 this is one side, this is the upper side, 

00:02:26.234 --> 00:02:29.351
 this is the other side, the other side. 

00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:32.479
 And then draw it this way. 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.799
 Here, we received the rectangle, 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.334
 but more importantly, we have answered the question, 

00:02:35.334 --> 00:02:38.876
 what are the coordinates of point D. OK.
