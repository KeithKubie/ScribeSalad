00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:02.669
MIKE: It's beautiful
out here, isn't it?

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.304
FRANK: Danielle sends us
to a lot of places,

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:06.172
and we're always
on these dirt roads,

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.707
these gravel roads and stuff.

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:11.745
Now she's sending us to a town
that only has six people in it.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.580
MIKE: Oh, yeah,
look at this building!

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.948
FRANK: Oh, this looks good.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:17.717
MIKE: Wow, wow, wow.
Dani hit it with this, man.

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:19.853
FRANK: She did.
MIKE: This is so cool.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:25.392
FRANK: This place
looks good, dude.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:26.760
MIKE: Oh, man, it's incredible.
Are you kidding me?

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.761
FRANK: I know.

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:28.762
MIKE: Hey, you Junior?

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:29.729
FRANK: Junior.
JUNIOR: Yes, sir!

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:30.797
MIKE: Hey, I'm Mike.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.031
Nice to meet you.
JUNIOR: Glad to meet you.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.266
MIKE: Beautiful
country out here.

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.734
JUNIOR: Oh, you bet!
MIKE: That's my buddy, Frank.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:35.802
FRANK: Nice to meet ya.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:36.836
MIKE: Talked to Dani
on the phone?

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:38.037
JUNIOR: Yeah, sure did.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:39.239
MIKE: Oh, man, this
place is beautiful.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.373
How long have you had this?

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.108
JUNIOR: Oh, for several years.
MIKE: Yeah?

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.777
Now, did you run
a business out of here?

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.678
JUNIOR: No, I run
a business next door.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.380
MIKE: Oh, okay,
so the feed store next door.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.418
JUNIOR: I went into the business
of farming and running cattle.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.787
JUNIOR: When I bought this,
there was nothing in here,

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.989
except two display cases.
MIKE: Okay.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.190
JUNIOR: And I...
FRANK: You packed it in.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.092
JUNIOR: I have went everywhere.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:00.727
FRANK: Are you still buying?
JUNIOR: Yes, sir.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.862
JUNIOR: I've always
been interested in

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.665
history, and preserving it.
FRANK: Never leaves you...

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:06.933
MIKE: Frank, he's got
all the oil cans!

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.802
JUNIOR: Penn-Bee is
the best oil can that I have.

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.069
FRANK: This one?
JUNIOR: Yes.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.771
FRANK: The Penn-Bee is the best.
JUNIOR: Yep.

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:13.273
FRANK: When it
comes to oil cans,

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:14.741
I thought I'd seen them all.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.243
FRANK: Is this something
you would sell?

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.412
JUNIOR: Possible,
but I'd have to think about it.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.747
FRANK: A lot of
places we go to,

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.683
the guy pigeonholes himself,
collects one thing.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:26.019
You know, collects toasters
or collects this or that.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.253
This guy's got everything.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.621
MIKE: What about
the piston rings sign?

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.623
Is that something you'd
probably sell, or no?

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:31.724
The Ramco?

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.159
JUNIOR: I probably wouldn't.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.294
MIKE: You wouldn't?
JUNIOR: Nope.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.395
FRANK: He's a historian.

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.497
He likes to keep
this stuff around.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:39.866
MIKE: So, is the Dr. Pepper
piece something you'd sell?

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.068
JUNIOR: That's a local piece.
MIKE: Oh, it is?

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:43.203
JUNIOR: Come out of
this old building

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:44.204
over here on the corner.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:46.272
MIKE: What are you
thinking on this?

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.907
JUNIOR: I don't think you
got enough money to buy it.

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:49.175
MIKE: [laughs]

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.878
JUNIOR: The reason I'm
keeping some of this stuff,

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:53.713
I already have...

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:57.016
several pieces
in our two local museums

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.885
that's on loan.
MIKE: Okay.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:02.755
FRANK: A lot of these items are,
you know, from around this area.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:06.125
And he's been the preserver
of historic items.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.862
If he wouldn't have kept this
stuff, no one would remember it.

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:11.097
JUNIOR: I enjoyed talking
to Frank and Mike.

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:13.399
Both of them have a real
knack for what they do.

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:15.101
MIKE: When Junior
bought these buildings,

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:17.203
he wanted a place to
run his business out of,

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:20.039
and he also wanted a place
to keep his stuff.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.343
But now he's been there
for so many years,

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:25.144
that he's the local historian.
FRANK: You make...

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:26.746
MIKE: Thanks for preserving
your local history.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:27.780
I mean that.
FRANK: Darn right.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.815
MIKE: That's a big deal.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.550
FRANK: You got
a lot of neat stuff.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.985
Appreciate it ever so much.
JUNIOR: Okay.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.854
MIKE: Back when he bought them,
he had no idea

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:37.257
that he would basically
be the curator

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:38.791
of them and the town.

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.360
JUNIOR: Bye!
[Mike honks horn]

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.128
MIKE: Sweet picking, Junior!

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:45.865
