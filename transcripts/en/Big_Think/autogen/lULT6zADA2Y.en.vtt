challenge and we are normally quite good
in getting to the lowest cost solution

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:36.449
in getting to the lowest cost solution
 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:39.110
in getting to the lowest cost solution
so I'm still convinced we will go on the

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120
so I'm still convinced we will go on the
 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.290
so I'm still convinced we will go on the
race to the top but I think it will be a

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.300
race to the top but I think it will be a
 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.159
race to the top but I think it will be a
kind of a volatile bumpy road
