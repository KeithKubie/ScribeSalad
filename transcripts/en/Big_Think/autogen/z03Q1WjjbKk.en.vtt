there are two things to remember about
 

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.370
there are two things to remember about
that the relationship between China and

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:27.380
that the relationship between China and
 

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.050
that the relationship between China and
the United States one is that the

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:29.060
the United States one is that the
 

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.810
the United States one is that the
demographics are about to turn against

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:31.820
demographics are about to turn against
 

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.080
demographics are about to turn against
China quite sharply the the Chinese

China quite sharply the the Chinese
 

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:36.730
China quite sharply the the Chinese

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080
in the more years and subsequently have
 

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.350
in the more years and subsequently have
a really serious demographic imbalance

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360
a really serious demographic imbalance
 

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.530
a really serious demographic imbalance
between the generations and that is

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:44.540
between the generations and that is
 

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.060
between the generations and that is
going to become a major problem as the

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:46.070
going to become a major problem as the
 

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.220
going to become a major problem as the
proportion of Chinese aged more than 65

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:48.230
proportion of Chinese aged more than 65
 

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:50.890

soars in the next two decades they also
 

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.230
soars in the next two decades they also
have a huge gender imbalance and there

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:53.240
have a huge gender imbalance and there
 

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.820
have a huge gender imbalance and there
are some provinces in China where male

infanticide and so forth the second
 

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.520
infanticide and so forth the second
point to remember is that the financial

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:05.530
point to remember is that the financial
 

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:08.169

it's not stable because the Chinese
 

00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:57.610
it's not stable because the Chinese
don't want this mountain to get any

they're looking for alternative routes

this course that they've been on for the
 

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:13.030
this course that they've been on for the
last ten years it's pretty obvious

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040
last ten years it's pretty obvious

what's going to happen that their US

what's going to happen that their US
 

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.510
what's going to happen that their US
dollars are nominated claims at some

all that we have at the same time now if

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:47.180
all that we have at the same time now if
 

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.630
all that we have at the same time now if
you think about what that means the end

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640
you think about what that means the end
 

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.140
you think about what that means the end
of reserve accumulation by China and

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:52.150
of reserve accumulation by China and
 

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.700
of reserve accumulation by China and
possibly a gradual winding down of

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:54.710
possibly a gradual winding down of
 

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:58.450
possibly a gradual winding down of
Chinese exposure to US securities it

00:35:58.450 --> 00:35:58.460
Chinese exposure to US securities it
 

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.460
Chinese exposure to US securities it
means the end of a credit line to the

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:00.470
means the end of a credit line to the
 

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:02.620
means the end of a credit line to the
United States that has been worth there

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:02.630
United States that has been worth there
 

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.870
United States that has been worth there
not a lot to American consumers and

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880
not a lot to American consumers and
 

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.170
not a lot to American consumers and
American investors it means that the

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:08.180
American investors it means that the
 

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.080
American investors it means that the
Chinese support for US government bond

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:11.090
Chinese support for US government bond
 

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:14.140
Chinese support for US government bond
prices is going that means their price

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:14.150
prices is going that means their price
 

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.270
prices is going that means their price
will drop which means that US interest

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280
will drop which means that US interest
 

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.570
will drop which means that US interest
rates will conceivably rise and that of

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:19.580
rates will conceivably rise and that of
 

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:23.230
rates will conceivably rise and that of
course will act as a real dampener on US

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240
course will act as a real dampener on US
 

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.660
course will act as a real dampener on US
recovery prospects when it happens and I

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:25.670
recovery prospects when it happens and I
 

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:28.780
recovery prospects when it happens and I
believe it is happening now so the big

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:28.790
believe it is happening now so the big
 

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:30.970
believe it is happening now so the big
problem for the u.s. is realizing that

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:30.980
problem for the u.s. is realizing that
 

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:34.000
problem for the u.s. is realizing that
this relationship is unwinding when I

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:34.010
this relationship is unwinding when I
 

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:35.800
this relationship is unwinding when I
hear American policymakers talk about

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:35.810
hear American policymakers talk about
 

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:39.130
hear American policymakers talk about
this I still hear the same riff that I

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:39.140
this I still hear the same riff that I
 

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.320
this I still hear the same riff that I
was hearing two or three years ago they

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:41.330
was hearing two or three years ago they
 

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:44.710
was hearing two or three years ago they
need us as much as we need them they

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720
need us as much as we need them they
 

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.290
need us as much as we need them they
can't dispense with us as an export

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:47.300
can't dispense with us as an export
 

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.610
can't dispense with us as an export
market so they're not going to risk

market so they're not going to risk
 

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.380
market so they're not going to risk
destabilizing this relationship I heard

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:50.390
destabilizing this relationship I heard
 

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.060
destabilizing this relationship I heard
that just the other day at Harvard's

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:52.070
that just the other day at Harvard's
 

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.860
that just the other day at Harvard's
Kennedy School and it's profoundly

complacent and wrong the Chinese don't

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240
complacent and wrong the Chinese don't

think of it this way these they see this

00:36:58.210 --> 00:36:58.220
think of it this way these they see this
 

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.400
think of it this way these they see this
as a marriage on the rocks and they are

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:00.410
as a marriage on the rocks and they are
 

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:02.350
as a marriage on the rocks and they are
actively looking if not for another

from this somewhat unreliable and

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:07.370
from this somewhat unreliable and
 

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:14.010
from this somewhat unreliable and
spendthrift American spouse

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:14.020
 

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:17.310
as I said earlier there are many futures

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:17.320
as I said earlier there are many futures
 

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.690
as I said earlier there are many futures
and we don't know which one will happen
