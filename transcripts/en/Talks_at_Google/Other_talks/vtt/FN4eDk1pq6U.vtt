00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.840
JONAH BERGER: So I want
to start with

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.230
a very simple question.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.810
These are three products and
brands that most of you in the

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.810
audience are probably
quite familiar with.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.220
So on the left we have Walt
Disney World, the

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.280
self-described place where
dreams come true; in the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.390
middle, we have Honey Nut
Cheerios, the delicious

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.800
breakfast cereal, which may or
may not cure your cholesterol;

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.830
and on the right we have
Scrubbing Bubbles, the

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.170
bathroom cleaner.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.260
So if you had to guess, which of
these three products do you

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.730
think gets the most
word of mouth?

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.960
Is it Disney World, Cheerios,
or Scrubbing Bubbles?

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.400
And I'm actually going to
ask everybody to vote.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.325
So you want to take
a first guess?

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:36.510
AUDIENCE: I'd say Scrubbing
Bubbles.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.870
JONAH BERGER: Scrubbing
Bubbles.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.200
How many people want to vote
for Scrubbing Bubbles?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.820
OK.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.220
Good.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.580
Somebody else want to take
a different vote?

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.020
Yeah.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.500
AUDIENCE: Disney World.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.040
JONAH BERGER: Disney World.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.260
How people want to
go with Disney?

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.630
OK.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.610
Good.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.860
Anybody else?

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.720
That's it.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.203
OK.

00:00:52.203 --> 00:00:53.170
AUDIENCE: I gotta
say Cheerios.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.830
JONAH BERGER: Okay, you'll
say Cheerios.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.740
You'll be the brave soul.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.210
OK, good.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.970
AUDIENCE: Come on Cheerios.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:56.930
JONAH BERGER: Cheerios.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.020
Good.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.920
I got a couple of people
for Cheerios.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.200
So I want to point out
two things in this.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.250
First, I don't think
we know the answer.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.150
So we went around, about, I'd
say about 45% of the folks

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.550
were for Scrubbing Bubbles,
about 45%

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.490
were for Disney World.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.750
So we're pretty evenly split
among those two.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.430
So we're not really sure
of the answer.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.690
But second, if we did have to
guess-- so how many people

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.580
guessed Disney World?

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.810
That is a really good guess.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.990
It's wrong, but good guess.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.000
Scrubbing Bubbles?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.930
Also an excellent guess,
also wrong.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.620
So the gentleman over here who
is nice enough to stick his

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.970
neck out for me, I appreciate
it, is actually--

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.270
Cheerios gets more word of mouth
than Disney World and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.980
Scrubbing Bubbles.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.320
And this is just one example.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.950
But I think it points to a
broader question, which is why

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.870
do some products and ideas get
talked about more than others?

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.970
You probably heard that word of
mouth is really important,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.340
as we'll talk about in
next couple minutes.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.000
It's more important
than advertising.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.430
But to make it work, we have to
understand why people talk

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.800
about some things rather
than others.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.260
If we want people to talk about
our product or idea, we

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.940
have to understand the science
or the psychology behind

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.390
social transmission.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.670
And so that's what I'm going
to talk about today.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.640
My name is Jonah Berger.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.140
I'm a professor at the Wharton
School, I have this book

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.280
called "Contagious," which
is coming out tomorrow.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.410
I have heard that they've been
nice enough to get some of

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.949
them for you guys at
a reduced cost.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.800
But they're actually
unfortunately not here today.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.300
So if you're interested, they'll
be here tomorrow

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.970
apparently or you can
get it on Amazon or

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:16.890
anywhere else you want.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.870
It'll be in stores tomorrow.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.980
I'm excited to actually
physically

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.760
see it in the store.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.810
So tomorrow will be
exciting day.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.040
Also, everything I'm
going to talk about

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.130
today is research based.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.900
It would be great to be
a social media guru.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.470
I think it's a really fun job.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.500
Apparently, all you have
to do is make guesses

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.490
about what's true.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.760
You don't have to back it up
with data and you just get to

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.300
write about it.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.630
And that sounds fantastic.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.890
But that's actually
not my job.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.090
Wharton would not pay
me if I did that.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.500
So all this is based on academic
research that we and

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.540
others have done in the
past decade or so.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.740
It's all up on my website.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.970
If you're interested, please
go check it out.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.200
And that'll sort of fill in a
lot of the gaps from what I'm

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.570
going to talk about today.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.220
So just to start us out with
that idea that word of mouth

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.480
is important, McKinsey, none
other than McKinsey, because

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.933
people believe what McKinsey
says, has said that word of

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:01.980
mouth generates more than
twice the sales of paid

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.810
advertising in categories as
diverse as skin care and

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.010
mobile phones.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.730
And this probably doesn't come
as a big surprise to folks in

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.840
the audience, but a lot of
research in the past decade or

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.310
so has shown that word
of mouth has a big

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.420
causal impact on sales.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.220
Everything you can imagine, from
online book reviews, so a

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.090
five-star review, increases the
number of books sold by

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.890
about 20, to offline word of
mouth for restaurants and a

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.460
whole host of other products.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.810
Why do you think that word
of mouth is so much more

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.570
effective than advertising,
if you had to guess?

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.860
Yeah?

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.340
AUDIENCE: It's usually
a trusted source.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.950
JONAH BERGER: OK.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.890
So we don't really believe
advertising.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.150
Advertisers say hey, 9 out
of 10 dentists love this

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.800
toothpaste.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.850
You say hold on.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.240
Really?

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.150
9 out of 10 dentists.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.350
I don't know about that.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.660
You never see an ad that says 1
out of 10 dentists like this

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.360
toothpaste, right?

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.990
So you don't trust ads, but
you trust your friends.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.280
Your friends usually have your
best interests at heart.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.220
They're going to help you.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.680
That's good.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.640
That's one reason.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.560
The other reason is word of
mouth is much more targeted.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.830
And now with digital ad
targeting, a lot of the good

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.520
work that Google's doing, it's
easier to target people.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.935
But it's still really hard to
be exactly sure what someone

00:04:03.935 --> 00:04:05.400
is interested in and
when they might be

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.020
interested in that thing.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.140
So if you sell skis for example,
well maybe you say,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.820
OK, I'm going to buy some words

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.030
related to skis on keywords.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.130
That'll get you sort of close.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.370
Because it may not be
still people who are

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.640
looking to buy skis.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.310
Maybe you get buy skis and
that's even closer.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.690
Or you average in a ski
magazine, but a whole bunch of

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.660
people who are reading that
magazine might not actually be

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.530
in the market for skis
at the moment.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.720
So what word of mouth does is
it's really, really targeted.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.070
So if you don't have a baby,
no one's going to tell you

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.970
about baby products.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.490
If you don't like spicy food, no
one's going to talk to you

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.880
about a restaurant that has
really great spicy food.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.980
Word of mouth is like a
searchlight that works through

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.760
your social network to find the
person that might be most

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.120
interested in a particular
product or idea.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.820
So a really nice example of
this that happened to me a

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.350
couple years ago, publishers
often send academics

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.530
books in the mail.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.540
They're hoping that we'll read
those books and assign them to

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.810
our classes.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.850
And so I got a book in the
mail from a publisher.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.800
But they didn't actually send
one, they actually sent two

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.800
books, two copies of
the same book.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.690
Now let me tell you, the second
copy is not any better

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.240
than the first.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.660
It was the exact same book.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.540
So why would they do that?

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.230
Well, they sent that second book
and they said Professor

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.190
Berger, we think you'll
like this book.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.320
And if you do, please share it
with a friend of yours might

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.630
like it as well.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.360
And so that's this old

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.970
sociological idea of homophily.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.660
We tend to be friends of people
that are similar to us.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.010
If you like football,
you tend to have

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.110
friends who like football.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.520
If you like opera, you tend to
have friends that like opera.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.030
And so if you like something,
you probably know other people

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.940
that would like that as well.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.000
And that's the targeting benefit
of word of mouth and

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.275
social media more generally,
finding people that are going

00:05:31.275 --> 00:05:33.880
to interested in it, who can
help you find other people

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.150
that are interested in it.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.430
That's why the referral benefits
are so useful.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.960
The customer lifetime value of
customers referred through

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.540
social networks is much higher
than traditional customers

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.680
because it helps people find the
people that will be most

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.730
interested.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.270
OK, great.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.690
So we like word of mouth.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.670
Let's jump on the bandwagon.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.100
How do we get it?

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.930
And indeed, there's been a lot
of interest lately in social

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.100
media channels.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.930
If you had to guess though, how
much word of mouth do you

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.595
think is over social media?

00:05:57.595 --> 00:06:01.280
So it's over things like
Facebook, like Twitter, online

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.760
interviews.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.280
What percent of word of mouth is
online, compared to offline

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.134
being face to face?

00:06:07.134 --> 00:06:08.040
AUDIENCE: 20.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.010
JONAH BERGER: 20.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.920
20.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.890
AUDIENCE: 25.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.345
JONAH BERGER: 25.

00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:14.840
AUDIENCE: 5.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.230
JONAH BERGER: 5.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.110
We'll do---

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.860
AUDIENCE: 40.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.160
JONAH BERGER: 40.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.210
I feel like auctioneer up here.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.490
10?

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.040
Do I hear 20, 25, 30, 30?

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.210
It's actually 7.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.500
So not 70, not 17, 7.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.410
So the 5 was pretty close.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.210
And if we think about why that
is though, we can think about

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.920
why we think there's so much
online word of mouth.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.300
Hardly a the day goes by where
we see an article, like we

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.250
don't see an article about it
in the paper, oh Facebook is

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.920
doing this, Twitter is doing
this, Google+ is doing this.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.220
There's some new site we need
to pay attention to.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.300
And further there's a
record of all the

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.420
things we share online.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.690
We can go back and look at
those things we shared.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.660
But if you think about what
you did in the five or 10

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.770
minutes before you were waiting
for me to talk or even

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.570
when you were out in the
hallway, you were probably

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.200
talking to someone else
and you were probably

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.720
talking face to face.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.280
You don't sit in a meeting
and tweet back and

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.470
forth to each other.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.400
You have a face-to-face
conversation.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.280
And so much more word of mouth
is actually offline.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.590
And I think the second problem
with focusing so much on these

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.450
is we think about the technology
rather than the

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.480
psychology.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.300
So everyone probably
remembers Myspace.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.070
A few years ago, you could have
decided you're going to

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.060
be a Myspace expert.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.510
You're going to put all your
eggs in the basket of Myspace,

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:17.460
understand how it works.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.460
That's great.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.280
And now how useful would
that expertise be?

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:21.720
AUDIENCE: Not really.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.080
JONAH BERGER: Not
really, right?

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.490
We've moved on to
something else.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.360
And so if Facebook is here in
10 years, maybe, maybe not.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.910
Twitter is here in 10 years,
maybe, maybe not.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.150
A couple of years ago,
it was Foursquare

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.240
was the new hot thing.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.930
Now, everyone's talking
about Pinterest.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.800
Technologies will come and go.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.010
Why people share things will
pretty much stay the same, the

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.520
same psychological drivers
of sharing.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.820
And so we need to understand
why people talk and share.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.100
And that brings me
to this picture.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.790
This is a cat playing
a turntable.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:48.940
It's not actually a turntable.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.490
It's a sort of cat
scratching post.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.540
But anyone have any idea why
I have this in my talk?

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.590
Why a talk on virality has to
have a picture of cats in it.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:00.222
What?

00:08:00.222 --> 00:08:01.400
AUDIENCE: People share
them a lot.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:01.690
JONAH BERGER: Yeah.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.230
So there's a theory out there
that people share things

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.190
because they have pictures
of cats in them.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.080
So you go on the web, one of
the most prevalent theories

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:09.970
oh, why do things go viral?

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.030
Because of cats.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.070
So this cat picture
is fantastic.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.850
It's got to go viral because
it has cats in it.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.420
Now, obviously that
logic is flawed.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.810
It's flawed for a
couple reasons.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.260
First, it's like noticing that
Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, and

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.390
Bill Cosby are all famous.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.220
And so you decide to name your
child Bill because well,

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.550
getting the name Bill must be
the route to fame and fortune.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.039
Certainly, there are some
kind cat videos

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.030
that are great, right?

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.940
That are very viral,
that people share.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.320
But that doesn't explain
why some are

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.720
shared and others aren't.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.299
And it doesn't tell us anything
about non-cat videos,

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.120
most other things that's
shared on the web.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.830
So I'm actually going to put
an X unfortunately through

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.250
this cute picture of a cat
playing on a turntable.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.800
And instead, I'm going
to put this up.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.060
And this is supposed
to be science.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.530
I couldn't find a better
image for science.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.410
But this is what I would
call science.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.180
So we've studied things
like why "New York

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.840
Times" articles go viral.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.790
We've gotten all the articles
released by "The New York

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.690
Times" over a six-month period,
over 7,000 articles,

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.470
to look at why certain articles
make the most emailed

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.000
list and why others don't.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.360
We've analyze over 500 products
and brands to look at

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.700
why certain products get more
word of mouth than others.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.270
We've looked at YouTube videos,
a whole host of

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.960
different types of content.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.390
And based on these insights
we've seen again and again

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.620
that certain principles
both drive

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.110
people to talk and share.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.490
Unfortunately, it's not cats.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.507
But these principles can help
us explain why cats and a

00:09:23.507 --> 00:09:26.590
broad variety of things are
talked about and share.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.320
And so what I'm going to do
today is share a little bit of

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.060
the insights from the book.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.880
And the book has a
framework in it.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.860
And what it is essentially
is a recipe, a recipe for

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.080
engineering content to make
it more viral or talkable.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.920
And people at this point usually
say well, hold on.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.130
Can you guarantee that something
will go viral?

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.880
We can't guarantee that
something will go viral.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.440
I can't guarantee that by
reading this book you will be

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.720
the next "Gangnam Style"
with a billion views.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.080
That's what everyone
wants to know.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.430
But what I can guarantee is more
people will talk about

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.080
and share your idea.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.800
A useful analogy here sort of
like a batting average.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.700
Can you guarantee you're going
to hit a home run every time?

00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.540
No.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.300
But to the degree you can
improve your batting average,

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.680
you're increasing the chance
that you get a hit each time.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.900
That's what these principles
can do.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.830
They can increase the chance
that people talk about and

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.080
share your ideas.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.690
From 9 people to 10 people,
from-- if you think about a

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.860
virality coefficient, the viral
coefficient, getting

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.780
that number up above 1.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.400
And so what I'm going to talk
about is how to craft

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.930
contagious content.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.330
By content, I both mean the
messages we wrap around our

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.930
products, but also how we build
the products themselves

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.240
for viral growth.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.040
Thinking how to make the
products more talkable and

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.440
shareable and how we design both
websites, as well as the

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.850
product themselves, to be
something people will pass on.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.550
By contagious, I mean that old
idea of spreading from person

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.470
to person, just like
a virus might.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.550
But the first idea here is
actually the most important

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.430
one, the first word, and
that is the word craft.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.450
So you might think that you can
only do this for certain

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:44.720
types of products.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.510
So someone this weekend shared
Google Glass with me, Google

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.160
Glass, Glasses, Glass,
Glasses?

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.340
Glass, really a cool product.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.900
That is a naturally remarkable
product that people are going

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.970
to talk up because it has some
of these characters naturally.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:58.920
But you might say, hold on.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.220
I'm working on a product
that not that exciting.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.270
So I do exec ad sessions
sometimes where someone will,

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.330
say I sell cement.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.320
How can I make people talk
about and share cement?

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.320
And what I'm going to talk about
is how these same ideas

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.140
can be used to sell cement,
toilet paper, network

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.300
software, whatever you want.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.890
Pick your most boring product,
by following these principles

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.820
you can craft that product or
that idea to make it more

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.670
talkable or shareable.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.090
And finally, the last
thing I want to say

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.010
here is quite important.

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:29.400
We're going focus in our next
few minutes that we have left

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.560
on the message, not
the messenger.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.790
So how many of you heard the
idea of influentials, or

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.160
opinion leaders, or mavens,
connectors, salesmen, those

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.150
sorts of ideas?

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.860
So that's a really
compelling idea.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.270
So about a decade ago, Malcolm
Gladwell came out with a

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.570
famous book called "The Tipping
Point," great book,

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:44.810
extremely well written.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.670
But about half of what is
in that book is wrong.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.870
And many in the audience
probably have

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:50.740
realized that already.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.040
My job as an academic is to
figure out what's right there

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.110
and what's wrong.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.160
And we focus so much on special
people, the messenger

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.490
of our ideas, we said if we can
just find those hipsters

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.150
in the East Village
and get them our

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.830
product, well we're done.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:03.930
Then it's going to catch on.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.420
But by focusing so much on the
messenger, we've ignored

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.930
something else that's really,
really important and that is

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.120
the message.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.080
Lots of people don't have
millions of friends or

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.920
millions of followers, yet
they talk about and share

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.360
things all the time.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.520
And so we need to understand the
psychology of talking and

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.690
sharing to make people share our
stuff, whether they have

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.510
10 friends or 10,000, whether
they're really persuasive or

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.160
not persuasive at all.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.690
It's sort of like thinking about
the difference between

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:26.720
jokes and joke tellers.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.920
So we probably all have a friend
who's a really good

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.760
joke teller.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.390
When they tell a joke at the
party, everybody laughs.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.300
But there are certain jokes that
are funny regardless of

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.500
who tells them.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.480
And that's a difference
between the

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.320
message and the messenger.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.780
How we can create content that
people are going to share

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.390
regardless of who's
doing the sharing.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.110
So there are six key
STEPPS in the book.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.760
Each of these is a
research-based principal.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.090
I'll talk about that recipe, one
of the ingredients in the

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.230
recipe for talking
and sharing.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.790
I don't have time today to
talk about all of them.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.100
But I'll pick maybe one or two,
depending on how much

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.470
time we have, and see how
many we get through.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.380
I'll pick a fun one that relates
to you guys, I think.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.590
So I think I'll talk
about triggers.

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.300
But I'll give you a sense
of what the others are.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.180
And if you're interested,
there's a whole fantastic book

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.260
out there that you can
read to find out

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.600
about the rest of them.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.760
So I won't talk about
social currency.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.820
I will talk about triggers and
maybe I'll talk about stories,

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.840
depending if there's time.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.030
How many of you guys know
about Please Don't

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.600
Tell, by the way?

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.780
A couple people.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.410
If you don't know about Please
Don't Tell, ask someone who

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:24.440
raised their hand.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.820
It's a great example
of this principle

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.180
called social currency.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:27.980
I talk about it in the book.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.920
But basically, people talk about
and share things to make

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.240
them look good.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.690
I'll tell you, you know what,
I'll tell you the Please Don't

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:33.470
Tell story.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:35.370
Because it's a good one and
it's a New York one.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:39.130
So imagine you're down in the
Village one weekend, maybe

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:40.275
it's this weekend.

00:13:40.275 --> 00:13:41.490
It's Saturday afternoon.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.110
You're looking for something to
eat, you're hungry, you're

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.300
hanging out with your friends,
when you notice a hot dog

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.230
restaurant.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.330
It seems pretty cool.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.150
You like hot dogs.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.870
You walk downstairs inside to
this place called Crif Dogs, a

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:55.150
delicious hot dog restaurant,
gingham tablecloths, huge menu

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.710
in the back to die for.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.100
It's got a breakfast hot dog
with eggs, bacon, and cheese;

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.150
another hot dog with green
onions and pineapple on top,

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.010
sort of interesting flavors; and
the traditional New York

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.190
water dog, with ketchup
and mustard.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:08.740
So you're sitting there.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.760
You're enjoying your hot dog.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.280
You finish it.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.470
When you notice over in the
corner here is what looks like

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.530
a phone booth, sort of what
Clark Kent would change into

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:17.996
to turn into Superman.

00:14:17.996 --> 00:14:20.280
So you say, I haven't been in
a phone in a long time.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.230
They're sort of endangered
species nowadays.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.350
Let me go check it out.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.170
So you walk over, you slide open
the doors, and you walk

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:27.450
inside this phone booth.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.340
It's a little cramped,
tight space.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.440
But you notice on the
wall is a phone.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.780
And it's not a recent, sort
of payphone looking thing.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.300
It's a rotary dial phone.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.975
Ones you have to stick
your finger in and

00:14:36.975 --> 00:14:38.380
dial around in a circle.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.380
Just for kicks, hold the
phone to your ear and

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.040
dial the number 2.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.220
And someone will pick up the
other line and they will ask

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.080
you whether you have
a reservation.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.780
Reservation, I'm in a phone
booth inside of a hot dog

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.180
restaurant.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.180
What would I have a
reservation for?

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.880
But if you're lucky and they
have space, the back of this

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.580
will open and you'll be let
into a secret bar called

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.530
Please Don't Tell.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.550
Now, for those who have of
Please Don't Tell, it's a fun

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:04.110
experience.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.710
I've been there a couple
times myself.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:06.900
But they have violated a lot of

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.480
traditional laws of marketing.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.690
There's no sign on the street.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.620
There's no sign in
the restaurant.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.890
They have made it really
hard to get into.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.860
Yet they've never advertised
and if you've ever tried to

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.520
call there, you know it's
really hard to get a

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.660
reservation.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.540
Phones open at 3:00
PM for that day.

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.400
By 3:30, they're all gone.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.880
People hit redial again and
again to try to get through.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.100
Really hard to get through,
so many people calling.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.150
So what did they do to
make them successful?

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.740
Well if you notice, they did
something really cute.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.880
They made themselves a secret.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.720
And if you think about secrets,
someone tells you a

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.415
secret, what's the first thing
you do with that information?

00:15:39.415 --> 00:15:40.720
AUDIENCE: You tell everyone.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.330
JONAH BERGER: You tell
everyone else.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.450
They tell you not to tell and
what do you do, you turn

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.920
around and you tell
someone else.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.150
Because the fact that it seems
like a secret makes that

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.210
information seem better and it
makes you look really good by

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.190
sharing it.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.410
You go to that cool bar, you
tell someone else about it,

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.570
you look like you're
an insider.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.230
You look like you're
in the know.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.190
And that's this idea
of social currency.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.530
Just like the car we drive and
the clothes we wear, the

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.420
things we say affect how
other people see us.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.950
And so we talk about and share
things that give us status by

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.200
association.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.680
Things like cool bars, but
also cool information of

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:14.430
restaurants that make us look
smart and in the know.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:15.260
I won't share this.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:15.930
I'll skip this.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.580
I was going to show you guys--
have seen Will It Blend?

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.780
Yeah, people have
seen it blend.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.320
OK, I'll skip that one then,
because that's sort of fun.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.290
We'll talk about triggers though
and then I'll open it

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:25.950
up to questions.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:26.950
Triggers is I think--

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:28.970
social currency is a little
pretty intuitive concept.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.990
Triggers are a little bit
more counterintuitive.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.680
Everyone knows Rebecca
Black, yes?

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.450
So many people have argued
that this is

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.110
the worst song ever.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.050
I will play you, in case you
haven't heard of it before,

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.340
I'll play about 10
seconds of it.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.310
That I think it's about what
everybody can stand.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.560
[MUSIC - REBECCA BLACK,
"FRIDAY LYRICS"]

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.600
JONAH BERGER: OK.

00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:03.160
Good.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.450
So we've all heard
this song before.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.560
People have argued that this is
the worst song ever, which

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.520
in itself is a bit of
an accomplishment.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.150
If you could truly make the
worst song ever, that would be

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.190
quite impressive.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.430
So one question was that if this
song is so bad, why did

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.089
so many people watch it?

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:23.420
This song was one of the most
viral videos of 2011, over 300

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.849
million views at this point.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:25.770
Why?

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.030
And I was actually giving a
talk to a bunch of Google

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.770
executives a couple years ago,
when one of your colleagues

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.360
raised their hand and said hey,
Professor Berger, your

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.450
framework is great.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:35.350
But if it can't explain Rebecca
Black, it's not

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.710
really worth it.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.080
If you can't explain this, come
on, what are you doing?

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.490
And then someone from YouTube
said hold on, I think your

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.510
framework can explain
Rebecca Black.

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.990
So they showed me
this nice data.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.810
And this searches for Rebecca
Black over time.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.870
What you notice is it
goes up, big spike.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.515
So then it tails off,
less interest.

00:17:53.515 --> 00:17:56.860
Then it goes up again,
down, up again.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.800
There's a spike.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.860
You probably can't see it.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.390
But it's a spike every
seven days.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.450
Every seven days is a
spike in attention.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.470
Now, this song is equally bad
every day of the week.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:09.210
I checked.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.450
I've listened to it on Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.760
Saturday, Sunday, and
Friday, equally bad.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.460
Yet Friday is an environmental
reminder to think about that

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.580
song and to share
it with others.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.460
And that's what I'll
call a trigger.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.690
It's a cue, a stimulus in the
environment that triggers us

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.480
to think about something else.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.050
And maybe you hear that
something is top-of-mind, like

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.550
Friday makes us think about
Rebecca Black's song, it's

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.020
going to be tip-of-tongue.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.835
Not only are you going to be
more likely to watch that song

00:18:33.835 --> 00:18:36.420
or purchase a product if it is
a product, but you're gong to

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.250
be more likely to share it
with others because it's

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.610
top-of-mind.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.480
So usage is one thing that
makes a product or idea

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.370
top-of-mind.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.770
By top-of-mind, I basically what
are you thinking about?

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.870
So right now, you're probably
thinking about hopefully the

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.350
talk, what you just had for
lunch, or what you're doing

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:51.000
afterwards.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.460
You're probably not really
thinking about what you're

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.280
going to for summer vacation or
what you're going to do for

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:54.800
the holidays.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.220
Those things are lower
down on your list.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.120
But using a product is one
thing that can make it

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.580
top-of-mind.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:04.180
This is Twitter traffic for
Cheerios by time of day.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.790
And not rocket science, what
you see is not much around

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:07.890
midnight, 2:00 AM, 4:00 AM.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:09.550
6:00 AM, it starts going up.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.300
Around 8:00 AM, lots of people
are talking about Cheerios.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.085
Then it goes down again
throughout the day.

00:19:14.085 --> 00:19:15.910
And what that's saying
is people eat

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:16.700
Cheerios in the morning.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.070
It's making that product
top-of-mind.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.470
It's making it more likely to
talk about it and share it.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.055
Notice what happens
on the weekend?

00:19:22.055 --> 00:19:23.640
It shifts a little bit
to the right because

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.980
we all wake up later.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.710
So we actually analyzed both
data from Cheerios, as well as

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:29.300
Walt Disney World.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.680
That's the problem with
Disney World.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.760
How many people have been
to Disney this year?

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.790
A couple.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.170
That's the exact problem.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.520
We don't go very often and
there's nothing in the

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.110
environment to remind us that
the product exists.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.020
So when people come back,
they talk about a lot.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.090
But they don't keep talking
about it because there's no

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.850
trigger to remind them of
them of the product.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.570
Cheerios is really boring,
extremely boring.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.150
But we eat breakfast,
last time I checked.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.830
At least once a day.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.270
Some of us, we really like
cereal, maybe even twice.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.140
And if you don't eat Cheerios,
you wheel your cart through

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.580
the grocer isle and see that
box once or twice a week.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.690
And because you're seeing it,
it's more top-of-mind.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.500
And you might say well hold on,
is usage is the only thing

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.290
that makes a product
top-of-mind?

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.020
So do related cues.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.430
So if I said peanut
butter and--

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:12.310
jelly, right?

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.440
Or if I said rum and--

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:13.990
AUDIENCE: Coke.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:15.010
JONAH BERGER: Coke.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:18.010
Notice that the word jelly and
the word Coke aren't up there.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.740
But the word peanut butter
is like a little

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.690
advertisement for jelly.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.400
If someone says cat,
you think of dog.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.360
If someone says peanut butter,
you think of jelly.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.650
It triggers related ideas in our
minds because those things

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:29.760
are connected.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.620
Michelob used this idea of a
couple years ago with their

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.620
slogan, "Weekends are Made for
Michelob." Their idea was hey,

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.640
we're going to link the product

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.340
to a time, the weekend.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.260
So when the weekend rolls
around, people hopefully think

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.940
about consuming the product.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.860
Every time the weekend rolls
around and I want a beer, I'm

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.220
going to think about Michelob.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.150
Corona has tried to do the same
thing with the beach.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.560
When you're on a beach vacation,
it's really hard not

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.150
to think about ordering
Corona.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.620
You have to sort of stop
yourself and say hold on, I

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.150
should order something else.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.660
But they have done a really good
job of owning the beach.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.160
Beer and the beach, you
think about Corona.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.320
Weekends and the beach,
hopefully

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.310
you think about Michelob.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.900
So in terms of applying this
concept, you need to consider

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:04.970
the context.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.280
You think about the cues or
triggers that are around your

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.660
consumers that they
might come around.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.070
So one of my favorite examples
of this comes with cats.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.250
So if you a the cat and your cat
is hungry, what's your cat

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.890
going to say?

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:21.140
Meow, which is why Meow Mix is
a great name for a cat food.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.260
Every time your cat goes meow,
you're more likely to think

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.630
about that thing.

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.260
But you need to think
about your specific

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.550
customers, your consumers.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:30.000
So there's a restaurant in
Philadelphia called Barclay

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.640
Prime that has a $100
cheesesteak.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.830
A $100 cheesesteak, right?

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.650
It has Kobe beef, it has
lobster, it has truffles.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.680
It comes with a little
bottle of champagne.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.680
Basically, the most opulent
thing you can think of.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.630
Huge, hugely expensive, I
had never had it myself.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.960
Fast Company did a piece
on me and the book.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.130
The writer took me
out to dinner.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.080
She asked where I'd
like to go.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.580
I said, let's go to Berkeley
Prime and have the $100

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.300
cheesesteak on Fast Company.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.120
So she was nice enough
to take me there.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.640
But if you think about it, why
is $100 cheesesteak good for

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.520
Philly in terms of triggers.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.850
Because Philly has a
lot of cheesesteak.

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:05.220
So every time you think of a
cheesesteak, you might think

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.350
about this remarkable
cheesesteak.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.450
Whereas a $100 cheesesteak is
now so good for a restaurant

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:10.280
in New York.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.880
Because you don't think about
cheesesteaks very often here.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.080
And so depending on what
environment you live in, what

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.610
you see, what you hear, what
you smell is different.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.980
Women may have certain cues
that men don't have.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.530
Older people have certain cues
the young people don't have.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.160
Think about the environment
that people live in, it is

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.290
important to think about the
right triggers to link our

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:27.460
product to.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.960
And then the second thing is
just growing your habitat.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.370
So just like animals have a
habitat, a set of things in

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.960
the environment they need to
survive, so deer have, they

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.790
need water and certain
things to eat.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.840
Ideas have a habitat, a set of
cues or triggers that make

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.280
people think about them.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.110
And so Kit Kat did a
really good job of

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.455
growing their habitat.

00:22:45.455 --> 00:22:47.750
So you might say Kit Kat,
I really like those.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.750
But they were having a problem
a few years ago when no one

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:50.830
would think about
their product.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.610
Everyone loved it, but they'd
never think about eating it.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:54.610
And so they did a really simple

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.760
campaign, Kit Kat and coffee.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.800
Think about having coffee,
have a Kit Kat.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.450
Every time you take a coffee
break, have a Kit Kat.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.940
They were linking those
two things together.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.920
Why is coffee a really good
trigger for Kit Kat?

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.720
AUDIENCE: So people would
have it often.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.870
JONAH BERGER: People
have it often.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.780
You know really, really
prevalent, really frequent.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.400
You have coffee multiple times
a day, it's a good time to

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.480
think about a Kit Kat.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.230
So the Michelob slogan was
actually originally, that one

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.120
Weekends are Made for Michelob,
was originally

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.240
Holidays are Made
for Michelob.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.420
Same issue, if you think
about it, right?

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.040
Holidays don't come
up as frequently.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.460
It's like a Rebecca Black song
was "Leap Day," leap day, leap

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.820
day, something, something,
leap day.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.400
Equally catchy or not catching,
my karaoke voice is

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.760
not good as you can tell.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.130
But much less frequently
triggered by the environment.

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:40.110
And because of that, it's not
going to come up as often.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.910
There was a song around
Thanksgiving

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:42.990
that some girl had.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.670
I don't know if you saw it.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:45.600
She was singing into
a turkey leg.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.870
Similar sort of song,
the traffic before

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.090
Thanksgiving was great.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:51.610
Since Thanksgiving, basically
nothing because there's no

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.130
trigger in the environment to
make them think about it.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:53.410
Yeah?

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:57.430
AUDIENCE: So does something like
coffee get that effect

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:01.060
just by a virtue of being
called coffee break?

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.460
JONAH BERGER: You're saying why
is that a good trigger to

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.187
link it to?

00:24:03.187 --> 00:24:06.770
AUDIENCE: So Kit Kat had to
create the campaign to link--

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.530
JONAH BERGER: To link the two
together, Kit Kats and coffee.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:09.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
get that for free.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:09.950
JONAH BERGER: Yeah.

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.380
So Rebecca Black got
it for free.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.300
Rebecca Back got it for free
because she called her song

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.020
"Friday." That didn't
cost her any money.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.020
She just designed a song
around the cue in the

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:19.950
environment.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.300
The same thing with
Barclay Prime.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.540
Barclay Prime took advantage
of the environment with the

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.470
$100 cheesesteak.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.330
There was already the
$100 cheesesteak.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.460
Now, when people think about
other cheesesteaks, they think

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.170
about that one.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.900
You're right here that Kit Kat
had to spend some money to

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:32.980
link those things.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.940
And so you can either design
your product to take advantage

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.290
of existing triggers or you
can through advertising or

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.780
other methods, repeatedly link
two things together.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.840
I won't go through the rest of
the framework because I know

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.950
we're short on time.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.510
I'll just mention that
the book talks

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:46.490
about things like emotion.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:47.920
So when we care, we share.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.270
It's actually not true that all
emotions increase sharing.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:52.480
Some emotions increase it and
some actually decrease it.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.225
So if you're interested, the
book talks about that.

00:24:56.225 --> 00:24:58.990
I won't show you the good
Google example with--

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:03.400
you guys did a really nice piece
with one of your ads.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:03.930
Public--

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.260
it's basically the idea of when
we see something, we're

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.710
more like to imitate it.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.410
We can't imitate something
we can't see.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:10.810
So I see a lot of people around

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.300
here using Apple computers.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.995
Originally, the logo
was the other way.

00:25:13.995 --> 00:25:16.240
It actually faced upside down
when it showed to other

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.460
people, because it was meant
to be the North Star.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.510
When you open up your computer
from your bag, you need to

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.270
figure out which way the logo is
facing to figure out how to

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:25.000
take it out facing you.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.580
So they used to have if the logo
is facing you, the user,

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:28.670
it's easy to see.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.890
It's like a compass, really
easy to orient.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.270
But they actually flipped the
logo, making it harder for the

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.770
user to figure out which side
is up, to make it easier for

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.120
other people to see.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.220
Because we like to imitate
others, we often imitate

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.720
others, but we can't imitate
them if we can't see them.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.770
So we talk a lot about making
things public and different

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.620
ways to do that.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:48.090
Practical value is just news you
can use, basically useful

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:49.940
information.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.010
And finally, stories build on
this idea of a Trojan horse.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.190
Basically almost all stories
are Trojan horses.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:59.750
They carry information, brands,
benefits inside

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.580
So have you ever seen that
famous Will It Blend ad,

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.090
that's a great Trojan horse.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.840
People don't share that because
they want to advertise

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.340
Will it Blend, they share
it because the

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.670
content is really great.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.400
But Will It Blend comes
along for the ride.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.690
It's hidden inside that
broader message.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.330
People are sharing the good
story, but Will It Blend comes

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.300
along and gets benefit from
that particular story.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:23.450
So I will wrap up here and
I'll take questions.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.810
I won't show you Panda--
has anyone seen Panda

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:26.260
cheese, by the way?

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:26.670
You have--

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:27.330
OK.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:28.710
Talk to her if you haven't
seen Panda cheese

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:29.470
or talk to me after.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.940
It's one-- you know what, I'll
show you Panda cheese.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.580
There's time for Panda
cheese, right?

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.150
Yeah, OK.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.180
A really great example.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.270
Here's another good example of
a Trojan horse, a story or

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:39.585
message that's not a
direct advertising.

00:26:39.585 --> 00:26:40.690
But it is an ad.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.080
But it does a really good
job of carrying the

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.832
brand for the ride.

00:26:43.832 --> 00:26:46.990
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:48.230
-Would you like some
Panda cheese?

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:49.480
No thanks, I'm not hungry.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.800
-Never Say No to Panda.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.810
I'm going to show you
a couple of these

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:16.710
because they get better.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.640
-Good morning, good morning.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.710
I got you Panda cheese
for breakfast.

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:22.960
-No thanks, I don't feel well.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.270
-Never Say No to Panda.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:54.240
-Here's the best one.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.550
Dad, why don't we get
some Panda cheese?

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:56.800
Enough, that's too
much already.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:22.900
Never Say No to Panda.

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:29.610
-And last, but not least.

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:30.860
Dad, why don't we
get some Panda?

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.410
Get one.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.970
Get one more.

00:28:48.046 --> 00:28:48.510
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:50.630
JONAH BERGER: OK, so
I always close with

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:52.110
this ad for two reasons.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.970
One, it's really remarkable.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:53.640
It's really funny.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.970
And humor is one thing
that drives sharing.

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:59.006
But this ad would be equally
funny if it had a pet guy in a

00:28:59.006 --> 00:29:00.860
giraffe suite or an alligator
suit or sort of a brand like

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.320
Joe's Used Cars.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.180
People in suits, kicking stuff,
jumping on groceries,

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.420
and pulling the plug
on patients in the

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.650
hospital are all funny.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:11.270
Why this is a great example is
because you can't tell the

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.010
story without talking
about a panda.

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.660
I challenge you to tell someone
else about this ad

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.310
without talking about Panda,
which is the brand they want

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:20.630
you to remember.

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:22.320
They figured out how to
make it an integral

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.670
detail to the story.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:24.720
This ad is a Trojan horse.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.100
It's not just funny.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.180
There's a cute exterior,
a candy shell.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.390
But along the way, the brand
comes for the ride.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.550
And so it's not just about doing
things that are crazy.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.640
It's about figuring out a way to
build messages that people

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.090
want to share, but your
idea comes along.

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:39.890
So just to summarize, then I'll
take questions, word of

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:41.920
mouth increases sales.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.990
But to make it work for you,
you need to understand what

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:47.070
makes things talkable or
sharable, why we talk about

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.780
some things rather
than others.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.260
And so very briefly, we found
six key steps, six key

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.620
principles that drive people
to talk and share.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.500
There's social currency, that
idea of status by association.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.570
We talk about things that make
us look like insiders.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.070
That make us look
good or smart,

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:02.530
rather than bad or dumb.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.590
Triggers or cues in
the environment.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.710
Rebecca Black, not rocket
science, but viewed more on

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.210
Friday because that's a trigger
to make it top-of-mind

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:11.970
and make people more likely to
think about it and share it.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.560
Emotion, when we
care, we share.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.840
But some emotions we share
more than others.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.270
Public.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:17.530
Again, that idea of
being publicly

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:19.310
visible increases imitation.

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:22.080
Apple did a great job about
making their headphones white.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.840
Now, you can look at how many
people have white headphones

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.360
and use that as a signal of
quality for whether or not I

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.970
should buy that product.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.040
Practical value, news
you can use.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.220
And finally stories building a
Trojan horse or a vessel that

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.160
carries your information.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.410
Thank you guys, very much.

00:30:40.395 --> 00:30:42.510
I want to make sure to stay
within my time, but I'm happy

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:44.431
to take any and all
questions now.

00:30:44.431 --> 00:30:44.882
Yeah?

00:30:44.882 --> 00:30:46.913
AUDIENCE: First of all, I was
in your session a few years

00:30:46.913 --> 00:30:49.240
ago with [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.094
JONAH BERGER: Oh good,
no problem.

00:30:51.094 --> 00:30:52.990
AUDIENCE: So a problem that I'm
working on right now, so

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:55.520
you say that the problem with
Walt Disney is you don't

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.180
experience it enough.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.440
JONAH BERGER: Yes.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.410
AUDIENCE: The problem I'm
working on is actually the

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:00.970
opposite problem.

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:04.535
I've been trying to get people
to appreciate how awesome the

00:31:04.535 --> 00:31:06.293
internet is.

00:31:06.293 --> 00:31:08.270
Which it seems like it's simple,
but like we live in it

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:11.330
so much that we only think about
the internet like when

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.646
it's broken or when it's
not really working.

00:31:13.646 --> 00:31:16.940
So given the framework that
you're building, like how do

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.850
you get us aware of-- like how
you do an ad campaign for

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:21.890
oxygen or these sorts of
things that are so--

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:22.680
JONAH BERGER: A commodity.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.890
Or like you only think about the
water at your house when

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:26.920
it goes off or the power
when it goes off.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.970
But I think you just pointed out
a really great point about

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:30.510
your message.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:33.140
What if you could communicate
people what it would be like

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.530
if the internet went off?

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.120
So not actually have them
experience that and have them

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.020
be upset when it's slow, but
have them mentally simulate

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.770
what that would be like.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:42.980
So you could imagine showing a
campaign which shows what it

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.740
would be like if the
internet was down.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.950
So using analogies is a really
helpful way to get people to

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:48.980
understand something.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.850
So try to get them to experience
what that would be

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.115
like, even without having them
experience themselves.

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:57.080
Bing is obviously trying
to steal some

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:57.850
space from you guys.

00:31:57.850 --> 00:31:59.920
But they tried to do that
recently with their experience

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.560
the speed difference between
Bing and Google, allow people

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.010
to not only say well, OK,
Bing could say hey, we

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:06.210
have a great product.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:07.270
But you guys would say
oh, I don't know

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.370
if it's really great.

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:10.670
Whereas if they can show you,
you'd actually experience it.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.020
So how could you make people
experience what life would be

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.380
like when the internet was down,
either rhetorically or

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.460
actually experience
it in some way?

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:19.640
And encourage them
to use that.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.300
I mean imagine if you had an ad
that just reminded people

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.300
what it was like during
dial-up time.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.470
Remember how frustrating
that is?

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:27.020
Or imagine if you've been to a
conference and you're waiting

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.010
for the internet to load.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:28.760
And it takes forever.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.840
It's really slow.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.120
Or how it used to be when you
couldn't find anything.

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.010
And showing people that again
might encourage them to

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:37.020
remember how useful
the internet is.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:37.731
Yeah?

00:32:37.731 --> 00:32:40.186
AUDIENCE: I'm curious about your
study on "The New York

00:32:40.186 --> 00:32:41.659
Times" [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:41.659 --> 00:32:42.641
shared.

00:32:42.641 --> 00:32:46.620
So given that there's some use
triggers where they're not--

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.962
I don't think social like cachet
would necessarily apply

00:32:48.962 --> 00:32:50.360
to a lot of the article.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.690
What were some of the triggers
that apply to

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:53.700
"The New York Times"?

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.050
JONAH BERGER: So we found a
number of different things.

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:56.640
And if you're interested, the
article is up on my website

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.770
and we talk about
it in the book.

00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:58.500
We found a few things.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.790
So one, there is some social
currency in sharing.

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:02.030
People are more likely to
share interesting or

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.130
surprising things because
it makes them look good.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.570
There's also a lot of practical
value, so restaurant

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.770
reviews, movie reviews.

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:10.550
If you ever see the articles
that come out in education

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:11.000
aren't many.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.990
But tips for choosing colleges,
people love that.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:17.040
One big thing in practical value
is six tips for this.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.330
I call it the "Cosmo" effect.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.280
If you ever looked at "Cosmo"
when you're in the line at the

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.840
grocery store, and most men's
magazines do it as well, but

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.500
six secrets for this, seven
ways to do this.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.830
Articles that really boil down
concepts into useful

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:29.620
information get shared a lot.

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.940
But then we also found emotion
was a big driver.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:34.660
And not just positive emotion,
also negative emotions if

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:35.920
they're high arousal.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.700
So if you think about both
positive and negative

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.860
emotions, they can be divided
not only into whether their

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.300
valence is positive
or negative.

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:47.490
So happiness or humor is
a positive emotion.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.580
Anger or sadness is a
negative emotion.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.650
But also whether they're
high or low arousal.

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.620
So anger and sadness are
both negative emotions.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.850
Neither fear is really good,
but anger is activating

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:59.550
emotion and sadness is a
deactivating emotion.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:00.410
So you think about
what you do.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:01.990
When you're angry, you want
to yell at someone.

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:03.380
You want to throw something.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.330
You're mad, you're shaking
your fists.

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:06.940
When you're sad,
what do you do?

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.060
You of curl up under the
covers, you put on your

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.760
favorite sweat shirt, eat
a big bowl of ice cream.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.590
You sort of shut off
from the world.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:15.630
And so what we found is it's not
only whether the articles

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:18.010
are positive or negative, but
also at the high arousal,

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.230
activating, or low arousal,
deactivating.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.260
We actually found anything
that deactivates actually

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.670
decreases sharing.

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.510
So even merely the act of
running in place, so we've

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:27.090
done experiments where we have
people run in place in the

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:29.510
laboratory, that increases the
likelihood of emailing

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:31.900
articles to others, even if
those articles have nothing to

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.300
do with the running in place.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.880
Because it activates the body.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.840
That physiological system gets
going and they infer that then

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.179
the content must be
worth sharing.

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:40.909
So that's just some of
the things we found

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:42.810
from the Times analysis.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:44.547
Other-- yeah?

00:34:44.547 --> 00:34:47.541
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
earlier that there's a

00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:49.662
misconception about how much
the word of mouth is taking

00:34:49.662 --> 00:34:52.700
place over social media right
now and I totally

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.000
think that's true.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.576
And you mentioned sort of the
other side of that being a

00:34:57.576 --> 00:34:58.960
person's interpersonal
interactions.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.901
JONAH BERGER: Yes.

00:35:00.901 --> 00:35:02.968
AUDIENCE: Like I've been reading
more and more about

00:35:02.968 --> 00:35:05.671
people talking about like this
idea of dark social, which is

00:35:05.671 --> 00:35:06.625
a ridiculous term.

00:35:06.625 --> 00:35:07.760
But basically it's--

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.136
JONAH BERGER: It's a great
term though, right?

00:35:09.136 --> 00:35:10.030
Yeah.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.951
Everyone is like what
is dark social?

00:35:11.951 --> 00:35:14.035
AUDIENCE: On the social media
track-- email, and the chat,

00:35:14.035 --> 00:35:15.318
and all that--

00:35:15.318 --> 00:35:18.760
so in your research, like how
much do you think that that

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.952
factors in or doesn't in
how we share things?

00:35:22.952 --> 00:35:25.694
Like how important is that?

00:35:25.694 --> 00:35:28.180
Are we skewed because we can
track the social media stuff

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:28.860
that Twitter basically is?

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:29.370
JONAH BERGER: Yeah.

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:31.690
So I think that's one we reason
that we focus so much

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:32.530
on the online.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.860
We say OK, we can see it.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.110
And I'm actually working on an
op-ed for "The New York Times"

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:37.480
for this weekend.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.890
But think about just how
statistics or measuring things

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:41.920
affect our behavior.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.830
So take Facebook, for example.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.190
Facebook made the number
of friends we

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:46.490
have a thing to count.

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:48.740
Well, now we all want that
number to be higher.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:50.170
You think about the Prius,
the Prius came out.

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:52.020
We used to care about
how fast a car went.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.930
Now, they display
the gas mileage.

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.150
The gas mileage has
always been there.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:57.420
But now that we can see it,
we care a lot about it.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.650
Because we can say oh, I want to
get my gas mileage higher.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:01.530
I want to get my Twitter
followers higher because more

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:02.390
must be better.

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:04.520
And so merely measuring things
can actually change our

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.330
behavior in relation
to those things.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.900
And I think social
is the same way.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.320
We can see it online.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.520
And I'm all about measurement.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.360
I'm a data guy.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.130
I like measuring things.

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:13.400
I'm not saying we shouldn't
measure things.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.990
But we should be careful how
merely measuring things can

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.190
change our behavior.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.780
And just because we're measuring
something, doesn't

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.120
mean we're measuring
the right thing.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.700
So we've done some work
with offline word

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.340
of mouth, as well.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.990
So there's a company called
Keller Fay that records lots

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:26.690
of-- asks people to keep
diaries of offline

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:28.030
conversations.

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:30.560
Some smart academics have put
together a device called the

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.560
EAR, electronically activated
recorder.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.670
Basically you can carry
it around with you.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:36.000
It records ambient noise
throughout the day.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.110
So it can get a chance of what
you're talking about

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:40.710
throughout the day, even if
you're not writing it online.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:44.360
And so I think there are ways
to measure offline behavior.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.500
But there's always a focus
on what's online.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.470
I think the important thing
here is we've done

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:49.450
some of the leg work.

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:51.230
So some companies say well hold
on, we want to test every

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.900
single campaign.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.260
How can we test offline
sharing?

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.360
How can we measure it?

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.250
And what we can say is well,
look, we've actually looked at

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:56.820
offline sharing.

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.240
We've done a lot of research
in this space.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.990
If you follow these principles,
your stuff will be

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.990
shared more.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:02.050
You don't necessarily
have to do the

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.310
groundwork all over again.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:04.930
But I agree, certain things
are definitely harder to

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:08.300
measure in this space.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.610
Anybody else?

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:11.920
Yeah?

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.460
AUDIENCE: Cats?

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.430
JONAH BERGER: Oh, why cats?

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:17.950
So I'm an academic.

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:18.860
Academics tend to be
a little bit of

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.530
curmudgeons, so oh, cats.

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:22.810
So I used to say, oh, it's
not actually true.

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:23.780
And I thought about
it a little more.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.510
I was going to write an op-ed
about cats versus dogs.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:29.170
And I have an answer that's less
satisfying to me, but I

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:30.570
think is more true.

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:32.720
So one, I think there
are more cat people.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.190
Cat owners I think are more
into their cats than dog

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:36.320
owners are.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.550
Everyone's into their pets.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:38.220
It's like your kids.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:39.260
Why do you show photos
of your kids?

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:39.850
Look at my kid.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:40.700
They did this.

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.780
They made this great picture.

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:42.490
You show it to all
your friends.

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:43.510
And they're like what is that?

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:46.130
It's like macaroni on like
a piece of cardboard.

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:47.530
But yeah, because my kid,
my kid made this.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:48.140
It's great.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.480
So the same thing with cats
and dogs in general.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.760
I think cat people are maybe a
little bit more engaged with

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.660
their-- dog people are a more
like this is my dog.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.668
But cat people are like
this is my cat.

00:37:56.668 --> 00:37:58.010
I'm so excited.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:59.910
Having spent though
unfortunately, fortunately or

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:02.890
unfortunately, an hour looking
at cat photos and videos last

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.240
week and thinking about whether
I could write this

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.540
editorial, I think that cats
are actually not more

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:11.380
photogenic, but they have more
of a varieties of faces and

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.490
things that make them amenable
to the phrases that people put

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.030
on those pictures.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:19.160
So they really make themselves
amenable to whatever we want

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.210
to call them, the I Can
Has Cheezburger?

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:23.450
Or you know, I mean your fridge,
eating your foods.

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:24.610
There's things we put on them.

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:27.610
If you look at those for dogs,
they're just not like "as

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:33.670
good." So I wouldn't think that
per cat piece, cats are

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:35.930
more likely to be shared
that a given dog piece.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:38.000
But I think that more cat
pieces are created just

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.600
because they're sort of more
leeway to do those things.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.660
Whether it's a cat hanging on
its hind legs looking like

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:45.600
it's from "Thriller" or a cat
that is like Hoover Cat,

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.250
there's all sorts of these
different things.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:49.220
I think dogs generally
look happy.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.130
And I have a dog myself.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.240
I'm a dog person.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.560
So I'm very dismayed
that people

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.200
share lots of cat things.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.740
But dogs sort of have the happy
look and the sort of

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.750
dumb, out of it look.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.130
My dog has both of them.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:01.240
Whereas cats do more angry.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.670
They do different
sorts of things.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:05.450
And I think that's really
amenable to those phrases,

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.140
which itself is a little bit
of internet culture.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:08.830
I think that's a great example
of social currency.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:10.080
Why do people do that?

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.770
What do they riff off
existing photos?

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:14.610
There's a recent one you might
have seen with a pigeon with

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.420
bread around, a bread crust
around it's neck.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.920
Have you seen that one, where it
says swag underneath, which

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.620
I think is just great.

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:21.720
But it's sort of showing
that you know

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.750
what's going on in culture.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:24.970
You can riff off it and
create something new.

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:26.700
And so I think that's a driver
of a lot of those.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:30.068
Why cats I think, I think cats
are quite photogenic.

00:39:30.068 --> 00:39:32.219
AUDIENCE: Well, you listed the
question about why there's

00:39:32.219 --> 00:39:34.370
more cat media up there
than say dog media--

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.820
JONAH BERGER: Yes.

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.260
AUDIENCE: --but not why
it's shared more.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.470
JONAH BERGER: So I'm not
actually-- so sorry.

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:39.910
To be clear, shared more in
aggregate is different than

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:41.440
likelihood of sharing.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.060
So there's 1,000 pieces of cat
stuff and there's 100 pieces

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.380
of dog stuff, cat stuff may have
more aggregate shares,

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.210
even though the likelihood of
sharing given seeing one of

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.680
those is lower.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.690
So you'd have to be 10 times as
likely share the dog stuff

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:54.960
for aggregate shares--

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.210
if there's 1/10 the dog stuff,
you gotta be 10 times likely

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:58.020
to share it.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:00.100
I'm not convinced that you are
more likely to share a piece

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.150
of cat content.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:03.740
But I think people are more
likely to create cat content.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.520
And so the overall aggregate
sharing of cat content is

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.860
higher, even though
the likelihood--

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.730
if you sent me a piece of cat
content and you sent me a

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:11.300
piece of dog content,
the likelihood of

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.040
sharing it might be equal.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.050
But I have not empirically
looked at that, even though it

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:17.455
is a fun thing to empirically
look at.

00:40:17.455 --> 00:40:18.670
AUDIENCE: So this is now your
next piece of research.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:19.320
JONAH BERGER: Ah, yes.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.470
I should rigorously examine
cat versus dog,

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:23.292
cat versus dog things.

00:40:23.292 --> 00:40:24.645
AUDIENCE: Well, if you
do, that certainly

00:40:24.645 --> 00:40:25.550
will be best seller.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:26.800
JONAH BERGER: Yes.

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:30.120
It's emotion in one
of those things.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.280
We care about our cats.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.200
We like to show our cats
doing funny things.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.650
And we like to show we're in the
loop, which I think both

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:39.190
relates to social currency
and emotion.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:40.410
Anything else?

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:41.380
OK, thank you guys for coming.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:42.850
I will stay up here, if there
are any more questions.

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:44.100
Otherwise, have a good day.
