00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.700
You've seen good board game movies like Clue

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.880
"♪I am, your singing telegram♪"

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.380
"BANG!"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.380
And, uh...

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.140
Well, I guess that's about it

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.260
Now, get ready for a movie with more scares than Ouija

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.700
More quality than Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and about a thousand times more logic than Battleship.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.940
"Majala, motherf-"

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.820
"Huh?"

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.080
Jumanji

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.720
Before you catch Step 16 of The Rock's 25 point plan to rule the world,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.040
revisit the children's classic that's way too scary for children

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.920
And scariest of all, doesn't give Robin Williams anything funny to say!

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.180
"What happened to you, the Clamperts had a yard sale?"

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.280
Ha, ha...

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.340
As this guy in a weird green costume makes peace with the death of his childhood.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.380
"Wonder if Mrs. Niedelmeyer is still teaching sixth grade"

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.600
In other words, Hook in reverse

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.120
Get ready to play Jumanji

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.640
The vaguely African board game that's ruined at least three generations of kids lives.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.700
Where all you have to do is roll the dice, then read a slight variation on 'move your ass'

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.940
"You better run"

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.560
"Your party better move"

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.760
"Staying put would be a blunder"

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.440
Stampede.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.200
Guys, stampede!

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.960
How many times does this have to happen before you automatically start running?

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.960
"Run!"

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.740
Finally, geez!

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.740
Meet Alan Parrish, a boy who was sucked into a board game

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.820
only to emerge as a confused and hairy Robin Williams

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.700
er

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.400
hairiER Robin Williams

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.660
Now, along with his traumatized playmate Sara

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.560
And two super unlucky orphans

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.900
They'll do whatever it takes to finish the game they started 26 years ago.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.260
Just as soon as they finish talking about having to finish the game they started 26 years ago!

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.400
"We're gonna finish it"

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.780
"We're gonna finish that game."

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.400
"If we finish the game, it'll all go away."

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.520
"But if we finish the game it'll all go away"

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.660
Any time, guys.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.480
"Listen. I know you're upset and all, but I kind of feel we should finish the game"

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.740
Forget about lions and spiders and vines, 'cause you're about to be hunted by more serious stuff, like...

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.640
Unresolved childhood issues!

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.820
"Last time I played this game, it ruined my life."

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.600
Bullying.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.060
Literal death.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.620
"I... wish mom and dad were here."

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.200
Fears about your own inadequacy that manifest as mass shooters

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.420
"You miserable coward!"

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.140
"Come back and fight me like a man!"

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.480
And tons of PTSD

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.900
"Then something screams..."

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.660
"Then you hear them eating..."

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.980
"And you hope to god that you're not desert"

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.120
Wow this is so much darker than I remembered

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.640
"Our parents are dead too"

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.400
Watch romance bloom between Bonnie Hunt and Robin Williams

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.020
Just don't think too hard about it

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.800
Because she's an adult and he's still mentally a child

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.680
"It's me! It's me Alan, mom and dad!"

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.360
And thrill at the happy ending where all the damage is reversed

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.420
But definitely don't think too hard about that

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.840
'cause 26 years of life on earth got erased because some kids finally beat a game

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.660
You know I kind of like my life, but cool very happy for you, Bonnie

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.400
So strap in for a film that finally cracked the code for being a good movie about a game

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.620
Base it on a made-up game from a book

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.560
Fill it with characters you actually care about

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.980
And always cast Robin Williams

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.600
Man, I miss that guy.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.260
*gun shots*

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.720
"Don't move, or I'll blow your blinking brains out!"

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.480
"Those are my keys, those are my keys!"

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.300
"You'll have to fill out these"

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.880
"Or I could fill these out!"

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.460
What ever happened to the helpful kind hobo trope?

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.880
We should bring that one back.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.180
"Here, you're gonna freeze out there."

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.500
Awwww.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:39.060
*reading comments*
