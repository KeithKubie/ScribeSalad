00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been happening you know
 

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.130 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been happening you know
the<00:13:30.880><c> textbook</c><00:13:31.270><c> said</c><00:13:31.540><c> shouldn't</c><00:13:31.840><c> be</c><00:13:31.960><c> happening</c>

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:32.140 align:start position:0%
the textbook said shouldn't be happening
 

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.830 align:start position:0%
the textbook said shouldn't be happening
so<00:13:32.740><c> I</c><00:13:33.100><c> had</c><00:13:33.400><c> to</c><00:13:33.550><c> imagine</c><00:13:33.820><c> there</c><00:13:34.330><c> was</c><00:13:34.420><c> something</c>

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
so I had to imagine there was something
 

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.310 align:start position:0%
so I had to imagine there was something
and<00:13:35.590><c> I</c><00:13:35.680><c> imagined</c><00:13:36.160><c> an</c><00:13:36.310><c> enzyme</c><00:13:36.730><c> right</c><00:13:37.150><c> and</c><00:13:37.570><c> you</c>

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
and I imagined an enzyme right and you
 

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.170 align:start position:0%
and I imagined an enzyme right and you
knows<00:13:38.500><c> it</c><00:13:38.740><c> said</c><00:13:38.920><c> well</c><00:13:39.280><c> this</c><00:13:39.850><c> thing</c><00:13:40.060><c> that</c>

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:40.180 align:start position:0%
knows it said well this thing that
 

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.070 align:start position:0%
knows it said well this thing that
doesn't<00:13:40.450><c> exist</c><00:13:40.750><c> maybe</c><00:13:41.650><c> it</c><00:13:41.860><c> exists</c><00:13:42.400><c> and</c><00:13:42.580><c> so</c><00:13:43.510><c> I</c>

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist maybe it exists and so I
 

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.830 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist maybe it exists and so I
think<00:13:44.470><c> that</c><00:13:44.620><c> was</c><00:13:44.860><c> a</c><00:13:44.890><c> creativity</c><00:13:45.610><c> aspect</c><00:13:45.940><c> of</c><00:13:46.630><c> it</c>

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
think that was a creativity aspect of it
 

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.100 align:start position:0%
think that was a creativity aspect of it
who<00:13:47.350><c> made</c><00:13:47.530><c> having</c><00:13:48.010><c> it</c><00:13:48.130><c> what's</c><00:13:48.280><c> there</c><00:13:48.640><c> before</c>

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:49.110 align:start position:0%
who made having it what's there before
 

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
who made having it what's there before
then<00:13:50.110><c> you</c><00:13:50.290><c> had</c><00:13:50.410><c> there</c><00:13:50.590><c> was</c><00:13:50.650><c> hard</c><00:13:50.890><c> work</c><00:13:51.070><c> going</c>

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:51.490 align:start position:0%
then you had there was hard work going
 

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
then you had there was hard work going
in<00:13:51.670><c> and</c><00:13:51.790><c> actually</c><00:13:51.910><c> finding</c><00:13:52.540><c> it</c><00:13:52.660><c> but</c><00:13:53.170><c> I</c><00:13:53.590><c> think</c>

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:54.070 align:start position:0%
in and actually finding it but I think
 

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.070 align:start position:0%
in and actually finding it but I think
you<00:13:54.370><c> had</c><00:13:54.520><c> to</c><00:13:54.640><c> first</c><00:13:54.820><c> imagine</c><00:13:55.360><c> the</c><00:13:55.510><c> possibility</c>

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
you had to first imagine the possibility
 

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
you had to first imagine the possibility
of<00:13:56.110><c> something</c><00:13:56.590><c> that</c><00:13:56.710><c> nobody</c><00:13:57.130><c> ever</c><00:13:57.280><c> said</c>

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:57.610 align:start position:0%
of something that nobody ever said
 

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
of something that nobody ever said
should<00:13:58.270><c> be</c><00:13:58.390><c> going</c><00:13:58.630><c> on</c><00:13:58.920><c> so</c><00:13:59.920><c> that's</c><00:14:00.510><c> very</c>

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:01.510 align:start position:0%
should be going on so that's very
 

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
should be going on so that's very

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
basis for that is to have the right
