00:00:00.485 --> 00:00:01.662
- [Instructor] We just
finished demonstrating

00:00:01.662 --> 00:00:03.307
how to calculate opportunity costs

00:00:03.307 --> 00:00:05.289
and determine who has
the comparative advantage

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:07.383
in a good's production
using the data provided

00:00:07.383 --> 00:00:10.798
in an output table or a
production possibilities curve.

00:00:10.798 --> 00:00:13.737
In that video we had a table
showing the potential output

00:00:13.737 --> 00:00:14.990
of two goods that two countries

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.283
could produce with a
fixed amount of inputs.

00:00:18.283 --> 00:00:20.444
In this video we're gonna
look at how to calculate

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:21.691
opportunity cost and determine

00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:22.825
who has a comparative advantage

00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:23.931
of two goods' production

00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:26.864
using the information from
what we call an input table.

00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:27.936
Let's look at this table and discuss

00:00:27.936 --> 00:00:30.209
how it differs from the
information provided

00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:32.161
in the table in the previous video.

00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:33.539
Notice that in this table

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:35.724
we are given not the number of units

00:00:35.724 --> 00:00:37.875
of output that the two
countries can produce,

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:39.762
rather we are given the
number of workers needed

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:42.452
to produce a single unit of output.

00:00:42.452 --> 00:00:44.003
So, the variable in this table

00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:48.170
is the number of inputs needed
to produce 1,000 watermelons

00:00:49.472 --> 00:00:51.624
or a single bicycle.

00:00:51.624 --> 00:00:53.221
With this information we can calculate

00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:55.675
the opportunity costs of
watermelons and bicycles

00:00:55.675 --> 00:00:56.617
in these two countries

00:00:56.617 --> 00:00:58.547
and determine who has
the comparative advantage

00:00:58.547 --> 00:01:00.031
in the two goods' production.

00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:02.928
Let's start with watermelons in country X.

00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:04.430
I find it very helpful to tell a story

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.142
when calculating opportunity cost

00:01:06.142 --> 00:01:08.333
using data from an input table.

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:11.496
The four workers needed to
produce a single watermelon

00:01:11.496 --> 00:01:14.203
could have produced how many bicycles?

00:01:14.203 --> 00:01:17.595
Four workers could have only produced 4/12

00:01:17.595 --> 00:01:18.595
of a bicycle

00:01:19.657 --> 00:01:21.127
because you would have needed three times

00:01:21.127 --> 00:01:22.632
that many workers in order to produce

00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:23.957
a single bicycle.

00:01:23.957 --> 00:01:26.109
That means that per 1,000 watermelons,

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.669
this country's giving up
only 1/3 of the bicycle.

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:32.443
Now, I'm gonna go ahead
and convert that once again

00:01:32.443 --> 00:01:35.068
to a decimal to make it easier to compare

00:01:35.068 --> 00:01:37.157
opportunity cost between
the two countries,

00:01:37.157 --> 00:01:41.428
so 1/3 of a bicycle means
that the opportunity cost

00:01:41.428 --> 00:01:45.345
of watermelons is 0.33
bicycles per watermelon.

00:01:46.368 --> 00:01:49.451
Four bicycles, 12 workers are needed.

00:01:50.412 --> 00:01:52.498
The question is how many watermelons

00:01:52.498 --> 00:01:55.169
could those 12 workers have produced?

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:58.568
The answer to that is 12 divided by four

00:01:58.568 --> 00:02:00.498
because three times as
many workers are needed

00:02:00.498 --> 00:02:01.764
to produce a single bicycle

00:02:01.764 --> 00:02:04.318
as are needed to produce
1,000 watermelons.

00:02:04.318 --> 00:02:06.963
So, the opportunity cost of
bicycles in terms of watermelons

00:02:06.963 --> 00:02:10.782
is what could have been
produced with those 12 workers

00:02:10.782 --> 00:02:12.998
which is three watermelons

00:02:12.998 --> 00:02:15.331
or in fact, 3,000 watermelons,

00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:16.998
so say a 1,000 here.

00:02:19.882 --> 00:02:23.135
3,000 watermelons are given
up for every bicycle produced

00:02:23.135 --> 00:02:25.748
because the 12 workers
needed to produce a bicycle

00:02:25.748 --> 00:02:29.770
could have produced 12
over four watermelons.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.874
Let's do a similar method to
calculate the opportunity cost

00:02:31.874 --> 00:02:35.291
of watermelons and bicycles in country Y.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.913
The six workers needed to
produce 1,000 watermelons,

00:02:39.913 --> 00:02:42.734
how many bicycles could
they have produced?

00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:45.057
Well, they would have needed 24 workers

00:02:45.057 --> 00:02:46.848
to produce a single bicycle,

00:02:46.848 --> 00:02:50.515
therefore in country
Y, six over 24 bicycles

00:02:51.532 --> 00:02:55.259
are given up in order to
produce 1,000 watermelons,

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:59.701
that is 1/4 bicycle per watermelon,

00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:00.920
convert that to a decimal,

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.837
I get 0.25 bicycles per watermelon.

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.848
How about bicycles?

00:03:06.848 --> 00:03:08.387
What's the opportunity cost of bicycles?

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:12.810
How many watermelons could
those 24 workers have produced?

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.135
Well, only six workers are needed

00:03:14.135 --> 00:03:16.140
to produce 1,000 watermelons,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.556
so the opportunity cost of each bicycle

00:03:18.556 --> 00:03:23.066
is the 4,000 watermelons
that could have been produced

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:27.085
using the 24 workers needed
to produce a single bicycle.

00:03:27.085 --> 00:03:29.733
We now have our opportunity costs

00:03:29.733 --> 00:03:32.957
of bicycles and watermelons
in these two countries.

00:03:32.957 --> 00:03:33.790
The next thing we need to do

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.427
is simply determine who has
the lower opportunity cost

00:03:36.427 --> 00:03:38.329
for watermelons and who has
the lower opportunity cost

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.842
for bicycles to determine

00:03:39.842 --> 00:03:41.880
who should specialize
based on the principle

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.319
of comparative advantage.

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.032
Let's start with watermelons.

00:03:45.032 --> 00:03:47.110
You can see right away
that a single watermelon

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.110
costs less of a bicycle in country Y

00:03:51.974 --> 00:03:53.410
than it does in country X.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.705
Only 1/4 or 0.25 bicycles are given up

00:03:57.705 --> 00:04:00.264
compared to 0.33 in country X.

00:04:00.264 --> 00:04:02.298
That gives country Y a
comparative advantage

00:04:02.298 --> 00:04:04.078
in watermelon production

00:04:04.078 --> 00:04:06.914
and yes, predictably, country X

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:08.488
therefore has a comparative advantage

00:04:08.488 --> 00:04:10.321
in bicycle production.

00:04:11.202 --> 00:04:13.666
Country X gives up only 3,000 watermelons

00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:15.128
for every bicycle it produces

00:04:15.128 --> 00:04:17.547
whereas country Y gives
up 4,000 watermelons

00:04:17.547 --> 00:04:19.492
for every bicycle it produces.

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:20.495
Based on these calculations

00:04:20.495 --> 00:04:22.648
we can come to the following conclusions.

00:04:22.648 --> 00:04:26.815
Country X should specialize
in the production of bicycles

00:04:28.762 --> 00:04:30.969
because it has the lower opportunity cost

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.129
compared to country Y.

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:34.379
Next, country Y

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:39.390
should specialize in the
production of watermelons

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.066
since it can produce watermelons

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:45.841
at a lower opportunity cost of
0.25 bicycles per watermelon

00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:49.574
compared to country X which
must give up 0.33 bicycles

00:04:49.574 --> 00:04:51.673
per watermelon, so how
do the two countries

00:04:51.673 --> 00:04:53.552
get the goods that they do not produce?

00:04:53.552 --> 00:04:56.497
Domestically they should
trade with one another

00:04:56.497 --> 00:04:58.387
and through trade both countries

00:04:58.387 --> 00:05:01.386
can enjoy the good that they
are not producing domestically

00:05:01.386 --> 00:05:02.592
at a lower opportunity cost

00:05:02.592 --> 00:05:05.282
than they could have
produced it at domestically.

00:05:05.282 --> 00:05:07.292
To review, the difference
between what we called

00:05:07.292 --> 00:05:10.034
an input table and what
we called an output table

00:05:10.034 --> 00:05:11.345
is that the variable given to us

00:05:11.345 --> 00:05:14.465
is not the number of units of output

00:05:14.465 --> 00:05:15.399
that can be produced,

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:17.432
rather it is the number of units

00:05:17.432 --> 00:05:20.729
of inputs needed to produce
a single unit of output.

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.391
The input in this table
was the number of workers

00:05:23.391 --> 00:05:25.102
needed to grow 1,000 watermelons

00:05:25.102 --> 00:05:26.740
and the number of
workers needed to produce

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.941
a single bicycle.

00:05:27.941 --> 00:05:29.274
We can calculate opportunity cost

00:05:29.274 --> 00:05:31.337
and determine who has
comparative advantage

00:05:31.337 --> 00:05:35.432
of two goods' productions from
the data in an input table.
