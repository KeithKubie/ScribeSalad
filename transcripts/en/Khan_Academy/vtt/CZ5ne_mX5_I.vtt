00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.121
- [Narrator] Let's get some practice

00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:02.707
with our exponent properties,

00:00:02.707 --> 00:00:05.391
especially when we have integer exponents.

00:00:05.391 --> 00:00:09.806
So, let's think about what
four to the negative three

00:00:09.806 --> 00:00:12.223
times four to the fifth power

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:14.593
is going to be equal to.

00:00:14.593 --> 00:00:16.435
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:16.435 --> 00:00:19.027
and think about it on your own.

00:00:19.027 --> 00:00:21.113
Well there's a couple of ways to do this.

00:00:21.113 --> 00:00:22.955
See look, I'm multiplying two things

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:24.555
that have the same base,

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:26.819
so this is going to be that base, four.

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:28.226
And then I add the exponents.

00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:31.533
Four to the negative three plus five power

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.505
which is equal to four
to the second power.

00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:37.185
And that's just a straight
forward exponent property,

00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:38.269
but you can also think about

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.453
why does that actually make sense.

00:00:40.453 --> 00:00:42.426
Four to the negative 3 power,

00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:45.489
that is one over four to the third power,

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:46.322
or you could view that as

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:49.322
one over four times four times four.

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:52.787
And then four to the fifth,

00:00:52.787 --> 00:00:55.367
that's five fours being
multiplied together.

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:57.194
So it's times four times four

00:00:57.194 --> 00:01:00.477
times four times four times four.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.289
And so notice, when you multiply this out,

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:03.901
you're going to have five
fours in the numerator

00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:05.953
and three fours in the denominator.

00:01:05.953 --> 00:01:08.068
And so, three of these in the denominator

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:08.931
are going to cancel out

00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:11.268
with three of these in the numerator.

00:01:11.268 --> 00:01:12.640
And so you're going to be left

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.829
with five minus three,

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.967
or negative three plus five fours.

00:01:17.967 --> 00:01:19.190
So this four times four

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.517
is the same thing as four squared.

00:01:22.517 --> 00:01:25.345
Now let's do one with variables.

00:01:25.345 --> 00:01:27.268
So let's say that you have

00:01:27.268 --> 00:01:29.768
A to the negative fourth power

00:01:30.602 --> 00:01:31.852
times A to the,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.821
let's say, A squared.

00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:38.630
What is that going to be?

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.411
Well once again, you have the same base,

00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:43.439
in this case it's A, and so
since I'm multiplying them,

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.324
you can just add the exponents.

00:01:45.324 --> 00:01:49.923
So it's going to be A to the
negative four plus two power.

00:01:49.923 --> 00:01:53.756
Which is equal to A to
the negative two power.

00:01:55.623 --> 00:01:59.123
And once again, it should make sense.

00:01:59.123 --> 00:02:00.522
This right over here,

00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:04.022
that is one over A times A times A times A

00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:06.904
and then this is

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:09.679
times A times A,

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.314
so that cancels with that,
that cancels with that,

00:02:14.314 --> 00:02:16.661
and you're still left
with one over A times A,

00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:21.561
which is the same thing as
A to the negative two power.

00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:25.216
Now, let's do it with some quotients.

00:02:25.216 --> 00:02:27.716
So, what if I were to ask you,

00:02:29.313 --> 00:02:31.980
what is 12 to the negative seven

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.127
divided by 12 to the negative five power?

00:02:39.968 --> 00:02:42.107
Well, when you're dividing,

00:02:42.107 --> 00:02:44.677
you subtract exponents if
you have the same base.

00:02:44.677 --> 00:02:45.814
So, this is going to be equal

00:02:45.814 --> 00:02:48.064
to 12 to the negative seven

00:02:49.288 --> 00:02:52.004
minus negative five power.

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:54.271
You're subtracting the bottom exponent

00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:58.553
and so, this is going to
be equal to 12 to the,

00:02:58.553 --> 00:02:59.903
subtracting a negative is the same thing

00:02:59.903 --> 00:03:01.340
as adding the positive,

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.666
twelve to the negative two power.

00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:06.715
And once again, we just
have to think about,

00:03:06.715 --> 00:03:10.198
why does this actually make sense?

00:03:10.198 --> 00:03:12.165
Well, you could actually rewrite this.

00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:13.671
12 to the negative seven

00:03:13.671 --> 00:03:16.034
divided by 12 to the negative five,

00:03:16.034 --> 00:03:19.445
that's the same thing as
12 to the negative seven

00:03:19.445 --> 00:03:21.778
times 12 to the fifth power.

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:29.941
If we take the reciprocal
of this right over here,

00:03:29.941 --> 00:03:31.773
you would make exponent positive

00:03:31.773 --> 00:03:33.559
and then you would get
exactly what we were doing

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:36.066
in those previous examples with products.

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:37.297
And so, let's just do one more

00:03:37.297 --> 00:03:39.064
with variables for good measure.

00:03:39.064 --> 00:03:43.231
Let's say I have X to the
negative twentieth power

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:48.044
divided by X to the fifth power.

00:03:48.044 --> 00:03:49.916
Well once again, we have the same base

00:03:49.916 --> 00:03:51.379
and we're taking a quotient.

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.645
So, this is going to be X to
the negative 20 minus five

00:03:55.645 --> 00:03:59.075
cause we have this one right
over here in the denominator.

00:03:59.075 --> 00:04:00.166
So, this is going to be equal

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:03.792
to X to the negative twenty-fifth power.

00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:05.835
And once again, you could
view our original expression

00:04:05.835 --> 00:04:08.331
as X to the negative twentieth

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.793
and having an X to the
fifth in the denominator

00:04:10.793 --> 00:04:12.482
dividing by X to the fifth

00:04:12.482 --> 00:04:14.241
is the same thing as multiplying

00:04:14.241 --> 00:04:16.095
by X to the negative five.

00:04:16.095 --> 00:04:18.384
So here you just add the exponents

00:04:18.384 --> 00:04:19.584
and once again you would get

00:04:19.584 --> 00:04:22.667
X to the negative twenty-fifth power.
