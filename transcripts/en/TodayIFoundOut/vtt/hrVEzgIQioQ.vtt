00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.080
On January 20, 1961, the newly-elected President
John F. Kennedy, at his inauguration in front

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.550
of the Capital, told Americans to “ask not
what your country can do for you, ask what

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.480
you can do for your country.”

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.410
Over 800 miles away, in Jefferson, Wisconsin
in an institution called “St. Coletta School

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.070
for Exceptional Children” lived a 43 year
old woman, who perhaps was listening to the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.070
address on the radio.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.810
Her name was Rosemary Kennedy and she was
President Kennedy’s little sister.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.559
Rose Marie (“Rosemary”) Kennedy, born
on September 13, 1918, was the third child

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.040
and first daughter for Joe and Rose Kennedy.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.000
No source could quite pinpoint why Rose Marie
had issues, but they were apparent very early

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
on.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.820
As we now know, there can be several factors/reasons
for development disorders – genetic, infection,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.030
exposure to environmental toxins, and other
complications.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.579
Rosemary’s mother claimed several times
that the nurses, due to the tardiness of the

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.059
doctor, tried to halt her labor, injuring
the baby in the process.

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.720
Even early in life, accounts describe Rosemary
to be “slower to crawl, slower to walk and

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.640
speak than her two bright brothers.”

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.070
She had a hard time “eating with a spoon
and steering her sled.”

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.600
In first grade, she was having difficulty
keeping up in school.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.510
Despite all of this, many signs point to her
having an otherwise happy, fulfilling life

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.300
as a child and teen, participating and remaining
active as a part of the wealthy and well-known

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.300
family.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.970
She was described as beautiful, sweet, great
company, and loquacious, and, as put in Laurence

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.320
Leamer’s well-known book, The Kennedy Women:
The Saga of an American Family, Rosemary was

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.020
“a picturesque young woman, a snow princess
with flush cheeks, gleaming smile, plump figure,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.350
and a sweetly ingratiating manner to almost
everyone she met.”

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.380
Her parents reported to several media outlets
(who were always requesting interviews and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.830
information about the Kennedy kids) that she
was training to be a Kindergarten teacher

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.120
and that she “has an interest in social
welfare work, she is said to harbor a secret

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.680
longing to go on the stage.”

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.650
In fact, Rosemary kept a diary during this
time that was only uncovered in 1995.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.830
The diary is thought to cover 1936 through
1938, when Rosemary was 18 to 20 years old.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.160
She describes trips, riding horses, dances,
spending time with family, teas, and even

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.819
a meeting with King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.420
In 1938, the whole Kennedy clan took a trip
to England and was presented in front of the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.420
royal couple.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.170
As Joe Kennedy said at the time (recounted
in the diary), “Rose, this is a hell of

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.670
a long way from East Boston.”

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.760
Rosemary, along with her sisters, performed
the rather complicated royal curtsey.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.900
By all indications, Rosemary had a fantastic
time – though Leamer reports that Rosemary

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.870
nearly tripped and fell when presented.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.450
The diary, itself, was written in simple,
short prose, but not unlike what you would

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.300
read in a teen girl’s diary today:

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.860
“Went to luncheon in the ballroom in the
White House.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.660
James Roosevelt took us in to see his father,
President Roosevelt.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.620
He said, ‘It’s about time you came.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.480
How can I put my arm around all of you?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.550
Which is the oldest?

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.550
You are all so big.'”

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.390
This diary entries have led some historians
and Kennedy biographers to believe that Rosemary

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.230
may not have had a severe developmental disorder,
or at least not as severe as is often claimed.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.840
There are theories that she had simple dyslexia
(based on certain signs of it in her writing),

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.870
a learning disability, or depression (as will
be described in a moment, she had severe mood

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.620
swings when she got older).

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.970
More nefariously, several books claim that
Joe Kennedy didn’t like that she was “unlady

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.960
like,” “sexually active,” and “at
times, unhappy.”

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.790
Whatever the case, in 1941, it seemed Rosemary’s
normal good-natured demeanor changed.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.209
In her mother, Rose Kennedy’s, memoirs,
she describes “noticeable regression in

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.050
the mental skills that she (Rosemary) worked
so hard to obtain” and “her customary

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.900
good nature gave way increasingly to tension
and irritability.”

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.989
She was known to run away and Rose described
her as being violent; “Since she was so

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.900
strong, her blows were quite hard.”

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.830
That same year, Joe consulted with doctors
to try and find a way to help his daughter

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.260
(though some more nefariously speculate that
he was simply worried about Rosemary embarrassing

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.890
the family) and came upon a “promising”
new procedure developed by Portuguese physician

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.080
Antonio Moniz called a “leucotomy” or
known today as a lobotomy.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.650
It was seen as a last resort for those suffering
from extreme psychiatric disorders, giving

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.329
the patient a “hope for contentment.”

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.300
The theory was that by severing the nerve
connections to and from the prefrontal lobe,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.820
it would “fix” certain mental illness,
depression, and a host of other developmental

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.820
disorders.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.169
Of course, by doing this, it potentially sacrificed
the patient’s personality and some level

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.610
of their intellect; but, at the time, the
potential benefits were often seen to outweigh

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.530
the potential drawbacks due to the lack of
other viable treatments for possibly severe

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.790
mental disorders.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.510
In the 1940s, performing lobotomies wasn’t
on the fringes of science either.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.750
In fact, Moniz won a Nobel Prize in 1949 “for
his discovery of the therapeutic value of

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.090
leucotomy in certain psychoses”.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.270
In November 1941, Joe Kennedy had a lobotomy
performed on Rosemary at George Washington

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.820
Hospital by Dr. James Watts and Dr. Walter
Freeman, who was a US advocate for the procedure

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.690
and called it “soul surgery”.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.070
Joe made this choice, apparently, without
approval from Rose (she would later say she

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.370
was never consulted).

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.330
As for the procedure, one of the surgeons
stated, “We went through the top of the

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.330
head…

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.330
She had a mild tranquilizer.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.360
I made a surgical incision in the brain through
the skull.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.360
It was near the front.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.360
It was on both sides.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.500
We just made a small incision, no more than
an inch…

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.780
We put an instrument inside…”

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.690
At which point they began making blunt cuts
of her brain with a butter-knife like object.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.741
They finally stopped destroying her brain
when she became incoherent and no longer could

00:05:34.741 --> 00:05:36.550
respond to questions they asked her

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.950
While the surgery did make her docile, it
also resulted in her being unable to speak,

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.660
walk, or communicate really at all.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.919
It also rendered her incontinent and significantly
diminished her previous mental capacity.

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.440
(She was much later in life able to recover
some motor skills, such as the ability to

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.080
walk with the help of a walker).

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.990
Needless to say, Joe Kennedy was crushed.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.919
The procedure that was supposed to help his
daughter ultimately left her, for all intents

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.080
and purposes, completely incapacitated.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.860
After spending seven years at a hospital in
New York, she was sent to St. Coletta in Wisconsin

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.520
where “she would be better off for her own
sake and ours if she went to a home where

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.449
she would be with people of her own mental
capacity.”

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:18.870
When Rosemary went to Wisconsin in 1949, it
was said that Joe Kennedy never visited nor

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.180
saw his oldest daughter ever again.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.199
He passed away in 1969.

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:26.490
Rose paid her a visit once a year, as did
some of the children.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.450
Initially, Joe and Rose told reporters that
Rosemary was “teaching retarded children

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.490
in Wisconsin and wanted to live a secluded
life.”

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.580
Rose would later tell renown biographer Doris
Kearns Goodwin that she never forgave Joe

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.009
for allowing the surgery to be performed on
Rosemary, “It is the only thing I ever felt

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:43.610
bitter towards him about.”

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.699
As for John F. Kennedy’s own relationship
to his sister, during the campaign, it was

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.639
claimed she was “too busy” to make public
appearances.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:54.449
It was only after JFK’s election in 1961
that they acknowledged that Rosemary was “mentally

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:55.449
retarded.”

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:59.850
On October 31, 1963, the President signed
the Mental Health Work Bill, attempting to

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.449
free patients from lives stuck in institutions.

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:06.840
While never explicitly stated, this may been
inspired by his sister Rosemary.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.870
This was the last bill ever signed by JFK.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.380
In 1962, Eunice wrote a heartfelt and, at
the time, incredibly open article about her

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.130
sister published in several magazines.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.199
She never mentions the failed lobotomy, but
says that her family (mostly referring to

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:23.680
her mother) did the best they could with Rosemary.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.410
She called her sweet, beautiful, and talks
about the sadness they had in the family for

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:32.669
her, acknowledging that she was “mentally
retarded” and “keeping a retarded child

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:34.039
at home is difficult.”

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:38.150
Eunice Shriver Kennedy would continue to talk
about Rosemary the rest of her life and would

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.539
create the Special Olympics in dedication
to her sister.

00:07:41.539 --> 00:08:03.520
Rosemary Kennedy lived until she was 86 years
old and passed away January 7, 2005 in Fort

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.710
Atkinson, Wisconsin.
