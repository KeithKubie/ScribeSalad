- Hello, my name is Natasha.

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:05.071 line:0%
I am a reporter for
Russian television

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.273 line:0%
here to cover American culture.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:10.310 align:start size:88% position:13%
Today, I talk to classic
American persons.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.013
(light music)

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:16.483 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
Hello, I am here with
classic American Comedian

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:17.684 line:0%
Maria Bamford.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.153
If apocalypse happen,
how will you help?

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:23.423 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I know I'm the first one
who will eat all the chocolate

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:25.759
if we're in a rubber raft.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.260
I cannot be trusted.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.897
I wanna say I can be a meat
shield thrown in front of

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:33.800
a shark or what have you.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.402
- That is very selfless.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.771
- Well, no, I just
think I'm realistic

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.305
of what I'm capable of.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:42.242 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And also, who wants to be
around once apocalypse happen?

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:43.743
- That's what I said.

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:46.479 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- Americans love paying a
lot of money for cheap things

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.949 line:0%
like eggs and pizza, how do
you throw your money away?

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.485
- I spent $7 on a coffee today--

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:55.155
- Yeah and that's truly crazy
because it's beans and water.

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:57.190 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You get to a
certain point where--

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.525
- It's like dirty beans.

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:00.660
It's black beans and water.

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:06.433
Do Americans like food trucks?

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:09.202
- San Francisco likes
food trucks a lot.

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:12.739 align:start size:97% position:3%
- See, I am confused by food
trucks because I thought

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.475
if there is a man in
a van giving out food,

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:16.976
you don't go inside.

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:18.778 align:start size:84% position:16%
- They're not
offering lollipops.

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:21.714 align:start position:0%
- Okay, but if they are offering
lollipops, that's the sign

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.249
it's no good.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:26.519
But if it's a wet hot dog
or something, that's okay.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.556 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And especially if it's
$20 you know that it's good.

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:30.824 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The more expensive,
the better.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:32.725
- The more expensive,
the less the predator.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.227
- Yes.

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:37.163 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You have traveled all across
the US performing stand-up.

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:38.865
What are you running from?

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:43.870 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Definitely from a
fear that I don't exist.

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:47.373
You've got to keep traveling
to see that people still know

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:50.577 align:start size:84% position:16%
that you are alive
and then merch, merch.

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:53.213
The exchange of merch
with other comics.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.180
- It's like a barter system.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.682
- Yeah, as a barter system.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:58.985 align:start size:97% position:3%
- In my apartment, I have
seven DVDs that I stack up one

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.154
on top of another just
to show I have wealth.

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:02.522
- What music are they?

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:04.390
- Pornographic, I think.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.625
- Oh, nice!

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:09.062
- So, there is music but
I would say people are

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.163
maybe off key.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.669 align:start size:84% position:16%
What about festivals
do you love?

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.304
- It's a good value for money.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:20.707
You come in, you pay
one price, you can see

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:22.208
so many different acts at once.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:24.711 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Festivals is like the
Wal-Mart of entertainment.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.180
- I like to think that people
just go because everyone else

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.581
is going.

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.283 align:start position:0%
- It's like that famous
phrase, if your friend jump off

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:32.352 align:start size:84% position:16%
a bridge, don't
embarrass yourself,

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:33.620
jump off that bridge first.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.655
- Yeah, that's it,
that's the saying.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.223 align:start size:88% position:13%
- And you have a
Golden Gate Bridge here

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:38.725
perfect for jumping.

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:40.393
You heard it here first,
they're going to jump off

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:41.694
the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:42.896
(laughing)

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.098 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Your show Joel
Joy (bleeping) Club.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:50.236
Joel Joy (bleeping) Club is a
celebration of Asian talent.

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:51.538
- Yes.

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:53.606
- Government okay with
you starting race war?

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:57.410
- I don't think they love
it but they've accepted it.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.780 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Do you worry that you put
them all together in one room?

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.316 align:start size:97% position:3%
- No, I didn't actually
think that it would be a trap

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:04.751
until just now.

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:07.554 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Thank you so much,
thank you so much, Joel.

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:08.388
Thank you.

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:10.924
Thank you so much.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.061
Can we get him a napkin
because I might have

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.396
cold sore or something.

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.998
(upbeat music)
