into a horrible pit if you really think
 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.250
into a horrible pit if you really think
that through and you come up with an

that through and you come up with an
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.200
that through and you come up with an
integrated ideal and you you put it

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
integrated ideal and you you put it
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.030

then you're more committed to the world

then you're more committed to the world
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.100
then you're more committed to the world
in a positive way and you're less

tormented by anxiety and uncertainty and
so and that makes sense right because

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
so and that makes sense right because
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.160
so and that makes sense right because
here you are alive and everything and so

unless you were capable if you're not

then how could that be anything other

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030
then how could that be anything other
 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.050
then how could that be anything other
than hellish because you it would just

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
than hellish because you it would just
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.670
than hellish because you it would just
be anxiety provoking and terrible

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680
be anxiety provoking and terrible
 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.050
be anxiety provoking and terrible
because you're vulnerable and there'd be

nothing useful or worthwhile to do well
that's just not I just can't see that as

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
that's just not I just can't see that as
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.190
that's just not I just can't see that as
a winning strategy for anyone you can

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
a winning strategy for anyone you can
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.340
a winning strategy for anyone you can
make a rational case for adopting that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350
make a rational case for adopting that
 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.010
make a rational case for adopting that
strategy in that you know you can say

well there's no evidence for for a

well there's no evidence for for a

well there's no evidence for for a

transcendent morality or for an ultimate
meaning there's no hard empirical

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
meaning there's no hard empirical
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.399
meaning there's no hard empirical
evidence but it seems to me that there's

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409
evidence but it seems to me that there's
 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.830
evidence but it seems to me that there's
existential evidence as well that has to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840
existential evidence as well that has to
 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.279
existential evidence as well that has to
be taken into account and of course

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289
be taken into account and of course
 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.059
be taken into account and of course

psychologists have pointed out that you

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090
psychologists have pointed out that you
 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.150
psychologists have pointed out that you
know you can derive reasonable

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160
know you can derive reasonable

information that's that's solid from
 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.870
information that's that's solid from
your own experience especially if you

your own experience especially if you
 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.310
your own experience especially if you
also talk to other people and you can

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320
also talk to other people and you can
 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.410
also talk to other people and you can
kind of see in your own life when you're

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420
kind of see in your own life when you're
 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.230
kind of see in your own life when you're
on a productive path that sort of in

nobles and enlightens you or a
 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.630
nobles and enlightens you or a
destructive path and i think it's kind

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640
destructive path and i think it's kind
 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.700
destructive path and i think it's kind
of useful to think that maybe the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710
of useful to think that maybe the
 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.830
of useful to think that maybe the
dichotomy between those two paths might

dichotomy between those two paths might
 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.910
dichotomy between those two paths might
be real you know and and because that

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920
be real you know and and because that
 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.420
be real you know and and because that
also allows you to give credence to your

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
also allows you to give credence to your
 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.520
also allows you to give credence to your
intuitions about that sort of thing but

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530
intuitions about that sort of thing but
 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.020
intuitions about that sort of thing but
I don't anyways I don't think it's

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030
I don't anyways I don't think it's
 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.790
I don't anyways I don't think it's
unreasonable to posit that since you're

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800
unreasonable to posit that since you're
 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.180
unreasonable to posit that since you're
alive adopting the highest possible

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190
alive adopting the highest possible
 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.100
alive adopting the highest possible
regard for the fact that you're alive

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110
regard for the fact that you're alive
 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.960
regard for the fact that you're alive
and that you're surrounded by other

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970
and that you're surrounded by other
 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.210
and that you're surrounded by other
creatures that are alive I just can't

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220
creatures that are alive I just can't
 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.830
creatures that are alive I just can't
see how that can possibly be construed

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840
see how that can possibly be construed
 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.560
see how that can possibly be construed
as a losing strategy and so that's the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570
as a losing strategy and so that's the
 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.940
as a losing strategy and so that's the
first thing so that's something like

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950
first thing so that's something like
 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.310
first thing so that's something like
faith right it's faith it's not it's not

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320
faith right it's faith it's not it's not

faith right it's faith it's not it's not
only faith in your being but it's faith

only faith in your being but it's faith
 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.330
only faith in your being but it's faith
in being as such and the faith would be

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340
in being as such and the faith would be
 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.600
in being as such and the faith would be
something like if you could orient your

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610
something like if you could orient your
 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.850
something like if you could orient your
being properly then maybe that would

being properly then maybe that would
 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.400
being properly then maybe that would
orient you with being as such and you

orient you with being as such and you

never know like I mean it might be true
 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.490
never know like I mean it might be true
there's no reason to assume that it

there's no reason to assume that it
 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.770
there's no reason to assume that it
wouldn't be true I mean even if you just

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780
wouldn't be true I mean even if you just
 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.870
wouldn't be true I mean even if you just
take a strict biological perspective on

take a strict biological perspective on
this and think about us as the product

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620
this and think about us as the product
 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.380
this and think about us as the product
of three and a half billion years of

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390
of three and a half billion years of
 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.770
of three and a half billion years of
evolution I mean we have struggled over

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780
evolution I mean we have struggled over
 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.110
evolution I mean we have struggled over
all those billions of years to be alive

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120
all those billions of years to be alive
 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.840
all those billions of years to be alive
and to match ourselves with reality and

so because one of the things I've often

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250
so because one of the things I've often
 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.340
so because one of the things I've often
wondered is you know life is definitely

difficult there's no doubt about that
and that's unfair and there's inequality

subject to all sorts of terrible things

faith you have to make that decision
 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.890
faith you have to make that decision
right because being is very ambivalent

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900
right because being is very ambivalent
 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.620
right because being is very ambivalent
and you can make the case that maybe

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630
and you can make the case that maybe

it's something that should have never

happened but that doesn't seem to be
productive to me and faith seems to me

I'm going to act as if being is
 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.360
I'm going to act as if being is
ultimately justifiable and that if I

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370
ultimately justifiable and that if I

partake in it properly I will improve it
rather than making it worse so I think

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260
rather than making it worse so I think

rather than making it worse so I think
that's the statement of faith and then

that's the statement of faith and then
 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.970
that's the statement of faith and then
what seems to go along with that is

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980
what seems to go along with that is
 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.380
what seems to go along with that is
something like truth in conception and

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390
something like truth in conception and
 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.200
something like truth in conception and
action you know even people like Jacob

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210
action you know even people like Jacob
 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.510
action you know even people like Jacob
who are pretty damn morally ambivalent

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520
who are pretty damn morally ambivalent

to begin with get hammered a lot by what
they go through and what seems to happen

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410
they go through and what seems to happen
 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.230
they go through and what seems to happen
is that they're hammered into some sort

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240
is that they're hammered into some sort
 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.200
is that they're hammered into some sort
of ethical shape right so by the

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210
of ethical shape right so by the

people who are solidly planted who you

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710
people who are solidly planted who you
 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.180
people who are solidly planted who you
can trust and who don't betray being or

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190
can trust and who don't betray being or
 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.730
can trust and who don't betray being or
themselves or their fellow man and so

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740
themselves or their fellow man and so
 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.050
themselves or their fellow man and so
it's an interesting I mean it seems

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060
it's an interesting I mean it seems
 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.500
it's an interesting I mean it seems
reasonable to me to first assume that

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510
reasonable to me to first assume that
 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.720
reasonable to me to first assume that
you have to establish a relationship

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730
you have to establish a relationship
 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.520
you have to establish a relationship
with something that's transcendent it

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530
with something that's transcendent it
 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.500
with something that's transcendent it
might even be just the future version of

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510
might even be just the future version of
 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.400
might even be just the future version of
you but and then second that you have to

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410
you but and then second that you have to
 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.170
you but and then second that you have to
align yourself with reality in a

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180
align yourself with reality in a
 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.970
align yourself with reality in a
truthful manner and that that's your

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980
truthful manner and that that's your
 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:16.480
truthful manner and that that's your
best bet and the biblical stories are

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490
best bet and the biblical stories are
 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.190
best bet and the biblical stories are
actually quite realistic about that too

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200
actually quite realistic about that too
 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.410
actually quite realistic about that too
because they don't really say that if

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420
because they don't really say that if
 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.570
because they don't really say that if
you do that you're going to be instantly

you do that you're going to be instantly

you do that you're going to be instantly
transported to the promised land

transported to the promised land
like even Moses as we'll find out in the

Exodus stories he never makes it to the

Exodus stories he never makes it to the

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070
promised land and so it's not like
 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.120

conduct yourself with integrity but it's
your best bet and it might be good

your best bet and it might be good
 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.700
your best bet and it might be good
enough and even if it's not good enough

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710
enough and even if it's not good enough
 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.190

it's really preferable to the
