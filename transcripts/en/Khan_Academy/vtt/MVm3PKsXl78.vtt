00:00:00.322 --> 00:00:01.992
- [Instructor] So we have
this question that says

00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:05.170
millions of Americans rely
on caffeine to get them up

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.388
in the morning.

00:00:06.388 --> 00:00:08.750
Now that is probably true,
although for me if I drink

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.314
even a little bit of
caffeine in the morning,

00:00:10.314 --> 00:00:11.860
I won't be able to sleep that night.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.177
Here's nutritional data
on some popular drinks

00:00:14.177 --> 00:00:16.427
at Ben's Beans Coffee Shop.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.812
And so we have the names
of different drinks

00:00:19.812 --> 00:00:22.126
and for each of those drinks,
we know not only their name,

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:23.958
we know whether they
are hot or cold, we know

00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:27.592
how many calories they contain,
sugar content, caffeine.

00:00:27.592 --> 00:00:30.391
Alright, now with that, let's
try to answer these questions.

00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:32.221
And like always, try to pause
the video and see if you

00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:34.370
can answer these questions before I do.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.801
And on this one on the right,
there's a little bit below

00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:40.654
what you see, there's a
little bit below, and actually

00:00:40.654 --> 00:00:41.956
I'll just leave it there.

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:45.562
So the individuals in this data set are.

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:48.645
So when you see the term
individuals, you might immediately

00:00:48.645 --> 00:00:50.627
say, oh, they must be
talking about people, because

00:00:50.627 --> 00:00:52.310
in every day language, we
talk about individuals,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.213
we tend to be talking about people.

00:00:54.213 --> 00:00:57.713
But in statistical language,
it's really referring to

00:00:57.713 --> 00:01:00.470
what are the different
entries of the data set

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.569
referring to?

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.914
So each of these rows of the
data set, they're not referring

00:01:04.914 --> 00:01:09.152
to types of people or customers
and things about those

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:13.319
customers, that's not about
Ben's Beans' customers,

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.550
I have trouble saying that,
each of these rows represent

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.629
one of the drinks that
are offered at Ben's Beans

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:23.176
Coffee Shop.

00:01:23.176 --> 00:01:25.328
So those are the individuals.

00:01:25.328 --> 00:01:28.885
In statistical language,
individuals could refer to things.

00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:32.509
What are the things
represented in that data set?

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.826
Then we're asked, the data
set contains, and we're asked

00:01:34.826 --> 00:01:37.268
how many variables does it
contain, and whether or not

00:01:37.268 --> 00:01:39.712
they're categorical or not.

00:01:39.712 --> 00:01:41.598
So first, what's a variable?

00:01:41.598 --> 00:01:43.490
Well the variables are what
are the things that are

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.736
different about these
different entries, about these

00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:48.955
different individuals that
this table tells us about,

00:01:48.955 --> 00:01:50.853
that this data set tells us about.

00:01:50.853 --> 00:01:55.185
Well, the name is variable,
each of these drinks

00:01:55.185 --> 00:01:57.759
have different names, that's one variable,

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.307
the type is variable,
they can be hot or cold,

00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:02.738
the calories are variable,
the sugar content is variable

00:02:02.738 --> 00:02:03.850
and the caffeine is variable.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.718
So we have five variables over here.

00:02:06.718 --> 00:02:09.328
The name, type, calories, sugar, caffeine.

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:11.835
So we have five variables,
so we can rule out

00:02:11.835 --> 00:02:14.467
the sixth variable
choices right over there,

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:17.832
so we're gonna rule that
one, and that one out.

00:02:17.832 --> 00:02:21.167
And so how many of these are categorical?

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:25.558
So a categorical variable,
lemme write this down,

00:02:25.558 --> 00:02:29.308
categorical variable
means that you're gonna,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.022
that dimension of the
thing you're measuring

00:02:33.022 --> 00:02:37.401
is gonna be placed into some
categories, or that variable

00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:41.228
takes on values that are
a name of a category.

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:45.417
So for example, drink name,
this is a categorical variable

00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:49.682
because the values that
drink name can take on,

00:02:49.682 --> 00:02:52.495
well, those are the actual
names of the drinks.

00:02:52.495 --> 00:02:54.258
These are the categories,
it could be brewed coffee,

00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:58.549
cafe latte, cafe mocha,
cappuccino, so on and so forth.

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.193
So this one right over here
is, this one over here is

00:03:03.193 --> 00:03:05.276
categorical, categorical.

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.564
Now you might say what's
another type of variable?

00:03:08.564 --> 00:03:12.517
Well another type of
variable is quantitative.

00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:13.600
Quantitative.

00:03:15.965 --> 00:03:19.022
A quantitative variable is going
to take on numerical values

00:03:19.022 --> 00:03:20.633
as opposed to categorical values.

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:24.888
Numerical values that are
measuring some type of attribute.

00:03:24.888 --> 00:03:26.451
So let's go through these.

00:03:26.451 --> 00:03:27.967
So what about type?

00:03:27.967 --> 00:03:30.607
Well type isn't a numerical
value, it's taking on

00:03:30.607 --> 00:03:33.040
a category, it's either
gonna be hot or cold.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.254
So that is also going to be categorical,

00:03:36.254 --> 00:03:39.419
but these other three, these
take on numerical values

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.354
that represent in the case
of calories, the number

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:45.030
of calories a serving has, the
number, the amount of sugar

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.113
in the sugar variable,
or the amount of caffeine

00:03:47.113 --> 00:03:48.860
in the caffeine variable.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.027
So these three right over
here, these are quantitative

00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:55.068
variables.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.757
So you have five total
variables, two of which

00:03:57.757 --> 00:04:01.022
are categorical, and three
of which are quantitative.

00:04:01.022 --> 00:04:04.018
And so that is this choice
right here, five variables,

00:04:04.018 --> 00:04:05.854
two of which are categorical.

00:04:05.854 --> 00:04:07.913
The two categorical ones
are, well what name,

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:09.453
what's the name of the
drink, and also whether

00:04:09.453 --> 00:04:11.203
they are hot or cold.
