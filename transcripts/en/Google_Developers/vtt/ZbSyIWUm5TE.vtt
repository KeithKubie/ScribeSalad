00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.029
THUNDER PARLEY: I'm Thunder
Parley, senior software

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:05.370
engineer at Google+ for
businesses and schools.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.340
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: And I'm Joel
Kalmanowicz, product manager

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.370
for the same.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.030
We're here today to talk to you
about Google+'s additional

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.000
features for businesses and
schools, and to help you apply

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.890
Google+ in your organizations.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.290
Let's take a quick look
at what we're

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.540
going to cover today.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.740
First, we're going to provide
some context on why this is

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.540
important to us and to our
business partners.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.040
We'll take a quick look through
of the headline

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.580
enterprise features
we provide today.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.560
THUNDER PARLEY: And then, I'll
take us on a quick dive into

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.330
our most important safeguard
for sharing in the domain.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.270
Then, we'll give you a quick
preview of something we've

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.480
been working on for you
developers out there.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.150
And then, we'll wrap it up and
save some time for a brief

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.170
question and answer session
at the end.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.510
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: All
right, let's get

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.760
familiar with the field.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.260
Social is the next generation.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.440
And with Google+, you can
connect to your local offices,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.170
global teammates, and external
partners and clients.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.890
People want more information,
not more emails.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.850
You can share with anything,
with anyone.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.140
But that doesn't mean
you should share

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.780
everything with everyone.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.420
Google+ provides a framework
to try and help your users

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.250
make the right decisions
regarding what to share with

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.320
whom in the right context,
internally and externally, to

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.260
work smarter, faster,
and better.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.640
THUNDER PARLEY: And we want it
to be easy to find the people

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.550
you need to reach and to keep
your communication safe and

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.860
within your company's domain
when necessary.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.350
And to this end, we're working
to enhance Google+ to make

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.450
this awesome social tool even
better for your organizations.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.600
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: We're already
getting some positive

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.720
feedback about this.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.730
Brady Corporation has found that
they've been able to help

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.420
their distributed offices come
together using Google+.

00:01:55.378 --> 00:02:00.230
Fairfax Media has used Google+
sharing and docs to facilitate

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.220
overcoming geographical
barriers themselves.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.430
And The Grommet has also used
Google+ and Hangouts, which

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.330
they like so much they've even
managed to completely replace

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.350
their wired phone infrastructure
with it.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.280
So they use Google+ as their
primary means of communication

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.490
within the company.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.380
Now, let's take a look at some
of the features we've been

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.900
releasing lately to
facilitate this.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.510
Domain labels are something that
we released recently to

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.120
try and address the need to make
sure that you're sharing

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.410
in the right context with
the right audiences.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.550
So I'll walk you through
an example.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.690
Let's say that I worked for
a company called Ink 42.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.110
If you have a look at my
profile, you'll see the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.350
ink-42.com domain label there,
which indicates that I'm a

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.800
member of this domain.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.590
But you can only see this label
if you are also logged

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.720
in as a member of
the same domain.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.720
So it's an internally visible
tool to help you differentiate

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.320
between people who are inside
your domain and out.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.650
So if I'm logged in, I look
at my own profile.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.410
I can see this.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.430
And it reaffirms to me, oh
yeah, I'm not using my

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.830
personal profile.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.510
I can also look at a co-worker
and see that, hey, on the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.130
hover card here, Allison is also
a member of my domain.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.570
So if I interact with her, I
can rest assured that I'm

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.300
interacting within
my organization.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.550
And in this case, I don't even
have to click through to her

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.040
profile to see this.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.000
It's right there on the hover
card that pops up when you

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.500
mouse over her profile
picture or name.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.020
Now, our goal in calling
this out is to, again,

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.670
differentiate between the
various profiles a person can

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.150
have to help you share
in the right context.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.790
This is especially important
when, for example, let's say

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.420
Allison has her work profile,
which is in the same

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.080
to domain as me.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.130
But she has a personal profile
down there at the bottom.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.840
So when I'm trying to + mention
her here, and I see

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.990
that, oh, there are multiple
profiles here.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.150
Am I trying to share with her
personal profile, with her

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.360
work profile?

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.300
This lets me make the
right decision.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.170
And in this case, if I want
to share it within my

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.040
organization, I look for
the domain label.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.660
We've started surfacing this
in the key areas which we

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.220
think are the most impactful--

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.005
hover card, back here, profile,
and then again in

00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:08.380
auto-complete.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.900
And we're looking at introducing
this in more

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.000
locations in the future.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.150
THUNDER PARLEY: So we also
challenged the Hangouts

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.910
engineering team to really
pump up the experience.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.709
We understand that businesses
and schools typically have a

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.270
need for more concurrent
collaboration, whether it be

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.760
closing a global sales deal,
an after-hours tutoring

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.520
session, a big research project,
interviewing people

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.010
from around the world.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.930
So we've boosted the number of
participants by a whopping 50%

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.680
to 15 live streams.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.060
That means all 15 participants
can use all the existing

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.670
collaboration tools, such as
working on the drive document

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.770
together, in real time.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.000
And when you start a business
Hangout, we make it easy to

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.400
only invite your coworkers
if you want to

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.550
have a company meeting.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.570
And if anyone external tries to
get in, [CLAPS], it's not

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.650
happening unless you've
invited them in.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.680
JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
That's right.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.900
And then, we get back to the
original and the most

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.930
important differentiator for
businesses and schools.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.000
THUNDER PARLEY: The ability to
create restricted posts.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.980
When you restrict a post,
it stays within

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.060
your Google Apps domain.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.940
Unlike a normal consumer post,
the audience is strictly

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.420
capped to your domain members.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.380
So you cannot even re-share or +
mention a post to show it to

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.370
people outside your domain.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.090
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: The admin has
a default option for this.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.060
When they go into their control
panel, you can see

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.750
that they can choose to make the
default for all new posts

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.780
within the domain restricted
to that domain.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.480
This means that if the user
doesn't make any additional

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.000
actions or doesn't really think
about what they're doing

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.580
and they're a member of your
domain, their posts will be

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.230
safeguarded and restricted
to their domain.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.720
It requires an explicit action,
with a conscious

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.360
decision, to change this at post
write time, so that you

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.880
create an unrestricted
post instead.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.500
If we go back here, you can see
at the bottom right, the

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.620
Allow External Sharing button.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.020
That's in this pop-up here.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.660
Once they click that, the
restriction is removed.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.450
And they can share this post
outside the domain.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.280
THUNDER PARLEY: All right, so
let me give you a little bit

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.880
more detail on exactly
how this works.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.160
So hold on to your hats.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.280
We're going to have some fun
with some basic Venn diagrams.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.010
JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
You all remember

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.480
your set theory, right?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.240
THUNDER PARLEY: Well, I don't
like to call it "theory,"

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.320
because I'm going to show you
how it actually works.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.800
So I'll call it "set
practice."

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.340
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: All
right, Thunder.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.190
THUNDER PARLEY: So this circle
here represents the collection

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.040
of profiles in your circles.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.020
These are all the profiles that
you've added inside or

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.220
outside of your domain.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.260
Now, this square here represents
the collection of

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:01.520
profiles that are strictly in
your Google Apps domain.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.150
So let's say you share a post
with people in your circles.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.510
Now, if it's a restricted post,
this green box limits

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.360
the audience.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.910
This post will be shared and
visible to people only in the

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.160
intersection here.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.490
Now, this works the same
with any specific

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.310
circles you might use.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.210
So let's say you want to share
with your buddies at work.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.340
I work with Joel.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.190
I'm going to share
a post with him.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.060
JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
Thanks, Thunder.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.480
I take a look at this post.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.220
And I decide, hey,
you know what?

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.886
This is probably the best cat
video I've seen all day.

00:07:41.886 --> 00:07:44.520
I want to share it with
my friends, too.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.650
So because it's a restricted
post, when I try and do this,

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.600
only those friends of mine who
are within the domain get to

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.250
see this re-shared post.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.990
So while the audience for the
post has expanded by virtue of

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.570
my re-sharing it, it's only
expanded within that green box

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.790
of people who are within
our Google Apps domain.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.000
Now, it may all be fun and
games, a little bit facetious

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.930
with cat videos.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.790
But let's say that instead of
re-sharing that, I re-shared

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.670
some internal information
about my company's

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.560
confidential plans to build
a better mousetrap.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.220
In this case, no matter what
the mousetrap is, I'd be

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.190
pretty glad that by re-sharing
it to my friends, even by

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.110
accident, it's still kept within
the domain and no one

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.040
who's outside of the
domain gets that.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.620
If I tried to re-share with
journalists circle, for

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.345
example, and none of those
journalists were members of my

00:08:29.345 --> 00:08:32.429
own domain, none of
them would see it.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.640
THUNDER PARLEY: So you see, your
choice of circles and the

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.740
people you share a post
with is a union.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.270
But if the post is restricted,
then that list is intersected

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.540
with the domain members to
calculate the final audience

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.690
allowed to view the post.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.200
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: And the same
thing applies with [? + ?]

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:50.950
mentions.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.770
Let's take a look.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.110
Here, we're looking
at another domain.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.170
This time, it's altostrat.com.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.200
You can see that this post was
restricted to the domain by

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.290
the building icon, which is
just beneath Eddy, in Eddy

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.130
Johnston, which is the
author of the post.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.950
Someone has decided that, hey,
they're going to try to

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.960
[? + ?] mention one
of my profiles.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.300
But as we talked about earlier,
my profile in this

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.650
case is in the ink-42 domain,
or maybe even

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.850
in the Google domain.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.240
So the lack of a domain label
there indicates that I'm not

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.760
in the altostrat domain because
we're looking at this

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.170
from the perspective of
someone in altostrat.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.300
So even though there's no domain
label there, it's the

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:26.990
end of the day.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.040
We're all feeling
a bit fatigued.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.301
Let's say they try and
+ mention me anyway.

00:09:31.301 --> 00:09:33.030
+ mention fails.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.930
You get a little warning
reminding you that, hey,

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.480
people outside your organization
can't get to see

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.750
restricted content because it's
safeguarded against that.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.250
THUNDER PARLEY: And now, we
know, hey, that's some fancy

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:43.970
JavaScript.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.980
And for you web developers out
there who like to mess around

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.260
with our JSON and try and trick
our servers, we keep it

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.010
safely tucked away in the back
end, that once a post has been

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.540
created restricted, we continue
to enforce that

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.190
restriction on every activity,
even on the re-shares.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.605
We look up the original
restriction, and we know that

00:10:03.605 --> 00:10:07.660
that restriction must
continue to stay.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.170
JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
That's right.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.400
Now, we've taken a good look at
the features we've already

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.700
released, maybe a little boring
for those of you who

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.550
are pretty familiar with it.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.130
So we know why you're
really here, right?

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.505
THUNDER PARLEY: The amazing
after party?

00:10:17.505 --> 00:10:19.130
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: That, too.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.950
THUNDER PARLEY: The chance to
meet the Conductor in person?

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.080
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Or maybe
to share a cold

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.195
one with you, Thunder?

00:10:25.195 --> 00:10:27.870
If you don't get that, watch
"The Internship" trailer.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.780
THUNDER PARLEY: Oh,
that's right.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.500
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: But really,
we want to know what's new.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.400
So today--

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.100
THUNDER PARLEY: We are
pleased to announce

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.660
our development of--

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.040
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: The
Google+ Domains API.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.810
This API allows you, as app
developers, to work within a

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.900
Google Apps domain and, say
you're developing in-house.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.360
You can develop an API call
in your application that

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.260
integrates your Google Apps
domain with third-party tools.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.750
You can also work as a software
vendor developing

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.550
application for other businesses
to install for

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.950
their own Google Apps domains.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.100
And we're still in
development.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.380
But Thunder has whipped
something up for you to show

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.300
you a little demo.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.530
THUNDER PARLEY: So this part of
the demo was pre-recorded

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.520
earlier for robustness against
lack of connectivity.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.750
But we'll be including a link
to the recording on YouTube

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.120
for people browsing
the slides later.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.870
For now, we'll just play
the video directly.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.960
So those of you watching later,
on YouTube, you'll be

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.780
looking at the recorded
recording demo.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.380
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: We
must go deeper.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.300
THUNDER PARLEY: And
deeper we shall.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.980
Let's begin.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.890
So here, we have Kavita Singh.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.230
She's a manager of a small sales
team and is logged into

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:34.700
her CRM app.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.890
She sees green.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.260
Green's good.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.740
Brigitta has already exceeded
her monthly quota by 12%.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.610
There's a button generated by
the app that will quickly

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.850
allow her to click and
congratulate Brigitta.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.640
A quick click makes an Ajax
call to a simple servlet--

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.460
I'll show you the code
in a minute--

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.010
which uses the Google domains
API to create a new post.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.360
We call this an activity.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.260
Share it to Brigitta and
the rest of her domain.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.080
That button linked
to the post.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.950
And now, we're looking
at the post.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.270
And we can see that this post
was indeed created and

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:12.130
restricted to the Google
Apps domain of Ink 42.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.825
And it cannot be shared
outside of the domain.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.360
So now, we've created
this post.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.235
Let's cut over to Brigitta who--
she's working away in

00:12:24.235 --> 00:12:27.730
her inbox, closing sales deals,

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.950
helping partners, financing.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.480
She didn't get to be the best
on the team by just sitting

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.680
around doing nothing all day.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.190
And this notification's
rolled in.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:41.920
And she sees that her manager
has congratulated her.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:46.100
And Joel has already
+1ed the post.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.920
That puts a little smile
on her face.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.800
So she's going to leave a little
comment back to her

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.380
manager thanking her and
reminding her that she has

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.360
worked extra hard this month.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.520
And she's going to take some
time off in Maui at the end of

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.860
the month, which I
personally love.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:07.040
And if you've been there, I
don't know how you can't.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.480
So that's not the end of our
story there, though.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.820
She's going to go back, keep
working on her inbox.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.440
She's finishing up her plan to
help customers finance and

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.700
further drive sales.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.620
She's about wrapped that up.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.810
And now, another notification's
come in.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.850
Oh, something from Joel.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.570
Well, Joel's a newer employee
at the company.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.310
And from this, he can see well,
Brigitta is the team

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.160
leader in sales right now.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.610
And he mentions Mike and
asks for her advice.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.410
Well, later, she will go
on to mentor Joel.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.440
And they're growing the team
to make them a lot better.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.740
So just in this simple demo,
we see that with the Google

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.960
Domains API, you're not just
creating content so people

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.000
have something to read
in your domain.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.190
You can help spread
information.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:08.380
You can boost morale.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.260
You can reinforce
communications

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.660
between team members.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.380
And you can help grow
productivity in your

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.780
organization.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.170
So now, let's go over to
the code snippets.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.210
I'm going to just show you the
very simple way it was to

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:27.100
write a quick Java servlet
to call the API.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.940
Here, you have your basic
servlet set up.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.360
The message and the email
address of the person we want

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.420
to congratulate, some
boilerplate code to do the

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.050
OAuth2 dance and get
the credentials for

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.300
the logged in user.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:48.980
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Let's
take a look now.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.650
How do you actually create
the activity?

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.590
So to create and populate the
activity, it's rather

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.030
straightforward.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.190
Using the library that comes
with the Google domains API,

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.210
we create a new activity,
which is what

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.700
we also call a post.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.930
This + object, we set the
original content, that's the

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.880
body of the message that
you want to send.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.725
And we set the ACL on it, which
is who we want to be

00:15:12.725 --> 00:15:13.950
able to see this post.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:17.150
In another example, you could
have maybe just congratulated

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.770
Brigitta privately.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.500
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Then, you
wouldn't have had that setType

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.230
domain entry in the
immutable list.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.800
THUNDER PARLEY: Exactly.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.670
So in this case, we add
two ACL entries.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.800
The first one is domain.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.620
And this allows anyone
in ink-42.com to be

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.220
able to see the post.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.970
The second entry we add, we add
this person type by email.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.090
In this case, this was
Brigitta's email.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.690
Now, she's in the domain.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.810
We don't strictly need
to add this.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.780
But because we've added her
explicitly, our systems will

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.680
generate that notification.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.560
And that's why you saw the
notification pop up directly

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.810
to Brigitta.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.240
And then finally, we say that
for this object, we want it to

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.870
be restricted to True.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:07.500
This is required right now
for the domains API.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.070
Setting this to True is what
tells our system that, yes, I

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.510
want the domain restriction on
this activity, this post I'm

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:18.080
creating, so it can only be
visible in my domain and not

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.570
be re-shared outside of it.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.930
Now that we've created the
activity, it's as simple as

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.910
calling the plus activities
insert and executing it, which

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:36.205
will make the call to the HGP
API and create the post.

00:16:36.205 --> 00:16:39.020
The response back from that
was the activity.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:44.970
And in the example I did, I
simply just wrote the URL back

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:45.870
to the call.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:49.030
And that's why the button to
congratulate Brigitta then

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.540
turned to a link directly
to the post.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:51.960
JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
That's right.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.370
So once the activity
is created, you

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.440
don't simply lose it.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.130
You can actually find it again
quite easily by requesting the

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:58.110
URL from it.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:01.150
THUNDER PARLEY: And I would just
like to reinforce that

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:06.150
with the domains API right now,
all posts created are to

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.349
be restricted to the domain.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:12.500
So as you experiment with this,
maybe try integrating it

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.460
with internal systems, your
own CRM apps, you can feel

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:22.060
safe that the activities being
created will be locked down to

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.380
your domain.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:23.750
JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
That's right.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.210
We do have a few safeguards with
this API, which is why it

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:29.900
is a domain specific API
for organizations.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.500
These boil down to
two main things.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.240
One, you have to have a
Google Apps domain.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.510
That's the whole point
of the API.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.910
It's the domains API.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.560
So if you try to call the API,
and you don't have credentials

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.520
belonging to a Google Apps
domain on your account, it

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.190
won't work.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.760
Second, you can only use
it for your own domain.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.850
So we really mean it when we say
that you can write posts.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:50.550
That's great.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.410
All your users, you
can install apps.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.660
You can start flooding all
your streams with useful,

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.990
engaging content.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.900
But only your streams,
your domain.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.100
So if you install an app within
your organization,

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.300
you've installed that app for
that organization only.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.680
This has two immediate
effects.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.320
First, as Thunder said, posts
are restricted to the domain,

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.660
which means that anyone in the
domain can see them, or you

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.660
can set the ACLs so that
maybe I only share

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.810
privately with Thunder.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:19.020
But either way, it cannot be
re-shared outside the domain,

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.080
as we went through with the
nice, little Venn diagram.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.990
Secondly, you can read posts
from anyone in the domain.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.760
The great thing is you can
read these post whether

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.920
they're restricted or not.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.190
So if I'm working in my
capacity as my Ink 42

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.410
salesperson, and I share a post
out to all of you guys,

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:38.080
the API can read that post
because I'm the one who wrote

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.670
it, and I'm in the domain.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.540
THUNDER PARLEY: And so this
is just the start.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.540
Obviously, we've started
with posts.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.950
We intend to expand this API.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.980
Some of you might already be
thinking, what about circles?

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.500
That's next on the radar.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.230
We'll be adding further calls
that you can use to enhance

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:01.860
the Google+ experience for
Google Apps users.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.010
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: All
right, let's recap.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.150
We've taken you through some of
the headline features that

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.540
we've released so far today.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:11.240
You can see here, the domain
labels, Hangouts integrations,

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.325
restricted posts, and
the defaults that

00:19:13.325 --> 00:19:15.680
the admin can set.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.220
We've also, then--

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.050
THUNDER PARLEY: Had a preview
look at the new Google+

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:20.770
Domains API.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.520
We took a look at the demo I
hacked up myself to showcase

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.940
how to integrate Google+ with,
say, a third-party CRM

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.330
business tool.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.740
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: So finally,
we'd like to involve you guys.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.040
We'd love to hear
back from you.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.930
We'd love to hear your feedback
on what you want to

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:36.060
do with this API.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.850
Where should we be focusing
our efforts?

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.510
What do you want
us to work on?

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.390
Do you want us to get more
circles things going on here?

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.350
Maybe more posts, read, write,
fetch, all this stuff?

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.580
We want to hear from you.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.020
You can fill out this form,
which, if you like, you can

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:50.450
write down.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.460
But these slides will be
available later, and that is a

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.340
clickable link.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.780
You can also talk directly to
your account managers because

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.260
if you have a Google Apps
domain, and you need to to use

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.310
this API, the account managers
will be able to help you.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:06.800
And remember, you can also, if
you're purchasing or licensing

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.990
software from a vendor, you can
ask them, hey, why don't

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.710
you build an integration with
the Google+ Domains API?

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.370
So if you're using a third-party
CRM software and

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.030
you want them to integrate the
Google+ stream for your

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.900
domain, just send them a note
and say, I heard about this

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.450
Domains API at I/O.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.140
THUNDER PARLEY: All right,
Joel, that's great.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.740
I think that's all we really
have to announce

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.680
and go over for today.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:35.060
But we're ready to take some
questions about the session.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.770
And remember to rate the
session, as well, and then

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.230
everybody should get ready for
the after hours party.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.890
JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
That's right.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.190
We did want to end a little bit
early to let you guys go.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.840
It is the end of the day.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.880
Please step up to the mic so
we can hear you and so the

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.961
recording does catch your
question as well.

00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:51.300
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:56.155
In our organization, business
use of Google+ has

00:20:56.155 --> 00:20:57.120
been kind of slow.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:01.910
And maybe this is an
outdated mindset.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.470
But I did see that you
had a work account

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:07.430
and a personal account.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:11.000
Our understanding was that it
was a policy of Google not to

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.670
have multiple accounts.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:19.600
So a lot of people won't get a
work account because they have

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.580
a personal one.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.180
Is that a misunderstanding
of the policy?

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.720
Is there any way we're going to
merge, like have a way for

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.630
a single Google+ account to have
multiple email addresses

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.910
attached to it, with technical
ways of solving that problem?

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:35.200
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Sure.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.950
It sounds like you're
questioning the identity

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.710
problem here, which is
essentially that you're not

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.110
the same person to everyone
you're talking to.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.000
I'm standing here right now,
today, in my capacity as a

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.180
Google employee.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.070
That's not the same as me
walking down the street

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.990
tonight, where I'm just
not another person.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.310
And so my work account at
Google, or in the example, at

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.910
Ink 42, is designed to be an
interaction with other

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:56.640
co-workers.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.150
Or when I'm talking to you guys
right now, with external

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.070
parties to my company,
but still in my

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.060
capacity as an employee.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.310
This is a very clear
differentiator between my

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.520
capacity as an individual.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.190
So we'd like to keep these
lines separate.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.980
And this is inherent
to approach.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.610
THUNDER PARLEY: And regarding
the policy side of the

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:18.160
question, I'd refer you to talk
to the press team for the

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.560
official answer.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.290
But when you are paying and have
these premier accounts or

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:27.090
for your EDU, we don't have a
problem with you obviously

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.756
using it, Google+.

00:22:29.756 --> 00:22:33.720
We don't want you creating a
bazillion accounts out in

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.880
consumer space for your users.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.890
Having the domains account
allows you this extra

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.520
functionality.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.750
Regarding merging into
one profile, we

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:45.800
have nothing to announce.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.200
As far as that goes right now,
you can imagine there's many

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:55.230
issues that complicate that,
both policy-wise and whatnot.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.060
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.670
THUNDER PARLEY: You're
welcome.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:58.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.220
Thanks for releasing
the domain API.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.690
You're very welcome.

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.670
So I work for Genentech.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:08.620
And we actually have two domains
in production, one for

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.950
gene.com, and one
is roche.com.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:15.160
And we are trying to pilot
users from both domains.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.080
And this is great that we can
actually share posts from

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.140
custom web apps to our
Google+ circles.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.050
My question is, will you add
support to actually trust

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:30.470
domains or have a post be shared
to multiple domains

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:33.610
through the API?

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.580
THUNDER PARLEY: That is a
feature we've been asked about

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.530
several times.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:41.000
Again, unfortunately, we have
nothing to announce in that

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.600
space at this time.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.170
But we have noted
that feedback.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:44.920
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.740
And quick follow up.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.450
Can you actually manage circles
using this API?

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:54.380
Is there a way to actually sync,
LDAP, or AD groups with

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.540
circle creation?

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.360
THUNDER PARLEY: So that's the
exciting part I hinted at.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.460
Normally, we won't pre-announce
things.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.580
But we have--

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:07.130
the circles functionality is
coming very, very soon.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.670
Me personally, if I was say a
manager, I would love to have

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:13.910
the ability to say, I have
a reportees circle that

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.960
auto-updates, interns get hired,
employees transfer.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.090
I don't have to worry
about it.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:22.230
I have a reportees circle
I can share to.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:23.020
AUDIENCE: So thank you.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.860
That's fantastic.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.770
THUNDER PARLEY: I'm glad
you're so excited.

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:26.750
Thank you.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.860
JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
On this side?

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:28.290
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:29.030
I'm Marcio.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:30.130
I work for CING.

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:31.950
We're a software developer.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.910
And we are super excited
about those features.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.780
We are actually using--

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.000
I noticed the guy said
that they are not

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.900
adopting Google+ so much.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.270
We are adopting so much
that we're using a lot

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.240
less emails, right?

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.920
But what strikes me is the fact
that no one mentioned

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.250
anything about the
communities yet.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.390
And we love communities.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.200
We are creating--

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.290
we have communities with more
than 1,000 members.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:01.110
And we are using actively, every
day, and we would love

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:06.890
to see the Google+ API allowing
us to do more stuff

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:08.540
with the communities.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.680
For instance, we cannot make
sure that every employee we

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:17.200
can only approve participation
of the domain members, right?

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.530
So it's very hard for us today
to go in a 1,000 member

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.740
community and see if there's
anyone using the personal

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.740
profile there.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:29.680
And that really puts us in a
fragile situation because we

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.170
might be sharing with someone
that later can be fired.

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:37.350
And that person will keep
that information, right?

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:40.210
And another, just as a
piece of feedback--

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.300
so my question is, what are the
plans around communities?

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:47.710
And just as a piece of feedback,
the hover thing for

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.820
you to see the label
is not efficient.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.390
Because if I have to approve
like 15 people, I have two

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.120
each one of them in order
to approve them, right?

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.434
So wouldn't it be better just
to see a label there?

00:26:01.434 --> 00:26:02.420
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Yeah.

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.220
Thank you very much.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.480
So as we mentioned back then,
we actually are looking at

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.920
additional places we do want
to introduce those labels.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.980
The hover card, we found very
useful simply because it is

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.370
useful on a case by case basis
when you want to know, who is

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:15.030
this person?

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.490
I want to learn more
about them.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.250
But as you say, it doesn't
scale very well to

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:19.780
long lists of people.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.020
So for example, search results
are something we're taking a

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.970
look at to see if maybe
it'll work out there.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.020
THUNDER PARLEY: And
as far as what you

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.280
mentioned, you're right.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.490
That is a very difficult
process.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:30.980
And--

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.540
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: For
communities, it's a very new

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.140
feature, even in the
consumer space.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.090
And we've been exploring with
the communities team to see

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.250
what we can do for enterprise.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.290
So thank you very much.

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:39.120
THUNDER PARLEY: Feedback's
well noted.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.600
And like we said, we're working
to make Google+ much

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.090
better for your organizations.

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:46.410
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Thank you.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:47.090
THUNDER PARLEY: Next question.

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.720
AUDIENCE: Yes, good afternoon.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.490
My name is [? Ringley ?]

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:50.410
with a 4G operator
in Malaysia.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:51.830
That's the video you
saw, that's our

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.850
project with Google.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.950
Anyway, we are super excited
about this domain concept.

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.780
Now, granted, whether it's in
school or in businesses,

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.470
people tend to share
documents.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:04.420
So how would this notion of
domain be recognizable by

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.350
drive so that when you actually
want to share a

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:10.670
document on drive via your
Google+ circle or Google+

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.860
domain, that same domain concept
would also apply to

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.480
enforce the policies and
the access control

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.810
for objects on drive?

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.930
THUNDER PARLEY: So I think what
you're asking is, if you

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:26.690
were to share a document, you
want the audience of the

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:28.690
document to stay in
sync with the post

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:29.490
that it's linked with--

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.990
AUDIENCE: And constricted to
the domain, let's say.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:33.610
THUNDER PARLEY: And restricted
to the domain.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.310
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: So we do
currently have domain

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.670
restrictions in documents
and we have domain

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:39.150
restrictions in posts.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:42.190
These are two separate systems,
in some sense, as far

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:44.720
as that one is a social sharing
model and one of them

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.320
is a collaborative working
sharing model.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.580
However, this whole session has
been about collaborative,

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.150
working, social sharing.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.590
So essentially, our answer
to that is it's

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:55.330
interesting to hear.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.300
It sounds like you're requesting
that these two

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.640
audiences be one and the same.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.940
And while that is an interesting
feature request,

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.660
which I'll pass on to some
people, think about it from

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.480
the perspective today.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.730
When you share a document, you
only want to share it with a

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:08.900
certain number of people.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.470
And you specify that in
the document ACL.

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:13.360
When you then potentially
re-share that

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.660
document in a post--

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.350
and I say re-share
here loosely.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:19.430
Essentially, you're sharing it
on Google+ for the first time,

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.010
you also choose the audience.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:24.130
And you can choose to restrict
that to your domain, as well.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:25.620
Either way, though, any domain

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.600
restrictions will be in effect.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.270
So if someone, say, if Thunder
tries to share a restricted

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:32.980
document to me, I'm in the
domain, that's fine.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:36.810
I try and re-share it on Google+
to the world at large,

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:38.920
they won't be able to access
it because the document

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.730
restriction is still there.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:41.650
AUDIENCE: OK, all right.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:42.010
That's a starting point.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:44.420
We'll continue the dialogue
with you guys.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.080
Thank you very much.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.580
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Thank you.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.140
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.620
Jonathan Frankel,
School of Rock.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.210
My question is kind of related
to some of the others.

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.000
I have a couple specific
things.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.890
Namely, I guess feature
requests.

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.590
Will you be able to provision
the Google+ accounts?

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:05.780
Because right now, from what
I see is that you can allow

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.260
people to create Google+
accounts, but you can't create

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.190
it for them.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:12.950
And also, it's kind of like
it's a separate thing.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:16.620
The Google+ profile is separate
from your Google

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.910
account on the domain
that you have.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:21.850
And again, another question.

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:26.710
In terms of control of data that
the Google+ profile has--

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.730
so one example is we
have people who

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:31.180
create Places pages.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:34.980
And we kind of don't have any
control over that, which is

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.420
kind of bad for our
company stores.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.800
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: When you say
you don't have control, could

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.570
you be a little bit
more specific?

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:43.330
AUDIENCE: The user account
owns the Places page.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.340
So as an admin, I can't
take it back when

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.210
they leave the company.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:49.170
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Right.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:53.240
At the moment, + pages are
not domain + pages.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.050
These are consumer space
pages which are

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:57.120
owned by domain members.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.120
We are looking into this.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.350
We're actively in discussion
with the pages team to see

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:01.590
what we can do about this.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.320
THUNDER PARLEY: And there's a
way to contest if you feel you

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.230
should own a page that's your
brand or identity were you can

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.520
file to reclaim the
ownership of that.

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.460
As the other one, as far as
auto-provisioning, right now

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:17.430
that's just a current policy
because these are--

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:21.390
even though they're owned by the
domain, this is a publicly

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:25.350
visible name and photo that is
created by the employee.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:29.230
So as of today, our policy is to
leave it an employee action

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:32.660
to actually sign up and create
the Google+ account.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.400
Whether or not that could change
in the future, we have

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.650
nothing to announce
at this time.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:38.430
AUDIENCE: I guess that begs the
question, would you allow

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:40.770
for Google+ to become
a private social

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:42.620
network for the domain?

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.610
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: That has never
been our goal as far as

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:48.130
we want to be able to allow
people to interact privately.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.460
In the same way as after this
session, any of you can kind

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:54.210
of come up and talk to us in a
one on one conversation, or we

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.690
could walk into a room where all
the walls are soundproof.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:57.310
That's fine.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:00.320
But we don't want to lock
people in that room.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.990
We want to give them
the opportunity.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.200
But we want to also say, if you
want to share with people

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.620
outside your domain, you want
to interact with people

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.650
outside your domain, you can.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:10.920
Just be aware that you're
doing that.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.910
And that's what all our warnings
and click through

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:15.005
explicit actions are
for, specifically.

00:31:15.005 --> 00:31:17.250
THUNDER PARLEY: Yeah, it's not
just content creation.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:20.890
It's also content consumption
and how you interact with the

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:22.180
world around you.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:28.090
So it's not our goal right now
to actually limit the flows of

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.330
information beyond where
people want it to go.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:33.180
They could find alternative
means.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.860
Otherwise, what we'd want for
them to do is to be able to

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.430
make easy, smart choices
and really share

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.050
with the right people.

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:41.760
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: And just a
quick little analogy on that.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.690
Look at how you use email.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.870
Your email client doesn't
prevent you from sending an

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:48.680
email to anyone outside
of your organization.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.300
You use it responsibly.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.680
Today, you guys have probably
seen a bunch of internal

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.250
Google email addresses.

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:58.310
You can email those addresses
because email is not an

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:00.390
internal only state, right?

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:03.730
We try to follow the same
sharing model in this case.

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:04.490
Thank you.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.400
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.470
I'm in Chile.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.605
And we are one of the
biggest resellers of

00:32:12.605 --> 00:32:13.483
Google Apps in the world.

00:32:13.483 --> 00:32:14.700
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Thank you.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.720
AUDIENCE: We're very
proud of that.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.390
And also, we're a very good
advocate of Google+.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:27.750
And at least the way I see
Google+ in a social side

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:31.280
should be based also
on mobile app.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:35.460
Nevertheless, if you enable
restricted posts by default on

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.920
your Google Apps, you're
going to lose the

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.060
mobile app on your Android.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.350
And is that going
to change soon?

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:44.870
Or what's the roadmap there?

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:45.260
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Yes.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.580
AUDIENCE: Soon?

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:46.990
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Just yes.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.803
AUDIENCE: Enough?

00:32:47.803 --> 00:32:48.770
THUNDER PARLEY: Yes.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.980
Not as soon as I'd
want, but yes.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.530
Very soon.

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:52.850
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Thank you.

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:53.692
AUDIENCE: That was
my question.

00:32:53.692 --> 00:32:54.955
THUNDER PARLEY: All right!

00:32:54.955 --> 00:32:56.470
AUDIENCE: I have one
last question.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:33:00.140
So will [? Vic ?] actually demo
the tags that you will

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.310
actually be populating tags for
posts automatically based

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:07.080
on some of the-- either
the image or the

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.120
data within the post?

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.080
For enterprise, there is the
Google Tag Manager that you

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.750
can use with Analytics.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:18.310
Is there any plan to actually
have so enterprises can define

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:22.320
some tags that can be used
within a domain that can be

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.230
managed with a Google
Tag Manager that

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:25.960
integrates with posts?

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:29.320
So you can actually do searches
and analytics based

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:35.820
off of tags, and allow users to
populate or pick tags that

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.880
are already published or
being used frequently?

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.045
Do you know what I'm
talking about?

00:33:40.045 --> 00:33:40.890
THUNDER PARLEY: I think
It sounds more

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:41.990
like a feature request.

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.320
I don't have anything to--

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.950
I'm not as familiar with
that topic area.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:50.140
But we don't have anything
to announce at this time.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:50.530
JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
That's right.

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:52.330
But please, thank you
for your feedback.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.680
THUNDER PARLEY: And please,
please do actually send that

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.760
feedback in.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.220
Because I might mince some
of the words if I try to

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.180
re-create it.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:00.320
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.840
Paul McLannes from
Fairfax Media.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.260
You actually quoted
my CIO in your

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.300
presentation, Andrew Lamperty.

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:10.460
And the funny thing is we use
Google Apps for pretty much

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.600
everything now, except
we still use Yammer

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.590
as opposed to Google+.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:19.050
So I was just wondering if you
think there's any features

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:21.710
that you think your competitors
might have that

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:23.360
you really want to get into
the apps, I guess, as a

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.780
product manager that maybe will
convince more people to

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.020
switch over.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:28.449
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: I'm sorry.

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:30.480
Could you summarize
the question?

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.130
AUDIENCE: Do you think there's
any features missing in + at

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:35.179
the moment that your
competitors, such as Yammer or

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:37.679
other internal networks,
might already have?

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:39.480
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: As a product
manager, my perspective on

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.120
this is that I don't try to
make my decisions based on

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.670
what my competitors are doing.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:46.670
I try and take user feedback
about what people want, what

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:49.380
we can try and do for them
that's the right thing to do.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:52.110
For example, I believe Thunder
doesn't even have a Facebook

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:55.199
page because he doesn't want to
be unduly influenced by the

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:56.590
state of the world today.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:57.500
It's sometimes--

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.790
if you're familiar with the term
zero gravity thinking,

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:03.620
it's essentially trying to keep
yourself only partially

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.350
in context so that when
you do need context,

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:07.110
you can go get it.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:08.840
But when you try and brainstorm
ideas, you're not

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.790
held back by the way everyone
else has been

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:11.650
thinking about it.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:13.110
THUNDER PARLEY: And we
understand that our

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.630
competitors do make very
compelling products.

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:17.430
They offer different
feature sets.

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:21.060
And like Joel is saying, it's
not a race sometimes.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.510
Sometimes they'll work
better for you.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.950
And we're just trying to build
the best product we can.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:28.150
And trust we, we're not running
out of any features

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.300
that we want to work on.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.830
But we want to hear more
feedback about where you would

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:34.870
like to see Google+ go.

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:36.190
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Right, so as
an actionable thing from what

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.060
you said, essentially, if there
are features that you

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:41.060
find useful in a competitor's
product, feel free to put in a

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:41.820
feature request.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.850
Let us know you want to see
something like this.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.780
It's the users that
we listen to.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:46.510
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:48.226
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Thank you.

00:35:48.226 --> 00:35:49.090
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.710
Stewart Gable from Ancoris

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:55.040
Enterprise, Google Apps reseller.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.040
We've had feedback from
enterprise users of Google+

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:06.070
that when users leave, they're
missing the threaded comments

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:09.320
from within the activity
stream.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.670
And I just wondered whether
there was any thought about a

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:15.130
way of preserving that?

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:17.470
THUNDER PARLEY: So I can tell
you that the state of it today

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:23.990
technically is when you go and
remove that account, you

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:26.680
essentially delete that account
and then all the data

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.640
gets deleted, which is why the
threaded comments are gone.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:35.640
But as an admin, that
is data you own.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.090
I think it's something--

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:40.560
it's a feature request
at this point.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.410
Right now, it would
mimic the same--

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.700
essentially the same behavior
if I had a Gmail account.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.250
And then I deleted that account,
my comments from

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.430
Google+ world would be gone.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.164
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: So we are
looking at it, though.

00:36:52.164 --> 00:36:53.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:56.650
Just from our perspective, the
minimal kind of request would

00:36:56.650 --> 00:37:01.250
be for an ability to export with
the threading preserved.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:02.660
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: Well, in that
case, this API might be

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.070
very useful to you because you
could read their posts.

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:06.630
AUDIENCE: That's what I
was wondering, yeah.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.480
THUNDER PARLEY: Read
and archive

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.700
activities and comments.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:09.050
JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
That's right.

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:11.290
If you don't want to do it
yourself, any developer out

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:14.130
there, feel free to make an API
to try and help with this.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:17.620
Be aware that our current terms
do not deal with keeping

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:18.880
data that you read.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.080
So this is something we're
looking into, as well.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.380
We do here you.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:22.870
Thank you.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:23.680
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.460
AUDIENCE: So just to
follow up to that--

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.278
THUNDER PARLEY: I don't have a
special prize for asking the

00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:27.736
most questions.

00:37:27.736 --> 00:37:30.360
AUDIENCE: No, no, no, I just
have too many questions.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:30.890
Sorry.

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:31.325
THUNDER PARLEY: That's okay.

00:37:31.325 --> 00:37:32.780
JOEL KALMANOWICZ:
No, that's fine.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:37.190
AUDIENCE: So some of the
policies for purging data of

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:40.870
deleted accounts, you do hold
onto Google Sites that are

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:42.080
created by users.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.340
You're not purging some data.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.920
I know Mail and Calendar data
gets purged after the user

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.350
leaves and the account
is deleted.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:53.350
Why not hold the Google+
information and let the

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:56.590
enterprise choose whether
they want to or not

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:59.462
to delete that data?

00:37:59.462 --> 00:38:04.550
Because it is, after all, the
property of the enterprise.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:07.030
The individual is not
taking it with them.

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:08.130
The account is suspended.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.245
It's gone.

00:38:10.245 --> 00:38:12.610
I'm just trying to understand
your reasoning.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:14.330
THUNDER PARLEY: Without
rehashing more and more and

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:17.510
more of the technical stuff,
we were talking about an

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.370
identity of a person who created
that content versus

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.410
something like a site other
people manage or Docs, which

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:26.530
we actually allow you to
transfer the ownership when an

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:27.160
employee leaves.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.640
You can transfer them to their
manager, some other coworkers,

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.310
an ownership.

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:37.220
The idea of transferring their
personal comments and posts,

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:41.130
right now our system says
that goes with the user.

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:44.200
You get rid of the user account,
that goes away.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.370
But like we said--

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:45.960
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: We're
looking at it.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.390
THUNDER PARLEY: Feel free
to add on to it

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:49.640
as a feature request.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.560
JOEL KALMANOWICZ: And to be
clear here, the comments we do

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.080
hear back from you right now
do matter to us a lot.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.190
Because as much as we can get
data as far as, OK, this many

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:59.790
different people are requesting
these features,

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.530
this is something a lot of
people are getting in, and we

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:04.920
de-duplicate these things down
to a single request with x

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.650
number of people.

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:09.140
It's this personal feedback we
get from you in these big

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.230
ticket events like I/O
that really do

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.320
help push the needle.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.790
Because after all, we're not
just in it for ourselves.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:16.900
We're not just a little
sub-unit of Google.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.490
We're working with Google with
enterprise and with Docs and

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:22.460
Drive and many different teams
to try and make this stuff

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.770
happen for you.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.800
So the better armed we are to
argue our point that you are

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.290
users, you are everyone's users,
and we want to do the

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:32.270
right thing for you, the better
we all work together.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.170
THUNDER PARLEY: So thank you
everyone for staying through

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:34.750
the session.

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.073
We appreciate your questions.

00:39:36.073 --> 00:39:37.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.620
THUNDER PARLEY: And enjoy
the rest of your I/O.
