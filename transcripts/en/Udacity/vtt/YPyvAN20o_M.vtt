00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to go through this algebra--so if you are an ace in solving this sort of systems of equation

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
you can skip this part, but for those who aren't, I'm going to walk you through it.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So, here we have our two equations.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'd like to write them one above the other to make thing a little simpler for me.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now my goal is to eventually know what the acceleration of the system is.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm going to do that by, first, solving for the tension in one of these equations and then plugging in

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and let me show you what I mean by that, so let's take this equation.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If I move this term to this side, I find that the tension is equal m₁a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and a is still unknown plus m₁g.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm going to plug this in, this value of the tension, in to here.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The idea of being that, now I'll get this equation in terms of only one unknown, a,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and FT won't show up anymore.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So rewrite m₂g minus FT, but now I'm using this, now equals m₂a.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's just distribute this minus sign and remove the parenthesis.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Well now I'm solving for a, so let's group all the a terms together.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm going to move this a over here, okay?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So, now that we've done that, I'm going to take out the common factors

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of each of these terms and each of these terms.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
For example, each of these terms has g in it and each of these terms has an a in it,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and now we're really close.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Let's divide both sides by this term here,

00:01:08.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and here is our answer and this is truly a thing of beauty and let me explain why.
