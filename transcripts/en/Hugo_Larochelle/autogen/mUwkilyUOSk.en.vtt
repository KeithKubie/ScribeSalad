00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 this capsule we will see the concept 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.610
 independence between random variable 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.030
 so we'll say that two variables 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.130
 random a and b are independent if 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.650
 only if we have one of the three 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.480
 following conditions where one demonstrates a 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.609
 of the following three conditions to know 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.880
 that the probability of rising 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.560
 is equal to parity of all that the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.660
 morality of bessat chara is equal to the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.500
 probability of bep or that probability 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.899
 of a and b the joint probability in a and 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.079
 b is in party and galabru is marginal 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.149
 twice the marginal probity so in 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.860
 actually showed a selection to show the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.399
 three that is to say that we can demonstrate 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.450
 each of his formulas from 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:50.579
 from another of these three formulas and 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.110
 so we understand better why that 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.360
 corresponds one of independence in 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.670
 various var at war on go focus and on the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.250
 first focus on the first 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.949
 line here because it's from here that the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.180
 high politics if I observe if I 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.060
 know the country value 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.549
 it's equal to the probity of when 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.600
 actually says is that my probability 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.270
 probability a priori 2 1 remains the hand 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.549
 even though I observe pays my uncertainties 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.140
 my beliefs about your staying 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.820
 exactly the same even though I 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.720
 observed and so that's probably 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.549
 intuitively actually it's a 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.560
 illustration of the fact that there is no 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.150
 dependence between b and a 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.450
 that's why watching at 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.820
 his hand not form on value does it 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.579
 to observe forgiveness his hand shape not on 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.970
 the value in an equivalent way 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.750
 if we are dependent on believers on 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.060
 b will not change if I have observed and 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.930
 in fact the fate we can see quickly 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.290
 that we get it from the fact that we have by the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.649
 polka and chaining that p2a knowing bcp 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.939
 forgiveness p2a and bcp of knowing 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:06.960
 belfry p2b messi gkp from high knowing 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:09.690
 bettega the p2a I get well and well 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.330
 so here are formulas that are the 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.370
 equations that its equivalent 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.840
 so let's keep a more concrete example 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.430
 imagine that in my problem 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.050
 identification for ja i introduced 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.710
 a random variable that disciple 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.610
 of Europe so intuitively for a co 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.770
 realistic nor any relationship between the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.240
 makes that there is more gold and the fact that 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.180
 I received an email that is a 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.180
 email or not so what I would like 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.090
 it's set up to model my 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.180
 environment with probabilities 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.760
 that they satisfy this equation secularism 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.160
 so imagine that my model of my 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.630
 environment and my models 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.959
 probabilists corresponds this table of 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.730
 joint probabilities if check if 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.459
 I have well and that then and independent 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.140
 of spam as I would you like it 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.590
 see if my model is fine is good 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.150
 true to reality then for that I 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.000
 have to calculate the marginal probability 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.040
 since then politics then be equal 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.860
 to train 0.3 so the volt is that more 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.010
 or even force it would be a minus that 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.709
 so 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:18.470
 1 - 0 point 30.7 and that I calculated that 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.170
 by doing the amount disturb or rain 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.269
 is equal to true then the policy be 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.610
 equal to fos and justin - politics is 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.840
 would equal the same way I can 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.400
 calculate the probability that for 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.800
 ensure true gala then the politics get 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.850
 to be equal to false it would be a minus that 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.769
 so 0.9 the man now for 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.690
 check out the rain dependencies for 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.130
 nothing I have to check for all 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.410
 possible values ​​of rain or 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.670
 spam is my probability 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.459
 seals in my head of probity 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:52.790
 is the product of the probabilities 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:55.519
 marginal that I'm showing here then the 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.769
 probability of rain and gala true and 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.420
 to rot galas true is 0.03 is this 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.370
 that it is equal to the product of the producti 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.470
 marginal since is equals in a short time the 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.870
 evidence a probability of spam 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.700
 was that's the real one so it fits 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:14.450
 at 0.3 x 10.1 is actually 0.03 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.299
 it's equal to 0 point 3 x 0 point and I 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.919
 so continues the probability that more 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.930
 galley for nothing related to the strength that 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.180
 that's who equals would not have been 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.860
 attached 0.27 in my model is what 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.840
 it's equal to the product of the pros 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.599
 it's marginal but actually it's 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.449
 equal to 0.3 which is the probability that 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:35.060
 overuse guys the true faith 0.9 that is 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.340
 the probability that spam is equal to 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.699
 wrong according to my calculation of probabilities 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.099
 marginal that I did here 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.960
 and so on in this example if we 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.550
 could check that for all 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.080
 possible values ​​of rain and 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.419
 spam I actually have that the 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.479
 probability seal in rain and spam 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:56.210
 it's equal to the product of the probabilities 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.860
 marginal so I demonstrated that but 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.810
 random variable in this case these are 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.129
 well and independent then 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.689
 independence is something that is 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.669
 very powerful in his care that 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:10.159
 greatly simplifies another model and then 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.629
 probability calculations by cons 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.479
 it's something that in general is 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:16.310
 rare in an interesting environment 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.939
 that we might want to model 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.560
 actually what gives them 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:23.180
 reasoning it is assumed that some 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.800
 observations will allow us to 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.889
 update our beliefs versus 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.120
 to the value of other slaughterhouses so one 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.729
 helmsmen the dependencies 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.610
 unconditional is something we 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.729
 would not often have that we can often 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.779
 operated time a real model 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.819
 noticed by contrast the independence between 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:43.879
 the variables that allowed to reduce 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:46.129
 substantially the size of 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:48.080
 distributions to take advantage of my 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.610
 random variable and so that's fine 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.259
 allow to do some calculations that are 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.129
 much more effective so in 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:54.379
 the previous example 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:58.120
 in fact I do not need to store the 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:06:05.110
 four values ​​of May 2 marginal probity 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:08.210
 pardon joints on rain and spam 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.159
 so I do not need the table with the 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.360
 four priorities 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:14.240
 in fact I just need to store in 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.159
 memory the probability since equal true 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.779
 the higher the probability of more spam 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:20.810
 equal true then from strains can 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:23.089
 calculate all probabilities 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.879
 joint on rain and quarries 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:27.289
 and if I had a larger number of 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:29.479
 values ​​at war that would allow me to 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.289
 save there again more so 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.440
 exponential 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.969
 storage in memory of all 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.770
 look that I need to calculate 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:40.060
 any probability June 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.970
 however as I said in practice 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.340
 it's rare to be first situation 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:49.050
 model where all the variables are going 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.790
 to be truly independent 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:55.150
 on the other hand we often see 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.600
 introduce without having a model that 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.730
 realize these independences 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.100
 conditional then i'm going to use a 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.930
 different example that is taken from the book 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.750
 of rats norvig mice so this is a 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:10.540
 example or imagine that I'm going to the 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.990
 dentist and I would have too variable 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.350
 random 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:16.210
 do I have back pain or not? 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.400
 that when the dentist uses that sounds 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:21.070
 to check if there is a hole in 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.630
 madam is what the probe hangs in 

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.420
 madam so that's going to be the variable 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:30.340
 random eighth and do I have a 

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:32.830
 decay or not so in this situation 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.600
 there if I wonder what is the 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.200
 probability that the probe is hooking 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:40.360
 of amada if I have a toothache and that 

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.340
 I have a cellar or whatever the value 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.500
 of evil in what is the will of 

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.990
 crooked knowing thanks to a sore 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.620
 teeth and the case where jean pebbles so 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:51.640
 actually having a decay 

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.530
 hall forgiveness the fact that the probe 

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.380
 hangs it's absolutely nothing to do at 

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:59.110
 do I have a toothache or not if I 

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.490
 know that I have a decay the probe should 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.860
 to hang then having to hurt or 

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.960
 employment should not influence the 

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.670
 does the probe hang or not so 

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.620
 in this case also the crooked politics 

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:11.320
 sacha toothache and carys equals true 

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.150
 it's actually I can reduce it as 

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.030
 being the cross politics at each to 

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:18.130
 riga the real then the network the same 

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.660
 reasoning applies if carrie and 

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.370
 regard ditch heap of topics meal of 

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.680
 caries I could actually reduced 

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:25.960
 the politics crusher toothache and 

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.380
 kariya the need for ego policy 

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.790
 sacha carrie equals must in this case 

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.849
 we will say that eighth and 

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:36.700
 conditionally to speaking two 

00:08:33.849 --> 00:08:38.740
 toothache as she dances 

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.150
 that we added here that given a 

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:44.229
 other of Ariane in this case if carrie 

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:47.850
 so to take the example here summarize 

00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:50.009
 that I bar carry on says 

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:52.560
 ret qxc crooked was dependent on evil of 

00:08:50.009 --> 00:08:54.360
 teeth if I had that probity of a 

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.199
 crooked sacha toothache was equal to 

00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:01.620
 the priority of eighth in the body 

00:08:57.199 --> 00:09:04.440
 conditional we notice that the dense 

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.509
 that if I add carrie we will say that 

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.870
 crooked and independent of toothache 

00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:12.449
 since harry if adding 

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.160
 teeth right so the part 

00:09:12.449 --> 00:09:16.079
 conditional because i left and right 

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.060
 I have this equality the water here it's at 

00:09:16.079 --> 00:09:21.149
 to say that to condition on the carry me 

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:23.430
 actually allows to eliminate toothache 

00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:25.500
 that is, the tip and crooked 

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.149
 sore toothache and carrie is reduced to 

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.610
 the eighth note priority only knowing 

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:32.399
 because it's the same way we had 

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.839
 for unconditional independence we 

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:36.870
 had three equivalent formulas 

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:40.430
 because if that's equivalent to that and 

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:43.740
 it's equivalent to this formula here 

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:46.670
 so if we did for the definition of 

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.959
 conditional independence we have three 

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.940
 equivalent formulas 

00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:52.889
 and to demonstrate that two variables 

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.470
 are continually independent of 

00:09:52.889 --> 00:10:04.259
 Sasha another one just show either 

00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:05.339
 this is it then to illustrate 

00:10:04.259 --> 00:10:07.560
 the fact that with the expenses 

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:09.689
 conditional we can reduce the 

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.970
 complexity of our model 

00:10:09.689 --> 00:10:13.889
 we will use the chaining rule for 

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:16.380
 writes the probability seals of hurt of 

00:10:13.889 --> 00:10:18.300
 crooked teeth and 15 then according to the 

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.639
 chaining probity we only have 7 pro 

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:23.250
 class spouse and the probity of 

00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:26.009
 toothache sacha hook caries them 

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:29.100
 two other variables times the 

00:10:26.009 --> 00:10:30.149
 probability of eighth and carys enjoy 

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.860
 carry hooks can be used 

00:10:30.149 --> 00:10:34.050
 as proof when we can write it 

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:37.380
 like eighth note politics knowing that 

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:40.769
 happens times the probity of carrie is 

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:42.360
 so this few lots here it requires 

00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:45.120
 that I can calculate this policy 

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:48.300
 conditional the ai if this one is the 

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.029
 probability a priori here now if 

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:56.250
 I have a conditional independence 

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:58.260
 between toothache and eighths knowing 

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.730
 because here we will say that I can write the 

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.020
 political toothache knowing hook 

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.060
 caricom being simply 

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:06.390
 the reality of evil dance in shanghai 

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:11.180
 so that means that rather than having 

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:14.160
 need of both at the 3 

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.930
 possible probability to take advantage of 

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.160
 bad of dance at every rock because there is 

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.080
 has two to the gang because there are two 

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.670
 possible values ​​of malouda in front of the 

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.340
 possible of eighth note of possible value of 

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:26.310
 caries we have two at the cross not 

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:28.380
 been different from the own to m I can 

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:30.240
 actually simplified and then stored 

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:36.120
 only all the probabilities the 

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:39.900
 two to the 2 so 4 probability so 

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.580
 enjoy badly daring shopping because there 

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.930
 had had to map since two by the 

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.270
 possible bad value dates 

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:47.820
 possible from kerry now we can 

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:49.290
 also exploit the fact that 

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.870
 conditional probabilities like that 

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.580
 have sommières this means that if 

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:56.010
 I know the probability that bad of 

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:58.110
 teeth be equal to true I can deduce 

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:59.970
 the toothache policy is equal to 

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.560
 so I just need half 

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:05.700
 of these settings there when I need 

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:08.490
 just 2 e to the 1 2 two parameters for 

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:10.230
 model this table of probity there for 

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.940
 with the same reasoning I need to 

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.620
 two probability to have all the 

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.360
 possible qualities conditional here 

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.220
 and then I just need parity that 

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.440
 Carrie is equal to Le Havre to be able to 

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.660
 calculate either probability she receives 

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:25.470
 gala true or false so in all I 

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:27.750
 only 2 + 2 + 1 so five parameters 

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.550
 individual stored in memory for 

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:32.340
 ability to calculate all probabilities 

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:36.390
 possible joining ego evil and 

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:39.360
 who then this contrasted with the case where 

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:44.520
 I could not have taken them off 

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:47.160
 little so I could not have gone from 

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:49.380
 the step here at the step here if I had not 

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.580
 seen that crooked and independent during evil 

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.130
 of nantes is dependent on crooked 

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:55.560
 knowing that harry I could not have 

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:58.140
 simplify it as being only this 

00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.330
 which I would need to store 

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:02.250
 dances only if four parameters 

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:04.140
 necessary for the calculation of this 

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:08.940
 conditional is here so I'm successful at 

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:10.260
 instead 4 2 2 + 1 so this share brings 

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.850
 so thanks to the functional expenses 

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.320
 I could reduce the number of parameters 

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.070
 that I attacked in memory for the 

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.320
 pros calculation 

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.520
 empowered that's a costume so I 

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.930
 not there to have reduced a lot but 

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.540
 finally have problems where I'm going 

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:23.790
 to be able to pass from an exponential man 

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:28.530
 from kind of to hate to a number 

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:29.310
 so linear from the top of n2 parameters 

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.440
 stored in memory 

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:34.650
 so we will be able to go from a body 

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.060
 exponential and light of a body that 

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.590
 is just impossible to do for 

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.930
 great values ​​of hate in a case that 

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:42.870
 is very reasonable 

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.920
 even for large values ​​of m 

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.690
 generally boarding 

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.360
 probabilistic conditional independence 

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:49.950
 it's really a concept that allows you to 

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.500
 represent the knowledge that is 

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.370
 very very useful they do more 

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.980
 to master this concept, that's fine 

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:59.010
 allow to model effectively 

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:02.910
 environments that are more 

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:05.840
 complex and that which involves a big 

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.840
 number of random variables
