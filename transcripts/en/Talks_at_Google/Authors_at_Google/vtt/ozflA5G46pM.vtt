00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:08.380
Hostess: He is a, a writer at Popular Science
and he went to Harvard.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.330
Umm, he's written two other books so far before
this one.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.000
One's about pirates and is for children and
is coming out soon, the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.750
other is about Einstein and this one came
about after he saw a book in

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.910
a bookstore about the philosophy behind how
Santa could exist and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.650
thought, well, let's look at it from a scientific
point of view.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.149
So, here we go, without further ado, "The
Science of Santa".

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.990
Gregory: So, the sad truth and the reason
I wrote this book is that

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.910
belief in Santa Claus is slipping.
Umm, this might come as a shock to some of

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.300
you in this room who I
assume are all believers, uh, but it's happening

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.720
right now all across
the country.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.699
We got little kids, juniors, seniors in high
school, soming home

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.010
crying, you know, during -- right before the
holiday break.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.509
They run into the house, run up their room
weeping.

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.890
Mom or Dad goes up, asks to see what's wrong,
makes them some hot

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.880
chocolate, and they explain, you know, I was
setting in the cafeteria,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.139
I was writing out my usual note to Santa and
these bullies came up and

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:21.399
told me that he's not real, that he doesn't
exist.

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:27.270
And it's terrible and I think the problem
here is that, you know,

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:36.119
Santa -- his mission does seem a little implausible.
Umm, he knows if we've been bad or good, all

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.020
of us, every one of us;
he knows what we want for Christmas; umm,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.299
he knows when we're
sleeping, when we're awake, and in all likelihood

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.599
who we're sleeping
with; umm --

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:43.599
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:46.969
Gregory: This doesn't sound -- you know, this
isn't just implausible.

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.959
It's a little creepy, too.
You could be arrested for things like this.

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.279
Umm, then you get into the next part where
he's supposedly immortal;

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:58.439
right?
Here's someone who's living on a diet of milk

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.679
and cookies almost
entirely and a little bit of eggnog.

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.849
If you look at Christmas Eve alone, say he
visits 200 million homes,

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:11.709
three cookies alone, that's 600 million cookies.

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:12.709
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.159
Gregory: -- and, you know, I've run the numbers
and I'm not sure

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:21.629
exactly how it would work out but it's roughly
200 million times the

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.450
recommended daily allowance of fat.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.450
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.450
Gregory: Umm, and this is all in a single
night.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.150
Now, normally this sort of eating behavior
leads to obesity, heart

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.060
disease, and in all likelihood an early death
and, you know, according

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.680
to what we know about nutrition, Santa wouldn't
make it to 60, let

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.680
alone 600.
Then there's his travel routine; right?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.700
You have this guy who lives up in the North
Pole, jumps in his sleigh,

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.549
and all of a sudden makes it around the entire
world in just a few

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.530
hours, umm, squeezes down these chimneys,
this big-bellied man

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.180
squeezing down a narrow space.
He's got an infinite sack of toys where he's

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.430
got toys for every kid on
the planet in one little bag.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.930
Never makes mistakes; right?
I mean, we see -- in the movie "The Santa

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.760
Claus" starts off where
Santa slips off the roof, falls, Tim Allen

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.890
grabs his card, he becomes
Santa, that Santa dies.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.349
But that's just fiction, you know, that's
just the movies.

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.349
That's not really how it works.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:13.349
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.730
Gregory: In reality, Santa's never fallen
off one of these

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.890
rooftops -- the snow-covered rooftops, never
made a mistake, he's

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.640
never tripped a security alarm, never gotten
a smart phone-captured

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:30.150
clip posted up to YouTube -- unless, of course,
maybe that has

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:47.540
happened and you guys have an agreement with
him to keep it down.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.159
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:56.480
Gregory: I don't know.
I'm just saying.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:08.909
Umm, I know that he does have a Gmail account
because I got an e-mail

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:18.359
from him the other day -- two days ago, said
he approved of the book,

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:31.020
I'm back on the nice list and I looked it
up and it was, you know,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.990
Santa@Gmailcom.
I have to believe that he does that for the

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:48.830
search capabilities
because, you know, he gets a new e-mail from

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:59.039
a kid and he says, I
remember this kid from somewhere, and then

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:06.979
he can just go back and
looks back and finds the old ones.

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:16.260
Very, very handy for someone like Santa.
Umm, so, anyway, given all these questions

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.509
and these -- these, umm,
apparent impossibilities, you know, it makes

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:34.039
sense that these bullies
would be able to convince this little kid

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.419
so easily, this poor junior
in high school.

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:46.060
The problem with kids today, the reason he
 -- you know, someone like

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:59.419
that is so quick to give up believing and
run home crying is 'cause

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:06.840
they're not really paying attention in science
class; right?

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:17.540
That's why I know all of you are believers
because you all certainly

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:27.430
have somewhat of a science engineering bed
and anyone with a decent

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:34.099
grasp of physics, biology, material science,
Santa's -- knows that

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:42.979
Santa's advertised abilities are totally plausible.
Umm, the trick is that he has at his disposal

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:45.500
some incredibly advanced
technology.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:52.430
Umm, and as we know Clark's law says any sufficiently
advanced

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.960
technology is indistinguishable from magic.
Trick is, you know, Santa -- everyone thinks

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.850
it's all magic 'cause
they don't understand how it works.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:13.919
Umm, you know, yes, he has a warp-drive sleigh,
that's pretty

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:14.919
obvious --

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:15.919
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:17.669
Gregory: -- umm --

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:18.669
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:25.960
Gregory: He uses all sorts of flying robots
to capture video

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:32.540
surveillance data.
Umm, ornaments are not just ornaments.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:39.949
They do have high definition, uh, listening
devices inside.

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:50.650
Umm, his suit does have meta materials that
allow him to go invisible

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:59.260
with he needs to.
Umm, and it also has some energy functions

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:07.330
where if there's a -- if
there's a malfunction in the worm hole tunnels

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:15.879
he uses sometimes and
he gets stranded out in the middle of nowhere

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:24.990
in some alternate galexy
he can pull down the hood and he has a little

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:32.860
reserve oxygen supply
and he can last for a little while, you know,

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.280
send an emergency
signal.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:43.140
Hopefully he's close enough where the signal
has time to get to the

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.190
North Pole and someone has time to go get
him.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:51.960
Umm, if he's out, you know, way beyond the
Milky Way, usually the

00:08:51.960 --> 00:09:02.010
signal doesn't get there until it's too late
Santa's just gotta shrug

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:08.970
his shoulders.
Umm, because I, uh, I should say Santa is

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:16.200
not, umm, the only one who's
going around making these deliveries every

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:21.020
night.
Uh, Santa has lieutenants, he has between

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:29.990
two and 300 who help him
with his task and I'll get into a little bit

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:35.700
more of that later.
Umm, also immortality.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:50.420
The reality is he isn't immortal, he is a
real person, but he has his

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:59.920
organs switched out pretty -- pretty frequently.
Umm, he has few -- a few pretty amazing organ

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:07.970
printers up at the North
Pole and whenever his liver runs down a little

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:22.460
bit from too much
eggnog, just gets a new one.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:35.240
Umm, obviously you wouldn't want to entrust
Mrs. Claus with that kinda

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:43.060
major surgery.
That would be pretty hard on her, so he has

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:50.711
robotic surgeons that do
the -- do the work.

00:10:50.711 --> 00:11:02.240
They're a little bit like the ones in, umm,
that fixed up Anakin in

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:14.080
"Revenge of the Sith."
I don't know if you remember that but, umm,

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:24.380
they have silly Chrismas
outfits and they're just a little bit more

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.380
friendly.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.380
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.270
Gregory: Umm, so, technology can explain everything,
umm, and this

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:33.600
book that I wrote, "The Truth About Santa",
umm, discusses, you know,

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:41.630
a lot of other things, the origins of St.
Nick, his true identity,

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:53.190
umm, how Mrs. Claus keeps it hot up there
at the North Pole, and why

00:11:53.190 --> 00:12:02.080
it wouldn't make sense for him to go the corporate
route and outsource

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:10.550
his whole operation.
In short it would just be really, really way

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:19.410
too expensive.
Umm, and all of this is discussed kinda within

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:26.660
the context of real
research, what's going on today.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:38.460
And so as I wrote the book I talked to a lot
of experts, umm, who

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:47.940
I've -- who I've spoken to in the past and
written about in the past.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:56.720
I called them up and I said, hey, remember
the time we talked about,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:03.560
you know, your Google work with 140 RNA interference
and obesity?

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, sure.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:16.130
Well, I was wondering if you think, well,
it seems to me like Santa

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:21.970
would probably use something like this.
And, oh.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.650
What?
You know, huh?

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:24.650
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:31.850
Gregory: But eventually quite of few of them
did, uh -- did, uh, get

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:41.280
the idea and they were very interested.
Umm, and -- anyway, so what I'd like to do

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:50.130
today is dispel a few of
the myths and answer some of the big questions

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:56.420
around Santa.
Umm, so that this way if some bully tries

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:59.581
to come and tell you that
there's no Santa, you can answer back.

00:13:59.581 --> 00:14:03.590
Your don't have to run home crying.
Umm, anyway.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:11.800
So, how does he know if we've been bad or
good?

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:22.990
With adults it pretty easy; right?
You scan e-mail, phone conversations, texts.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:33.090
It happens to people all the time.
Umm, it's all automated.

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:41.360
Just searching for certain patterns, key words,
things like that.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:53.100
Umm, the average company can handle this no
problem.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:15:03.240
Kids aren't on e-mail as much.
Umm, for kids, therefore Santa mostly uses

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:12.130
flying robots, like I said.
He's got these predator-like drones that are

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:17.250
way overhead looking down
on schoolyards, umm, looking for fights, bully,

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:28.600
things like that.
But then obviously a lot of things happen

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:39.260
indoors and a lot of
security cameras and school cameras are being

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:46.360
digitized so that Santa
can get that data.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:58.630
But for a while that was all analog tape and
he couldn't gather it.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:03.891
So, that's why he uses these mini unmapped
aerial vehicles or

00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:17.650
microaerial vehicles, umm, and
he basically has, you know, these

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:26.590
flying inside.
They look like little flies or wasps.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:41.180
They might be outside a window, they might
be stuck up on a wall, and

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:50.430
they're constantly monitoring kids and making
sure they're staying out

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:54.960
of trouble.
Umm, in the real world there's been some real

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.750
progress in this.
Umm, you know, Aerial Environment Company

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:01.660
out in California just
released this summer a little video of a flying

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:08.490
humming bird-like, uh,
aerial vehicle that flaps its wings and stays

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:14.709
aloft.
Umm, over in Harvard an engineer has one that's,

00:17:14.709 --> 00:17:21.880
you know, barely the
size of your thumb and it flies by guide wire

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:27.000
but it can't even get
off the ground.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:34.669
Umm, so there have been these enormous advances
in this field in

00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:40.190
recent years.
You know, people usually say, oh, it's just

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:46.840
because it's DARPA money
and there's a lot of military funding.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:54.700
Umm, but when I tried to talk to these engineers
about -- ant this

00:17:54.700 --> 00:18:02.530
story, they were reluctant to speak to me,
umm, which leads me to

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:09.350
think that they might be in league with Santa
somehow.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:17.679
Umm, either that or these advances, uh, have
become as a result --

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:27.740
result of reverse engineering; right?
I mean, Santa's got hundreds and millions

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:37.160
of these robots out there so
it may very well be that someone kinda picked

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:44.649
one up one day, found
it, looked into it, and tried to -- tried

00:18:44.649 --> 00:19:03.400
to make it work themselves.
Umm, now, flying robots couldn't get it all

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:12.299
so he does also have, uh,
high definition audio recorders and microphones

00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:21.210
in the ornaments, umm,
and they're very sensitive to the point where,

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:28.389
you know, they don't
have to be down on the tree.

00:19:28.389 --> 00:19:38.889
They can be up in the attic picking up -- picking
up kids yelling at

00:19:38.889 --> 00:19:45.679
each other or telling at each other, things
like that.

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:54.100
Umm, and all of this data, you know, the video,
the audio, everything,

00:19:54.100 --> 00:20:03.490
is -- is wirelessly routed to the Pole.
It's sent through -- you know, if it's heard

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:17.649
in a house it'll be sent
through a home network often but they try

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:36.389
to do this at night in the
middle of the night so they don't jam people's

00:20:36.389 --> 00:20:41.759
network and -- and
people don't get suspicious.

00:20:41.759 --> 00:20:49.149
Umm, but obviously this is a lot of data;
right?

00:20:49.149 --> 00:21:03.420
You have -- say you have one, uh, MAV per
house, you know, one

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:10.350
ornament per house, you have 200 million of
each.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:19.379
Umm, you could estimate about ten gigabytes
an hour of video, five

00:21:19.379 --> 00:21:26.149
hundred megabytes an hour of audio recording,
that's about ten and a

00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:42.770
half gigabytes per hour or a hundred and twenty-six
gigabytes per

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:56.830
household per day, umm, times 200 million
homes is about 23.4 exabytes

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:06.630
of data per day.
Umm, and that's a conservative estimate.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:16.160
So then that's not even factoring the overhead
drones, or the digital

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:26.159
security cameras in the schools which, as
I said, have been a big

00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:37.039
help.
So, how does he review all of this?

00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:52.600
He can't -- there's no way he could do it
all himself and, umm, it

00:22:52.600 --> 00:23:09.159
would be pretty hard for
the elves to do it as well 'cause you've got

00:23:09.159 --> 00:23:19.420
say 300 million kids who need one elf per
kid to constantly keep his

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:26.700
eye on the screens.
So 300 million elves up at the Pole would

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:36.499
be pretty tricky, , might be
a bit of a reading problem and Santa actually

00:23:36.499 --> 00:23:45.009
likes to clone them so
that would be tricky.

00:23:45.009 --> 00:23:54.460
Umm, so instead it's all done through intelligent
video management

00:23:54.460 --> 00:24:01.879
software.
Umm, it happens, again, in, you know, in the

00:24:01.879 --> 00:24:06.299
security industry today.
You have technologies like, umm, smart catch

00:24:06.299 --> 00:24:14.000
where a video -- there's
a bag that's been sitting in one spot too

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:21.710
long in an airport, video
software will figure that out and point it

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:31.279
out to a security official
or they have ones where you could use 'em

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:40.760
in schools and you could
look for someone hopping over the fence, an

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.490
intruder or something like
that.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:55.470
Umm, some people are even working on being
able to detect violent

00:24:55.470 --> 00:25:07.450
behavior where -- where you're looking at
two figures in a video and

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:18.049
sort of breaking out their arms and different
things like that and

00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:25.789
breaking down whether their arms are moving
sort of in concert in

00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:35.669
which case they might be shaking hands or
if one arm's moving against

00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:43.309
the other one it might be categorized as a
punch.

00:25:43.309 --> 00:25:48.360
So this is the sorta stuff that Santa has
going for him up at the Pole

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.860
and everything is automated and just bad behavior
 -- only the -- only

00:25:51.860 --> 00:26:03.129
the really bad behavior gets forwarded to
the elves so they don't have

00:26:03.129 --> 00:26:12.980
to sit in front of the screen all the time.
They're only really hitting the highlights.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:18.530
Umm, now, obviously this brings the question
of, I don't know, what

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:26.970
sort of data center does he have up there?
Umm, at the North Pole.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:39.289
It is a really big one.
One of the concerns with these kinda things

00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:49.140
is how do you keep them
all -- how would you keep all these servers

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:57.250
cool?
Umm, that's one of the reasons he's at the

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:59.679
North Pole, obviously --

00:26:59.679 --> 00:27:00.679
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:27:00.679 --> 00:27:12.660
Gregory: -- is that it's pretty simple.
You just kinda open the window, umm, let everything

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:23.419
cool down and --
and that just keeps it at the right temperature.

00:27:23.419 --> 00:27:34.990
Umm, but at the same time, you know, there's
gotta be some big

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:39.111
electricity demands and for that, umm, Santa
has a vast array of

00:27:39.111 --> 00:27:42.570
underwater turbines in the Arctic Ocean so
everything, his whole

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:53.071
entire operation runs on green technology.
Umm, and it has to really because Santa is

00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:55.690
really, really affected by
global warming.

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:59.770
Umm, today, the World Meteorological Association
announced that this

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:08.110
is -- this will with the warmest decade on
record and, up, this does

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:14.360
affect Santa.
He doesn't live at the actual magnetic North

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.110
Pole.
He lives, umm, his facilities are buried underground

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.450
in the Greenland
Ice Sheet, uh, which -- which is two to 3

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.789
miles thick in places.
Umm, but scientists have been finding in recent

00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:26.010
years that this ice
sheet is melting and the tops of Santa's facilities

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:28.590
are -- are now
starting to melt.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:39.320
And this is tough 'cause he's a busy guy,
the elves are busy, they

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:45.789
don't want tourists coming up there, bothering
them, slowing things

00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:46.789
down.
Right?

00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:49.679
So he's considering moving but at this point
it -- it still seems okay

00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:52.830
and -- but he's really trying to push green
technology to kinda -- to

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:56.789
kinda stop this global warming trend. That's
one of the reasons he

00:28:56.789 --> 00:29:01.460
stopped using coal, umm, you know.
He doesn't -- he doesn't drop coal off in

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.940
kids' stockings anymore.
Umm, so, anyway, the out-of-the-way location

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:09.350
up at the North Pole
brings up another question which is how does

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:11.289
he -- how does he do it?
How does he get around the world in one night

00:29:11.289 --> 00:29:14.059
from the North Pole to
all these hundreds of millions of homes?

00:29:14.059 --> 00:29:20.100
Umm, you've got one guy in a sleigh and being
trailed by flying

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:28.549
reindeer and, you know, the whole flying reindeer
thing does seem a

00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:40.090
little bit ridiculous and I will say it is
a PR front, umm, he keeps

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:47.499
around because he knows the kids love them.
He's -- he doesn't need them to fly.

00:29:47.499 --> 00:29:51.690
Umm, but let's assume that he did do it the
standard way: Reindeer

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:55.410
from rooftop to rooftop, umm, you know, steaming
out of the North

00:29:55.410 --> 00:30:00.460
Pole, landing on a roof, going down the chimney,
looking around,

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:09.399
dropping off the presents, going back up the
chimney and going on to

00:30:09.399 --> 00:30:20.789
the next house.
Umm, say he has to visit 200 million homes.

00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:31.239
You can assume about four minutes per home
including, you know,

00:30:31.239 --> 00:30:44.159
three -- three to three and a half minutes
of getting from one home to

00:30:44.159 --> 00:30:58.039
the next, umm, and then 30 seconds inside
 -- to a minute inside, a

00:30:58.039 --> 00:31:12.879
little puttering around, eating some cookies,
some milk, maybe having

00:31:12.879 --> 00:31:23.999
a little bit of a carrot just to get something
healthy in him, umm,

00:31:23.999 --> 00:31:29.649
and if he does all that it takes about 800
million minutes total, umm,

00:31:29.649 --> 00:31:35.000
or 555,555 days, or 1,500 years to deliver
all those presents that

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.809
he's supposed to in a single night.
Umm, and he does this every year.

00:31:41.809 --> 00:31:45.019
Umm, so if we assume that he's been in business
for 150 years that's

00:31:45.019 --> 00:31:56.100
228,310 years in all plus the rest of the
normal calendar year when

00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:14.570
he's not working brings the total even higher.
Umm, the movies have tried to explain all

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:24.690
this to us. You know, in,
umm, Miracle on 34th Street with Richard Attenborough,

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:32.179
uh, couple
people asked Santa this question, how do you

00:32:32.179 --> 00:32:40.039
 -- how do you do it in
and he says, well, time for me flows at a

00:32:40.039 --> 00:32:45.580
different rate so what if I
get stretch, you know, a second for you into

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.850
an hour for me?
Umm, that sound great and a -- and a -- it

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:58.080
 -- it does explain it a
little bit but the problem is that he'd still

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:04.540
have to live through all
that time; right?

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:16.559
His clock still runs through the normal rate
so he'd have to live

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:24.299
through those 228,000 plus years.
Umm, I don't care how big of a heart he's

00:33:24.299 --> 00:33:32.529
got or how great the cookies
are, he would get bored.

00:33:32.529 --> 00:33:34.149
He would sit down on someone's TV -- sit down
on someone's couch,

00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:35.769
watch some TV, maybe log into his facebook
page on their computer,

00:33:35.769 --> 00:33:37.530
he'd fall asleep and get caught.
Obviously this has never happened so we know

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:38.530
that this is not the way
the system works.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:39.530
As I said, instead he has assistants.
Umm, lieutenant Santas

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:40.530
There are about two and 300 of 'em.
Santa himself is the O.C.C., or the Original

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:41.530
Clause.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:42.530
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:43.530
Gregory: Umm, now, are they clones of Santa?
No.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:44.530
There would be some benefits here because
he could just sorta give

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:45.530
them his old clothes, they'd all -- you know,
that I had probably fit,

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:46.530
he could play poker with them and beat them
'cause he'd know their

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:47.530
poker faces because they're his poker faces.
Umm, but again he's a little bit worried about,

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:48.530
you know, one of them
potentially makes a move on Mrs. Clause.

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:50.609
So, instead, what he does is he finds, you
know, jovial older

00:33:50.609 --> 00:33:56.350
gentlemen and recruits them to work for him
for a period of two to

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:58.750
three years.
Umm, sometimes they're department store Santas,

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.820
sometimes they're
ex-journalists, uh, there's a whole bunch

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.309
of different positions he
looks at.

00:34:02.309 --> 00:34:06.190
Umm, mostly he just looks for people with
a high tolerance for

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:09.310
repetition and a hard -- hard working ethic.
Umm, now, why do they do it?

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:11.410
Umm, Santa pays them a lot of money.
He -- he has a number of revenue streams from

00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:12.410
consulting, umm, he has
a hand in almost every Hollywood movie that's

00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:13.410
made about him and he
also has, umm, robots that crank out scripts,

00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:14.410
action scripts, umm,
that are non christmas related and usually

00:34:14.410 --> 00:34:17.650
sells ten to 15 of those a
year so he does have a pretty good revenue

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:20.980
stream.
And he rewards them with a lot of money and

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.400
then at the end of their
term he gives them a glass of eggnog with

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:30.179
memory-erasing compounds in
it, uh, knocks out their last three years,

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:32.600
and sends them home with a
check.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.690
Umm, now -- [Coughing] -- excuse me.
Umm, the lieutenants travel via worm hole.

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:34.690
Umm, these -- these astrophysical oddities
are supposed to link one

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:38.710
part of the universe to another normally.
Umm, you see them in play in movies like "Contact"

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:39.710
and others.
Umm, but Santa's actually goes -- go from

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:40.710
one house to another.
Umm, usually they go from chimney to window

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:52.010
so, you know, he -- he
will leave through the chimney in one house

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:59.160
and arrive through the
window in a another house.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.160
Umm, I'm sure this doesn't surprise any of
you 'cause honestly how

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.160
many of us have really seen him arriving through
the chimney?

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.160
Right?
Nobody.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.160
Umm, anyway, the -- it also explains a few
other things.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.750
The, umm, you know, the finger aside the nose.
You know that's how he goes up the chimney

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:07.750
supposedly.
What that is is that's actually a classic

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:08.750
case of magician-still
misdirection, you know?

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:09.750
He puts his finger on the side of his nose
and you automatically -- if

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:10.850
a little kid is there seeing -- looks at that
and doesn't see Santa

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:12.150
flicking the little worm hole switch which
is hidden next to the

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:13.150
chimney.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.150
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:15.150
Gregory: Umm, it also explains a little bit
why, umm, chimney repair

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:17.830
people come around your house so often and
why it's so often -- so

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:18.830
often so expensive to fix chimneys is because,
umm, Santa's elves are

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:19.830
out there maintaining these worm holes so
they like to pop in and do

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:23.640
estimates on chimney repair and at the same
time check and see if the

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.200
exotic matter generators are working and things
like that.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.680
Umm, and that's also -- I don't know if you
notice but that -- I'm

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.080
sure it'll help clear up why so many chimney
workers are tiny and have

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.080
pointy little ears.
Anyway, the advantages are -- you know, the

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.270
worm holes, they -- they
cut the commute time to nearly nothing and

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.270
he actually -- Santa can
set it up so that his lieutenants can arrive

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:36.700
in one house before they
left the last one.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:37.700
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:38.700
Gregory: Umm ...
So what this does is it cuts the time per

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.700
home to about 30 seconds
'cause he doesn't have that commute time anymore.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.580
Umm, and what ends up happening is the total,
you know, amount of time

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:47.730
needed for Santa to get presents -- Santa
and his operatives to get

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.350
presents into all these homes works out to
190 years.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:50.670
When you split this among all the lieutenants
and Santa himself, who

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:55.750
does do a little bit of the work, umm, that
comes out to about six to

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:58.270
nine months each.
And, umm, obviously it's hard to work for

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:01.340
six to nine months straight
but they do have a lot of drugs in their system.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.340
Umm, they typically stay awake for 71 hours,
get an hour nap, with

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.340
that hour nap, umm, acts the equivalent of
eight hours' sleep in one

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:04.340
hour, umm, thanks to these drugs.
So they can keep going for those six to nine

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.340
months.
Umm -- [Coughing] -- excuse me.

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:06.340
Now, one of the problems is that you can't
have issues with a Santa

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.340
running into himself, you know, 'cause he's,
you know, he's constantly

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.340
going back in time, going toward in time,
and as a result the Santas

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.340
don't typically go from one house to the next
in the neighborhood.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.340
They -- they hop states and counties, and
countries and they're

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.340
zigzagging all across the world.
This makes tracking them pretty complex because

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:12.340
even though they each
have a little GPS device on them that tells

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.340
the elves where they are,
you know, every -- every, you know, fraction

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.340
of a second that keeps
doubling as the Santa comes back in time and

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.340
goes forward in time and
comes back.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.340
So, umm, it's a little bit harder to do but
the elves do a decent job

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.340
of it.
Umm, the other problem with worm holes is

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.340
that when they malfunction
when a Santa is inside the tunnel going from

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.340
one mou -- worm hole
mouth to the other worm hole mouth, you can

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.340
get left in an -- an
alternate and considerably less jolly universe.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:21.340
Umm, and sometimes a Santa can be rescued
by the means I described

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.340
before but most of the time they're just kinda
gone.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.340
And that's one of the reasons he pays these
guys so much 'cause there

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.340
is a lot of risk involved.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:25.340
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.340
Gregory: Umm, the other issue with this time
traveling technique is

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.340
it -- it runs into a little bit of causality
problems where if a

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:28.340
little girl sneaks out at -- at midnight,
goes and looks under the

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:29.340
tree, and sees that Santa isn't there, he
can't then travel back in

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.340
time and -- and be in that house when she
had already seen that he

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.340
wasn't there.
So an event happened and he can't change it.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.340
Now, if he's en route while this is happening,
again, he'll probably

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.340
get lost in an alternate universe.
So that -- according to -- this is according

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.340
to an astrophysicist at
Berkeley I spoke to about this issue, this

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.340
guy Richard Muere, and he
said that that might be the reason why Santa

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.340
tells people they
shouldn't go and peek out under the tree.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.340
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.340
Gregory: Umm, now, the O.C. himself doesn't
use the worm holes for

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.340
this reason because he doesn't wanna get involved
in such a risky

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.340
situation.
He's got a warp-drive sleigh.

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.340
Warp drive makes it a little easier for him
to travel because, you

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.340
know, instead of -- if he's just going from
point A to point B,

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:43.340
instead of trying to get there as fast as
he can, cover that distance

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.340
as fast as he can, warp -- the warp drive
in his sleigh allows him to

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.340
basically shrink the distance.
It pushes point A away from him and brings

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.340
point B closer.
Umm, I spoke with a few scientists about how

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.340
this might work and
there's some recent thinking about how it

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.340
might relate to fiddling
with extra demensions and things like that

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.340
but to be honest I can't be
sure exactly how it functions.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.340
Now, can reindeer fly?
No.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.340
As I said, they're just there for show.
This, umm, this astrophysicist Richard Muere

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:52.340
at Berkeley suggested the
myth of the flying may actually be as a result

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.340
of, you know, the --
the elusion of the reindeer leaping off the

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:54.340
rooftop into a warp bubble
and disappearing; right?

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.340
It makes it look like they're flying off into
some cloud, or into the

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.340
sunset, or into the night but in reality they're
just really good

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.340
leapers.
Umm, now, you know, does he really make toys?

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.340
Obviously, umm, the classic vision is we've
got hordes of elves

00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.340
hacking away at -- at wood and making rocking
horses and things like

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.340
that.
Umm, but that's not the way it works at all.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.340
Umm, instead at this point, you know, Santa
 -- Santa and his crew

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.340
aren't up there slaving away.
They're actually in Hawaii at the Four Seasons,

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.340
up, relaxing, getting
a little bit of a rosy glow in their cheeks

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.340
and getting ready for that
hard six to nine months of work and the elves

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.340
themselves, they are all
monitoring this data I was talking about that's

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.340
coming in making sure
kids are naughty, or nice, or what have you.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.340
Umm, plus, the question is, you know, how
would Santa know what to

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.340
make?
Even if he could, you know, get all of the

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.340
wish list, which is pretty
simple, umm, the problem is, parents do leave

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:10.340
kids some presents;
right?

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:11.340
We know that.
And so Santa would have to figure out what

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.340
are the parents going to
leave versus what I should leave.

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.340
So really he's never going to know what he
should leave or give a kid

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.340
until he gets to the house, sees what the
parents have left, and sorta

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.340
cross references that sample with the desired
wish list.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.340
Umm, now, if -- if you imagine him bringing
a bag of -- of finished

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.340
toys, he would then have to basically have
 -- you know, if a kid has

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.340
ten toys on his list and he gets six of 'em,
Santa would have to have

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.340
all ten toys and then go through -- so it's
just two inefficient and

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.340
it doesn't make sense.
Instead he has, umm, he has a -- he basically

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.340
enters the room, he has
a high-performance scanner where, you know,

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.340
he can look through his
terahertz radiation scanner that can look

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.340
through wrapped gifts,
figure out what they are, then he gets a list

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.340
of what a kid has
received.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:25.340
Umm, the North Pole, he sends this information
back to the North Pole

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.340
and then, umm, the North Pole fires back to
him a reference code for

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:27.340
a -- the toy that he should be leaving, umm,
he types this into a

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.340
little handheld remote, fires it at a little
box he brings with him,

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.340
and inside, the toy starts self-assembling
from sub molecular

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.340
components.
Umm, now, he also, you know, after he does

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.340
that, he has another bite
of a cookie and then he leaves.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.340
This isn't a quick process.
It takes about two hours but Santa doesn't

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.340
need to be there to watch
it happen.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.340
Umm, what -- what it is, is, umm, you know,
self-assembly is -- again,

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.340
it's not magic either.
It happens all the time in the real world

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.340
and -- galexies
self-assemble tree, self-assembled, umm, scientists

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:37.340
are making
progress in the area, too.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.340
Umm, uh, a pair of scientists, one at the
university -- UMASS Amherst

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.340
and also Berkeley recently coaxed these tiny
polymer strands to

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.340
self-assemble into 10 trillion cylinders with
precise patterns that

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.340
they think eventually could lead to discs
the size of a quarter that

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.340
still, uh, store 175 DVDs worth of data.
Umm, this is small stuff.

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:43.340
Larger stuff like toys is farther out but,
you know, a few of the

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.340
experts I've spoke with say it's not totally
inconceivable.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.340
Umm, so with Santa, he leaves this thing on
the floor and he's gone

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:46.340
and as he's gone this sort of fluid-filled
central chamber starts

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.340
these -- these, umm, sub molecular components
start gradually linking

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:48.340
together to form complex structures, the toy
comes together first,

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.340
then the packaging, and then the fluid drains
out through a tiny hole

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.340
in the bottom and it dissolves and there's
no trace left except on

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.340
these newer IKEA hardwood floors where there's
a little bit of a stain

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:52.340
left over but apparently Santa is working
to resolve that.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.340
Umm, now -- [Coughing] -- excuse me.
What happens when he is spotted?

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:54.340
'Cause on occasion, Santa does like to be
seen by certain kids to sort

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:55.340
of keep the belief in them about -- alive.
And when this happens, he's totally happy

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.340
to interact to the child,
wish them a merry Christmas, tap 'em on the

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.340
head, have a cookie, et
cetera, and go.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.340
But occasionally, umm, a child doesn't come
out but a parent, you

00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.340
know, an overprotective dad potentially with
a shotgun.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:00.340
Umm, and Santa usually gets very little warning
for this.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.340
He has a lot of surveillance devices in the
 -- in the room, umm, you

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.340
know, and the elves will warn him hey, there's
someone coming but he's

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:03.340
such a trusting guy and a jolly guy that he
doesn't think it's gonna

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.340
be anything threatening so he just hangs out
and waits and what

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.340
happens when it is, you know, a dad with a
shotgun or something to

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.340
that effect, umm, he basically just goes invisible.
He has these, uh,

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:07.340
meta material enhanced so that can bend light
around him and re-rout

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.340
it so you don't even know he's there, sort
of like the invisibility

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:09.340
cloak in "Harry Potter" or something like
that.

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:10.340
Umm, now, when this happens, the dad usually
just yawns, realizes he

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.340
had too much champagne or eggnog the night
before, goes back to bed,

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.340
and Santa takes off and he's safe.
Umm, now, finally, umm, probably the most

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.340
pressing question is, uh,
will I get good presents this year for writing

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:14.340
this book?
Umm, now, as I said, I received an e-mail

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:15.340
from Santa the other night.
He says I'm on the nice list which is good

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.340
to know, umm, but I really
guess I won't know that answer until Christmas

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.340
morning.
Umm, but that's not the main reason I wrote

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.340
to, you know, to get good
presents.

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.340
Umm, part of my concern is for my country,
too.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.340
It's about patriotism.
You know, there are far too few scientists

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:21.340
and engineers coming up
through the ranks.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.340
There's this -- that Laura Morganston report,
"The Gathering Storm",

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:23.340
you know, about the future of our economy
and how we don't have enough

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.340
scientists and engineers and I think, you
know, getting kids to think

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.340
differently about Santa, stop thinking about
magic and start thinking

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:26.340
about it in a science sense, umm, could really
make them look at this

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:27.340
holiday in a whole new exciting way.
Umm, and so I think, umm, that's it.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:28.340
You know?
I, uh, I hope you all spread the truth about

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.340
Santa and I hope that no
bullies intimidate you and thanks for having

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.340
me and happy holidays,
and merry Christmas and, uh, I'd love to answer

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.340
questions if anyone
feels like asking 'em.

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:32.340
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.340
Gregory: Sure.
Oh, right.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.340
&gt;&gt; Umm, so, uh, my -- my big issue here with
belief in Santa Claus is

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:35.340
I have trouble believing in the public.
Here we are giving them free services and

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.340
they keep claiming that
we're collecting too much information on them.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.340
What you just described --

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:38.340
Gregory: [Laughing]

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.340
&gt;&gt; -- as far as information collection is
not something new.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.340
I mean, if every child is known to be naughty
or nice, clearly there's

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:41.340
massive amount of underage data collection
without permission going on

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.340
and -- and how do you -- how do you reconcile
that?

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.340
Does the public exist?

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.340
Gregory: I'm -- I'm a little bit -- that is
the one thing I'm a

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:45.340
little bit concerned about with this book
coming out where, I don't

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.340
know, I don't think Santa's gonna be upset
about the, uh, talking

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.340
about his travel techniques and things like
that but if he -- if he

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:48.340
does start to get into privacy trouble I'm
really worried.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.340
I am.
I hope I don't ruin the whole thing.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.340
So yeah.
'Cause it is a little scary.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.340
Abslutly.
I agree with you.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.340
I -- I try to swat any flies now that I see.
Moths, I keep 'em right out of the house.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.340
Absolutely.
Yes.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.340
Absolutely.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.340
&gt;&gt; Hi.
Umm, if he has all this technology and perfect

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:56.340
information and stuff,
how come I didn't get the present I asked

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.340
for last year?

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.340
Gregory: Uh, you were naughty.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.340
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.340
&gt;&gt; All right.
So, uh, you seem like a good source to answer

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:01.340
this question I've had
for a while, which is, going in the bookstore,

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.340
there seems to be a lot
of Santa expose books out at this time and

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.340
like I bought "Santa
Responds" the other day where he where I say

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.340
back to kids' Christmas
lists and stuff.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.340
I mean, clearly he e-mailed you so you're
legit, but how do I tell

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.340
with the other books?
Like, which ones are valid?

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.340
Gregory: Well, we're looking into sort of
a certification process.

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.340
Uh, yeah.
And I don't know -- I don't know where he

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.340
stands on that at this point
but I think, you know, I think it's an absolutely

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.340
valid question
'cause there is a lot of -- like I said, there's

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.340
a lot of myth out
there, there's a lot of crazy stories and

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.340
I think it's important to,
you know, really settle on the truth and -- and

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:13.340
really explain, you
know, to kids what Santa is all ant but I'm

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.340
glad you brought that up
because that's something that does need to

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.340
be resolved.
I agree.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.340
All these -- all these other books.
I moan, there only really needs to be one

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.340
book about Santa Claus;
right?

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:18.340
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.340
Gregory: You know?
You've got all this other junk out there.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.340
Yeah.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.340
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.340
Gregory: It's a good point.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.340
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.340
&gt;&gt; Uh, what's your opinion on the controversial
claims in Erich Von

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.340
Daniken's book "santa Claus Was An Extraterrestrial"?

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.340
Gregory: I -- you know, it's funny. I think,
umm, that would be a

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:27.340
sort of a half truth because, umm, while Santa
Claus himself is not an

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.340
extraterrestrial, all of his technology is
of alien origin.

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:29.340
Umm, you can't imagine, you know, it'd be
impossible for someone from

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.340
the future to go back in -- or maybe not impossible
but very

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.340
implausible to go back and give Santa this
technology because, as you

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:32.340
know, you can't -- even if we could invent
a time machine, you

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.340
couldn't go back any further than the invention
of the first time

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.340
machine; right?
So, umm, there's no way Santa could have started

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.340
all this in 1850
'cause nobody had a time machine back then.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.340
If someone were to invent one today, the best
we could do is go back

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.340
to today.
Umm, and Santa himself couldn't have developed

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.340
all this stuff because,
I don't know, there's never been anyone I

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.340
don't think in the history
of humanity who's had that sort of skill as

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.340
a scientist and an
engineer, he'd have to have knowledge of all

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:41.340
these different fields
and the ability to apply all this knowledge

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.340
going up in, you know,
several centuries past what we know now.

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:43.340
So all of his technology does come from aliens.
We don't know why they gave it to us, why

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:44.340
they gave it to him but,
umm, absolutely.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.340
You know, it's alien origin.
Santa himself is not an alien, but they do

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.340
help him.

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.340
&gt;&gt; This has come up in a couple of different
ways.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.340
Obviously Santa would like to avoid very public,
umm, exposure, uh, of

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.340
any -- of any of his methods and how this
happens.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.340
Umm, and the obvious way to do this is by
having people present false

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.340
descriptions of how things actually work and
 -- and playing the role

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.340
of journalist here, I have to question whether
you are an agent of

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.340
Santa in doing this and -- the -- the -- the
 -- the K.I.S.S.

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.340
philosophy, Keep It Simple, Stupid, the simplest,
uh, uh, uh -- the --

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.340
I'm sorry.
Nthe simplest explanation is probably the

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.340
real one.
Umm, it seems to me by -- by, uh, splitting

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.340
up the tasks that he's got
across many people, uh, many elves, planted,

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:58.340
distributed in every
household, not the shortest actually actually

00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.340
but the tallest members
of those households who know whether the children

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.340
are naughty or nice
by being present and watching them, uh -- uh

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.340
directly, umm, who -- who
know what -- what gifts are arriving and -- and

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.340
are able to coordinate
like that would be the obvious thing.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.340
The problem is that would be parents.
They aren't -- they aren't elves.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.340
So the way to turn those people into elves
would be some kind of mind

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.340
controling reading device.
That's all he needs.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:06.340
A mind controlling reading device for all
the parents and suddenly the

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.340
problem's solved.
I think that's what happened.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.340
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.340
&gt;&gt; Very good.

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:10.340
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.340
Gregory: Umm, no.
It's a -- it's a -- it's a very good point

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.340
and, you know, I am -- I've
been accused of -- of imagining some of this

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:13.340
'cause I'm a novelist as
well made up -- I am prone to making things

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.340
up on occasion, uh,
writing pirate stories and other things like

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.340
that, uh, but I'm just a
simple reporter in this case, just an investigative

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.340
journalist who's
trying to help someone, uh, so, umm, yeah?

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.340
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.340
Thanks.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.340
Hostess: Yeah.
If there are no other questions.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:20.340
Gregory: Sure.
Great.

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:21.340
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:21.343
Gregory: Thanks everyone!
