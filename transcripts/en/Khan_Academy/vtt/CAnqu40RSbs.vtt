00:00:00.827 --> 00:00:04.199
- [Voiceover] A line is graphed
aand the X-Y plane is shown.

00:00:04.199 --> 00:00:06.881
Which of the following
equations represents the line,

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:08.628
they give us a bunch of equations here.

00:00:08.628 --> 00:00:11.229
And so there's several
ways we can tackle it.

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:12.021
When we look at this

00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:13.586
I can see there's two
interesting points here,

00:00:13.586 --> 00:00:16.877
there's the point when X
is, let me just write this,

00:00:16.877 --> 00:00:18.584
and I should be writing a little bit lower

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:19.336
so we can look at it at the same time

00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:21.631
that I look at the equation choices.

00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:25.553
So we see that when X is to zero,

00:00:25.553 --> 00:00:27.605
Y is one.

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:30.896
So that is the Y intercept, we could say.

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:34.065
And then you can see
when X is six, Y is zero.

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:36.442
When X is six, Y is zero.

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:38.759
So a very kind of basic
way of approaching this

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:41.867
is see like, oh, when X is to zero,

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:43.391
Y needs to be equal to one.

00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:48.023
When X is zero, we get
six Y is equal to one.

00:00:48.023 --> 00:00:49.425
Well then Y is going
to be equal to one six,

00:00:49.425 --> 00:00:51.172
rule that one out.

00:00:51.172 --> 00:00:52.574
When X is equal to zero

00:00:52.574 --> 00:00:54.057
Y needs to be equal to one.

00:00:54.057 --> 00:00:56.455
If X is zero, then six Y equals six.

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:59.584
Yeah, Y is going to be equal to one.

00:00:59.584 --> 00:01:01.229
Now when Y is zero,

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.175
X is going to be, X
needs to be equal to six.

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:06.369
So if Y is zero this goes away

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.157
and X is equal to six.

00:01:08.157 --> 00:01:09.153
So we're done.

00:01:09.153 --> 00:01:10.799
This is our choice.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.952
Now there's other ways that we can do it.

00:01:12.952 --> 00:01:16.203
We could write it first
in slope intercept form

00:01:16.203 --> 00:01:19.210
and convert to this form right over here,

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.241
so let's do it that way, as well.

00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:23.334
So we could say that the
equation of this line

00:01:23.334 --> 00:01:24.553
is going to be Y,

00:01:24.553 --> 00:01:27.032
if I write it in y = mx = b form

00:01:27.032 --> 00:01:28.190
where M is the slope

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.978
and B is the Y intercept,

00:01:29.978 --> 00:01:32.111
we already know that B is equal to one.

00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:33.594
so we already know that's one.

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:35.057
And what's the slope?

00:01:35.057 --> 00:01:36.682
Well slope is our change in Y

00:01:36.682 --> 00:01:38.572
for given change in X.

00:01:38.572 --> 00:01:40.949
And we see when our change in X

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:43.103
is positive six,

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.256
when our change in X is positive six,

00:01:45.256 --> 00:01:47.694
our change in Y is negative one.

00:01:47.694 --> 00:01:51.778
So our slope is we decrease in Y by one

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.891
when we increase in X by six,

00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:55.841
is negative one sixth.

00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:57.121
So the equation of the line

00:01:57.121 --> 00:02:02.121
Y is equal to negative one
sixth X, this is the slope,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.921
plus one.

00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:05.587
And then we could convert to

00:02:05.587 --> 00:02:08.167
the forms that we have here.

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:11.012
So let's see, we could add

00:02:11.012 --> 00:02:13.470
one sixth X to both sides,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.567
and you're gonna get

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:19.443
one sixth X plus Y is equal to one.

00:02:19.443 --> 00:02:21.150
And that's not quite what we have here,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.827
all the X coefficients on X are just one.

00:02:24.827 --> 00:02:26.412
So we could multiply both sides of this

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:28.667
times six and we would get

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:32.853
X plus six Y is equal to six,

00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:37.083
which is exactly the
choice that we picked.
