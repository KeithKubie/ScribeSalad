00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
[Cheerful music]

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.440
The definition of 'Narcissistic Personality Disorder is:

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.580
a mental disorder, in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.360
a deep need for admiration and a lack of empathy for others.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.420
But behind this mask of ultra-confidence lies a fragile self-esteem that's vulnerable to the slightest criticism.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.740
While narcissists might think of themselves as all-powerful and invincible,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.980
- there are a lot of things which scare them

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.480
One: Rerelationship commitment

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.680
Probably one of the things which narcissists fear the most is committing to a relationship.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.060
Narcissists never let their guard down, and being in a real relationship

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.280
- means you can't put up walls and hide your true self as so many narcissists do.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.420
Being that close to someone also exposes their insecurities,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.020
- and some narcissists are scared that their partners will find out their

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.540
deepest, darkest secrets.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.660
Do you know anyone who's like this?

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.840
Two: Self-reflection

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.800
When it comes to narcissists, a lot of them are in complete denial.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.320
For many, the one thing they fear most is coming to terms with who they really are.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.869
They like to think of themselves as perfect.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.820
They are afraid that if they look to deep within themselves,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.320
- they will find things that they don't want to cope with.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.280
Three: Insults

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.920
Narcissists actually fear being insulted more than you might expect.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.460
Although they are quick to dish out criticism to others, they simply can't handle the dose of their own medicine.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.640
Since most narcissists actually have areally fragile self-esteem,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.040
- an insult can be a humiliating blow to their inflated egos.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.340
And it's something they're really afraid of.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.520
Four: Shame

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.660
Narcissists will do anything to avoid feeling the sting of shame.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.920
It's interesting to note that while they fear shame, they don't fear guilt.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.660
This means that they fear being seen as unworthy in society and being lower in the social hierarchy.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.940
They don't, however, fear the guilt of actually hurting someone's feelings.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.340
Five: Lack of admiration

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.060
In a sense, narcissists are very much like performers.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.640
They crave attention and they want to be admired more than anything else.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.280
They are terrified that their attempts to impress others

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.520
- will be completely ignored.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.180
While some people are fine going through life completely unnoticed,  narcissists are the total opposite.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.680
Six: Getting exposed

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.440
Sometimes, narcissists can find themselves in a thick web of lies that they've created.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.720
They might lie about their past exploits to impress people or lie to manipulate others.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.780
While these lies might help them get what they want,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.940
Deep down, they have a huge fear of being exposed and getting called out on their dishonest behavior.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.760
Seven: Feeling gratitude

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.820
Narcissists are also totally incapable of saying those simple words: "Thank you".

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.400
Gratitude is a completely foreign emotion to them. And again, this probably all stems from fear.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.120
Saying "Thank you" means that they were relying on someone,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.120
- and narcissists will never admit that they need anybody's help.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.860
Lastly... Death

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.760
Believe it or not, many narcissists see themselves as gods.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.680
They think they're untouchable; that nothing bad will ever happen to them,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.680
- and that everything they touch will turn to gold.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.640
But everyone knows that even the most powerful people on Earth can't beat death,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.160
- and this is something that most Narcissists are terrified of.
