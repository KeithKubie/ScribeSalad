00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.810
Let's try to subtract
659 from 971.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.856
And as soon as you start trying
to do it, you face a problem.

00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:09.230
You go to the ones
place, and you

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.210
say, how am I going to
subtract a 9 from a 1?

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.400
And the answer lies in
regrouping, taking value

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.890
from one of the other
places here and giving it

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.210
to the ones place.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.230
And to understand that
a little bit better,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.050
let me rewrite
these two numbers.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.520
Let me expand it out.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.080
So this 9 is in the hundreds
place, so it represents 900.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.030
The 7 is in the tens place,
so it represents 7 tens.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.110
And then, this 1 is in the ones
place, so it just represents 1.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.260
And then down here,
this 6 represents 600.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.070
This 5 represents 5 tens, or 50.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.750
And then, this
9-- well, it still

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.386
just represents 9 ones, or 9.

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:55.510
And we're subtracting this.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.840
We're subtracting
600 plus 50 plus 9.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.320
Or another way of thinking
about it, we're subtracting 600,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.680
we're subtracting 50,
we are subtracting 9.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.070
So let's work it out over here.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.560
So this is the
exact same problem,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.180
just written a little
bit differently.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.554
And we still have
the same issue.

00:01:11.554 --> 00:01:14.840
How do we subtract a larger
number from a smaller number?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.050
And the solution lies
in trying to take value

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.360
from one of the other places.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.240
And the easiest place to go
is-- look, we've got 70 here.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.930
Why don't we take 10 from here,
and we'll be left with 60,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.480
and give that 10
to the ones place.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.250
So if you add 10 to
1, what do we have?

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.390
Well, then we're
going to have 11.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.160
Notice, I have not changed
the value of the number.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.220
971 is the same thing
as 900 plus 60 plus 11.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.700
It's still 971.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.812
And now we can
actually subtract.

00:01:48.812 --> 00:01:51.545
11 minus 9 is 2.

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:55.520
60 minus 50 is 10.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.160
And 900 minus 600 is 300.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.480
So this subtraction should
result in 300 plus 10

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.990
plus 2, which is 312.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.389
Now, let's do the
exact same thing here,

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.280
but we're going to do it
without expanding it out.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.240
So same issue-- how do
we subtract a 9 from a 1?

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.080
Well, let's take a 10
from the tens place.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.242
We're going to regroup.

00:02:19.242 --> 00:02:21.200
So we're going to get
rid of one of these tens,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.300
so we're only going to have 6
tens left in the tens place.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.200
And we're going to give
that 10 to the ones place.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.140
So 10 plus 1 is 11.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.070
Now we are ready to subtract.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.480
11 minus 9 is 2.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.100
6 minus 5 is 1.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.350
9 minus 6 is 3.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.280
We get-- let me do
that same color-- 312.
