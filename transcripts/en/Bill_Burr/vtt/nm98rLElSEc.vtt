00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.050
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.140
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.940
June 20th, 2016 what's going on? How are you, how are you doing,

4
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.000
you cons. Um, do you notice? Sounds a little weird. Uh,

5
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:22.070
I am in a hotel in Baltimore, Baltimore,

6
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.590
Baltimore. Um,

7
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:27.020
I can't say that cause I've watched Scarface so many fucking times.

8
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:31.280
I can't watch, I can't say Baltimore without picture and fucking, you know Tony,

9
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.280
Mike is that fucking ac coming back on again?

10
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:39.200
How many fucking times I gotta hit off? Ah, Jesus fucking

11
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.780
Christ. It's a fucking button on here. It literally just says off.

12
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.820
Off We go off. Shut off. Please shut off.

13
00:00:48.821 --> 00:00:53.650
Thank you. Fuck Sakes. I'm sorry. Um, anyway,

14
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.581
so believe it or not,

15
00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:59.581
I'm doing this because I'm flying back to La as you're listening to this and I'm

16
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.780
so sad to say, I haven't watched the fucking NBA finals yet,

17
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.420
but I do promise you if Cleveland wins, then I will do something. Ah,

18
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.480
I gotta do something specialist something. Um, cause who's kid? No,

19
00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:18.190
the warrior's already won it, right? If they repeat, fuck, sorry.

20
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.640
I held it too closely. If they repeat, then it's going to be like, all right,

21
00:01:21.641 --> 00:01:22.960
can they three pizza next year?

22
00:01:22.961 --> 00:01:26.770
I feel like is their big thing so that they can go down with all the teams that

23
00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:30.850
have won three in a row. So this year is sorta like, you know, you know,

24
00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:34.920
it's not as exciting. I'm sure warrior fans who I don't give a fuck.

25
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:37.110
I'd love to see Lebron do it. You know,

26
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.390
after everybody gave him shit for the way he left,

27
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:43.170
which they should have because like I said, he gave everybody fucking, you know,

28
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.280
sports blue balls. Like maybe I'll go here, maybe I'll go there.

29
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.980
Who wants to buy me a drink? Yeah,

30
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.330
he was being very cunty and then he went to fucking Miami. Jesus Christ.

31
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:57.630
What the fuck happened to her? I could have the TV not on, in the background.

32
00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.420
<v 0>Okay,</v>

33
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.850
<v 1>good Lord. Getting old is the worst. I just saw some woman,</v>

34
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.110
she had her fucking head.

35
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.020
Do you ever see like when a dog gets confused and cocks her head,

36
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.240
like her head was just like that? Um, what is that called? What does that from,

37
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:12.170
how do you avoid that?

38
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.710
Is it fucking alternate neca exercises you can do on the other side of your

39
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:20.020
fucking head so that doesn't happen to you. It's so fucking weird. Why?

40
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:21.670
Why can't you just like, you know,

41
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.000
why can't death just be like the old right there, Fred, you don't any,

42
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.030
why does it have to be just like this slow fucking dissension into like,

43
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.290
God knows what? The older I get, the more frightening that is.

44
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.300
When you're younger, you just like Jesus,

45
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.690
that old fuck what happened to them and me, I'm looking at it now going like,

46
00:02:41.691 --> 00:02:44.720
you know, in the next 20 fucking years, you know,

47
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.150
I've got to start eating better. Jesus Christ.

48
00:02:49.151 --> 00:02:50.560
I'm off the rails and by fucking date,

49
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.310
does anything make you feel fatter than Eaton room service in your bed,

50
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.490
in a fucking hole, just eaten in yet in a bed in general,

51
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.310
nothing makes you feel fatter than eaten in bed. You know,

52
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.670
just fucking sitting there getting crumbs in your sheets and shit and you're

53
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:08.290
trying to scrape it off onto the floor. You just feel like a fucking animal.

54
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:12.250
You like lay it on you. I was like literally on my side, I'm in Maryland,

55
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:13.810
so I got some sort of crab cake sandwich.

56
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.020
Of course it sucked because I got it at the hotel instead of the spot to get it

57
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.080
at right, and I'm on my fucking side and I'm eating the fries.

58
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.780
I'm literally sitting there like that fucking lifeguard.

59
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.010
You know when he got shit faced and he was eating the burger and everybody

60
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:28.240
laughed at and Hasselhoff,

61
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:31.540
everybody was laughing at him like it was fucking nuts. To me. It's like like,

62
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:36.340
dude, but you never did that. You never just been laying on your foot floor,

63
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.220
hammered eating a fucking, you should try it.

64
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:43.640
Sometimes the food is delicious. It takes it to a whole other level. Yes.

65
00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:48.340
So fucking psyched and so appreciative of the Goddamn food. You know?

66
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.550
If he wants to know, I advocate everybody doing that this week.

67
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:54.370
Get fucking hammered order burger, lay on your floor.

68
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.700
Just start talking shit in honor of father's Day while your daughter films you.

69
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.180
And I think that's, I think that's the way to go. Um,

70
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.180
people already texted me. You watched the game anyway, tonight.

71
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:10.340
Now I'm fucking working. Actually somebody tweeted at me going, what the,

72
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.860
what's with your agent? Why the hell would you agent book a show?

73
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.560
You know, when this game seven of the NBA finals, it's like, hey,

74
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:21.394
stupid.

75
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.440
Like we booked it after game six things been on the books for months.

76
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.610
We had no fucking idea. I didn't know. So, um,

77
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.220
anyways, uh, I really want to see, I love the warriors man, by the way.

78
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.790
You know, I have no beef with those guys, but it's just as a sports fan,

79
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.990
when I don't have a dog in the fight,

80
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.310
it would just be great to see the Bron after all this shitty got and all those

81
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:45.641
sad,

82
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:49.780
sad Cleveland fans burned his Jersey standing there and they're fucking cargo

83
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:52.540
shorts, right? Burden the Jersey.

84
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.470
What people filled it so fucking stupid. That is so stupid.

85
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.530
And I'm not singling out Cleveland Cavalier fans,

86
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:02.020
but when people just take sports to that level,

87
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.200
like when Lane Kiffin left fucking Tennessee and there was that one guy going,

88
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:08.440
let me tell you something.

89
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.190
He fucking piece of Shit Lane Kiffin Egan fucking leave here.

90
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.090
You're going to leave here like Tana sees it.

91
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.510
We ain't no stepping stone to USC. We're booking,

92
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.990
we're fucking destination skills without think book and lane book keep it and I

93
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:26.561
don't know what he had.

94
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:30.880
He had some lane Kiffin something or like a program and he fucking peed on it.

95
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.210
A grown man filmed themselves paying on that program. It's like, dude,

96
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.830
someday you're going to have kids. The fuck is wrong with you.

97
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.790
Well I don't give a fuck fuck and kids, I have them right there.

98
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.190
They are little dicks out you right with me.

99
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.410
I don't take it to that fucking level or whatever.

100
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.030
So I always thought it was stupid.

101
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.620
You know this is something like really like medieval about like it's looks like

102
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:59.540
you're at a burning or something when you sit in there burning a jersey,

103
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.041
you know what I mean? It's like,

104
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:03.470
is Jesus going to come down the street with his cross neck?

105
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.860
Next thing is start yelling. Crucify him. It's, you know,

106
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:09.590
at the end of the fucking day, who you know, who gives a shit?

107
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.580
If you went the fucking options. Cleveland fans, all right?

108
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.140
Of Stain and miserable downtown Cleveland with all those miserable fucking fans

109
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.300
are going to Miami beach with some of the hottest fucking ass that is ever been

110
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:26.900
fucking grace the earth, you know,

111
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.740
beautiful fucking weather, right? You buy a hurricane proof house.

112
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.090
I don't know what the fuck that looks like,

113
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.540
but God knows if anybody had the money, it'd be a fucking professional athlete,

114
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.180
you know? Of course you would go down there. You want a couple, two,

115
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:45.970
three. When he went three down there. Alright, four or five. Yes. Six. Yeah.

116
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.040
Six finals in a row and he come back to Cleveland. All right,

117
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:52.790
you fucking snowed. Cons and we go and I'm going to say,

118
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:56.480
I'm going to go big air on this one right now. I say,

119
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.760
if Lebron, if Lebron fucking

120
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.030
leads the Cleveland Cavaliers to the championship tonight,

121
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.820
tonight, tonight gave seven, seven, seven, seven years, um,

122
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.710
in my mind he passes Colby Bryan. All right, I'm just pausing right now. Oh,

123
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:22.550
what the fuck everybody's going to say all that shit. I just feel like a,

124
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:23.940
<v 0>okay,</v>

125
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.420
<v 1>the level of leadership that he would have to show</v>

126
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.970
in order to do that. You know what I mean?

127
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.630
Compared to the teams that Coby played on where he had all this fucking help.

128
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.913
You know what I mean?

129
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.760
Cause I feel like Lebron's already done the Cobi Championship where you piled on

130
00:07:38.761 --> 00:07:40.230
with Shaq and all that fucking shit.

131
00:07:40.231 --> 00:07:42.090
He went down there with Dwayne Wade and all those guys,

132
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.340
but to go to the middle of fucking nowhere as far as sports goes and lead a

133
00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:49.140
fucking sad sack.

134
00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:53.690
Fucking city set sac city auto out of the fucking,

135
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:58.660
they're cursed lack of championships is,

136
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.670
is a way bigger accomplishment than any than any of Co-pi's five that he had.

137
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.710
You know, my big beef with Tim is he,

138
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.720
if Phil Jackson wasn't the coach and he didn't have major free agents signings

139
00:08:10.771 --> 00:08:15.300
there, they immediately became a 500 team with Colby scoring 40 points a night.

140
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.530
You know, just being like, well, I got my stats. You guys suck.

141
00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:22.020
And then he just would walk off the court. I Dunno.

142
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.890
I would in my sports mind,

143
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.330
my unathletic comedic sports mind, I put that with like,

144
00:08:30.331 --> 00:08:33.810
just watching like the Pistons walking off the court when the fucking bulls

145
00:08:33.811 --> 00:08:36.180
finally beat him. Those shadows. Just something fucking wrong about that.

146
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.300
Walking off the fucking court. What do you fucking share? Um,

147
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.280
um, did she ever walk off the court?

148
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.230
Did she walk off a battleship ever when they,

149
00:08:49.231 --> 00:08:52.830
she didn't think the sound was right. I have no fucking idea. Anyways,

150
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:58.770
I'm plowing ahead here. Um, I had an amazing fucking time. I did, uh, Newark,

151
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:03.090
New Jersey, um, performance at Santa, whatever the hell they called.

152
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:03.930
It had some great shows.

153
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:08.180
And then last night I played this some fucking place in, um,

154
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:13.830
I don't know why. I don't know the names on this run. Um, hang on a second.

155
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:17.040
Typing in the password. One fucking word letter at a time.

156
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.500
I played this place last night and it was the same venue where Mike Tyson

157
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:27.390
knocked out fucking, uh, Michael Spinks. Now granted,

158
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.480
you know, the way they sat at when he had zonked,

159
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:33.390
I sold the same amount of tickets, believe me. Um,

160
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.550
they can see it in all these different ways.

161
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:38.010
So they sat at more for comedy show, but when he fucking did it,

162
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:39.960
it was like right now at turtle goddy fought there.

163
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.940
All these amazing boxing matches, uh, had had been there.

164
00:09:44.941 --> 00:09:49.110
And if you went in there, man, I literally felt like I was in citizen Kane.

165
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.480
I got to get you guys the name of this fucking place.

166
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.290
One of the more amazing places I've ever gotten to walk into.

167
00:09:54.291 --> 00:09:56.370
I had this old fucking, um,

168
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.130
this old Oregon there and shit as it can still going to be on my website or know

169
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.110
for fuck sakes. Bill Bell Burger

170
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.320
just got built bud fucking dope. Phoenix city. Let's see. Let's see.

171
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:18.180
Let's see. Something, something ballroom coming and fence.

172
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:23.280
You know, you fucking how fucking it just disappears. It's unbelievable.

173
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.100
You're kicked in the balls that fucking lives forever on the Internet.

174
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.330
Fucking one. God Damn. Day later, I can't find it. Whatever.

175
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.240
Lannick I'll tell you,

176
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:35.550
if you ever want to make a zillion dollars in Atlantic city,

177
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:40.670
open up a tattoo removal, fuck a tattoo removal store,

178
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.610
whatever you call it, service Jesus Christ. I have,

179
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.600
those were some of the worst fucking tattoos I've ever seen in my life.

180
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.130
What the fuck is the name of the venue? You can't,

181
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.860
this is what I do and I can't figure it out.

182
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:57.870
Just start landing city boardwalk hall and I'm actually,

183
00:10:59.051 --> 00:11:02.530
you know, my, my back has been way better, but just riding in a car,

184
00:11:02.531 --> 00:11:05.560
I don't know what it is. It just fucks with my leg. I get this,

185
00:11:05.561 --> 00:11:09.640
the nerve starts acting up again, but I'm like 85% of the way back.

186
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.920
I'm really psyched. So, um,

187
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:16.840
I didn't want to deal with driving that two hour thing down the turnpike. So,

188
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:22.270
uh, I actually for once blew a little bit of cash and,

189
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:23.410
uh,

190
00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:27.910
I took a helicopter ride down from the fucking west side of Manhattan Down to

191
00:11:27.911 --> 00:11:31.390
Atlantic City was the shit. I flew in an a star, um,

192
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.550
got to sit up right next to the pilot.

193
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.560
I didn't get one of the seats in the back, which was cool.

194
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.630
I bought a ticket and piled on this thing.

195
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:42.750
Some other people going down there and I'm so fucking Shit,

196
00:11:42.791 --> 00:11:46.330
man. He came out like, I was always terrified of being like, Oh man,

197
00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:49.780
I don't know if I would want to fly. I still wouldn't,

198
00:11:49.781 --> 00:11:53.980
I would never fly around Manhattan without an instructor because it's just so

199
00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:54.940
much fucking traffic.

200
00:11:54.941 --> 00:11:57.640
But you just go out over the Hudson and just like you're driving down the

201
00:11:57.641 --> 00:11:59.020
street, you just get on the right side.

202
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.260
I couldn't look over and sees gauges to see what altitude we were flying at.

203
00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:07.510
We went right down the Hudson River and I'm by the Freedom Tower and all that

204
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:13.030
stuff. And then we got to the other side. On the other side.

205
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.070
We've got the south side and this, um,

206
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.060
you know the statue of Liberty's right there, Ellis island.

207
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.750
And then we went right over the Verrazano Bridge and there's no way to fucking

208
00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:27.520
go over that thing and not think good fucking Saturday night fever. You know,

209
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:30.590
when that fucking Guy Bobby, whatever his fucking name is,

210
00:12:30.591 --> 00:12:34.790
tries to do the head stand. Look at me. I'm like, you guys right? Look at me.

211
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.190
They're like, Bobby, don't fucking do it.

212
00:12:37.191 --> 00:12:42.170
Bobby said him and his, well he has to suit,

213
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.510
just go all the way down to the fucking bottom man.

214
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.640
It's fucking fucking unbelieve. I'm at that fucking scene.

215
00:12:49.641 --> 00:12:51.770
Scared the shit on me when I was a kid, but now you know,

216
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.740
his fucking Afro and his fucking big collar, you know,

217
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.590
it's almost like if he went in head first he would have been fine or actually

218
00:13:00.591 --> 00:13:03.320
maybe it would absorb too much water and he'd hit the bottom. I have no idea.

219
00:13:03.321 --> 00:13:06.560
But anyways, we went over that, then we went over Red Bank, New Jersey,

220
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:10.010
made a right and went right down the coast. Went by Asbury Park.

221
00:13:10.011 --> 00:13:14.390
So the fucking Jersey show me, it actually made me think like,

222
00:13:14.391 --> 00:13:17.970
I can't believe I never went to either one of those places. Um,

223
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.640
but down to Atlantic City and then we, uh,

224
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.650
had a great time down there and tonight I'm in Baltimore,

225
00:13:22.651 --> 00:13:26.520
so that's basically it. But a fucking underrated,

226
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.420
underrated being in Manhattan, blowing a little bit of cash,

227
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.170
piling onto a fucking helicopter with a few other fucking passengers getting the

228
00:13:34.171 --> 00:13:38.160
last seat and fucking flying by that amazing skyline, man.

229
00:13:38.161 --> 00:13:42.000
It was the shit. It was the shit. And I finally got to ride a,

230
00:13:42.001 --> 00:13:46.610
a star and a, it was way less intimidating than I thought it was going to be.

231
00:13:46.611 --> 00:13:49.180
I thought when I looked at the cockpit, all the gauges and everything branded,

232
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:53.180
they were analog. I don't like that digital shit. I fucking hate that stuff.

233
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.840
I don't trust it. I don't like it. I'm not a technology guy.

234
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.390
I like when everything looks like a fucking weird clock,

235
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.210
then I feel like I can read it. I don't, I don't like all that,

236
00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:06.270
that type of shit. So, um, anyways,

237
00:14:06.271 --> 00:14:07.350
how many minutes do I have to here?

238
00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:11.220
I will do the advertise and I just don't know if it's coming yet. Um,

239
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.510
let's see if we got anything. Nothing. So anyways, as always,

240
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.700
as I've been trying to mention here so I can support, um, my fellow comics, um,

241
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:24.280
if you like this podcast or stuff like this or maybe you're sick of it and you'd

242
00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:26.290
like to listen to another one. Uh, we have,

243
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:31.710

255
00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:21.860
we just got some investors on it, which is great.

256
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.050
So we're going to start having some more original content,

257
00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:27.500
which is why I'm trying to drive some traffic there and be a good fucking team

258
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:28.670
player. Okay.

259
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.320
So after I do my show here tonight and beautiful fucking Baltimore,

260
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.750
Baltimore, um, I'm flying, this is my fucking day.

261
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.200
I'm flying out to la.

262
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.430
I go right into the writers room and after that I'm doing a a,

263
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.780
I'm doing a benefit that's really important to me. Um, great friend of mine,

264
00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:48.441
Bobby Slayton,

265
00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:51.970
unfortunately his wife passed away a few months ago and we're doing a,

266
00:15:51.971 --> 00:15:55.930
a benefit and memory of her at the Saban Theater in uh,

267
00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:00.200
Beverly Hills and uh, the fucking lineups. Ridiculous.

268
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:04.820
Arsenio Hall is hosting and there's a few other up and coming comics you

269
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.410
might've heard of like, I dunno, Ray Romano, Dana Carvey, Jon Lovitz,

270
00:16:09.411 --> 00:16:11.270
Brian Regan, Bob Saget,

271
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.530
and I'll be a fucking pulling up the rear. They have a

272
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.450
low man on the totem pole and that show would definitely be me. Um,

273
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.550
I'm a huge fan of all of those guys,

274
00:16:22.551 --> 00:16:24.860
so I can't believe I'm going to get to work with them. Um,

275
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.030
unfortunately it's not the greatest reasons why we're doing it, but, um,

276
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:33.470
we love Bobby and um, it's a great benefit. There are a few tickets left.

277
00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.440
It's going to be a crazy show and I have a feeling all those guys are going to

278
00:16:36.441 --> 00:16:40.190
be fucking with each other cause they known each other for so long and uh,

279
00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:44.630
I want to be like beyond a fan boy that night. And then, uh,

280
00:16:44.631 --> 00:16:47.420
then after that I go home and then I go right on a fucking plane.

281
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.730
I have to go back to New York because a,

282
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.730
I've got to work with some actors to do some voiceovers.

283
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.590
We're up to episode eight. Everybody know recording episode seven. Huh?

284
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:03.470
Dodd days is summer. We'll coming around but coming around so fucking site,

285
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.670
we're a up to episode seven. We're going to do the table riff episode,

286
00:17:07.671 --> 00:17:10.190
April accord, the table a the fucking episode.

287
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.393
<v 2>Um,</v>

288
00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:16.900
<v 1>yeah, next week. Hey, you know, I just realized, you know, it'd be cool if this,</v>

289
00:17:16.901 --> 00:17:19.750
if one of you guys out there wanted to come to a table read,

290
00:17:19.751 --> 00:17:21.490
I gotta figure out how to do a,

291
00:17:21.491 --> 00:17:25.750
a some sort of contest or something maybe bringing in for episode 10,

292
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:28.510
whenever we record that. Uh,

293
00:17:28.511 --> 00:17:30.790
I don't know why the fuck I never thought to do that. You know, it's funny,

294
00:17:30.791 --> 00:17:33.880
I don't even invite my wife to him. I'm so busy like pouring over the script,

295
00:17:33.881 --> 00:17:38.620
making sure, you know, I don't fuck up the jokes at the table read, but, um,

296
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.770
you know what, I'm going to figure out how to do that and I'm,

297
00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:46.170
I'm promising you right now, by next Thursday. Yeah. Thursday's podcasts.

298
00:17:46.171 --> 00:17:49.020
We'll have something set up for that. I think that'd be a really cool,

299
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.090
if you're into the show, if you're not into the show,

300
00:17:51.091 --> 00:17:52.290
then you'd probably be like, wait, bill,

301
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.770
maybe I just want to go get a fucking cheese stick or some shit. Cheese. Steak.

302
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:59.550
Sorry. Anyways, let me, uh,

303
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.110
what else did I want to talk about here?

304
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.950
This is usually where I do the fucking advertising. I guess I can't this week.

305
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:10.330
Um, oh, formula one racing. Oh,

306
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.360
the European Grand Prix over there. Um,

307
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.300
I actually didn't get a chance to watch that cause I stayed out too late,

308
00:18:17.301 --> 00:18:21.740
but I did tape it. But spoiler alert, spoiler alert,

309
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.130
a Nico Rosberg fucking Nico,

310
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:31.010
Nico Rosberg he won his fifth fucking race, right? One, two, three, four, five.

311
00:18:31.011 --> 00:18:33.230
He's won five of them. He's the points leader.

312
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:38.520
He's said he's with the German team and he's uh,

313
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.710
just funny. Ross Park, you know what I mean?

314
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:44.040
It's about time they fucking made up for it. Had a Jewish guy drive for them,

315
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.460
you know, um, I don't even know if he's Jewish or anything, but uh,

316
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.930
he also drives from Mercedes, so I always root for Germany and Mercedes because,

317
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.910
uh, I've never done a background check,

318
00:18:53.911 --> 00:18:58.260
but I think I'm mostly German just based on, uh, what my parents have told me.

319
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.770
Um, but oh my God, I saw the pictures of it too,

320
00:19:02.771 --> 00:19:04.840
just driving through this beautiful fucking city.

321
00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:09.130
I don't know where the fuck I been for so goddamn long when it comes to Formula

322
00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:12.610
One. Now, of course me because I'm a psycho. Somebody told me about the fucking,

323
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:17.970
you know, the basically the former formula one of, of motorcycle racing. Um,

324
00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:19.420
I don't know why I'm not watching that.

325
00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:23.650
I sit there and I flip out where I love all these fucking crazy contact sports.

326
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.130
Right? You know, I like rugby, Australian rules,

327
00:19:27.131 --> 00:19:30.940
football and this fucking Mad Max shit that people been showing me lately where

328
00:19:30.941 --> 00:19:34.570
it's sort of rugby sort of soccer and after somebody scores you can punch them

329
00:19:34.571 --> 00:19:39.460
in the face. I don't know what the fuck that is. It's like football,

330
00:19:39.461 --> 00:19:44.110
soccer, rugby and bullying all at the same fucking time, man.

331
00:19:44.111 --> 00:19:46.990
It's just, I don't know about that sports. You don't,

332
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.680
the only thing that was missing was just to have a couple of bulls run in there

333
00:19:50.681 --> 00:19:53.950
and just start fucking trampling people. Um,

334
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:55.800
<v 2>okay.</v>

335
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.700
<v 1>But anyways, uh, let me shut this fucking TV off.</v>

336
00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:02.580
This is really fucking with my brain here. Um,

337
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.520
I don't know why if I liked all that type of shit.

338
00:20:05.521 --> 00:20:09.390
Why watching somebody ride a motorcycle 200 fucking miles an hour.

339
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.890
Um, it's absolutely incredible.

340
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:16.600
It is amazing to me is these guys are so good that when they go down,

341
00:20:16.601 --> 00:20:20.410
they don't die somehow. You think they, I mean that same people don't die,

342
00:20:20.411 --> 00:20:24.220
but you'd think they would die every fucking time. You know what I mean?

343
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.610
The fact that you can wear a fucking suit

344
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.260
that is so God damn strong human go 200 miles an hour and you could fall off

345
00:20:34.261 --> 00:20:36.180
your fucking bike and it just does.

346
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:41.210
Like what should happen there is like after fucking two seconds of skidding on

347
00:20:42.661 --> 00:20:47.661
the asphalt at 200 miles an hour immediately you should just see the guy's ass.

348
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.480
His Berra has, should be there.

349
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:53.860
And then you just see it looks like steak and then it would look like bones and

350
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:55.990
then that would just be it and the guy would be dead.

351
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.730
You would think that that would happen every time.

352
00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:02.500
And these fucking guys just slide in these goddamn suits and were incredible.

353
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.940
Not saying people don't die. But um, I think, um,

354
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.030
I think this is sort of my next thing man. Cause like you, what's funny,

355
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:13.330
this time of year when hockey ends and basketball ends,

356
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.760
everybody is a football fan. You know,

357
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:19.060
Pixie the hockey or hoop for the most part. All right.

358
00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:21.610
Very few go hockey and then wait and go baseball.

359
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:22.930
I only know a couple of guys like that.

360
00:21:22.931 --> 00:21:26.050
So people go hockey or fucking hoop and um,

361
00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.200
people who watch hockey don't watch who people watch hoop,

362
00:21:29.201 --> 00:21:32.350
don't fucking watch hockey. They have nothing in common with each other.

363
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.260
And the only thing that they have in common with each other other than their

364
00:21:35.261 --> 00:21:40.261
love of football is the sheer fucking panic of the day after the game seven or

365
00:21:40.571 --> 00:21:44.320
your final or your finals when that's over and you're like, holy fuck,

366
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:50.320
what am I going to do now for the next two and a half fucking months is I wait

367
00:21:50.321 --> 00:21:52.030
for the NFL regular season to start.

368
00:21:52.031 --> 00:21:55.270
And I'm not shitting on baseball because I love baseball. I just,

369
00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:59.530
the the fucking dog days of summer, I can't stand like,

370
00:21:59.531 --> 00:22:01.630
you know who the fuck wants to go to the ballpark.

371
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:06.010
It's like fucking a hundred degrees out. You know who does die hearts?

372
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:09.880
I guess I'm not a die hard baseball fan, but I love it. I love it in October,

373
00:22:09.881 --> 00:22:13.930
so I needed a sport and Formula One dude,

374
00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:16.330
I'm telling you like the race today was,

375
00:22:16.331 --> 00:22:18.490
it was only like something like 50 something laps.

376
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.880
You can really just sit down and they bang it out in a couple of hours.

377
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:25.720
You know, you get to learn about other fucking cities, you know,

378
00:22:25.721 --> 00:22:28.600
half of them they go to like, oh shit, I'd like to go there,

379
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.590
get all those people hanging out, calling it right now.

380
00:22:32.591 --> 00:22:36.070
At some point I'm going to hit a fucking country when they have a formula one

381
00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:37.420
race, there's actually one here. It says,

382
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:41.350
the United States says United States Grand Prix for the life of me,

383
00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.090
I think it's an Austin, Texas,

384
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.960
which is really disappointing to me that that's where they're going to fucking

385
00:22:46.961 --> 00:22:50.620
have it. You know what I mean? Why the fuck is it in Austin, Texas?

386
00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.720
They should have that thing in like Chicago,

387
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.230
Chicago should have a Formula One fucking race.

388
00:22:56.231 --> 00:22:59.260
That's a cool ass fucking city, you know,

389
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.300
fucking zip and over the rivers at one point, only one car could make it.

390
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.590
They'd probably kill each other. Um,

391
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.690
I don't even know what the track looks like in Austin, but, um,

392
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:12.220
all I know is Austin is a great city. Once you're in it,

393
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.940
trying to get to it with that fucking traffic is an absolute goddamn nightmare.

394
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.620
So, um, anyways, I guess this is a place here where I would actually pause,

395
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:25.630
right? And I would do some sort of advertising. Um,

396
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.970
I'm just gonna say this so I can edit it in later.

397
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.980
We're going to pause here right now. The little bit of that advertising,

398
00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:38.020
when the fuck is my reads, come on, give me the reads, give me the reads.

399
00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.780
Ah, you can't. All right. But you know what?

400
00:23:40.781 --> 00:23:43.510
It doesn't matter you guys because this is not going to be in real time for

401
00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:45.480
yourself. Oh my God.

402
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:50.180
Does this podcast suck as bad as it sounds in my fucking head right now. Um,

403
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.360
you know, I was going to say about Baltimore. Every time I go to the Baltimore,

404
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:57.920
Baltimore, the Baltimore, I always think about the wire and I was going to go,

405
00:23:57.921 --> 00:24:01.230
I remember the wire and then I was going to go boom, booboo, booboo,

406
00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:05.780
which is for law and order. I can't even remember how the fucking song went.

407
00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.380
I just remember the song in the end, the guy was screaming up.

408
00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:10.041
But as you can tell,

409
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:13.850
I'm kind of losing my fucking voice with the voiceover shit and screaming about

410
00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:16.320
my deck here and stage. Um, but you know,

411
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.340
what I'm psyched about is my fucking act is coming together and I'm getting

412
00:24:19.341 --> 00:24:21.860
ready to do another special, I think I'm going to do it in October,

413
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.840
and all I gotta do is just get through these last three fucking episodes. Okay.

414
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:30.800
Give 100% on that shit, and then that's it. Then all of a sudden,

415
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.870
it's all Billy fucking flank steak.

416
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.930
Remember when I said I wasn't going to drink? You know,

417
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:40.610
I fucked up on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Okay.

418
00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.120
But I was great Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Sunday. Right?

419
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.810
So when I get back, I'm going back to not drinking. I gotta,

420
00:24:47.811 --> 00:24:51.320
I gotta get back off this, but I just, I don't know what happened. You know,

421
00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:55.250
I fucking, uh, I don't happen, you know? And you know what happened?

422
00:24:55.251 --> 00:24:57.530
I went on the fucking road. That's what happened.

423
00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.080
I went to New York and I met up with some fucking friends and like, Hey,

424
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:01.730
let's go to this fucking bar. And then, you know,

425
00:25:01.731 --> 00:25:04.160
it's like one of these wine bars, you know,

426
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.760
so you don't feel like you're drinking. So I showed up, you know,

427
00:25:07.761 --> 00:25:11.240
another buddy of mine that's fucking comic. I'm not going to say,

428
00:25:11.241 --> 00:25:13.160
I don't wanna name any names, but this guy's fucking hilarious.

429
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:17.750
And he comes in and it was hilarious. He called them out.

430
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.410
He just goes like, cause he showed up and uh, I know what you're saying,

431
00:25:22.411 --> 00:25:23.730
but why did you go to a wine bar?

432
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.420
Because there were ladies there and that's what they fucking picked, right?

433
00:25:27.421 --> 00:25:28.890
So we're like, all right, I'm gonna fucking go there.

434
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:33.090
So he shows up and I immediately got, dude,

435
00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.350
it's a wine bar. I don't, cause he wanted a beer and a shot and I,

436
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.730
his face fucking dropped in verse. He called out,

437
00:25:38.731 --> 00:25:41.280
he goes to the level of fucking disappointment on your face.

438
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.020
And then we find out that they had beer and they did have a shot,

439
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.890
but it was this, you know, this foofy place. So the dude goes, uh, they go,

440
00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.620
can I get some drink? He goes, yeah, can I just get a a bud light?

441
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.450
And the guy's like, ah, yeah, no, we don't, we don't have bud light. Uh,

442
00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.250
we have, we have a Papa Bubba, bull bull, whatever the fuck it is,

443
00:25:59.251 --> 00:26:02.750
some Italian beer. And he goes, guys like, Oh, what?

444
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:08.060
He's like a Bababababa Bowl? And he just goes, yeah, is, is that a beer?

445
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.800
And the guy goes, yeah. And he goes, all right, I'll have one of those.

446
00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.750
And I don't know what happened.

447
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.300
Then we started doing Tequila shots and the whole fucking thing went off the

448
00:26:15.301 --> 00:26:18.750
rails. And I'm a fat fuck. And I all like myself right now there.

449
00:26:18.751 --> 00:26:23.640
I said it a fucking in a hotel. Roman Baltimore eaten French fries in bed.

450
00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.690
Huh? Like some fucking,

451
00:26:26.691 --> 00:26:28.940
I dunno if somebody whose dreams didn't come true,

452
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:33.920
that's who eats French fries in bed or maybe people who fucking everything

453
00:26:33.921 --> 00:26:36.560
worked out for them and they're just so fucking bored. They, you know,

454
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:39.910
like Marlon Brando, whatever the fuck his issue was. Oh,

455
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.380
I've won every award that exists. Bring me a fucking elk.

456
00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:47.370
Said he just sat in bed just non on the fucking amblers for like 10 years and

457
00:26:47.371 --> 00:26:51.930
all of a sudden, you know, he's ready to do the fucking,

458
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:57.090
what is it? What the fuck? Gorilla Monsu movie. I have biopic. I have no,

459
00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:01.110
I don't know how those things work. I don't pretend to fucking know. Um,

460
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:05.870
so anyways, we're going to pause here for a little bit of advertising.

461
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.720
Bill flooring, come back with a Monday morning podcast.

462
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.180
Okay. And we're back. Um,

463
00:27:15.181 --> 00:27:18.070
so I figured I'll take me a good fucking three minutes to read those cuts.

464
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:21.120
Maybe five minutes or whatever that means they can get to the, I can get to the,

465
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.790
uh, the questions right now. Can I, I think I can't,

466
00:27:23.791 --> 00:27:27.600
don't get too close to Mike. Bill Second. You fucking ask. Exhale.

467
00:27:27.601 --> 00:27:32.370
It all goes off the fucking rails. Um, alright.

468
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:36.590
Here we go. All right, advice first. You know,

469
00:27:36.591 --> 00:27:37.910
some kind of fucking Ireland,

470
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.460
some cutting island gave me shit about the ticket prices.

471
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.970
I think that's a little bit too much. I think you funny. It's like, Hey Douche,

472
00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:47.090
how about the fact I'm flying from the other side of the fucking world?

473
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.270
Almost onto your fucking doorstep. That's not enough for you.

474
00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:55.910
Who's going to pay for all that fuel? Um, all right, here we go. Advice for,

475
00:27:55.970 --> 00:28:00.510
for a daft Scotsman. Hey there, you're redheaded content.

476
00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:07.400
Ah, I cannot fucking wait to go back to Scotland,

477
00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.620
Ireland and all these fucking places,

478
00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:12.410
these miserable cons to some of the funniest people you ever going to meet.

479
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:17.390
Alright, he says, I'm 26 year old guy from near Glasgow, Scotland.

480
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:22.310
Um, for quite a while I was in a bit of a Rut,

481
00:28:22.311 --> 00:28:26.330
but eventually I managed to pick myself out of it and decided to do something

482
00:28:26.331 --> 00:28:27.560
that I've always wanted to do.

483
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:32.680
I took a big step and decided to buy a ticket to a festival in Chicago. I said,

484
00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.670
shit, I love Chicago. Said,

485
00:28:34.671 --> 00:28:38.990
I booked my flights and I'll be in the city for a week. That's tremendous.

486
00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:44.210
So basically my question is as I'll be traveling alone and we'll be staying

487
00:28:44.211 --> 00:28:45.020
alone,

488
00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:50.020
how easy is it to just hang around and strike up conversations with complete

489
00:28:50.031 --> 00:28:51.620
strangers in a different country?

490
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:56.330
Have you ever found difficulties in finding common ground in conversation with

491
00:28:56.331 --> 00:28:58.370
people from different countries? Also,

492
00:28:58.371 --> 00:29:03.371
any full pause I should avoid when talking to Americans so I can prevent getting

493
00:29:03.381 --> 00:29:07.040
my cunt kicked in. All the best you fat shaming, Prick.

494
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.210
Um, all right. It's a lot of questions there. Um,

495
00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:16.610
well the only time I ever traveled is when I, I'm doing stand up.

496
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.180
And then after the show there's always people that just saw you do a show.

497
00:29:20.181 --> 00:29:25.010
So I've already broken the ice. But um, first things first,

498
00:29:25.011 --> 00:29:29.420
why don't I tell you a couple of places to go to from my little fucking places

499
00:29:29.421 --> 00:29:34.100
to go, thing that I have in my fucking phone that my wife used to make fun of.

500
00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:38.120
She made fun of places to go and she was laughing and then, you know what?

501
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:43.060
We went to one of those fucking places and then all of a sudden, you know,

502
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.780
she's just, she has total faith in it. Now she tells me to hit it. All right,

503
00:29:46.781 --> 00:29:48.790
here's what I would go. All right.

504
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:54.420
If you like a nice fucking a great fucking bar for music and that type of thing,

505
00:29:54.581 --> 00:29:59.530
I'd go to the Liar's club. Um, if you like cigars is a place,

506
00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:03.220
big cigar in pouring them, check that fucking place out.

507
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:07.570
And then as far as food and all that shit, I would just tweet about it because,

508
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:12.160
uh, I'm not a big fan of, of, of deep dish pizza, you know what I mean?

509
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.390
I just don't understand it.

510
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:17.740
I don't understand deep dish patient pizza the way I don't understand why white

511
00:30:17.741 --> 00:30:22.000
coffee and tea have to be so fucking hot. You know what I mean?

512
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:28.150
I what? So it gets the fucking, the teabag all in the water maybe.

513
00:30:28.151 --> 00:30:30.400
Is that what the fuck it is? I just don't understand.

514
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:34.480
But you have to wait like an hour before you can drink it without scalding your

515
00:30:34.481 --> 00:30:38.380
fucking mouth. And when it comes to deep dish pizza, it's, it's just,

516
00:30:38.381 --> 00:30:41.960
it's just too fucking much, you know,

517
00:30:41.961 --> 00:30:45.380
and you can't just get a slice of it that they bring the fucking thing over.

518
00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:49.430
It's, it's like, hey, you want some lasagna? Yeah,

519
00:30:49.431 --> 00:30:53.560
but not a whole fucking tray, you know? Um,

520
00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:54.980
but you should definitely try it.

521
00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:58.610
If you get one that actually has a really good crust, it is pretty amazing.

522
00:30:58.611 --> 00:30:59.810
But it's just like, I mean,

523
00:30:59.811 --> 00:31:04.760
you can literally split one piece with somebody else. It's so fucking big. And,

524
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:08.060
uh, my wife said the funniest shit about it. She called it an abomination.

525
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.120
She goes, it's the ultimate expression of American gluttony. She goes,

526
00:31:14.121 --> 00:31:18.020
go to Italy, you won't see anything, anything over there like it.

527
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:23.450
And it's true. We went to Italy, you know, they have like,

528
00:31:23.451 --> 00:31:26.900
we have all our American versions of their dishes, you know what I mean?

529
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:31.160
But there's no deep dip. The deep dish pizza in Italy,

530
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:35.150
at least not in any place we went to in. That's the only place I've been to.

531
00:31:35.151 --> 00:31:38.540
But you don't see it a, that's what she said. And she goes, you know why?

532
00:31:38.541 --> 00:31:42.670
Because it's an abomination. Um, so anyways, uh,

533
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.710
as far as I found in that, that Liars Club, uh,

534
00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:48.230
people were fucking cool as hell. If you're into the music and shit,

535
00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:49.550
it's a good time. But Dude,

536
00:31:49.551 --> 00:31:51.980
you're going to be coming over with your fucking accent.

537
00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.840
I wouldn't go to the fucking, you know, I, you know,

538
00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.260
depends on what you're into. I would go to a, uh,

539
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.550
a place where it's going to be a bunch of beautiful women.

540
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.840
That's what I would do. And then you go over there and you just fucking just,

541
00:32:05.841 --> 00:32:09.410
just start talking and I think you'll be in the fucking game and they'll be,

542
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.990
who'd you come over here with? I came over by myself.

543
00:32:11.991 --> 00:32:15.020
I want to always wanted to come to Chicago. And just literally,

544
00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:19.490
you know how HR watch, he goes, what are you fucking Berge do?

545
00:32:19.491 --> 00:32:21.680
Whatever the flower of the fuck you guys talk. Right?

546
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:26.170
Who the fuck you fuck do over here for fun?

547
00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:30.070
You're scared wherein could write whatever the fuck you going to say and they're

548
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.610
going to love it. They're going to love it. Even if you ask him, Hey,

549
00:32:33.611 --> 00:32:37.720
for fucking Shag, any however the fuck you say fucking in your country,

550
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:41.030
it's going to seem so cool to them. It's so different.

551
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:44.940
And then also they're going to be more adventurous because you know, you're,

552
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.550
the story's leaving with you when you go back, when you fly back to Scotland.

553
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:54.060
Um, how can you avoid getting your head kicked in? Um,

554
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.950
don't do what everybody else from other countries do is you come here and you

555
00:32:57.951 --> 00:33:02.840
criticize the United States and talk about how dumb we are,

556
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:07.910
how fat we are, how awful the foreign policy is, how uh,

557
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.820
our football players are pussies cause they wear pads.

558
00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:14.660
Why do you call it football? All of that dumb shit. You know what I mean?

559
00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:18.600
It's so fucking obnoxious. You know?

560
00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.610
You know why it's obnoxious because they have those kinds of people always come

561
00:33:22.611 --> 00:33:26.640
here and they act like these. They're these worldly traveled people, you know,

562
00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:30.020
oh I come from here and I come from there and we can do this and we can do that.

563
00:33:30.021 --> 00:33:32.960
And it's just like, well, in all of that fucking travel,

564
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:36.410
you never learned to be on your best behavior when he'd come to somebody's

565
00:33:36.411 --> 00:33:38.120
country and you don't come in and insulted.

566
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:42.470
So you make your whole country look like a bunch of fucking snobby cunts.

567
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.660
You never learned that one. I am always,

568
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:48.080
I'm on my best fucking behavior when I go to a different country.

569
00:33:48.081 --> 00:33:49.910
I'm not saying I'll go out and get fucking hammered,

570
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.330
but like I don't go there and shit on it, you know?

571
00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.840
Yeah. Some of these places I go to, I'm fucking talking to people.

572
00:33:57.841 --> 00:34:00.690
I know this place is nice. They always like, why the fuck did you come here?

573
00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:07.470
Well, I was like, I was in Oslo, Norway. I said, you know,

574
00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:10.650
you guys will thanks a lot. You guys were great.

575
00:34:10.651 --> 00:34:13.380
I'll definitely be back if somebody yelled out. Why?

576
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.470
It just struggles. Like why? What do you mean? Why? Why the fuck wouldn't I,

577
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:24.900
it's fucking beautiful. I don't know. Anyway, so I would avoid doing that.

578
00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.470
Um, and then just everything else is common sense. You know, somebody's,

579
00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:33.120
you know, looking like a psycho. Just fucking leave him alone.

580
00:34:33.121 --> 00:34:36.120
But I don't know, Dude. I, I mean I judge a lot of Scotland on that movie.

581
00:34:36.121 --> 00:34:38.170
Trainspotting or I just feel like it,

582
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.610
I don't go into any bars where there's an upper deck to it cause I just feel

583
00:34:41.611 --> 00:34:44.910
like there's going to be that guy up there that's going to finish his fucking

584
00:34:44.911 --> 00:34:49.830
pint and just throw the glass over his head, cut open some woman's face.

585
00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:53.280
Like I just, you know, if it's even remotely like that over there,

586
00:34:53.281 --> 00:34:55.650
I think you're going to be fine in Chicago. Um,

587
00:34:55.680 --> 00:35:00.210
I would definitely try to go to a cubs game. Uh, no offense to white sox fans,

588
00:35:00.211 --> 00:35:03.810
but you guys all know that you fucking stadium stinks. You know, it stinks.

589
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.030
It's the only time I ever saw a stadium,

590
00:35:06.031 --> 00:35:09.120
a new stadium built and they admitted so quickly like, wow,

591
00:35:09.121 --> 00:35:12.540
we really fucked this up. Let's try it. And like, it was like a batch nose job.

592
00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:17.460
You know what I mean? Like your stadium is the fucking stadium version of like,

593
00:35:17.461 --> 00:35:19.440
you know, when some Hollywood chick or somebody,

594
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.040
they get too much work done on their face and people, oh my God, what happened?

595
00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.380
That's what you did with that stadium. They're like,

596
00:35:25.381 --> 00:35:29.020
oh well let's wait til it settles. Let's see what happens. You know,

597
00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.940
so they go, but dude, you picked a great fucking city to go to.

598
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:35.790
Chicago is the shit. And then you picked a great time of the year to go there.

599
00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.840
Um, I will tell the traffic is fucking horrific, so just get ready for that.

600
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:44.400
But once you're in it, it's fucking phenomenal. Um, all right.

601
00:35:44.401 --> 00:35:46.830
What did we go here? All right. Uh, dear Billy,

602
00:35:46.831 --> 00:35:50.430
stretchy pants on your podcast sometime back,

603
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:55.290
you were talking about someone getting with someone else and one of the people

604
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:58.860
gaining a bunch of weight. Oh yeah. When you start dating somebody,

605
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.760
how it's not fair to the other person for you to then put on a bunch of fucking

606
00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:07.650
weight. Um, unless you're a woman, you having a baby that's obviously, you know,

607
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.530
I'm not a fucking animal here but I'm just saying, you know,

608
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:13.950
after you have the kid, you know, that's,

609
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:17.760
that's when you know after your wife has a kid, two things should happen.

610
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.450
This is what you do.

611
00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:22.140
You get a little bassinet for the beautiful baby and then the second thing you

612
00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:25.890
do is you get an elliptical for you wife.

613
00:36:25.891 --> 00:36:27.450
But so she doesn't get mad at you.

614
00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:32.370
What you do is you get our initials engraved on the side of it and plastic of

615
00:36:32.371 --> 00:36:35.640
course. Totally kidding. All right. Um,

616
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:41.430
I was already a few weeks into whipping myself back into shape. Um,

617
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:41.761
okay.

618
00:36:41.761 --> 00:36:43.950
Let me just start this over again cause I've even forgot what the fuck he's

619
00:36:43.951 --> 00:36:47.580
talking about on your podcast sometimes back you sometime back you were talking

620
00:36:47.581 --> 00:36:50.700
about someone getting with someone else and one of the people gaining a bunch of

621
00:36:50.701 --> 00:36:53.940
weight. I was already a few weeks into whipping myself back into shape,

622
00:36:53.941 --> 00:36:58.380
but this really helped me solidify my will. Well that's fucking great man.

623
00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:02.600
That's great. I wish she can you help me? Cause I, you know,

624
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.890
sitting in a fucking writer's room is like,

625
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.010
I eat there like the way I eat on the road. I mean, I,

626
00:37:08.011 --> 00:37:12.210
it's just fucking hard to try to eat healthy. It's just, you're just bored.

627
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.770
You're freaking out. You're locked in the fucking room and you're like, oh,

628
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:18.150
I'm gonna eat some fucking candy for no reason. I'm sitting there everyday like,

629
00:37:18.151 --> 00:37:21.390
it's Halloween and I'm fucking seven years old. I got to stop. All right.

630
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:26.040
It made me think that I should really give my lady the respect of maintaining

631
00:37:26.041 --> 00:37:30.960
something close to the body I had when she got on this train. Uh, she loves me.

632
00:37:30.961 --> 00:37:35.280
She stayed with me in spite of the lumpy beanbag chair. I have become.

633
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.210
I am now. I'm 15 pounds down with a bunch more to go,

634
00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.100
but I am back on my routine.

635
00:37:41.101 --> 00:37:44.190
Four or five trips to the gym at five 30 in the morning. Dude,

636
00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:48.390
you fucking killing it. That's great. And Calorie counting as well.

637
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:53.130
I know exactly what to do. It's just the time. Now my question is this,

638
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:58.080
how do you deal with it if your lady wants you to eat the same stuff she is or

639
00:37:58.081 --> 00:38:02.550
wants to go to a shitty fried food restaurant. Anyways,

640
00:38:02.551 --> 00:38:06.600
thanks man. Hope season two F of F is for family is coming along. Well it is.

641
00:38:06.601 --> 00:38:10.740
Thank you sir. Can't wait to see it. And I loved your last show in Austin.

642
00:38:10.741 --> 00:38:12.630
Hurry back and come during the football season.

643
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:16.620
We had a monster fucking recruiting class this year. Thanks your best. Oh,

644
00:38:16.621 --> 00:38:19.680
that's great man. You could learn horn should be good.

645
00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:25.410
So the legendary college program there. All right. Um, all right.

646
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.800
How do you deal with, I would just say I want just, that's easy as easy.

647
00:38:28.801 --> 00:38:30.600
Just sit down with her and just say, hey listen,

648
00:38:30.601 --> 00:38:33.960
you know when you got with me,

649
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:40.180
I was however years old and I w I weighed this much and I don't think it's fair

650
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:43.240
for me to have put on all this fucking weight, you know?

651
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.910
And they'd be looking like a lumpy beanbag chair like you said.

652
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:50.620
So I'm really trying to get myself back into shape. So I was wondering if,

653
00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:55.120
you know, you know, if you want to eat something that's a little unhealthy,

654
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:59.170
is there any way we just can go to a place that has healthy options for me?

655
00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.080
All right. Because a,

656
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:04.360
I don't want to look bad for you and I also don't want to die early.

657
00:39:04.361 --> 00:39:06.360
So you're fucking, you know,

658
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:11.500
in your forties and 50s having to put lipstick on and get the fuck back out

659
00:39:11.501 --> 00:39:14.260
there again and try to meet somebody who works down at Sears, you know?

660
00:39:14.261 --> 00:39:15.430
And I don't, I don't want to do that to you.

661
00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:18.730
I'd like to be here for the long haul, dude. There's no fucking way she,

662
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.300
she'll give you shit about that. That's a very easy thing to have happen,

663
00:39:22.301 --> 00:39:25.330
you know? And then also I think, sorry, I'm looking at the timer.

664
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:30.220
I also think that she would be happy to hear that you weren't just doing this

665
00:39:30.221 --> 00:39:33.760
for some vain reason yourself, that you were actually also doing it for her.

666
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:37.060
I think that that would be pretty cool. Now. Watch, now watch. She'll fucking

667
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.370
getting some big fucking fight, you know, or you think the thing I eat bad.

668
00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:47.620
You say I'm fat. You know she blows her sales manager.

669
00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:50.800
All right, read this. Okay. All right. I'm going to read this. Relax.

670
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:55.030
What's up dickhead? Let's go fucking Bruins. Can't wait for next season.

671
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:58.540
I just moved to wildly mediocre Los Angeles.

672
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.971
Uh, well yeah,

673
00:40:00.971 --> 00:40:04.580
that's what you're going to feel like cause you just fucking moved there. Um,

674
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:06.730
but if you stay open minded,

675
00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:10.150
which is really difficult for east coast people to do.

676
00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.220
I did that the first time I came to la.

677
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:16.450
I went to La and I tried to do Boston New York Shit. And then when I couldn't,

678
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.410
I was like, dude, this place fucking sucks. It doesn't, it's fucking amazing.

679
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:21.581
Beautiful women.

680
00:40:21.581 --> 00:40:25.210
Some of the best food you ever gonna have so much outdoor activity.

681
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:28.810
Just fucking embrace it. Stop trying to be the fucking Boston guy.

682
00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:32.230
You're not on a reality show. All right. Take it down a few fucking notches.

683
00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.380
Nobody gives a fuck in Los Angeles that you don't like it.

684
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:39.490
Everybody just thinks, well then go back to fucking Boston. Go back to Philly.

685
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.100
Wherever the fuck you're from. If it's so fucking great.

686
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:45.220
Why did you accept the job out here? All right. Sorry.

687
00:40:45.221 --> 00:40:48.610
I'm just heading off at the past before you come. Another country. Shit.

688
00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:53.350
Nine fucking la. And he said I worked for the UFC editing fight highlights.

689
00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:58.720
Uh, thanks for keeping me entertained with your semi-literate bib babble.

690
00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.380
Bullshit day after day. This is like a classic East Coast Guy.

691
00:41:02.381 --> 00:41:04.570
He really likes me and likes what I, what I do,

692
00:41:04.571 --> 00:41:07.540
but he just can't get himself to say it cause his dad never hugged him.

693
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:10.130
So I'm not taking any of this personally anyway.

694
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:13.330
My girlfriend is about to move here to meet me.

695
00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:17.230
She had to stay behind when I move because she's a teacher and needed to finish

696
00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.690
up the school year. Uh, we get along great.

697
00:41:19.691 --> 00:41:22.420
I trust her and she treats me better than I deserve. However,

698
00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:25.840
sometimes I can't take how ditzy she can be. Oh,

699
00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:30.250
I'm starting to pull some threads here. She is successful and very book smart,

700
00:41:30.251 --> 00:41:32.260
but sometimes lacks common sense.

701
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:37.460
I find feeling embarrassed when she says some stupid shit in front of my friends

702
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:41.420
or parents. It's kind of a hard thing to discuss with her though. You know,

703
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.880
what should, what the fuck should I do? Also,

704
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.580
I'm coming to your show with the same in theater this Monday.

705
00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:48.920
I'm looking forward to it, so don't blow it. Well,

706
00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:52.130
I appreciate you coming out to that. Like I said, it was, you know,

707
00:41:52.131 --> 00:41:54.800
for a really good friend of mine and for a great cause. Uh,

708
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.990
so thank you for doing that. All right,

709
00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:00.200
well here's the deal dude.

710
00:42:00.201 --> 00:42:05.201
You either have to accept the fact that she can be a little ditsy or you have to

711
00:42:05.841 --> 00:42:09.800
come to the realization that you're dating a fucking dope and you've got to get

712
00:42:09.801 --> 00:42:13.340
rid of her. It's one of the other, um,

713
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.810
I mean, look, she doesn't sound like she's 100% that I've,

714
00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.910
I've dated people like that that were a little, you know,

715
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.360
they were either locked in or just sort of floating.

716
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:27.950
It was really weird and they could say really like amazing,

717
00:42:27.951 --> 00:42:30.110
like spot on shit.

718
00:42:30.111 --> 00:42:32.960
And then two minutes later could just could say something like, oh my God,

719
00:42:32.961 --> 00:42:35.150
what the fuck was that? Um,

720
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:39.530
but I have to tell you that's kind of a, that's kind of a big deal. They'll do,

721
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.240
you know, you can't think that the person you're dating is a dope, you know,

722
00:42:44.241 --> 00:42:48.080
you get into that situation and uh, I dunno,

723
00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:51.080
you start thinking about getting married, you start thinking about having kids.

724
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:51.381
You're like,

725
00:42:51.381 --> 00:42:55.730
is my kid going to be half a dope or a full on dope is used as a kid going to

726
00:42:55.731 --> 00:42:59.790
get all of that DNA from her over the fuck knows. Um,

727
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.410
all right. It's kind of a hard thing to discuss with her, you know,

728
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.250
what are you going to say to what, can you stop saying dumb shit? I mean this,

729
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.200
there's no way to do that, you know, I'm trying to think.

730
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.760
That's like my wife telling me that to, to work on my team. I mean,

731
00:43:13.761 --> 00:43:17.060
I do work on my temper, but I mean, it's Kinda how I made up.

732
00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.590
I mean, if somebody did see that fucking ditzy,

733
00:43:20.591 --> 00:43:23.260
that'd be like my wife telling me, okay, can you be a little less pasty?

734
00:43:23.261 --> 00:43:26.140
It's like I can, I can become red for a few days

735
00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:30.010
as well. That's about the best I could do.

736
00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:34.100
I don't know what else you want from me, but uh, you know, I think you, uh,

737
00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.420
need to maybe move on. I'm not saying you need to move on it. Yeah.

738
00:43:37.421 --> 00:43:41.880
You either accept this about her or IGA. You got to walk one of the Yoga.

739
00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:44.230
Um, all right. Here's another one.

740
00:43:44.231 --> 00:43:48.640
Jesus Christ can't come and I don't mean to the wedding.

741
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:53.890
Um, how's it going, Billy? Butterballs uh, if you're reading this on Monday,

742
00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.800
it's fucking sick. June 20th

743
00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:03.130
will is my 21st birthday. Oh, Jesus. I don't know what's going on here.

744
00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.500
Great gift hearing you read this. Uh,

745
00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:09.010
well you're not going to hear it until the fucking Monday anyways. All right.

746
00:44:09.011 --> 00:44:10.360
I'm mailing, I'm mailing.

747
00:44:10.361 --> 00:44:14.410
I'm emailing today though is I was with this girl last summer,

748
00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:16.780
some good sex, no big deal,

749
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:20.410
but we didn't have anything going on during the year when we were at college.

750
00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:25.000
Well, we're back at it this summer, but the thing is I can't come.

751
00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:31.050
I mean I'm doing good. Pretty good. A PPM pumps per,

752
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:35.130
but I just can't finish now. I know you're not a doctor,

753
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.850
so not going to ask you why, but how should I go about this?

754
00:44:38.851 --> 00:44:43.740
I think she's getting self conscious, but she's a hard eight and I'm a soft six.

755
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:46.470
She's hot. It's not her fault.

756
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:51.390
Daddy can finish Dedi can't finish when the pressure's on.

757
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.810
How should I be playing this? I can only laugh it off for so long.

758
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:59.250
I'll try not jerking off to maybe that'll help. Any advice?

759
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.750
Thanks for the read, man.

760
00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:04.020
I'll feel I'll be able to come check you out when you come back. East Coast.

761
00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:07.950
Maybe Baltimore on Sunday. Go socks. Go Fuck Yourself. Uh, yeah.

762
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:12.120
I don't rub one out. If you're watching too much porn, maybe that's a problem.

763
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:16.410
Or maybe you know, you don't want to be in a relationship with her.

764
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.910
And that's the weird way your body's reacting, like you're wasting time. Um,

765
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.520
so we're not going to fucking, I don't know,

766
00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.410
there's a bazillion psychological reasons, but yeah, I, yeah,

767
00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:30.940
just don't rub one out for awhile. You know, this is another thing too.

768
00:45:30.941 --> 00:45:34.840
Women have fucking, they're very forgiving people. If I would,

769
00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.320
I wouldn't laugh it off. I would talk to you about it and just say, listen,

770
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:42.310
obviously this is happening. It's bothering me. Um,

771
00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.880
I'm feeling pressure about it and I'm also feeling like in a roundabout,

772
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:50.230
I just don't want you to be taking my issue on like, is something you are doing?

773
00:45:50.231 --> 00:45:53.260
You're not doing anything wrong. There's something going on with me.

774
00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:56.410
And then she'll be like, well, maybe you should go talk to somebody about it.

775
00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:58.390
And because you're a fucking red sox fan,

776
00:45:58.391 --> 00:46:01.750
I'm assuming you're from the Boston area, you don't want to go to therapy.

777
00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:03.520
And even if you do go to therapy,

778
00:46:03.521 --> 00:46:06.400
it's not going to help because you probably have enough Irish blood in you.

779
00:46:06.401 --> 00:46:07.360
And they always said,

780
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:12.630
who is that fucking psychologist that said the Irish are like immune to therapy.

781
00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:17.020
Um, I don't know if you liked this girl,

782
00:46:17.021 --> 00:46:18.900
I would definitely talk to her about it. But, uh,

783
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:21.160
there's no reason to put any pressure on yourself. You know what I mean?

784
00:46:21.161 --> 00:46:24.930
Just don't rub one out. Don't watch any porn. Just a, you know,

785
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.890
I don't know. Just let it back up.

786
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:34.440
I don't fucking know. I'm not a doctor. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ started.

787
00:46:34.441 --> 00:46:39.000
Here we go. Here we go. Wind it down. Wind it down. All right, heroin. Um,

788
00:46:39.001 --> 00:46:42.720
I have no family, no friends. I work in support myself. I have no kids,

789
00:46:42.721 --> 00:46:46.830
no relationship. I actually enjoy freedom and being alone to an extent.

790
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:48.270
I'm in my twenties.

791
00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.620
I had a lot of sex relationships and ended up getting a herpes. Slash. HPV.

792
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:57.510
I would basically rather just not tell people and not have relationships than to

793
00:46:57.511 --> 00:47:01.320
have, than to have to at 35 years old. Uh,

794
00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:06.060
didn't have to at 35 years old deal with having to explain slash tell this to

795
00:47:06.061 --> 00:47:10.950
women. I really like heroin. A what the fuck? Jesus Christ buddy. What are you,

796
00:47:10.951 --> 00:47:14.850
what are we doing? Here it is. This doesn't sound real. I really like heroin.

797
00:47:14.851 --> 00:47:19.350
I go to work, come home and use heroin on a daily basis. I still pay my bills.

798
00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:20.190
I still work,

799
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:24.870
but I have traded the pleasure of sex slash having a family slash relationships

800
00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:29.350
for that, of watching TV shows slash movies while high on heroin,

801
00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:33.340
falling asleep, then going to work the next day. Should I change this?

802
00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:35.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

803
00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:39.740
<v 1>Is this re I, I'll try it. You know what, I'll, I'll treat it as real. Um,</v>

804
00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.050
should I listen to society, stop using,

805
00:47:42.051 --> 00:47:45.290
go out there and find women and tell them about my situation and hope they do

806
00:47:45.291 --> 00:47:49.460
not reject me and get clean or if I am happy,

807
00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:54.020
is it okay for me to just accept the women part of my life is over,

808
00:47:54.021 --> 00:47:55.040
eat whatever I want,

809
00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.430
use whatever drug I want and fill the time I have left on this planet.

810
00:47:58.431 --> 00:48:00.980
Watching shows, movies, playing games,

811
00:48:00.981 --> 00:48:04.940
and resigning myself to the fact that I will be alone. Love the podcast.

812
00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:08.150
Heroin gets a bad rap. It may sound crazy,

813
00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:12.890
but people can use opiates and still be responsible. I know many people who do,

814
00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:16.820
it's like alcohol. Both can be physically. This is really fascinating.

815
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:22.600
Um, uh, or maybe it's a big lie. I Dunno. It's alcohol. Uh,

816
00:48:22.601 --> 00:48:25.160
it's like alcohol. Both can be physically addictive.

817
00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:29.090
Alcohol can actually kill you with withdrawals.

818
00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.380
Why heroin cannot.

819
00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:35.300
And the deaths you hear about heroin are from idiots overdosing.

820
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:39.350
Um, if we, well, what if you get a bad batch? Isn't that something? You know,

821
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:44.510
it's too fucking strong. Um, I dunno. I don't pretend to know. All right.

822
00:48:44.511 --> 00:48:49.370
If we reported all the deaths from alcohol involved incidents, they're easily,

823
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:52.220
well, they do report all of them. As far as I know.

824
00:48:52.221 --> 00:48:53.720
It's like they're trying to hide them. Um,

825
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:56.960
they are easily 100 times more than heroin related deaths,

826
00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.640
but in our society right now,

827
00:48:58.641 --> 00:49:02.150
opiates are not acceptable because too many white middle class parents are

828
00:49:02.151 --> 00:49:06.950
finding their idiot kids using them without understanding tolerance slash

829
00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:08.630
<v 0>okay.</v>

830
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:11.840
<v 1>Ah, proper dosing anyways, love the podcast.</v>

831
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:16.250
I'm not leaving any contact info, so I have no way to know if you read this,

832
00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:18.800
just thought it might be an interesting subject for your show.

833
00:49:18.801 --> 00:49:22.160
It is interesting. Um, yeah, dude,

834
00:49:22.161 --> 00:49:26.660
I don't pretend to know anything about opiates. All I do know is that the, um,

835
00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.680
I know alcohol can ruin your life,

836
00:49:30.681 --> 00:49:34.460
but I don't think it's nearly as addicting as heroin.

837
00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.620
I've heard that people can fucking,

838
00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:38.403
<v 0>okay.</v>

839
00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:41.610
<v 1>I don't know, but I think, I think if what you're saying is true,</v>

840
00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:46.500
I think you are a rare person that can handle that. I have no idea. Ah, fuck.

841
00:49:46.501 --> 00:49:47.610
Now I've got to look some shit up.

842
00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.190
The last thing I wanted to do and I got to get going here.

843
00:49:50.191 --> 00:49:53.850
I got my fucking show here and a half hour. Um, oh,

844
00:49:53.851 --> 00:49:57.300
the live reads are here. The live reads are here.

845
00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:00.900
I guess I'll read them here then. Let me just see something. Um,

846
00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:03.300
let me just look up. What do I look up

847
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:10.110
productive while on heroin,

848
00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:18.700
heroin and employment. Independent drug morrow. Let's see.

849
00:50:18.701 --> 00:50:23.180
Productivity and heroin addiction. What is this?

850
00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:26.960
How heroin addicts in Vietnam. What is this

851
00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:30.380
productivity and heroin addiction?

852
00:50:30.381 --> 00:50:32.960
How living in a cave turned me into a blogger.

853
00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:34.510
<v 0>Okay,</v>

854
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:37.060
<v 1>I failed my new year's resolution. I wish I could do better.</v>

855
00:50:37.061 --> 00:50:40.630
I just don't have enough willpower. Have you ever set a goal you didn't achieve,

856
00:50:40.631 --> 00:50:42.760
ever tried a new year's resolution that didn't stick?

857
00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:47.170
What separates the 0.5% from the 99 and a half percent? What makes someone,

858
00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:50.350
some people succeed in building new sustainable habits,

859
00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:52.120
but almost everyone else fails.

860
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:53.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

861
00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:55.850
<v 1>I'm living in a cave term. Where the fuck's the heroin shit.</v>

862
00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:02.650
How heroin addicts in Vietnam and your productivity habits are the same.

863
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.830
What everyone knows the horrible effects of heroin addiction.

864
00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:11.580
Once someone starts taking herring, it's almost impossible to quit.

865
00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:14.790
And those who form a recurring habit will likely never quit.

866
00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:19.620
So why didn't heroin using Vietnam vets relapsed when they returned to the USA.

867
00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.530
A study from the Washington School Medical School of Medicine,

868
00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:26.370
very few heroin use in Vietnam, uh, veteran relapses.

869
00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:28.900
Uh,

870
00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:33.580
what very few heroin using veteran relapsed or relapsed when they returned the

871
00:51:33.581 --> 00:51:34.414
USA.

872
00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:38.620
And those who did were more likely to have been illicit drug users before ever

873
00:51:38.621 --> 00:51:42.100
arriving in Vietnam. These vets weren't addicted to the chemicals and heroin.

874
00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:43.870
They were addicted to the experience of how,

875
00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:47.740
or an in a specific situational context. In the same vein,

876
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:51.430
you think you are in control of what you do. You think that when you fail,

877
00:51:51.431 --> 00:51:52.960
it's a failure of your willpower,

878
00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:56.500
but the fact is you don't even realize the influence of the environment has on

879
00:51:56.501 --> 00:52:00.040
you. Did you know that obesity spreads through a network of friends?

880
00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:02.590
Happiness also spreads throughout a social network.

881
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.730
You situation determines should choices as much as or more than your own

882
00:52:06.731 --> 00:52:08.410
personal choices. When willpower.

883
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:09.610
<v 0>Okay,</v>

884
00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:12.490
<v 1>so how can I use this to improve my habit? Oh, it's Jesus Christ.</v>

885
00:52:12.491 --> 00:52:15.670
Don't join a Wally ball league. I don't even know what the fuck that was.

886
00:52:15.671 --> 00:52:16.880
All right, let me, let me look up. Ah,

887
00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.600
let me just read these fucking things here. Um, you know what?

888
00:52:19.601 --> 00:52:22.120
I might read up on that. I probably won't. I'll try to,

889
00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:28.320
I would never tell people to fucking, you know, age, just heroin. You know,

890
00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:33.240
that seems a little crazy to me. Um, and people always come in and alcohol.

891
00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.690
It's like the fucking pot smokers always doing that shit. Well,

892
00:52:35.810 --> 00:52:39.600
the alcohol actually, man, there's no medicinal purposes to fucking, I get it.

893
00:52:39.601 --> 00:52:42.090
I get it. But you know, you guys are also,

894
00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:46.840
you know your pie in the sky fucking thing with weed. Like it's like this.

895
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:50.340
They keep, can't get addicted to weed is another fucking thing. Jesus Christ.

896
00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:54.420
Okay. Yeah. You just really like it. That's all you know. All right.

897

You're unique. Oh, this is helix. Helux you're unique.

they customize each side of the mattress. Your mattress arrives.

910
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.050
I just pictured somebody have in one like the husband,

911
00:53:43.051 --> 00:53:46.620
so he could bang a woman while his wife's sleeping and she would know, you know,

912
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:48.270
rather than than doing the red wine test.

913
00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:52.590
But one guy jumps up and down while the red wine just sits there. Um, you know,

914
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:54.540
what about mattresses for those people?

915
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:58.660
Helix customers report a 30% improvement in overall sleep quality.

916
00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:01.920
And for cuffs cuff couples, they customize each side of the mattress.

917
00:54:01.921 --> 00:54:05.490
Your mattress arrives at your door in about a week and shipping is 100% free.

918
00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:09.780
That's why everyone from GQ magazine to Forbes are all talking about helix

but do to to Mandy's beyond the zest cause you got a flat ass.

926
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:42.720
But when you put me on these around your flat ass,

927

they cop you fucking balls and you take to get some me undies.

Everybody needs them. Muslims, Christians and Jews. Oh yeah. All right. Mandy's,

929
00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:55.380

you spend almost 24 hours a day in your underwear.

931
00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:01.200
But instead of making a statement like Superman's tight under tights,

932
00:55:01.201 --> 00:55:02.370

00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:18.150
Nothing can describe the fit and feel of me undies. But once you try them on,

937
00:55:18.151 --> 00:55:19.830
your balls will never go back.
