00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.220
I've got this instruction booklet,
but that will give me step by step

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.590
instructions on how to
build this LEGO model.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.530
You know that it's organized, right?

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.970
When you flip through it, you can see
that each step is arranged in order and

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.610
there are page numbers to
help you find your place.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.550
All of the instructions
take a common form,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.240
which means that you can easily
jump to any page in the booklet and

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.010
figure out exactly what the LEGO
designers want you to build.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.680
This organization is helpful,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.710
it allows you to spend your energy
decipher in exactly what you want to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.770
build rather than just simply
trying to read the booklet.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.360
Frameworks are similar, they help us
manage all of the coding complexity

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.180
by giving us places and
patterns for writing it.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.590
Some frameworks have their own set of
conventions on how to name files.,where

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.200
to put them and how to get them
interacting with each other.
