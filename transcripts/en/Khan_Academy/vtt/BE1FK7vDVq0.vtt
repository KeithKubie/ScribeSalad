00:00:00.586 --> 00:00:02.535
- So we've depicted here the area under

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:05.591
the curve F of X above the X-axis,

00:00:05.591 --> 00:00:09.393
between the points X
equals A and X equals B.

00:00:09.393 --> 00:00:10.997
And we've denote it as the definite

00:00:10.997 --> 00:00:14.765
integral from A to B of F of X, DX.

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:16.474
Now what I wanna do with
this video is introduce

00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:21.042
a third value, C, that
is in between A and B.

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:24.140
And it could be equal to A
or it could be equal to B.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.459
So let me just introduce
it, right, just like that.

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:32.042
And I could write that A
is less than or equal to C,

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:34.364
which is less than or equal to B.

00:00:34.364 --> 00:00:37.301
And what I wanna think
about is, how does this

00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:39.970
definite integral relate to
the definite integral from

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.739
A to C and the definite
integral from C to B.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.496
So let's think through that.

00:00:44.496 --> 00:00:49.496
So we have the definite
integral from A to C of F of X.

00:00:50.944 --> 00:00:53.535
Actually I've already used
that purple color for the

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:55.921
function itself, so we use green.

00:00:55.921 --> 00:01:00.921
So we have the integral
from A to C of F of X, DX,

00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:05.927
and that of course is
going to, that's going to

00:01:05.942 --> 00:01:09.976
represent this area right
over here, from A to C under

00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:14.463
the curve F of X, above
the X-axis, so that's that.

00:01:14.463 --> 00:01:17.865
And then we can have the integral from

00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:22.865
C to B of F of X, DX,
and that of course is

00:01:24.223 --> 00:01:28.143
going to represent this
area right over here.

00:01:28.143 --> 00:01:30.420
Well the one thing that
probably jumps out at you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.028
is that the entire area from
A to B, this entire area

00:01:34.028 --> 00:01:37.423
is just a sum of these two smaller areas.

00:01:37.423 --> 00:01:41.909
So this is just equal to
that plus that over there.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.197
And once again, you might say,

00:01:43.197 --> 00:01:45.547
"Why is this integration property useful?"

00:01:45.547 --> 00:01:49.455
That if I found a C that is in
this interval that's greater

00:01:49.455 --> 00:01:52.882
than or equal to A and it's
less than or equal to B, "Why

00:01:52.882 --> 00:01:56.723
"is it useful to be able to
break up the integral this way?"

00:01:56.723 --> 00:01:58.679
Well as you'll see this is
really useful, it can be

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.086
very useful when you're
doing disc, when you're

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:03.684
looking at functions that
have discontinuities,

00:02:03.684 --> 00:02:05.451
if they have step
functions you can break up

00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:07.789
the larger integral
into smaller integrals.

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.097
You'll also see that this
is useful when we prove

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:12.152
the fundamental theorem of Calculus.

00:02:12.152 --> 00:02:13.148
So in general, this is actually a

00:02:13.148 --> 00:02:14.854
very, very, very useful technique.

00:02:14.854 --> 00:02:17.983
Let me actually draw an
integral where it might be

00:02:17.983 --> 00:02:22.299
very useful to utilize that property.

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.299
So if this is A, this is B,
and let's say the function,

00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:31.348
I'm just gonna make it
constant over an interval.

00:02:31.348 --> 00:02:34.209
So it's constant from there
to there, and then it's,

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.287
and then it drops down
from there to there.

00:02:36.287 --> 00:02:38.792
Let's say the function looked like this.

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:42.143
Well you could say that the
larger integral, which would be

00:02:42.143 --> 00:02:44.692
the area under the curve,
it would be all of this.

00:02:44.692 --> 00:02:45.876
Let's just say it's a gap right

00:02:45.876 --> 00:02:48.269
there or it jumps down there.

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.165
So this entire area you
can break up into two,

00:02:52.165 --> 00:02:55.580
you can break up into two smaller areas.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.836
So you could break that up into that area

00:02:58.098 --> 00:03:01.340
right over there, and then this area right

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.433
over here using this integral property.
