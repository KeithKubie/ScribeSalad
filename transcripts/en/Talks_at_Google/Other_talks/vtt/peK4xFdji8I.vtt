CAROLINE O'CONNOR: Hi there.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.430
I am Caroline O'Connor,
and I met Jake and John

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.810
a couple of years ago when I
was a designer in residence

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:09.867
at Google Ventures.

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:11.950
I was coming over from the
Stanford Design School,

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.800
where I was a faculty
member, and I had a chance

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.716
to see the sprint process
that these guys were

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:19.270
running with startups up close,
and I was really blown away.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.087
It was a process that we
were teaching at Stanford,

00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:23.670
but I will say these
guys were getting

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.800
amazing results with what
they had honed and refined.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.260
And so I'm really, really
excited to introduce them today

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.810
to talk about the book
"Sprint" that they've written,

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.840
which really lays out
a blueprint for running

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.430
these kinds of sprints for
your teams and how it's useful

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.392
and how it can help
in the bigger picture.

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:40.357
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:40.357 --> 00:00:41.690
JAKE KNAPP: Thank you, Caroline.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.100
Thanks, you guys.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.540
So before we have a
little discussion,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.500
I wanted to talk to you
guys about where the sprint

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.880
process came from and tell
you a little story about it.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.850
So it all begins back
in the year 2003,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.460
and it was that year that
my first son was born.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.960
And that's a picture of him.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.082
And I have to tell you
that when my son was born,

00:01:05.082 --> 00:01:06.540
I kind of freaked
out a little bit,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.490
because I had this
realization that he

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.560
was going to be growing up.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.910
He was going to be a baby and
then a toddler and then a kid,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.632
and this whole sort of life
was going to be going on.

00:01:17.632 --> 00:01:19.090
And when I went
back to the office,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.710
I realized every day
I'm at the office,

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.960
I'm kind of like missing that.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.620
I'm missing out on
a piece of his life.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.760
And so what I do at the
office should really matter.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.850
I should be making the most
of those hours and days

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.148
that I spend away.

00:01:33.148 --> 00:01:34.522
And so I thought,
well, I'm going

00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:35.920
to take a look at
what I'm doing.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.440
And so I thought
about my work week,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.730
and I looked at my
weekly schedule.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.410
And it looks kind of like this.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.267
It was meetings.

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:44.850
People would schedule
me for meetings.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.520
I'd say yes.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.145
I'd schedule other
people for meetings.

00:01:47.145 --> 00:01:48.030
They'd say yes.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.430
And if I ever wanted to
get anything important

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.180
accomplished, I
had to kind of wind

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.720
my way through this like
obstacle course of meetings.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.090
And I realized I
wasn't really doing

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.360
sort of the best use
of my time by winding

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.790
through those meetings and
checking email and just

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.990
kind of churning a lot of the
time, so what I decided to do

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.000
is get productive.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.330
And I read every book I
could find on the topic.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.000
I read "The Four-Hour Work
Week" and "Getting Things Done"

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.170
and "Brain Rules,"
and I experimented

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.752
with different kinds
of to-do lists,

00:02:19.752 --> 00:02:22.330
like five over the
course of a couple years.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.450
Pretty crazy.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.510
And over time, I
did get productive.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.030
In those little windows when
I had a gap between meetings,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.950
I would make the most
use of it possible.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.110
And a few years later, 2007, I
was at Microsoft in those days,

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.240
and I left and came to Google.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.350
And when I came to
Google, I thought, man, I

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.510
can't wait to see what the days
are going to be like at Google,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.380
because Google is this
like crazy new place.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.810
What's it going to be like?

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.110
And it turns out, as
you guys might know,

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.190
it's kind of the same.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.570
There are a lot of meetings.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.057
But I had honed these
sort of productive skills

00:02:58.057 --> 00:02:59.640
for those gaps between
meetings, and I

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.800
knew how to get things
done, and I also

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.460
found that at Google,
there was a real spirit

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.700
of experimentation, and there
was a spirit of experimentation

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.600
in the products but also
in the way people worked

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.680
and the way teams worked.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.054
People were willing
to experiment

00:03:16.054 --> 00:03:20.980
with how they conducted
their execution on things,

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.690
and I've started to do a
new kind of a quest to make

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.389
the team process better.

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.430
And I imagined, what if
I could just sort of wipe

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.140
the week clean, wipe
the calendar free

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.310
of all those meetings,
and start from scratch?

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.450
And so I started doing
day-long workshops

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.090
with teams and then a couple
of day-long workshops,

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.220
and eventually ended up
with this week-long process

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.980
that I call a sprint.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.070
And that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.430
And I took this
sprint process in 2012

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.890
to Google Ventures,
which is now called GV,

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.060
because since the
alphabet thing,

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.430
we've lost all of our letters.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.492
So we're just GV,
and at GV we have

00:04:00.492 --> 00:04:02.200
this interesting
challenge, because we're

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.880
investing in
startups, and we want

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.570
them to be as
successful as possible.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.209
If you run a startup, you've
got all kinds of ideas,

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.000
but it's hard, because
you don't know which

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.420
ideas you should focus on.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.680
It's hard to know.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.532
Some of these might be big hits.

00:04:17.532 --> 00:04:18.990
They might make
you a lot of money.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.610
They might be really successful.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.730
But a lot of them are worth
pennies on the dollar,

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.822
and some of them are
downright dangerous.

00:04:25.822 --> 00:04:27.030
But up front, you don't know.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.654
They're just a bunch
of question marks.

00:04:28.654 --> 00:04:30.090
They're just a bunch of ideas.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.970
And so this idea in startup
land, in Silicon Valley,

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.990
but really around
the world has caught

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.870
on that you should take an
idea, make your best hunch,

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.890
and just get data about
it as fast as you can.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.510
The trouble is that getting data
requires you to usually build

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.910
something and launch it.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.432
And as most folks who have
gone through this cycle know,

00:04:53.432 --> 00:04:55.410
building almost always
takes longer than you

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.120
think it's going to take.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.040
And so that knowledge
that the build process

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.645
will probably take-- if we
think it's going to take weeks,

00:05:02.645 --> 00:05:04.186
it'll probably take
months, and if we

00:05:04.186 --> 00:05:05.644
think it's going
to take months, it

00:05:05.644 --> 00:05:07.430
might take years--
tends to make us

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.760
more cautious about
the ideas that we try.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.430
And we argue more about
which hunch we should follow.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.770
So the sprint gives
you a chance in a week

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.290
to collect data
quickly, and we found

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.060
that that was a really valuable
technique for our startups.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.030
They could try riskier ideas
and try them a lot faster.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.990
So that's what I'll tell
you guys about today.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.300
And the process is
broken down day by day

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.459
into five big steps with a
lot of little steps inside.

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:38.500
And rather than just tell
you about how it works,

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.960
I'm going to tell you a story.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.650
We've done over 100 of these
with the different startups

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.287
in the GV portfolio,
and many of them

00:05:45.287 --> 00:05:46.870
are ones that you
might have heard of,

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.480
but I'm going to tell you
a story today about one

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.563
you may not have heard of.

00:05:49.563 --> 00:05:52.060
It's a company called
Savioke, and Savioke,

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.250
when it was first-- well, this
is their mission statement,

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.510
but when it was first described
to me by my colleague, John,

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.920
who you'll meet
in just a moment,

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.420
he was like, these
guys make robots.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.700
And we've totally got
to try to find a way

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.790
to work with these guys.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.164
And luckily as it
turns out, they

00:06:06.164 --> 00:06:08.070
had a really pressing
question that they

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.970
wanted answered right away.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.644
And so it was a perfect
time to do a sprint.

00:06:12.644 --> 00:06:14.060
So this is the
founder of Savioke,

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.980
this guy named Steve Cousins,
and Steve is a robotics expert.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.190
He worked at a place called
Willow Garage for years

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.440
and years, and he
left Willow Garage

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.020
with the idea of building
robots for the service industry,

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.980
robots that would be helping us
in our sort of everyday lives.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.960
He wanted to take robots out of
this kind of abstracted world

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.490
of these really high
tech expensive robots

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.850
and make ones that we'd
would have in everyday life.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.900
So he built this team of
roboticists, engineers,

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.180
designers, and they decided
to build their first robot

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.110
for hotels, which might seem
like kind of a funny choice,

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.240
but if you think about
working at a hotel front desk,

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.786
your day might look
something like this.

00:06:56.786 --> 00:06:59.410
This is a diagram that
I just sort of made up,

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.430
but I think it's
probably fairly accurate,

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.730
because if you imagine the
morning times when people are

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.907
checking out and unpacking,
moving around, the evenings

00:07:07.907 --> 00:07:09.990
with people checking in,
there's a lot of activity

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.960
during those windows at the
front desk with people who

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.710
are there physically,
and then also people

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.800
are calling from the rooms
and asking for room service,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.250
asking for a toothbrush,
a towel, some extra thing.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.894
And so it's really hard
to staff those bikes.

00:07:23.894 --> 00:07:26.420
So Savioke thought, If
we built a robot that

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.920
could make some of
those deliveries,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.960
we could let the folks
at the front desk

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.930
stay there, be focused there,
do a really good job there,

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.850
and then we could also make
sure that people in the rooms

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.000
got stuff they needed.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.040
So for the first five
months of their existence,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.290
Savioke builds these
progressively more

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.800
sophisticated
prototypes until they've

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.630
created this thing, which
is called the Relay robot.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.420
The Relay is a robot about
the size of a trash can.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.810
It is self-driving, so it
can sort of autonomously

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.270
navigate the hallways.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.620
It's got a little hatch on
the top with a locker in it,

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.410
so at the front desk, you could
put in a towel or a toothbrush

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.360
or whatever, close it up,
type in the room number,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.780
and then the robot would drive.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.820
You can call the elevator,
ride the elevator,

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.130
and make the delivery
right at the room door.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.420
So all that was great,
and they had worked out

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.470
this pilot program with the
Aloft Hotel in Cupertino.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.595
And they were going to take
their first-- they just

00:08:21.595 --> 00:08:22.800
had one robot that
worked, and they

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.216
were going to take that one
robot and put it into service,

00:08:25.216 --> 00:08:26.840
and for a fledgling
startup, this

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.000
is like a great opportunity,
but also a really big risk.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.179
They wanted to make
sure they got it right.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.409
And it was going to start making
deliveries in just a few weeks.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:39.210
But they still had one really
big question left unanswered.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:43.090
They weren't sure exactly
how the robot should behave.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:47.350
It's a really good question,
because if you guys think

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.800
about, say, Isaac Asimov--
I don't know if anyone here

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.700
is familiar, if there's
any science fiction

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.116
nerds in the audience, but
I'll confess to being a science

00:08:54.116 --> 00:08:54.727
fiction nerd.

00:08:54.727 --> 00:08:56.310
There's this really
sophisticated idea

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.160
about how robots
should behave, and it's

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.710
deeply ingrained
into the science

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:04.410
fiction that has come ever
since Asimov wrote these down.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.500
But as Steve told
us, look, this robot

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.350
is not that sophisticated.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.320
It's not going to be
thinking about much.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.080
It's just going to
be delivering things,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.810
and it can't have a
conversation with you.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:20.510
He said, we've really been
spoiled by Wally and by C-3PO,

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.580
and we think that robots have
sort of thoughts and plans

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.480
and hopes and dreams,
and the reality

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.180
is that this robot
won't be able to have

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.521
any kind of a
dialogue with people,

00:09:31.521 --> 00:09:33.520
and they were really
concerned that people might

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.590
get frustrated or
disappointed if they

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.240
tried to interact
with the robot,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.950
ask the robot to do
something, tell it something,

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.610
and got no response.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.300
So in order to play it safe
with this launch coming up,

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.420
the safest thing to
do is just make sure

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.020
that the engineering worked
well-- they had done that--

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.750
and not give it a
personality, not

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.399
do anything that might ruin
all that other hard work.

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:56.190
But they still kind of
wondered, because it

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.280
seemed like this
interesting opportunity,

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.863
and they had a bunch of ideas,
but they didn't have a good way

00:10:00.863 --> 00:10:01.960
to test them.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.600
So we did a sprint
together with them.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.300
We got to be there in the room
while these guys hashed this

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.390
out over the course of a week,
and what happened is on Monday,

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:13.400
they brought the robot into our
building here in Mountain View,

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.980
so we could do the sprint there.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.060
They rolled it in.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.060
Here, it's covered
up in a sheet as

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.520
though a ghost might be less
conspicuous on the Google

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.820
campus than a robot.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.924
And brought it in, and as you
can see here, it kind of looked

00:10:25.924 --> 00:10:28.090
like a printer when they
first took the blanket off,

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:29.950
and we were like,
well, OK, you know.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.920
But then we saw
it driving around,

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.530
and there's something kind
of amazing that happens,

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:39.042
because this thing can-- it sees
you, and it kind of cautiously

00:10:39.042 --> 00:10:39.750
moves around you.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.590
And they had really engineered
that motion exquisitely.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.560
It seemed very dog-like almost,
and so we fell in love with it.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.300
And this is possibly the
first robot selfie ever taken.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.157
But we just thought
like, this robot is-- OK,

00:10:53.157 --> 00:10:54.240
let's try the personality.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.500
We got excited.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.620
So on Monday, the first job
in the sprint of the team

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.170
is to share all the
information that they've got

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.310
and make a map.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.850
And then on that map,
pick the best spot

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.530
to focus for the sprint.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.240
So we decided that
the moment of delivery

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.140
was both the biggest risk
and the biggest opportunity

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.320
for personality, because
up to that moment,

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.340
it's possible that you
never saw the robot.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.190
You didn't even know
that the robot existed.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.060
You asked for something to be
delivered, and lo and behold,

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.050
you open your door.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.160
You're wearing god knows
what, and there's a robot

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.590
at the door of your hotel room.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.050
So what we did then on
Tuesday was to come up

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.350
with a bunch of solutions.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.670
How might the personality work?

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:38.270
And when we do this, instead
of having a big group

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.990
brainstorm where everyone's
shouting out ideas,

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.390
we instead have everybody
sketch on their own.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.720
And I mean everybody,
so in this instance,

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.410
it's not a bunch
of just designers

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:49.850
or product folks working on it.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.740
It's everybody on
the team, and when

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.397
I say we're working
quietly, it looks like this.

00:11:55.397 --> 00:11:56.230
It's kind of boring.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.272
Everybody is in great detail
sketching out their solutions.

00:12:00.272 --> 00:12:01.730
So then by Wednesday,
we've got all

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.990
these different competing ways
for how the robot might behave,

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.760
and we decide from
all of this-- I

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.510
think we had 10, 15
different approaches--

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:11.100
to focus on three big ideas.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.850
So first, we've got giving the
robot a face, which obviously

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.330
carries some risk, because it's
going to promise personality.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.640
We thought about a lot of
different kinds of faces,

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.280
and we ended up going with
this kind of sleepy robot

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.730
that sort of matched that
dog-like impression we got

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.830
from the way the robot
moved, and we thought

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.790
might suggest that you
can't really talk to me.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.300
I'm nice, but you can't
really talk to me.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.960
We wondered if people would like
to play games with the robot,

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.820
and we have this idea
of the robot doing

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:40.150
sort of a happy dance after
the delivery was completed.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.422
So on Thursday, we had
to build a prototype,

00:12:42.422 --> 00:12:43.880
and we'd spent the
first three days

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.810
kind of getting all
these ideas on the table,

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.607
making all the choices, and now
we had to build a prototype.

00:12:49.607 --> 00:12:51.940
And we think it's really
important that the prototype be

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.230
realistic so that when
we test it with customers

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.310
on Friday-- that's
how the sprint ends--

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.640
we'll be able to
trust their reactions.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.110
So we put together
sound effects,

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.970
sort of a sound effect library,
and we divided up the work.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.660
So here's somebody from Savioke
working on that sound effect

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.520
library.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.230
Here's the face,
designing the face,

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:12.370
and then just putting it
on an iPad Mini on Keynote,

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.360
and we replaced the panel
on the front of the robot

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.030
with an iPad
temporarily, because it

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.450
would look realistic.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.400
And finally, the
robot choreography.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.810
So normally, the robot is
running completely on its own.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.970
It's all done with sensors.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.670
It's all programmed out,
but as you can see here,

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.610
Tessa's got a remote control
like a PlayStation remote.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.610
And temporarily, we could do
sort of a Wizard of Oz thing

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.250
with the choreography.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.640
It only needed to work
for five deliveries for us

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.471
to be able to get
some data on it.

00:13:43.471 --> 00:13:44.470
So finally, it's Friday.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.400
It's time for the test.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.920
We're going to find
out what happens

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.670
when you expose this robot
personality to people.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.150
And what we did, and
what we always do

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.090
is to do these
one-on-one interviews.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:56.700
So in this case, our
partner, Michael Margolis,

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.960
came down to do the
tests, and here's

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.970
a photo of him in
front of the hotel.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.870
And he comes in at 7:00
in the morning and starts

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.900
sort of rigging the
room up for the test.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.397
So he's got a suitcase,
and inside a suitcase,

00:14:10.397 --> 00:14:11.730
he's just got all kinds of gear.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:12.600
He's got computers.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.580
He's got tripods.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.687
He's got duct tape.

00:14:15.687 --> 00:14:17.770
I don't know how he gets
through airport security,

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:19.580
but he does consistently.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.710
And with the help
of the Savioke team,

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.540
they're making sort of
a makeshift research

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:25.830
lab out of the hotel room.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.889
So they're wiring
up these drop cams

00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:30.180
so that we'll be able to see
as the robot kind of moves

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.600
into position.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.240
And then at 9:00 AM, it's
time for the first test,

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.309
the first one-on-one interview.

00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:38.100
So I want you just for
a moment to imagine,

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.580
put yourself in the shoes
of this first customer who

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.630
shows up, and
earlier in the week,

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.360
you responded to
an ad on Craigslist

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.240
for a usability interview.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.970
You've filled out this
survey, and you get this email

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:54.930
from Michael, and
it says, hey, this

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:56.680
is going to be in a
hotel room, and you're

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.080
like-- this is like
Wednesday to you.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.440
You're like, OK, I
guess I'll check it out.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.049
And then on Friday, like
actually, you're like, oh, god,

00:15:05.049 --> 00:15:06.090
kind of cursing yourself.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.340
You're there in the lobby,
and Michael shows up,

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.647
and he's like, OK,
so come with me.

00:15:10.647 --> 00:15:12.230
We're going to go
up to my hotel room,

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.729
and you're in the hotel room,
and there's all these cameras,

00:15:14.729 --> 00:15:17.340
and you're just like-- you're
probably a little weirded out.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.690
But I mean this just
goes to show that even

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.570
under the most potentially
awkward of circumstances,

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.434
you actually can get good
honest reactions from customers,

00:15:27.434 --> 00:15:29.850
because what Michael does is
he puts the customer at ease.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.580
So he's wearing his work
badge in the hotel, which

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.290
doesn't totally make
sense, but it does show

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.600
that he is who he says he was.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.260
He's got a clipboard.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.350
His body language is
even very careful,

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.490
and he's asking questions
of the customer.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.900
He's saying, tell me
about your hotel routines

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.110
when you check in.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.000
Where would you
set your suitcase?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.449
And if you found that you had
forgotten your toothbrush, what

00:15:52.449 --> 00:15:52.990
would you do?

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.990
And they say, well, I guess
I'd call the front desk

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.870
and ask where to get one.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.300
And he says, OK, I want
you to go ahead and call

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:57.925
the front desk.

00:15:57.925 --> 00:15:58.890
Here's the number.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:01.560
So this first person,
she calls the front desk,

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.310
and this is actually the phone
number of Allison from Savioke,

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:07.060
who says, oh, sure, I'll
send a toothbrush right up.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:10.236
So meanwhile we're back
watching over video,

00:16:10.236 --> 00:16:11.610
and we can see on
all these, it's

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.984
kind of like this
like FBI setup.

00:16:12.984 --> 00:16:14.190
He's got all these cameras.

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.970
And we know that the robot
is coming into positions

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.272
from inside the room
she doesn't know.

00:16:19.272 --> 00:16:20.730
And the robot drives
into position.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.470
She opens the door, and
we can watch the reaction

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:24.490
to the personality.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.750
We can watch her take
the toothbrush and see,

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.660
does she talk to it?

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.601
What happens?

00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:31.100
And so we get to watch this
five times throughout the course

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.599
of Friday.

00:16:31.599 --> 00:16:34.930
We get to see five totally
cold reactions to this robot,

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.370
and we see what happens.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.910
And it turns out that
five is enough to give you

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:42.430
these big patterns of things
working and not working.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.180
So it turns out
that nobody wanted

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.194
to play games with
the robot, which

00:16:47.194 --> 00:16:49.860
is good, because that would have
been a lot of engineering work.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.280
We were able to sort of
cut that right off the bat.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.390
But the face worked.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.960
No one also had any
inclination to have

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.090
a conversation with the
robot, to ask the robot

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:01.270
to do something verbally.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.570
That didn't happen.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.800
So the face was a big success.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.900
And the dance even worked.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.923
They even found the dance, which
when described in the abstract,

00:17:08.923 --> 00:17:10.339
didn't sound that
great, honestly,

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.930
but it was quite
delightful in real life.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.470
This is a little video of what
the robot looks like now out

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.780
in the wild, and
Savioke launched

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.040
with this sort of
robot personality,

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.920
and they now have more
orders than they can fulfill.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.050
And as you can see, it
has very simple eyes.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.590
The dance is really
just kind of rotating,

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:31.740
but it all gives this
kind of delightful feeling

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.386
to the robot.

00:17:32.386 --> 00:17:33.760
And it turned out
to be something

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.288
that guests absolutely loved.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.600
So the idea with the
sprint is, of course,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:47.720
to not make us be so cautious
about taking these big bets,

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.270
to not water down our
ideas or play it too safe.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.880
It might sound a
little bit corny.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.940
You can almost be
true to your vision,

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.170
because you know that
you're not betting

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.492
the whole farm on everything.

00:17:58.492 --> 00:17:59.950
At worst, you'll
embarrass yourself

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.090
in front of five customers,
which is nice to know.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.550
That's the idea behind the book.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.170
There are stories about Savioke
and many other companies

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.161
in there, and it's also
kind of a DIY guide.

00:18:09.161 --> 00:18:10.410
And yeah, let's talk about it.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.352
You guys want to come on up?

00:18:12.352 --> 00:18:14.310
CAROLINE O'CONNOR: So
tell us about why does GV

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.135
have a design team?

00:18:15.135 --> 00:18:17.510
Like what's the goal of having
a design team on a venture

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:18.650
capital?

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:22.260
JAKE KNAPP: We're trying to
slip by as long as possible.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:26.780
Well, the big idea with GV
is to invest in companies

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:27.822
that we're excited about.

00:18:27.822 --> 00:18:29.988
We're excited about the
businesses they're building.

00:18:29.988 --> 00:18:31.430
We're excited about
the technology

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.920
that they're building, and
we want them to succeed,

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.580
but we want them
to succeed in a way

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.060
where we make a return
on our investment.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:43.590
And so we actually see design
as kind of a strategic advantage

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:44.370
for us.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.536
So if you think about a
company that's starting out,

00:18:46.536 --> 00:18:49.340
and they're starting to get
some traction on their business,

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.381
they've got this really
big idea about where they

00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:53.820
can go with the technology.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.240
They've got to, in order
to get there, build

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.750
this kind of bridge
between their ideas

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.600
and the reality of the real
world, the reality of what

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.120
their customers will want
to use, be able to use,

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.980
fit into their lives, and
design, as we kind of saw

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.230
in this story, offers this way
to really quickly prototype

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:15.610
ideas, understand
how they'll actually

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.320
work in customers' hands.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.890
And we find that it's kind
of our secret advantage

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:25.360
over if those companies
were just sort

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.640
of doing things on their own.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.640
CAROLINE O'CONNOR: Yeah.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.030
So given you guys have
hundreds of companies

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:30.905
in the GV portfolio.

00:19:30.905 --> 00:19:31.920
JAKE KNAPP: Over 300.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.610
CAROLINE O'CONNOR: So I
imagine there's a ton of things

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.401
that you could do to
try and help them out.

00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:38.120
How did you come to sprints
as kind of the primary way

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.504
to help the portfolio?

00:19:39.504 --> 00:19:41.670
JOHN ZERATSKY: Well, we
kept investing in companies,

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.620
and we were like, oh, we can
help all these companies.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.660
It's not quite like
that, although it's not

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.720
that far from the truth.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:53.180
But I was at GV before Jake
joined us, and had a couple

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.530
people on the
design team, and we

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.660
had worked as
designers and writers

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.330
at other startups in
other parts of Google.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.990
And so we kind of
had this approach

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:03.739
where we would go from
company to company,

00:20:03.739 --> 00:20:05.720
and we were sort of the experts.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.960
Or they thought we were experts,
and we thought we were experts,

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.840
and we kind of felt this
pressure and this anxiety

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.460
of needing to have the answers,
to go into a company and say,

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.140
this is what we
think you should do.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.839
But it became clear that
given the breadth of companies

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:21.880
we were investing in and
the different challenges

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.440
that those companies faced,
that there was no way we

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.640
could have all the answers.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.250
Nobody could have
all the answers,

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:30.540
and so we began looking for,
instead of the answers, a way

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.000
to find the answers,
and that was

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.070
really where the sprint
process became, we thought,

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.880
really powerful.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.449
So we didn't have to say,
well, when I want YouTube,

00:20:40.449 --> 00:20:41.240
this is what I did.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.560
And maybe it'll work for you.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.184
We could say, hey,
let's work together,

00:20:44.184 --> 00:20:46.470
and let's figure out the
answer to this big question

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.235
that you're facing.

00:20:48.235 --> 00:20:49.360
CAROLINE O'CONNOR: Awesome.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.484
So you guys have had a
chance to apply this process

00:20:51.484 --> 00:20:53.800
with a lot of different
kinds of companies,

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.710
small startups, big
startups, but also you've

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:59.340
done a lot of work here at
Google, very big organization.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.520
What have you guys seen
in terms of pitfalls

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.460
that are maybe common
to teams or things that

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.394
can be blockers
for them generally,

00:21:07.394 --> 00:21:09.310
and how this solves it,
or what can block them

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.480
from doing a sprint well?

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.350
JAKE KNAPP: I think
one of the struggles

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:18.100
is having discussions
in the abstract.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.800
John calls this getting
stuck in abstractopia, where

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.050
you know when you're going
to have to build something

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.710
that it's a big decision.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:27.580
And so we debate.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.970
We wave our hands
in conference rooms

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:35.070
and try to anticipate how people
will react in the real world.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.060
And that's tough.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.700
That's an energy
drain, and it often

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.320
doesn't yield the
best decisions.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.050
So part of the
reason for the sprint

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.610
was to add a little
bit of structure

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.700
to those conversations
and to use

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.500
some of the things that actually
work really well in design.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.360
Design is a technique
and a set of skills

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.190
that can enable people to
make things real really fast.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.730
There's a whole idea
of critique and design.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:06.420
And design is usually thought
of as this kind of kooky,

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:09.120
creative art that people don't--
if they're not designers,

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.450
they kind of walk quickly past
the design room and think like,

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.530
it's like those guys are playing
D and D in there or something.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.960
But in the sprint, we've tried
to make those things very

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.190
practical, very accessible
to everyone on the team,

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.580
and then use them to
short circuit a lot

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.455
of those pitfalls.

00:22:25.455 --> 00:22:26.580
CAROLINE O'CONNOR: Awesome.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.820
And how do sprints fit
with what everybody thinks

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.820
of as like regular work?

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.195
Like the calendar
that you showed

00:22:32.195 --> 00:22:35.857
that we're all too familiar
with here at Google-- is it

00:22:35.857 --> 00:22:37.690
something teams should
be doing all the time

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.240
if they're working well, or
when do they bring this process

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.360
to bear?

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.818
JOHN ZERATSKY:
Yeah, a lot of times

00:22:42.818 --> 00:22:44.400
we think that that
sprints make sense

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.080
as sort of the kickoff or
kind of this initial burst

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.420
for a new project
or a new initiative.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:54.070
So if a company wants to
reach a new kind of customer,

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:56.920
or they want to introduce a
new feature, a new product,

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.330
sprints are a really good
way to sort of kick that off.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:02.160
But they're not meant
to be sort of the way

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.860
that you work all the time.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.710
At the same time,
there's a lot of ideas

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.880
that are part of the sprint
that we think are really

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.600
valuable to use sort
of in day-to-day work

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.810
and day-to-day life.

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.230
One of the examples is
sort of about the way

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:22.590
that time and activities are
so structured in the sprint.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.400
For example, I do
all of my meetings

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.790
on Thursdays and Fridays, so
a lot of the work that I do,

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.927
I'm writing, I'm designing, I
need uninterrupted work time.

00:23:31.927 --> 00:23:33.760
So I actually leave
Monday through Wednesday

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.030
open for those things, and
then Thursday and Friday

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.670
are the days for meetings,
so being very structured

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:43.729
in that Jake and I are very
sort of aggressive about--

00:23:43.729 --> 00:23:45.020
JAKE KNAPP: It's sort of weird.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.320
JOHN ZERATSKY: We're sort
of weird about limiting

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:51.600
distractions, so Jake
introduced me to this idea

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.440
that he came up with of the
distraction-free iPhone.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.520
So uninstalling Twitter and
removing your email account

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.050
from your phone, so you
can't check your email,

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.950
and even-- it sounds
nuts-- but even

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.760
like disabling Safari
in the restrictions

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.700
and the settings for the iPhone
so that you don't have access

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.170
to this sort of unlimited
pool of potentially very

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.930
interesting but ultimately
distracting information

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:19.370
that exists in the world.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.940
JAKE KNAPP: You
can see the picture

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.023
that's being painted here.

00:24:21.023 --> 00:24:23.531
Fundamentally, John and I
have very poor self-control,

00:24:23.531 --> 00:24:25.780
and if left to our own devices
in a typical work week,

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.480
we would be checking
Twitter and our email just

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.570
continually over and over again.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.180
And the sprints and then some
of these other kinds of methods

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.610
are ways for us
to put rails on it

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.410
so that it's easy to do
the right thing, the best

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:39.750
thing with our time.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:40.500
JOHN ZERATSKY: But
I think usually

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.030
what happens with
the teams that we

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.870
work with is that
they'll use sprints

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.760
as sort of the kickoff
for some new thing

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.050
that they're working on.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.910
And a lot of times they'll do
two or three sprints in a row,

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:53.290
so the first sprint is five days
the way that Jake described,

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.590
and the second sprint
is usually shorter.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.470
Usually the prototype
that you built and tested,

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.670
there may be some
problems with it,

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:01.750
some things you want to
fix, and then there's

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.416
some other things
that went really well,

00:25:03.416 --> 00:25:06.310
that worked out really well,
and so the team will then

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.690
do a shorter sprint where
they tweak that prototype

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.840
and test it again, and
then maybe the next week,

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.010
they do another
sprint, where instead

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.580
of tweaking that
existing prototype,

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.840
they create a different
kind of prototype, something

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.760
that they can test
with live traffic

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.205
or do a different sort of more
quantitative kind of test.

00:25:22.205 --> 00:25:23.480
CAROLINE O'CONNOR: Awesome.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.960
Can you talk a little
bit about user testing

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.616
as a forcing function for teams?

00:25:27.616 --> 00:25:28.990
You guys have that
set on Friday,

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.530
but talk a little
bit about how that

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.540
can help with the distractions.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.540
JOHN ZERATSKY: Well, the
sprint is actually just

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:38.120
an elaborate scheme to get more
companies to do user research.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.620
JAKE KNAPP: Well,
it's also-- I mean

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:44.470
it does get back to that idea
of me being a procrastinator.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.560
And I did have this
realization that when

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.652
I had a deadline, like
many, many procrastinators,

00:25:50.652 --> 00:25:53.110
I suddenly got really productive
right before the deadline.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:55.190
So if you decide you're
going to run a sprint,

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.030
and then on Monday
you say, these

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:58.530
are the customers
we're bringing in.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:25:59.613
You start recruiting them.

00:25:59.613 --> 00:26:03.000
You know that five strangers
are coming in on Friday,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.583
on Thursday, you'll
be like, you don't

00:26:04.583 --> 00:26:05.707
want to embarrass yourself.

00:26:05.707 --> 00:26:08.200
So you will get
really productive.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.620
And there's all
these good reasons

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.720
for bringing in customers.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.439
It makes you focus on those
customers in a very concrete

00:26:15.439 --> 00:26:17.230
way throughout the
week, so you're not just

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.938
waving your hands,
but you know these are

00:26:18.938 --> 00:26:20.500
the people who are coming in.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.460
And it also gives
you data right away.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.120
It's the very
fastest way that you

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.800
can get some data on a
complex idea like the ones

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.530
that we put into a prototype.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:34.720
But that forcing function is a
very real, very powerful part

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.749
of having people show up.

00:26:36.749 --> 00:26:38.290
JOHN ZERATSKY: Part
of our motivation

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:42.290
for sort of building the sprint
around customer interviews

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.200
specifically is
that the startups

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.620
that we work with and
imagine a lot of the teams

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:52.220
that you guys are on here,
your center of gravity

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.960
or your sweet spot is writing
code and shipping software.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.730
That's what we all
know how to do.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:59.960
And so there's a
tendency for that

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.570
to be the thing
you do when you're

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:03.959
trying to figure out something.

00:27:03.959 --> 00:27:06.000
And you see this in sort
of like the lean startup

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.040
and different approaches like
that like I'll create an MVP,

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.560
create some basic
version of the product

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.850
that you can get out
there and you can get data

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:17.770
as quickly as
possible, but we think

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.770
there's this amazing
shortcut, which is creating

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.430
this realistic prototype.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:23.300
And then instead of
having to launch it

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.120
and having to analyze the
data, just watching people

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.130
react to it.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.020
We think it's not a
replacement for sort

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.610
of quantitative
testing and launching

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.600
something in the
wild, but it gets

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.190
you a different kind of data.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:38.250
It gets you this really rich
qualitative understanding

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.850
of which things are
working and which aren't.

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.760
And the best thing is you can
do it in a few days instead

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.295
of weeks or months.

00:27:45.295 --> 00:27:47.670
JAKE KNAPP: You can try a
sprint once, do that experiment

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.745
with your team, try
working in a different way,

00:27:49.745 --> 00:27:51.120
and it all comes
with the sprint.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.020
And then you can
see how it works.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.910
CAROLINE O'CONNOR: So for
partners at a venture capital

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:00.370
firm, you guys have pretty
unusual backgrounds.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:03.100
No top hats or monocles
that I've ever seen.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.340
JAKE KNAPP: We left
it at the door.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.756
CAROLINE O'CONNOR:
Can you tell us

00:28:06.756 --> 00:28:09.620
a little bit about how you
came to be partners at GV?

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:13.470
JAKE KNAPP: Well, that's
a very long story, Carol,

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:14.889
but I'll begin at the beginning.

00:28:14.889 --> 00:28:16.680
I won't begin all the
way at the beginning,

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.540
but I studied art and
painting in college,

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:24.300
which was, generally speaking,
not helpful for any of the work

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.300
I did after that.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:31.096
But I've always been interested
in computers and making things,

00:28:31.096 --> 00:28:33.470
and when I was a kid, I would
make games on the computers

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:37.312
and test them on my
unwilling friends

00:28:37.312 --> 00:28:38.770
not knowing that
that was basically

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:41.720
what I'd end up doing sort of
forever, only not with games.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.450
But for me, the process
that led me to GV

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.260
was, ironically,
not about having

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.080
a ton of startup expertise.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.780
I've learned a
lot about startups

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:56.350
and built that by being at
GV, but actually just having

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:59.030
this sort of interest
in figuring out

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:02.830
how teams can use
design and how teams can

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.780
make better use of their time.

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.870
So it was the
opportunity at Google

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:10.810
to really test that out and
experiment over and over again

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.390
and make the process
better that gave me

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:15.000
the experience
that I needed to be

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.940
able to start doing that here.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.455
But you have another very
different road to GV.

00:29:20.455 --> 00:29:22.030
JOHN ZERATSKY: Yeah.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.360
I got my start in journalism.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.470
I was actually
introduced to design

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:30.920
by working at a newspaper,
and so I sort of accidentally

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.960
found my way into this
really interesting kind

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.620
of design work.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.840
So every day I would come in.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.881
It was a daily newspaper.

00:29:36.881 --> 00:29:39.030
I would come in, and
the editors would say,

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.570
OK, here are the stories that
we have for today's paper,

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.017
for tomorrow's paper, I guess.

00:29:43.017 --> 00:29:44.850
Here are the photos
that we have, and here's

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:45.640
sort of the priority.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.181
These are the most
important stories.

00:29:47.181 --> 00:29:48.620
These are the least important.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.160
And so I'd kind
of do this puzzle

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.510
of putting the paper
together and figuring out

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.620
how everything fit.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.220
And then it was a paper
that was distributed

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.770
on a college campus, the
University of Wisconsin.

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:02.620
So the paper would
be printed, and then

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.630
I would go to
class the next day,

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:08.030
and I would actually watch
people read the paper.

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:11.130
So I was like doing usability
testing without really knowing

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:17.540
it, and in a lot of ways, that
experience kind of crystallized

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:21.390
my approach to work-- trying
to get in a lot of reps,

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.650
trying to create environments
or seek out environments where

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:27.210
I could get in a lot of
these little loops of trying

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:29.890
something and then seeing
how it worked with customers,

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:32.530
and then fixing it and making
it better the next time around.

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:35.000
So after that, I worked
at a startup called

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.266
Feedburner as a designer.

00:30:36.266 --> 00:30:37.390
We were acquired by Google.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:39.870
Worked at Google in
Chicago, worked at YouTube

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:43.570
doing sort of product design,
UX design work all along,

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:46.610
and I was attracted
to GV for a lot

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:47.790
of the same reasons as Jake.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:52.650
I wanted this
opportunity to work

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:55.920
with so many companies working
on so many different things.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.710
I saw it as being sort of like
being at the newspaper again.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.700
I knew that I was going
to have these loops.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.200
I was going to have
this opportunity

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:08.480
to try things, make them
better, and try them again.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.930
CAROLINE O'CONNOR: Awesome.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.210
So the question is,
how do you make sure

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:16.530
that the small sample of
users that you're getting

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.320
relates to the larger
sample that you're

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.710
going to be working with?

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:21.626
JAKE KNAPP: Well, one
of the great things that

00:31:21.626 --> 00:31:24.140
happens in the course of setting
up the customer interviews

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.880
is early in the week,
you talk about all

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.080
of the different customer
types that you have.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.820
And you figure out, OK, we're
going to focus on this group,

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:37.810
and what happens when you make
that decision is you start

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.896
to get very real about
what defines that group,

00:31:39.896 --> 00:31:41.270
because if we want
people to come

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:45.130
in who look like that, who
use that kind of software,

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.750
have that kind of job, whatever
it is, then you realize, well,

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.124
in order to get
them, we're going

00:31:49.124 --> 00:31:53.420
to need to post an ad here or
contact our network of folks

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.980
here, and we're going to
need to screen people out.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.896
We're going to need to
recruit a lot of people

00:31:57.896 --> 00:32:00.350
and put together a survey,
where we ask them questions,

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.650
and we want the results of
those questions to tell us,

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:04.510
is this our customer or not?

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.850
And it's that survey,
that sort of screener

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:09.130
that we use that helps
us make sure we're

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:10.470
getting the right people.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.760
But that exercise,
having to do that

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.190
is something that we find many
teams at all kinds of companies

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:18.200
small and large defer.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.070
They talk in sort of broad brush
strokes about their customers,

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:24.380
but the sprint makes
you get very specific,

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.010
because you want to make sure
you get the right people in.

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:28.593
JOHN ZERATSKY: Yeah,
and that exercise

00:32:28.593 --> 00:32:30.880
on Monday of creating the
map is also really helpful,

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:36.580
because you avoid the temptation
to think in terms of personas

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.640
and what kind of person it
is, and you think more about

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.130
what situation is the person
in, and what are they doing?

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:45.340
What's the task they're
trying to complete?

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.180
And that's sort of that--
Jake showed that big map

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.610
and then zooming in on that
one point, so in that case,

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:54.090
it's a traveler who is
checking into a hotel

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.160
and realizes that they
forgot their toothbrush.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.550
So you can look for
people who would likely

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:00.660
be in that very
specific situation.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.659
JAKE KNAPP: To give you
a concrete example, when

00:33:02.659 --> 00:33:05.850
I worked with Slack, who's a
sort of messaging software,

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:09.090
they were interested
in finding better ways

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:11.460
to explain how Slack
works to companies

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.540
who aren't tech companies.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.040
Slack's grown tremendously
with tech companies,

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.810
and they're figuring
out how to explain it

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:19.690
to other kinds of teams.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:22.360
And so they knew that
they wanted to expand

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.780
to other kinds of teams.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.870
In the sprint, they had to get
really specific about which

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.270
kinds of teams, which
are the best example

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.340
of representative teams?

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.270
Is it a team who's in media?

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.580
Is it a team who's
in health care?

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.640
What should we look for?

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.340
What questions should
we put in the survey

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.504
to find those people?

00:33:40.504 --> 00:33:41.920
CAROLINE O'CONNOR:
So the question

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.349
is we have so much data.

00:33:44.349 --> 00:33:45.890
Do you want to be
looking at the data

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:48.070
that you've got and digging into
that before you do a sprint,

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.440
or do you do the sprint earlier?

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.860
How do you think about that?

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:51.568
JAKE KNAPP: Yeah.

00:33:51.568 --> 00:33:54.700
So there's maybe three
things I'll remind myself,

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.364
there's three things
I want to mention.

00:33:56.364 --> 00:33:57.780
The first one
actually is that you

00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.654
should be really careful
of three-day sprints

00:33:59.654 --> 00:34:02.830
or anything short of five,
because usually the first thing

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:05.740
people cut when they make
the sprint shorter is

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:09.260
that realistic
prototype and the test.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.094
So I do know there are some
folks who will compress all

00:34:12.094 --> 00:34:13.719
the steps into three
days, and then you

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:15.709
have to look out
for like dehydration

00:34:15.709 --> 00:34:17.750
of like passing out,
because it's pretty intense.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:21.632
But if you actually are
doing it at the normal pace,

00:34:21.632 --> 00:34:23.090
you just want to
be really sure you

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.881
build that realistic
prototype and test it.

00:34:24.881 --> 00:34:29.001
Otherwise, you might not know
if you have the right idea.

00:34:29.001 --> 00:34:30.750
JOHN ZERATSKY: Yeah,
you can cut out days,

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:32.329
but you can't cut out steps.

00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:33.620
Or you shouldn't cut out steps.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:34.699
JAKE KNAPP: Yeah.

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:36.980
That's a nice concise
way of putting it.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:40.360
But in terms of when
you have a lot of data,

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:44.110
knowing what to do
with it, I think

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:47.380
John and I both came from
working at Google where

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.342
there was tons of data.

00:34:48.342 --> 00:34:49.300
John worked on YouTube.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.924
I worked on Gmail,
and obviously, those

00:34:50.924 --> 00:34:52.670
are products where
you launch something,

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:55.690
and you get a lot of data
about what's going on.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:57.290
But even when you
have a ton of data,

00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:00.840
it can be very hard to know
why something is working or not

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.520
working.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.960
And so we certainly
have the experience

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.450
of working for a long
time on a new feature,

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:09.960
launching it, and seeing that
people were using it or not

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.510
using it, but not
knowing why still.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.980
And that's part of
the thing that you'll

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.150
get with the kind of
qualitative research

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.970
that you do in a sprint
when you're doing interviews

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:22.420
is that you'll know why.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.400
You'll be able to see
people actually doing it,

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.410
and you don't have to just
guess what the numbers mean.

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.880
In terms of when
to do the sprint,

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.070
I think what we really
look for is a big question.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:36.200
And so Savioke is honestly
among all of our sprints,

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.850
it's more unusual for us
to work with a startup

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.890
when they're so close to launch.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:44.710
It's not crazy or
unheard of, but it's

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.320
more common to do
it at the beginning

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.960
when you have that big question.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.410
You're starting off on
a totally new product

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:52.642
or a big new feature,
or maybe it's

00:35:52.642 --> 00:35:54.100
the start of a new
quarter, and you

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.840
know that you're going to be
putting a lot of effort in.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.970
You just want to check
where things are.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:02.120
But it's that feeling of, gosh,
we're making big decisions,

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.490
but we don't know for sure.

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:08.760
We're arguing or we're
scratching our heads.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.270
You can satisfy
that with a sprint.

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:13.520
JOHN ZERATSKY: Yeah, I would
say that to your question

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.180
about sort of bringing
data into the sprint

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:19.810
and how to incorporate
that, having a lot of data

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.820
to work with when the sprint
starts is actually a luxury.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:23.990
It's actually a great thing.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:26.430
And the sprints that I
can think back to that

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:29.750
were the most successful
started with a lot of data.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:32.120
Either we did a round
of customer interviews,

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.150
or we had a lot of
quantitative data

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:37.830
about how people were
using the product

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.110
or how effective
the marketing was.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:42.460
It does take some
work to distill that

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:46.110
and analyze it and present
it in a way that makes sense,

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.940
but that's always a challenge.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.590
So what we'll typically do is
we'll invite sort of someone

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:54.420
from a data team or a product
manager or, in our case,

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.670
a lot of times, it might
even be the CEO or something,

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.003
because we're working with
these really small companies.

00:36:59.003 --> 00:37:01.160
And they'll give us on that
first day of the sprint

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.460
a half an hour or an
hour sort of run-through

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.600
of who's overseeing.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:08.350
Here is maybe the conversion
funnel, or here are the usage

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:11.480
patterns in the product, and
this is what we know so far,

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.252
and this is what we're
trying to figure out.

00:37:14.252 --> 00:37:15.960
CAROLINE O'CONNOR: So
is five days really

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.790
the number for a sprint?

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:18.916
Could you do it in one day?

00:37:18.916 --> 00:37:21.456
And how do you think about sort
of cutting it down or playing

00:37:21.456 --> 00:37:22.140
with time?

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.056
JOHN ZERATSKY: Well,
we've experimented a lot,

00:37:24.056 --> 00:37:25.660
so that's kind of
the first thing

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.520
is we're pretty confident that
it's the right number of days.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:34.070
But I like your question about--
you asked, what is the essence?

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.800
Like if you were going to sort
of slim down the sprint, what

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.850
would be like the absolute
essentials to not get rid of?

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.722
And I want to hear
Jake's answer.

00:37:41.722 --> 00:37:43.350
JAKE KNAPP: Well,
you definitely don't

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.920
want to get rid of that
realistic prototype

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.750
and the test,
because what happens

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:50.400
at the end of the sprint
is you run that test,

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.820
and then you're seeing
how customers react,

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.870
and then that's surprising.

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:58.810
Ideas that seem so
brilliant on Wednesday

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:02.230
turned out to be duds, and
then something that maybe you

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:04.910
just took a risk on, and one
thing we didn't talk about so

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:07.780
much is that we'll sometimes
make two or three competing

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:11.050
prototypes and see how
they do head to head.

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:14.130
And maybe it's that riskier
idea that turns out to work,

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:17.650
but you don't know that until
you've shown it to customers.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:19.420
And the other
things you get when

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.690
you have a realistic
prototype is for the team,

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:23.836
it's this concrete--
it's like you fast

00:38:23.836 --> 00:38:24.960
forward it into the future.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.390
What if we were done
already with the product,

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:27.450
and it looked like this?

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:28.533
And that's really helpful.

00:38:28.533 --> 00:38:32.390
It's helpful for the team to
decide if the product seems

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:34.786
to fail with customers,
do we have belief

00:38:34.786 --> 00:38:36.910
that this artifact is
something we can make better?

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.760
And we're just going to
try to make it better

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.540
in another sprint,
or are we off track?

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.040
This wasn't as great
as we imagined.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.331
JOHN ZERATSKY: Yeah, I think
a lot of the short sprints

00:38:46.331 --> 00:38:48.160
that we've seen or
that we've heard about,

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.070
for whatever reason, they
tend to be oriented or sort

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:53.550
of weighted toward the
early parts of the sprint.

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.440
So they tend to be more
about coming up with ideas,

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.580
and I actually think
that coming up with ideas

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:00.980
is usually not the challenge.

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.450
People are constantly
thinking of ideas,

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:06.490
and in fact, we found that
the ideas that people come up

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:09.550
with in the sprint are often
not as good as the ideas

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:11.980
that people have
had kind of rattling

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.390
around their brains for
the last months or years.

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.480
And I think it's because
the ideas in the sprint

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.820
are sort of abstract,
they're unrefined,

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:24.140
and they're new, whereas
the existing ideas have

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.000
been through the
wringer, so to speak,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.830
of kind of thinking about
them, working on them,

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:29.539
considering them.

00:39:29.539 --> 00:39:31.080
JAKE KNAPP: Just to
be clear, we make

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:33.122
sure people put those old
ideas into [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:33.122 --> 00:39:34.080
JOHN ZERATSKY: Exactly.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:34.660
Yeah.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.035
JAKE KNAPP: They're
on the table.

00:39:36.035 --> 00:39:38.390
But I think then you can
take-- the essence of it

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:46.565
also is to-- we're sort of
geeky about human interactions.

00:39:46.565 --> 00:39:48.190
John and I are a
little-- I don't know.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:49.250
We're sort of pod people.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:54.020
But we think that if you
can put some structure

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:57.300
around the things that we often
do at work with no structure,

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.356
that it helps a
lot, and so there

00:39:59.356 --> 00:40:01.230
are a bunch of little
pieces in a sprint that

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:02.770
can be helpful at any time.

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.010
It can be really
helpful when you're

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:07.740
having and you're starting
to talk and have evolved

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:11.140
into a brainstorm in a meeting
to say, wait, hold on a second.

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.980
Let's all quietly
write down our ideas.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.790
All of a sudden, you give
the introvert or the person

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:17.540
who's not so good at
pitching their ideas,

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.870
you give them a chance to
have their idea be on a level

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:21.927
playing field with
everyone else's.

00:40:21.927 --> 00:40:24.260
Sometimes it's helpful to
just put the ideas on the wall

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:28.320
and vote, the kind of thing that
we do in a sprint all the time.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.600
It helps you shortcut
sometimes a discussion that

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.870
isn't necessary.

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:33.869
And the idea of
talking to customers--

00:40:33.869 --> 00:40:35.660
putting what you have
in front of customers

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:36.500
is something you can do.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.999
Even if you're not
running a sprint,

00:40:37.999 --> 00:40:40.320
you can test your product
and put it in front of people

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.874
and start to answer
those why questions.

00:40:42.874 --> 00:40:44.290
CAROLINE O'CONNOR:
So the question

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:47.070
is, how do you go from 17
ideas on paper to the few

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:50.095
that you're going to test, and
how teams navigate that well?

00:40:50.095 --> 00:40:51.720
JOHN ZERATSKY: That's
probably the most

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:57.651
like robotic, scripted
part of the whole sprint.

00:40:57.651 --> 00:40:59.817
And for good reason, because
it is very challenging.

00:41:02.581 --> 00:41:04.580
I guess we sort of talked
through the specifics,

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:06.580
but I'll lay out the
high level, which

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.610
is that we have a very
particular set of voting

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:13.090
exercises that we do starting
with what we call a heat

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:16.580
map, which is where everybody
just sort of looks at the ideas

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:20.210
and has these small
colored sticky dots.

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:23.180
They get effectively an
unlimited number of them,

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:25.600
so if they spend them all,
they can get more, and just

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.860
put a dot on anything
that seems interesting.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:34.290
Then we do what we
call a straw poll

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:37.420
sort of round of voting,
where people get larger dots,

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.780
and they get a limited number.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.780
But it's non-binding,
so you're sort

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:43.480
of going around the room
looking at the ideas

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.170
and voting on the ones
that seem most promising.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.610
And then we do a
really fast critique,

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:51.720
so the group together talks
about which ideas they thought

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:55.340
were the best and which ones
maybe are problematic or not as

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.280
interesting.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.070
And then one of the more
sort of unusual steps

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:02.550
is that we then rely on the
decision-maker in the sprint

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:04.090
to actually make the final call.

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:07.000
So the leader, the
executive, the CEO,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.690
whoever it is-- that person
gets to sort of absorb

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:12.210
all the work and all the ideas
and all the opinions that

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:14.230
have been shared in
the room, and make

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:16.800
the final call about
which prototype

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.384
or which prototypes
to build and test.

00:42:18.384 --> 00:42:19.841
JAKE KNAPP: One of
the ways that we

00:42:19.841 --> 00:42:22.430
think about this is if you
think about your phone.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:24.979
Like every morning, if you
charged your phone overnight,

00:42:24.979 --> 00:42:27.520
you wake up, the battery's full,
and then throughout the day,

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.382
you do stuff, and the
battery wears down,

00:42:30.382 --> 00:42:32.090
unless you have a
cooler phone than I do.

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:33.810
But that's what happens to me.

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:36.752
Our ability to make decisions
is kind of like that,

00:42:36.752 --> 00:42:37.960
so we wake up in the morning.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.030
We've got like a full battery
of decision-making ability,

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:42.630
and then as the
day goes on, if you

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:44.437
have a lot of intense
conversations,

00:42:44.437 --> 00:42:46.020
if they're 17 ideas,
and you're trying

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.950
to narrow them down to three
by like arguing the whole day

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:50.890
or like pitching one
versus the other,

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:53.223
like your battery is just
going to go [SHRINKING NOISE].

00:42:53.223 --> 00:42:54.649
And it's not going to work.

00:42:54.649 --> 00:42:56.940
And so in the structure that
John described, what we're

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.140
trying to do is make
those decisions as

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.320
effective as possible
so that every time you

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.930
burn a little battery,
you're making progress.

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:06.580
And to do that, we
cut out sales pitches.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:09.380
We make a lot of the
evaluation silent.

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.420
We make the sketches
anonymous, so you're not

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.130
evaluating who made it.

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:15.110
And then ultimately,
when it starts

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:17.080
to be the hardest
part of the decision,

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.300
we turn it over to that
one person who we know

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.670
will make an opinionated call.

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:22.510
So we don't have to
worry about group think.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:24.760
We don't have to worry about
watering down and getting

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.060
to a consensus.

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:28.130
We're just saying like,
OK, look, decider,

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:30.210
you make the call, and
then we'll find out.

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:32.694
Right away we'll get data,
so you can take a chance.

00:43:32.694 --> 00:43:34.110
CAROLINE O'CONNOR:
So the question

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:35.990
is, how do you modify
this for situations

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:39.655
where humans are not
that end consumer?

00:43:39.655 --> 00:43:42.220
JOHN ZERATSKY: Well, I think
that is a really interesting

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:45.302
question, and I don't think
we've done a sprint like that.

00:43:45.302 --> 00:43:46.760
JAKE KNAPP: I'll
give you an answer

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.690
that-- I'll start
with a bad answer

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:52.390
to that question, which
is that for most things--

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:55.420
and you may be talking
about an exception

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.960
to this-- for most things,
there is some point at which

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.586
the product does touch a human.

00:44:00.586 --> 00:44:01.710
And it might be downstream.

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:04.085
It might be that you're building
a back end service that,

00:44:04.085 --> 00:44:06.739
in turn, supplies something
to another service,

00:44:06.739 --> 00:44:08.780
and in turn, the place
where it touches the human

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:10.070
is somewhere downstream.

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.990
But fundamentally,
humans are the problem.

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:13.760
Whenever anything,
you make something,

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.270
and it doesn't work well,
or there's a problem,

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:20.480
or people don't like it,
it's that surface area

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.190
where the human touches it
that's usually the unknown.

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:25.730
And so we often
think, well, where

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:27.381
is that human touch point?

00:44:27.381 --> 00:44:27.880
What is it?

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.970
It might not be like
a software interface.

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:32.499
It might be a
sales conversation.

00:44:32.499 --> 00:44:34.040
You might be building
back end that's

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:37.210
going to supply functionality
with the expectation

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:39.330
that we'll be able to
sell this to a third party

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:42.190
or that it'll enable us to
do some new kind of query

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:44.190
that people will want,
searches that they'll

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:45.231
want to run or something.

00:44:45.231 --> 00:44:48.270
I'm just making this
up, but that idea often

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:50.640
helps us get to the root
of the question, which

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:51.990
is about what will people do?

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:54.300
People are the ones who
are hard to predict.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.800
Now if that doesn't
work, the answer

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.390
that's slightly better, but
I'm waving my hands a lot more,

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:03.280
is that you try to prototype
what you would be supplying

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.966
if all of the coding was done.

00:45:04.966 --> 00:45:07.590
And you say, during our day when
we're prototyping on Thursday,

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:09.560
we're going to be
faking that part.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.490
And then we're going to be
somehow manually supplying

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:17.971
that to whatever's on the other
side and seeing what comes out.

00:45:17.971 --> 00:45:19.970
I'm not a back end
developer, so you're probably

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:22.040
just laughing at me, but I
think that might be the idea.

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:22.230
OK

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:23.771
JOHN ZERATSKY: I
was going to suggest

00:45:23.771 --> 00:45:27.930
that she change the test to
try to come up with-- the test

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:30.150
that we do, our
customer interviews,

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:33.220
but there might be
some other kind of test

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.175
that you could think up.

00:45:35.175 --> 00:45:37.720
I'm also waving my
hands, but there

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.180
might be a different way
of sort of validating

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.982
whether an idea or an
approach is any good or not.

00:45:42.982 --> 00:45:44.440
JAKE KNAPP: A big
part of the magic

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.660
is that constraint
of five days, and we

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:49.130
know that the
steps in the sprint

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:52.220
will provide us rails
to evaluate ideas,

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:54.890
make decisions, and then
very quickly, try something,

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:57.750
and it might not be
right, but for me, there's

00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:59.170
so much frustration
when you spend

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:02.260
weeks or months doing
that sort of discussion

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.539
and trying to decide.

00:46:03.539 --> 00:46:05.830
And so yeah, it might be just
a different kind of test,

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:07.580
and you commit to
doing the sprint

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.860
to have something
at the end, so you

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.884
can see what it might be like.

00:46:11.884 --> 00:46:13.300
CAROLINE O'CONNOR:
I have one more

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.960
I wanted to throw at you guys.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.690
You talk a lot about the value
of having the whole team watch

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:20.290
the user testing and really
see it for themselves

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:21.790
and be connected to it.

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:24.510
I found that to be really
challenging at Google

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:27.030
given the calendar situation.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:28.730
And so then you end
up with challenges

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:31.974
to a data set of
[INAUDIBLE] of five,

00:46:31.974 --> 00:46:33.390
that that can't
possibly be valid,

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.430
and especially for folks who
haven't sort of seen the user

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.720
test.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.960
Do you guys run into that?

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.669
And if you do, how do
you deal with that?

00:46:38.669 --> 00:46:40.210
JAKE KNAPP: Well,
that idea of having

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:41.740
everyone watch is
really important,

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:43.448
and one of the reasons
why it's important

00:46:43.448 --> 00:46:46.240
is that if everybody
can't watch together,

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.090
then it often falls on
one person's shoulders

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:51.570
to conduct the interviews
and then communicate

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:54.152
what he or she saw in those
interviews to everyone else.

00:46:54.152 --> 00:46:56.610
JOHN ZERATSKY: And that person
has to be really convincing.

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:57.318
JAKE KNAPP: Yeah.

00:46:57.318 --> 00:46:59.550
Yeah, incredible, and
it's a lot of work,

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:03.570
and there's a time delay to
put that information together.

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:05.750
So if you get
everybody in the room

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:07.930
together on a
Friday watching it,

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:12.330
this magical thing happens where
there is no argument about what

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:14.390
people saw, and there's
also-- we've never

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:17.040
had a sprint where after
watching five interviews,

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:21.320
people, no matter how much
hard core data nerds they were,

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.690
didn't say like, oh, yeah.

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:25.080
It's clear what the
big findings were,

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.080
what the big patterns were,
because by that fifth person,

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.540
you're just starting
to see the same things,

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.330
things that you saw
earlier happen again.

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:33.444
There's nothing new.

00:47:33.444 --> 00:47:35.360
And I don't know if you
want to talk about Y5.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.985
JOHN ZERATSKY: Well, I was just
going to add something and talk

00:47:37.985 --> 00:47:40.910
about one of the
mechanisms that we

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:44.430
use to sort of make sure
that people stick around

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:47.810
for the research and actually
watch the research is by making

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:49.380
sure that the
people in the sprint

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.200
all participate in the
creation and the selection

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.314
of those ideas so that
everybody is sketching,

00:47:54.314 --> 00:47:56.480
everybody's involved in the
decision-making process,

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.520
everybody's involved
in the prototyping,

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.090
and the reason
that's important is

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:02.290
that then those people
really want to see what's

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.020
going to happen in the test.

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:07.100
It's like people
are then into it.

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:09.094
They're in suspense.

00:48:09.094 --> 00:48:11.510
They want to find out if their
ideas are going to work out

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:12.010
or not.

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:15.480
So by making sure that
the entire team is going

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.960
to participate, even if that
means a smaller team, a smaller

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.964
core team who's going
to be really focused,

00:48:20.964 --> 00:48:22.630
it creates an incentive
for those people

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:24.409
to stick around for the end.

00:48:24.409 --> 00:48:26.450
JAKE KNAPP: There's a
study done by Jacob Nielsen

00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:28.260
in the '90s where he
evaluated hundreds

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:31.870
of these kinds of interviews
to see at what point

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:33.629
the sort of learnings
trailed off,

00:48:33.629 --> 00:48:35.420
and it turns out that
whether you interview

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:39.480
five people or 30, by the
time you've talked to five,

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.134
you'll see 85% of
what you'll ever see.

00:48:42.134 --> 00:48:44.550
And so you're better off--
that's the point of diminishing

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:46.880
returns-- you're better off
then turning your efforts

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:51.340
to doing a new prototype and
fixing it or changing it.

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:53.760
And so we've also
seen that anecdotally

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.090
in our own experience that,
again, by that fifth interview,

00:48:57.090 --> 00:49:00.960
it starts to be
repeated information.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.630
JOHN ZERATSKY: We both heard
a great metaphor the other day

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:04.550
for this.

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:07.310
Imagine if there was
a piece of carpeting

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:09.650
here that was kind
of flipped up,

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:12.700
and people were coming up to
ask us questions or something,

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.110
and 20 people were going to
come up and ask a question.

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:19.880
And the first two people tripped
on the piece of carpeting.

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.810
Would we need to watch
the other 18 people

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:23.387
all trip on the carpeting?

00:49:23.387 --> 00:49:24.220
We wouldn't need to.

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.020
So there are some
things like that

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:29.220
that just become so obvious
that need to be fixed

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.000
or things that are
working well after even

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.930
a couple of customers
that five really

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:35.714
is a magic number for
customer research.

00:49:35.714 --> 00:49:37.630
JAKE KNAPP: In the sense
of being a complement

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:39.170
to large scale data.

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:42.040
Either later on or before,
you have that large scale data

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.200
that can tell you something
different about it,

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.856
but five works well.

00:49:46.856 --> 00:49:50.020
And because it's so important
to have the team there,

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.140
to have everyone
see that research,

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.000
we really think that
you're better off,

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.655
if you don't have time to
do that realistic prototype

00:49:57.655 --> 00:50:00.030
that fifth day when you test,
you're better off not doing

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.238
a sprint at all, because it
might be a sign that what

00:50:02.238 --> 00:50:05.230
you're working on is not
important enough to the team.

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:07.730
And so in that
case, you might want

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:09.914
to wait until it is
the important thing,

00:50:09.914 --> 00:50:11.330
and you're willing
to do it right,

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:13.440
because you'll get so much
better results by going

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:14.660
all the way through.

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:17.269
CAROLINE O'CONNOR: How important
is it to test three ideas

00:50:17.269 --> 00:50:19.810
and evaluate them against each
other as opposed to maybe just

00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:21.680
testing one idea?

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.830
JAKE KNAPP: We don't
always test three,

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:28.610
but we often do, and the
reason why it's valuable

00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:30.780
is because-- actually,
there's a couple reasons.

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:35.360
One is that if you know
you have two or three,

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.940
you can take bigger risks.

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:42.100
So you're less likely to try
to make this really tough call

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.880
between two promising
directions or to try

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:49.710
to sort of water them down
or merge them into one idea.

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:51.470
The other thing is
that frankly, we've

00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:55.550
done this enough times that
we know how often we're wrong.

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:59.030
We know how often founders,
anybody who's a decision-maker

00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:00.200
is wrong.

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.450
It just turns out that
humans are unpredictable,

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:04.330
and when you show
them this new thing,

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:06.580
it's really hard to tell how
they're going to respond.

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:08.320
And so you have just
increased your hit rate.

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.220
If you've got two or
three different things,

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.400
it turns out that the
chances that one of those

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.460
is the right one is
much, much higher.

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.040
JOHN ZERATSKY: In
the Savioke story,

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.640
there were three
different ideas,

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.250
but they were all packaged
into one prototype.

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:23.099
So a lot of times,
that's what we'll do.

00:51:23.099 --> 00:51:24.640
We thought it would
be weird if there

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:28.642
were like multiple robots making
deliveries in your hotel room.

00:51:28.642 --> 00:51:29.600
But if it's something--

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.616
JAKE KNAPP: Here's
your toothbrush.

00:51:31.616 --> 00:51:34.140
JOHN ZERATSKY: If it's a more
conventional type of product,

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:38.540
if we're talking about like
when we worked with Blue Bottle

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:41.080
Coffee, so we were
helping them figure out

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.690
how to expand their
business online,

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:45.450
how to bring the
experience that they

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:49.510
created for their customers
in their stores to the web.

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:53.200
We had a lot of different
ideas for how we might do that,

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:56.600
and what we did in that case was
we took those different ideas,

00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:00.464
and we created three
separate prototypes,

00:52:00.464 --> 00:52:02.130
and what it looked
like to the customers

00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:04.550
we tested with were three
different websites where

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:05.720
you could buy coffee.

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.070
JAKE KNAPP: Three totally
different coffee companies.

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:08.340
JOHN ZERATSKY: They even
had different brands.

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:09.590
We made up fake logos.

00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:11.320
They had different
color schemes.

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.510
And so that's a
really powerful way

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:17.250
to test when you have ideas
that are completely in conflict.

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:20.070
With Savioke, the face and
the games and the dance

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:22.280
were not in conflict, so
we could put them together.

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.260
But if you have ideas
that are in conflict,

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:27.380
these multiple competing
prototypes with fake brands,

00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:29.390
they create that
illusion for the customer

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:31.180
that they're looking
at real stuff,

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:34.450
and they're just sort of
reacting and thinking out loud

00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:36.710
and telling you, I
really like this one,

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:41.890
because it seems I don't know
if I can trust it or whatever.

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:43.540
You're sort of
watching them shop

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:45.787
between these different options.

00:52:45.787 --> 00:52:47.620
CAROLINE O'CONNOR: Thank
you, guys, so much.

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:48.860
This was really,
really interesting.

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:50.040
JOHN ZERATSKY: Thanks,
everyone, for coming.

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:50.640
Thank you.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.180
[APPLAUSE]
