 The light of the sun 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.000
 it takes 8 minutes to reach your eyes 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.920
 Inside 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.400
 all atoms form our mind 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.000
 But yes 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.720
 You think that science is not made for you 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.020
 or that is not "woe"

 Be careful and you will see how 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.740
 We are about to spread a bit of science 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.900
 The evolution was created by the brain, the heart, the spinal cord 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.820
 And also the eyes 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.820
 medicine created vaccines and technologies 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 They keep you alive 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.200
 Every time you eat, read, chat 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.860
 or do you make a selfie all smiling 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.400
 No, science does not go out of fashion 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.900
 Science never goes out of style 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.980
 You love these applications for the iPhone that help you to bind 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.160
 But they were the "crakcs" of science 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.100
 those who first imagined them 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.260

 I say from the heart, take it seriously 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.680
 People are "sexy" when he shows he's smart 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.640
 Unlike all modes 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.660
 science is logical and it is not over 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.520
 Listen, I heard that

 And also the eyes 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.760

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.920
 You love these applications for the iPhone that help you to bind

 But they were the "crakcs" of science who 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.040
 they first imagined 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.140

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.920
 So alone, do not be silly 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.980
