[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.010
NAOMI NOVIK: Actually, I wanted
to steal this opportunity

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.750
to talk a little bit about the
kind of writing on a higher

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.990
level that I'm trying to do.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.740
Because, in fact,
it's interesting.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.422
One of the things
that I've had to do,

00:00:24.422 --> 00:00:25.880
that I've been
doing for promotion,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.650
is you end up
writing blog posts.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.850
You go on sort of
blog tours now.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.990
And it's funny
because I normally

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.390
don't like to write nonfiction.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.230
I tend to prefer to put all my
thoughts and all my feelings

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.400
and let them kind of get
processed unconsciously

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.150
and just come out in fiction.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.780
But when you start to try
to write about your process,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.350
about what you're doing,
about writing in general,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.470
sometimes you have to nail
down some of your thinking.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.350
And I found that
I've been doing that.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.320
And I sort of want
to talk about it

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.239
a little bit because I
think there's something--

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.880
I do think that there's a kind
of movement happening right

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.890
now, where for the last--
for a long time, really,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.520
there's been a certain kind
of model of authorship.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.740
A kind of top-down
model, basically.

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:25.060
The relationship between the
creator and the audience.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.720
And that has been
changing drastically just

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.820
because it's become much
easier to be a creator.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.080
The tools of creation in
various kinds of media

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.270
have become more accessible.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.990
And the ability to
talk back to creators

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.960
has been changing
because of social media

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.500
networks and the accessibility.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.290
The way that basically
makes it much easier

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.330
to have relationships
between one and many.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.630
So what I wanted
to talk about is

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.650
how that can change what
it is that you're trying

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.750
to accomplish as a creator.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.530
How that different
relationship with your audience

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.009
changes what you're
doing and how

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.980
that can come out
differently in your fiction.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.650
Obviously, for a long time
the process of creation

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.890
was you sit in a room,
you make something.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.800
Especially as an author, you
really do sit alone in a room.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.530
And even now that's true.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.130
And you make something and
you put it out to an audience,

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.540
who, if they talk back about it,
they generally are sort of talk

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.750
amongst themselves.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.160
You don't necessarily hear back.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.177
You might get a letter from
a fan every once in awhile.

00:02:45.177 --> 00:02:46.760
If it's even bigger,
if it's something

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.880
like you're making a movie,
your audience essentially

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.640
has almost no way
to respond to you

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.590
except by how many
tickets sales there

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.470
are on the opening weekend.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.090
And so these boundaries are
getting broken a lot right now.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.420
And this happens obviously
in software as well.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.550
In a previous life,
I was a programmer

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.420
and still do it for fun now.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.230
And we'll talk a little bit
more about that as well.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.930
But basically all those feature
requests, and feedbacks,

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.200
and feedback, and bug
reports-- and the problem

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.500
is that it's very hard to
respond to all of that.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.200
Trying to form a
relationship on the basis

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.340
of replying to every sort
of individual comment

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.730
is very hard.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.540
And people generally don't like
to do it, especially people who

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.420
are creating things.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.760
You don't want to
interrupt the flow

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.910
of being able to either write
something or coding something.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.210
I'm sure everybody here has
been in lots of meetings.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.810
And doesn't like the way that
they break up the work day.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.620
And so I sort of want-- and
that doesn't necessarily

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.880
align with the creator's goals.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.560
Creators obviously have
various different goals.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.790
But I sort of
would simplify them

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.029
to say that creators want to
either make art or software,

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.420
make a product, do good work.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.740
That's one intrinsic goal.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.060
They like to get praised.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.090
And they like to get paid.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.190
So those are some very, very
obvious, very basic things.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.750
But I'm interested
in what happens

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.610
when you kind of change some of
those goals, sometimes subtly.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:47.250
And when you get past that kind
of limited relationship, even

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.870
a relationship where the
audience is talking back

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.130
to the creator, to a different
kind of relationship that's

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.850
not necessarily visible in
a lot of mainstream media.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.050
So about me, first, where
this all comes from.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.150
So I've been writing
full time since 2004.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.940
But my background, actually, to
sort of go back even further.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.720
When I went to college,
I was an English major.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.280
And I was going to
be a journalist.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.350
Specifically, I was
going to be Lois Lane.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.120
And sadly, I did an
internship and did

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.560
a lot of newspaper
writing and discovered

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.270
that Superman comics
are not necessarily

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.430
the most accurate depiction
of a journalistic career.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.500
And after that, I did
actually squeak out

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.000
of college with
my English degree.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.590
But in fact, what I spent my
senior year doing was MUSHing.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.920
I don't know-- has anybody
here heard of MUSHes?

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.040
Yes, I see few.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.760
So MUSH stands for Multi-User
Shared Hallucination.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.790
And anybody who's played either
tabletop role-playing games

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.370
like D&amp;D, or has played
an Infocom game, or a text

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.880
adventure game-- you're are in
a maze of twisty little passages

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.280
all alike kind of thing--
you've had that experience.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.760
Except MUSHes are built,
generally, they're

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.620
text-only games.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.320
They are built by
the participants

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.340
who then use them as a setting
for role-playing games.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.350
And I actually learned to code
in the internal programming

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.770
language of MUSHes, which
was called MUSHcode.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.280
And that is in fact, descriptive
of the way the code looks.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.860
And basically since
then, I've sort of

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.800
oscillated between
programming and writing.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.272
I decided I wanted-- I
decided this was great,

00:06:50.272 --> 00:06:51.730
I wanted to work
on computer games.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.440
So with an English
degree, it's kind of

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.100
hard to get a job working
on computer games.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.200
So I was working and
working at the same time

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.370
on a graduate degree
in computer science.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.190
And while I was doing that, I
was also writing as a hobby.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.050
I was writing fan fiction.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.060
I started doing that,
basically in 1995.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.790
I discovered-- this was
actually even before, in 1994.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.420
So this was before Mosaic
for the first web browser.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:27.520
I discovered the
VAX/VMS at Brown.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.020
And got onto the Star
Trek-L mailing list.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.620
Yes, I see a few people,
a few people, yay.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.040
And I started writing
Next Generation fan

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.670
fiction because there were
other people doing that.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.400
And I thought this was great.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.440
This was just this
wonderful experience.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.339
And nobody was
getting paid for it.

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:50.380
For anybody who doesn't
know what fan fiction is,

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.340
it's basically you take
typically a TV series

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.950
or a movie or a book
and you write stories

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.960
about the characters and
settings, set in that universe.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.930
And you're generally
doing it non-commercially.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.780
You're not doing it
to try and sell it.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.890
People obviously do write
those kinds of stories

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.910
commercially as tie-in novels.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.120
But that's actually
tends to be quite far

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.600
away from what fan fiction is.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.880
And people write these
stories just for love

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.630
and post them and share
them with one another.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:23.140
And it becomes part of building
a community, basically around

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.080
this kind of work.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.580
So, yes, while I was working
on my computer science degree

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.690
professionally, I was writing
fan fiction as a hobby.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.230
And then I actually
had the chance

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.490
to work on a computer game.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.929
I got a chance to work
on "Neverwinter Nights"

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:45.360
expansion set, "Shadows
Of Undrentide."

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.150
And I discovered that working
in crunch mode for six

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.210
months at a time was also
not quite as much fun

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.620
as it might have sounded.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.840
And basically I came
out of that process.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.769
I had the exciting
opportunity on that game.

00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:09.060
When you have a really small
team working on something,

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.880
you get to be a little
more jack-of-all-trades.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.200
So I actually had come
onto the expansion set team

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.130
as a programmer.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.770
But they also needed
help with the design,

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.570
so I actually got to do
designing slash programming.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.650
And I got to participate
in the process

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.600
of designing an entire computer
game, 30 hours of game play.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.730
And the work of
structuring that and then

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.830
writing-- figuring out how
all the sort of side plots

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.610
and how you going to let
readers, I say readers,

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.360
but of course, it's players.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.850
How you're going to let
players have meaningful impact

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.930
on the universe, despite
the fact that in some ways

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.280
you have to kind of bring
it back to key points.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.150
So that the limited number
of cinematics and the budget

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.350
can all make sense.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.050
No matter whether you're playing
like the evil player who's

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.160
out to conquer the
entire universe,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.500
or the noble paladin who's
there to save everybody and be

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.700
a good guy.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.940
And I came out of that
process and realized,

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:17.200
all right, I don't actually
want to move to Edmonton

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.190
and work 100 hours a week
for the rest of my life.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.460
What am I going to do now?

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:29.450
And a good friend of
mine said why don't you

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.020
try writing a novel?

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.310
And I did and it was terrible.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.160
It was like 20,000
words and I junked it

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.830
after struggling
to make it work.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.310
And then about a
couple months later,

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.846
I saw the movie
"Master and Commander,

00:10:45.846 --> 00:10:47.220
The Far Side Of
The World," which

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.650
was based on the Aubrey-Maturin
books by Patrick O'Brian.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.520
And shortly afterwards I came
out of that-- that was awesome,

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.390
what could make it better?

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.530
Dragons.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.140
Dragons.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.580
So that was basically the
start of the Temeraire series.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.050
Things like how could I make
the "Age Of Sail" even more

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:07.550
awesome?

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:12.210
And clearly, it's throw
some dragons in there.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:16.810
And the thing is, of course,
that is actually very much

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.390
a kind of fan fiction move.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.010
It is an impulse.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.030
Fan fiction is the
impulse to want

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:27.410
more but a little different.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.870
More, but from this perspective.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.695
More of this, but I
want these characters

00:11:32.695 --> 00:11:34.400
to have relationship.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.750
More, but I want to see inside
that character's head who's

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.050
actually the bad guy.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:44.860
And that kind of impulse,
through fan fiction,

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:49.940
also lends itself to more
of that, but with dragons.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.970
More of that, but how about
if they were in space.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:57.840
And that kind of
play is really quite

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:06.630
key to the sort of fanfic kind
of aesthetic, I would say.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.360
So that was in
2004 that I started

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.180
writing the Temeraire series.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:17.130
And in 2007,
because I got bored,

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:22.230
I started a nonprofit
organization

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:26.050
called The Organization
For Transformative Works.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:29.280
And this was born out
of some frustration

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:34.960
in that a lot of us in the fan
fiction and sort of the broader

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.250
fan works community, saw--
there was a company specifically

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.560
then, called FanLib,
that basically was trying

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.420
to create a fan fiction
archive that they

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.940
were going to monetize.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.700
And they were inviting
fan fiction writers

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.225
to come and post on their site.

00:12:52.225 --> 00:12:53.600
And they were
saying things like,

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:58.420
we'll put you in touch with the
creators, we'll run contests,

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.730
and here, by the way, read
these terms of service

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.730
where you indemnify us
in case you ever get sued

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.520
for copyright and infringement.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.100
And that'll be your
problem, not ours.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.760
And so many of us were
quite up in arms about this.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.400
And I made the
mistake of writing

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.740
a long post about how we
needed an archive of our own.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.180
How we needed a home for
fan fiction and fanworks

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.980
that was like fan
fiction itself,

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.390
done in a non-commercial
way, that basically

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:33.560
supported preserving fan
works for the long term.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.400
Which is another major issue.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.300
When you have
non-commercial things,

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.500
there's nobody kind of
paying to keep the lights on.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.150
And so a lot of
times, fan fiction

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.170
literally just--
enormous swaths of it

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:49.130
just vanish into thin air.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:50.630
Obviously, I'm sure
many people here

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.320
remember the days of GeoCities.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.610
Well, a lot of people hosted to
their fan fiction on GeoCities.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.060
And a lot of those people,
after they posted their stories,

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.200
they left their sites
up but they went away.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.720
And when GeoCities went
down, it just was gone.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.199
Just disappeared.

00:14:09.199 --> 00:14:09.990
A lot of that work.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:14.180
Because a lot of them
had carefully made sure

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.120
their work was not
indexable, not archivable

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:22.300
by the archive.org crawlers.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:27.750
They were anxious about
their work being taken down.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.510
And they didn't necessarily
value their work.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.010
They didn't necessarily value
their work because, of course,

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.530
there was no price tag on it.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.466
And yet those stories were
extremely valuable to people

00:14:38.466 --> 00:14:39.340
within the community.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.880
So among that, we basically,
within this community,

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.990
we decided to build
ourselves an archive.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.620
The archive of our
own was started--

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:59.390
went into beta in 2008.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:05.960
It now has 1.5 million works
on it, more than 500,000 users.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.050
We get 90 million
page views a week

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:12.350
from about more than eight
million unique visitors.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.500
And this was done with
literally no advertising.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.410
There's no paid
staff whatsoever.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.400
There have been a total,
over the entire lifetime

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.610
of the project, of three
volunteer professional systems

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:25.910
administrators.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.740
Usually one at a time.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.300
There have been,
I think, a total

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.810
of four professional
coders, if you count me

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.200
as a professional coder,
which I actually was not

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.300
during this time period.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.900
Everyone else, basically, who
has worked on this project

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.730
was an amateur.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.170
Some people who worked
on it literally had never

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.320
written a line of code before.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.070
Most of the people
who are our QA team

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.200
are complete newbies
when they come in.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.280
The support staff is
basically just all volunteers.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.430
And they respond to literally
every support inquiry,

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.880
to every question that they get.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.500
And this whole
team is 95% female.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.630
It is, as far as I know,
the largest open source

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:17.770
project-- female-run
open source project.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.890
And it is not just an open
source piece of software.

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.670
It's an actual site
that's being maintained

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.760
under so many people.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.710
And basically, I'm talking
about these various pieces

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.520
in my experience
because they all

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.000
come out of the kind of
creator-audience relationship

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.227
that I want to discuss.

00:16:42.227 --> 00:16:44.310
A different kind of
creator-audience relationship.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.440
And the things that come out--
the changes that come out

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:59.570
of that relationship, I find,
apply both to my writing

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:03.080
and to the software
that I've worked on.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.970
And not just that
I've worked on,

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.220
but there are many--
there have always been

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.730
fan fiction writers who go pro.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.329
That process is
accelerating, especially

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:15.970
now with self-publishing
becoming much easier.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:21.890
One of the barriers to entering
publishing for a lot of writers

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.770
was this sort of
not wanting to go

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.660
through the process
of rejection.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.260
Not wanting to go through
the process of gatekeeping.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.040
And now a lot of
people-- and not

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:37.320
having the time to write an
entire kind of novel on spec.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.040
And a lot of people
are now moving

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.060
to writing
professionally, to writing

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:48.110
original fiction, who were only
previously writing fan fiction.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.560
But are bringing that kind
of aesthetic with them.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.610
So I kind of wanted to
talk about it because I

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.490
think it's interesting.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:00.890
And also, quite frankly, I do
feel a bit activist about this.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.940
In that I would love to
see more of the fiction

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.340
that I read and more of
the software that I use.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:11.390
And more of the media
that I consume generally

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:15.860
come from this place that
I want to talk about.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:20.780
So specifically, I talked
about how fan fiction,

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.430
you can't sell it.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:26.730
And so it creates a
gift economy where

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.420
those three goals that I
talked about for creators,

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:33.530
making good art, getting
praise, getting paid.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:38.020
Where the getting paid
part apparently disappears.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.840
Except it does not
actually disappear.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.260
People are getting paid, but
they're getting paid in barter.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.640
So in fan fiction, the reason
you would write a fanfic story

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.930
is because you want that more.

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.410
You want more.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.880
More, but different.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.020
And so the problem is
that if you want more,

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.014
you can't generally write fast
enough to satisfy yourself.

00:19:02.014 --> 00:19:03.430
And so what you
really want is you

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:07.080
want other people to
write stories for you,

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.800
in exchange for the story
that you wrote for them.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:16.650
And that actually
kind of creates

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:20.550
a different kind of relationship
and a different kind

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.530
of incentive for writers.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:27.240
Sometimes this actually
becomes-- the sort of exchange

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.730
becomes explicit.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:32.160
Where I run a challenge called
the-- I used to run, actually.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.230
I finally retired last
year, very happily.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.060
A challenge called the
Yuletide challenge,

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.360
which basically, every
holiday season, about 2000

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.060
people sign up.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.310
And they get randomly assigned.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.080
They sign up for
something between-- they

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.850
say I'll write a story at
any one of these six fandoms.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:57.010
And I want a story in any
one of these four fandoms.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.710
And we match them up.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.640
And basically, each
person gets kind

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.650
of assigned as a Secret
Santa for somebody else.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.690
So you're writing
a story for someone

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.130
who you may not even know.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.120
And that person is writing
a story for someone

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.670
else that they
may not even know.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.380
And meanwhile, someone's
writing a story for you.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.110
And this giant exchange
happens where everybody

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.860
is writing these stories.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.630
And these are--
Yuletide is specifically

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.722
for rare and obscure fandoms.

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:25.180
So it's the fandoms
where you never

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.965
get to see a story in
your tiny little fandom.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:34.690
I've gotten-- I'm
trying to think

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.730
what the mode-- and
people can submit,

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.720
can ask for the most obscure,
most bizarre, things.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:47.210
I've seen-- there was a great
story a few years ago that

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.711
was, basically, texts
from cephalopods.

00:20:50.711 --> 00:20:52.460
I don't know if any
of you have seen this.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.900
It is basically a
story about an octopus

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.270
and a squid sending each
other iPhone text messages.

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.280
And somebody wanted
that for yuletide.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.860
Because they had seen
a video of an octopus.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.877
I think it was that nopetopus.

00:21:04.877 --> 00:21:06.460
Do you know the one
I'm talking about?

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.543
It's the octopus that's
running across the screen,

00:21:08.543 --> 00:21:11.880
it's going nope,
nope, nope, nope.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:17.400
So basically this
kind of exchange

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.410
can happen explicitly
in that model.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:25.740
But it also is happening
informally all the time.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:31.550
In that the goals for--
people basically want

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.480
more of those stories.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.947
I just recently--
just the other week--

00:21:34.947 --> 00:21:36.780
I literally watched
someone read through-- I

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.700
have 13 Captain America
fanfic stories posted.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.580
A total of about 80,000 words.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.880
And literally, within
the space of four hours,

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.820
I got 13 comments.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.390
Because this person
was reading each story,

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:51.770
leaving a comment very nicely.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.330
Going to the next
story, reading it.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:56.830
And just kind of binge-- you
know it's Netflix watching.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.820
It's binge watching,
except with fanfic.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.840
And you get through
it too quickly.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.271
And you want more.

00:22:03.271 --> 00:22:04.270
And how do you get more?

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.600
You get more by basically
building a community

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.820
around your fandom.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.670
You get more by
building a community,

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.320
not just around your fandom but
about the specific characters,

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.980
or the specific pairing.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.260
People do a lot of
shipping in fandom.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.972
You get people to write you
stories that are not just-- you

00:22:21.972 --> 00:22:23.430
don't just want
people to write you

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:26.070
stories in a particular
fandom, necessarily.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:30.900
You want them to write the
kind of stories you want.

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:38.890
And so you want-- so obviously
this changes the relationship

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.390
between the creator
and the audience

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:41.431
in some interesting ways.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.351
First of all, obviously,
it changes status.

00:22:47.351 --> 00:22:47.850
Right?

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:52.380
So we're all kind of little
hierarchical animals.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:56.360
And normally, there's that
kind of geek hierarchy

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.720
where if you're the
science fiction writer,

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.050
you're on a higher
level of the hierarchy.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:04.290
But in fandom that doesn't--
in fanfic that doesn't happen.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.770
Because you are
writing for people

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:10.540
that you know are-- you're
hoping are going to write you

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.710
something back.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:13.890
So you are kind of
writing to your peers.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:21.040
You're writing to people
who are in it with you

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.350
I'm trying to court them.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:27.770
You're specifically trying to
invoke their own creativity.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:31.250
You really want to inspire
people to write more.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:33.820
You really want
them to sort of feel

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.890
like-- you want them to
maybe not write more.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:37.890
You would love somebody.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.450
There's nothing that fanfic
writers love more than

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:44.050
when somebody makes a piece
of fan art for their story.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:48.440
And fan art artists love it when
writers then take their artwork

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.720
and write a story based on it.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.650
And that kind of free
interplay is something

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.210
that people are constantly
trying to generate.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:01.610
You also want people to be
encouraged to leave comments,

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:02.660
to talk.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.330
Because those comments-- the
more commenting is going on

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.247
in a fandom, the
more likely it is

00:24:08.247 --> 00:24:10.580
that somebody else is going
to want to jump in and write

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.329
their own stories.

00:24:11.329 --> 00:24:15.050
Because they know they're
going to get a lot of feedback.

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.916
And often, there's
one other piece,

00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:20.790
which is that often
you're trying to convince

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.560
the audience of your take.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.440
So I don't know how
many of you have ever

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.410
heard of the massive,
massive flame wars that

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:30.410
went on in Harry Potter fandom.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:33.510
Between Harry, Ginny,
Harry, Hermione.

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:39.110
People literally wanted to kill
each other over this stuff.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.170
And you think, why do you care?

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.500
Why are you having
these incredible battles

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.630
over this stuff?

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.260
And of course, it's
because there is actually

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.240
a finite resource being
competed for, to some extent.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.120
You were literally trying
to get the good writers.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.830
You want the good writers,
you want all the writers

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:02.020
to kind of come to
your side of the force.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.990
You want them to come
and play with you

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.280
and write the stories
that you really want.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.300
And how dare they go and
write that other pairing.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:14.290
And people really
feel that-- and even

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:20.020
the rational among us who
recognize that the heart wants

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:24.250
what it wants and you can't
make people love something

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.790
and you have to just sort
of enjoy everything that's

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:31.460
being created-- you
still feel that when

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.600
fanfic writer that
you love starts

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.250
writing in a pairing
that isn't your pairing.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.990
You always feel that, oh.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.810
That "oh" moment,
where you're like,

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.130
ah, I wish they'd written
that story for me.

00:25:47.754 --> 00:25:49.670
And actually, interestingly,
one of the things

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.760
that people frequently criticize
fan fiction about-- for,

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.620
is the quality.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.536
People are like, ugh,
fan fiction is terrible.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.130
People have stopped saying
that so much, at least to me.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.750
Possibly because I talk
about fan fiction a lot,

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.360
so they're scared
to say it to me now.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.742
But people would often
talk about the problems

00:26:08.742 --> 00:26:09.450
with fan fiction.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:14.050
And I mean, as we've seen,
thanks to Kindle Direct

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.270
Publishing, it's not
about fan fiction.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.030
It's about the lack
of gatekeeping.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.740
You know, Sturgeon's Law
acts very powerfully.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:26.490
But for instance, I have seen
a lot of people talk about,

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:28.750
for instance, "Fifty
Shades Of Gray,"--

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.220
which started life
as fan fiction--

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.140
about how it's so bad.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.500
And they talk about it
and I know many people

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.880
who are just confused.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.100
They feel like
they don't like it.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.710
They look at the
text and it's not

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:44.950
even that it's not for them.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:48.935
It's just like it seems
like it's badly written.

00:26:48.935 --> 00:26:50.310
But one of the
interesting things

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:53.330
is that bad fan
fiction actually can

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:58.910
serve some of the function
of some of those goals.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:00.570
Fan fiction does
not necessarily have

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:06.650
to be great or even good to
help produce a community.

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.900
In fact, I know
many people who were

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.140
motivated by bad fan fiction.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.970
Somebody writes a
bad fanfic story.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.860
And that gets them mad.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.540
And they're like, this
story-- that idea is good,

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:19.640
but they did so badly.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.750
I'm going to write it again.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.790
Or they read the story, it's
like the characters would never

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:25.590
behave that way.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:26.430
It's terrible.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.700
I'm going to write it again.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.250
And frankly, just
having people talking,

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.850
it's like the power
of having somebody

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:38.320
talking in a room breaking
the ice, in a way.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.230
And kind of making
somebody else feel

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:44.060
like, well, I could write a
story as good as that one.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.220
Or I could write a
story better than that.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.590
And so I'm going to try.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.370
Actually has some
of those community

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:55.470
building effects, whether
or not the actual work

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:59.710
itself is necessarily
brilliantly written.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.460
But, of course,
good fan fiction,

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:09.670
really well-written fan fiction
is trying to do something,

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:13.040
is also trying to
accomplish those same goals.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.580
It's trying to
make the good art,

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:19.070
and it's trying to be praised.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.680
The fan fiction writers
love comments and feedback

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.440
since that's the
only-- that's sort

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:28.110
of the immediate direct
reward that they get for it.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.340
But they are also
trying to get--

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.870
it is trying to be seductive.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:37.050
It is trying really
actively to give pleasure.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:38.900
And it's trying to
give pleasure of a kind

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.880
that you want
mirrored back to you.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.310
Generally, you write
the kinds of stories

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:47.110
that you want to read in fandom.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:55.090
And the way that differs from
the kind of more mainstream

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:58.870
model, the more common
model, is that a lot of times

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:01.560
that is only performative.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.750
A lot of times you're
writing a book,

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:06.140
you want your book to
completely stand out.

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.280
You don't want your
book to be like anything

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.020
that anybody else has written.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.600
You want your book--
you want people to say,

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.310
that's an original
work of genius.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.430
You want people to say, I've
never seen anything like that

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.240
before.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:27.090
You want people to
say-- you want to have--

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:30.200
and frequently you want to have
a kind of controlling effect

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.770
on the reader's experience.

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.590
That's kind of the model that's
a lot of times-- it's sort

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.380
of that film director thing.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.110
Sit in this theater, turn
off your cell phones,

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:43.320
you're going to experience my
vision for the next two hours.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.760
And you're going to like it.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:51.700
And that's really sort of the
antithesis of the fan fiction

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:56.630
kind of approach where you
really want-- you're like,

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:57.750
here, look at this thing.

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:59.140
Don't you want to
come and don't you

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.764
want to start talking
with me about it?

00:30:00.764 --> 00:30:02.860
Don't you want to make
something just like this?

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:10.190
A lot of times you get
that in books as well.

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.940
Authors are trying
to cause the reader

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.710
to really have an
experience that they're

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:17.210
trying to push on the reader.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.690
And it's not necessarily
what they almost

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:21.780
think the reader wants.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.240
It's like they want to perform.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.260
They want to show off.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.510
They want to show their skill.

00:30:32.172 --> 00:30:34.380
They want to convince you
that they're great writers.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.830
They want to convince you
that this is a great story.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:42.386
They aren't always necessarily
thinking about giving pleasure.

00:30:42.386 --> 00:30:44.010
They aren't always
necessarily thinking

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:49.750
about making you really
just deeply entertained.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:56.770
And so specifically,
like the grimdark genre,

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.880
which I feel like has been
really dominant for a long time

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:08.410
now-- and we've seen it largely
because they're obviously--

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.660
there are kind of cultural
influences on this.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:19.250
So HBO has produced "Game
Of Thrones," "Sopranos."

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:25.235
And a lot of cable television
has this sort of incentive

00:31:25.235 --> 00:31:27.610
where the way they differentiate
themselves from networks

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.290
is they can have more
violence and more sex.

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:35.670
And generally what they do is
they have a lot more violence.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.800
They have a lot of
sexual violence.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:43.410
And they have some more
sex, but they still

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:48.270
are quite leery of getting
categorized as pornographic,

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.110
so very often the
sex is not super fun.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:57.120
And so the grimdark
genre broadly

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.230
is kind of like convincing
the reader to believe

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:03.190
in the universe you've made.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:06.180
And convince them and let them
sort of suspend their disbelief

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.240
by being like, this universe
just sucks so horribly.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.630
Look at all these
terrible things.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.770
And sort of putting
one unpleasant

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.600
experience after another
to kind of create

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:22.530
this feeling that it's not sort
of a shiny plastic universe.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:28.305
And we all get a lot of
shiny plastic universes

00:32:28.305 --> 00:32:28.930
from Hollywood.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.720
And not super exciting books.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.240
And we don't generally
want the super plastic.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.610
And grimdark was
kind of a reaction

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:43.800
to something coming before it.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:49.520
But at the same time,
that kind of mentality,

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.450
that kind of knowing that
this universe that you're in,

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:56.980
as a reader, as a
consumer, is terrible,

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.070
can be kind of deadening.

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:05.290
You're kind of scared to like
anybody on "Game Of Thrones."

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:08.619
Because you know the
chances are really terrible

00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:09.910
shit's going to happen to them.

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:12.050
Sorry.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:19.700
And it's hard to care about
Batman when you actually

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:23.130
accept that Gotham is
just totally irredeemable

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:25.720
and is going to stay terrible
no matter what he does

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.940
and that everything
is just awful

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.530
and nobody there
deserves to be saved.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:32.570
And then, finally, you're
like, why do I care about that?

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.900
And why am I watching this?

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.910
And I was just watching
"Princess Bride"

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.300
with my child the other day.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.700
It's like, why are you
reading me this for?

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.740
And I frequently feel
that way sometimes.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:53.440
So what I think of as the
fan fiction, or possibly,

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.780
more broadly, I should call
it the optimistic literary

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:00.830
aesthetic, what it's
trying to do instead,

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:03.740
is it's not necessarily trying
to tell you a happy story.

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:09.040
It's not trying to tell
you a plastic story,

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.250
a sanitized story, where
everything works out great.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.420
And nothing ever bad happens.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:18.900
And everybody survives and they
all lived happily ever after.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.850
Because that's not pleasurable.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:24.150
But it is trying to
give you a really deeply

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:28.650
pleasurable experience where
you feel like the author's kind

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:30.800
of in the trenches with you.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.409
The author is like, this is an
experience that I want to have

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:38.320
and I'd like you to
come along with me.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.159
And that feeling-- when you get
that feeling that the author is

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:45.020
in the trenches with you,
in that way, in that sort

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:49.030
of intimate way where they're
trying to sell you something

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:52.909
that they would like
to buy themselves,

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:57.240
is that it allows you
to have a kind of trust.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:01.510
If you believe that an author
really is deeply invested

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:04.310
in a particular
character, really loves

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:06.755
a particular character and
feels for that character

00:35:06.755 --> 00:35:09.130
the same way that they're
trying to make you, the reader,

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:11.527
care about that
character, then you

00:35:11.527 --> 00:35:13.860
don't know-- that doesn't
tell you that character is not

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:14.980
going to die.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.950
But it does tell you
that that character's not

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:22.920
going to die in an
unsatisfying, empty way.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.640
If that character
dies, it is not

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.020
going to be for an effect
in the larger universe,

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.910
it's going to be because
it is a meaningful part

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.025
of that character's story.

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:41.430
And that trust, knowing
that, allows you

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:45.210
to kind of lower your barriers.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:50.660
Especially in fan fiction, a
lot of fan fiction readers--

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:53.740
there's a lot of trigger
warnings in fan fiction

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:56.970
that people try to
put on their work.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.730
People generally
specifically try

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.830
to alert people for any
kind of graphic violence

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:03.160
or sexual violence.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:07.460
There's a lot of-- fan
fiction is very heavily

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:08.240
female-dominated.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:12.380
There are a lot of victims
of sexual assaults in it.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:17.790
And there are many people who
both either want to avoid it

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.050
completely, or actively want.

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:23.660
Like rape fiction is actually
a huge genre in fan fiction

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:29.870
where people frequently
are working through issues

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.180
that they have had.

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:37.370
And at the same time,
it's all kind of labeled,

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:40.430
so that people go
through it, go into it

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:43.290
knowing what they're getting.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:46.550
And knowing the experience
that they're going to have.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:49.770
And that the writer
is in it with them

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:52.440
and is having the
experience with them.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:59.210
And that means that-- actually,
this doesn't stop, in fact.

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:01.140
This effect of this
audience change

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.290
doesn't stop at just writing.

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:07.470
Fan fiction also has basically--
in the fan fiction community,

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:12.365
the function of editing is
taken over by beta readers.

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:18.620
In professional
publishing, I actually

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:22.420
been very lucky in that
I've had two, now multiple,

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.490
long-term relationships
with editors.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:29.300
But a lot of editors
are essentially in a job

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:33.210
for like a year, and
then they're gone.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:34.890
They moved to a
different company,

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:36.530
they moved to a
different position,

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:38.350
they have different authors.

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:41.630
And you don't have an
incentive to create

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:43.700
a long-term relationship.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:47.000
And very frequently
there is a process

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.570
that happens, where the
author's first book comes in.

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:51.810
They get lots of attention.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:53.840
They've worked on
it for 10 years.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.640
It goes out and
it's a big success.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.510
And the second one, they
just want it on time.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:03.960
They just want it on deadline,
they want it to schedule.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.730
And very little editing gets
done on the second book,

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:10.730
the third book.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:15.020
In fact, all of my work gets
edited by my fan fiction

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.980
beta readers before
my editor sees it.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:21.540
And my fan fiction beta
readers are a lot tougher

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.780
than my editor.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:31.180
And my editor is very good,
but my fangirls are brutal.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.740
And that's partly
because, again,

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:37.770
just like with the writing, beta
readers in fandom, in fanfic,

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:39.400
are starting from
the same place.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.570
They're actually
peers with the author.

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:46.120
It's not a kind of
subordinate relationship.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.040
They are peers because
they are invested.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.190
They're both starting from
the same place of being

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.700
invested in the fandom.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.910
Being invested in the
characters and the universe

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:59.030
that they're working from, and
feeling equally authoritative.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:01.030
If you're beta reading
a fan fiction story,

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:04.415
you can say, well, no, Captain
Kirk would not do that.

00:39:04.415 --> 00:39:05.790
And you have as
much right to say

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:09.850
that as the author
of the story does.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:13.940
Obviously, when you're
doing it with original work,

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.570
it's harder.

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.880
First of all, it's harder
to get your beta readers

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.870
to get an editor invested in
an original world the same way

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:27.010
that somebody is invested in
an original wor-- in the world

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:28.930
of a show or
television or movie,

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:32.630
whatever, that they already
love themselves independently.

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:35.410
But it can be done.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:38.890
And when you get somebody
who's willing to invest

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:43.746
that way in your original work,
who will tell you if it sucks,

00:39:43.746 --> 00:39:46.120
who will tell you that they
think the characters that you

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:50.140
invented are acting in
an out-of-character way

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.350
in the story you
just wrote, that's

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:55.430
where you get the best work.

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:02.040
That's the kind of editing
that produces truly great work.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:10.850
And basically, that's something
that happens so routinely

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:15.106
in fan fiction, that you almost
take it for granted as a fan

00:40:15.106 --> 00:40:15.730
fiction writer.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.840
Until you go to
professional publishing.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.940
And suddenly, you're
getting such very nice notes

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:21.866
from your editor.

00:40:21.866 --> 00:40:23.240
And they're like,
well, maybe you

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.540
might want to change the scene.

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:28.322
Meanwhile the beta reader's
like, he was terrible,

00:40:28.322 --> 00:40:29.280
what were you thinking?

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.440
Destroy it completely,
burn it with fire.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:38.110
But you get places
faster that way.

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:41.850
And frankly, this also
happens with software.

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:44.840
The archive was built--
the only incentive

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.370
that we possibly had to offer
people to come and spend

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:52.310
enormous amounts of free time
writing code for the archive

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:55.620
that they could be gainfully
paid for somewhere else,

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.460
was basically, that they
really wanted an archive.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.210
So that they wouldn't have
their stories getting lost.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:04.270
So that they could actually
go back and read and read

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.900
the stories.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:09.290
Many of the people who've
coded, worked on the archive,

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:11.600
are themselves not
fan fiction writers.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.810
But they read fan fiction.

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:14.810
They look at fan art.

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.400
They watch fan vids.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.640
And this was, in fact,
their way of kind

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.727
of giving back to that
community, of participating

00:41:21.727 --> 00:41:22.560
in the gift economy.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.870
So as a result, of
course, the archive

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:30.340
actually has some features.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:31.930
So for instance, it
has a complete set

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:35.599
of tools for running the kind
of gift exchange challenges

00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:36.640
that I was talking about.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.850
Even though that
isn't what you would--

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:42.010
if you were sitting down,
if you were doing it

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.057
as a professional
corporate thing.

00:41:44.057 --> 00:41:45.640
And you wrote, what
are the 10 biggest

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:50.320
features that we need
for our archive, that

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.120
would not appear on the list.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.510
That should not have
been, in a certain way,

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:56.380
part of the core functionality.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.536
But in fact, it was extremely
important to have it

00:41:58.536 --> 00:41:59.910
as part of the
core functionality

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:03.200
because it's what got
our coders working.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.757
It's what brought
people to the table.

00:42:05.757 --> 00:42:08.090
It's what brought people with
their skills to the table.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:13.360
It's also meant that people
who run challenges in fandom

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.920
are frequently the
kinds of people

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.320
who have large communities
and lots of friends.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.070
And so they came to
the archive because it

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.110
had much better tools.

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:23.910
And then they were like,
to all their friends,

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:27.390
all their networks, basically
like, come over here

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:30.420
and let's play over here and
put your stories on here.

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:35.650
And that's entirely how
the whole system built.

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:38.540
It also has, for
instance, a skin system

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.770
that essentially allows
you to completely,

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:44.000
if you know a little CSS, you
could essentially completely

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.092
redesign the entire front end
of the archive to your tastes.

00:42:50.092 --> 00:42:53.830
One of the example skins was
pink, it had pandas on it.

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:59.890
And these are sort of cases of
things that don't necessarily

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:02.680
make sense.

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.170
But they were passionate.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:08.610
They had real--
there was investment

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:12.150
visible in their
presence on the archive.

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:15.700
And that in fact, in turn,
changes the relationship

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:19.930
that the users have with
the archive in that people

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:23.540
who were using the archive
can see in many different ways

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:26.690
that this thing
was built by them.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.630
Even if they individually
didn't participate.

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:32.360
Even if they don't know
anybody who's on the team.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.800
When they send a
support request, when

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.430
they read the FAQ, and
the way it's written.

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:40.970
When they read the
terms of service

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.310
which are actually
human readable,

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.650
and talk specifically.

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:46.920
And have their own FAQ
that specifically addresses

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:51.550
things like, what do we do when
we get a DMCA takedown notice?

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:54.710
And the answer is not the
YouTube thing where we're like,

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:56.900
we're going to pull
it down automatically

00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:02.240
with a system that doesn't
see it, actually look at it.

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.380
And that there's actually
somebody individually

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:08.955
looking at each instance.

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:18.720
And again, this creates trust
and that encourages investments

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.690
and lowering barriers
in a way that

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:28.200
is not the case where
you feel like you're just

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.960
being sold something.

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.790
Or where you feel like
you're being given something

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:35.560
by someone who's sort
of like, and here,

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.360
here, lower person down there.

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.800
I'm going to hand
you this thing.

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.990
It's a gift out of the
goodness of my heart.

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:42.674
And pay me money for it.

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:49.010
There does-- it does
create a different feeling.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:58.720
And so, really,
what I would like

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.400
to make a case for, I
think, more broadly,

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:06.830
is just a sense of
letting-- trying

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:10.825
to have that mindset
when creating things.

00:45:13.622 --> 00:45:17.860
Trying to sort of be in the
trenches with your audience.

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:21.690
And trying to be
part of it with them.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:23.880
Try to have the
experience, even as you're

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.920
giving the experience.

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:31.360
And I think that establishing
that kind of trust

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.280
with the reader, with the
audience, for whatever it

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.090
is you're producing,
and I think that creates

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:38.860
a different kind of work.

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.340
I think it creates a
warmer kind of work,

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.320
a more generous kind of work.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.660
And I would like
to see more of it.

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.261
Thank you very much.

00:45:47.261 --> 00:45:50.698
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:53.736 --> 00:45:56.110
I was afraid that I was not
going to have enough material

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:58.570
and it turns out I've
talked quite a lot.

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:00.530
But I'm happy to take
a couple of questions

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:01.380
if anyone has them.

00:46:06.777 --> 00:46:07.610
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:09.510
Have you ever used
critters.org and how

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:11.680
do you feel like that
maybe compares or contrasts

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.200
with the existing
kind of fanfic trading

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.950
stuff you were talking about?

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:17.860
NAOMI NOVIK: So
critters.org, I have used it.

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:21.390
It's basically a site
where you sign up

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:24.380
to critique other
people's original work.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.720
And they give you critiques
of your work in return.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.510
You sort of earn points, if
I'm remembering correctly.

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:32.570
And in fact, the
problem with critters,

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:35.160
and the problem with
most writing workshops,

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.200
is precisely that.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.680
That it is quid pro quo.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:43.010
And the problem is that you're
coming into it as a writer.

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:47.280
And while other writers can
be very good critiquers.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:51.490
In fact, most of my
best beta readers

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:56.860
are themselves people
who write as well.

00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.840
At the same time, when
you're doing it in order

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.820
to get feedback on
your own piece, that

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.010
is a completely different
motivation than what happens

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:09.200
in fanfic where
the motivation is,

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.720
I want that story you've
written to be as good as it

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.970
can possibly be for me.

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:20.280
Where you're coming in from a
mindset of, I really love this.

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:23.990
I love what you do and I
want to make it better.

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:26.120
With any kind of
writing workshop,

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.382
sometimes you can get lucky.

00:47:27.382 --> 00:47:29.590
And I think that's when you
get really great work out

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:31.910
of writing workshops,
is where you have

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:37.030
a small group of people
in a-- sort of intimately,

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:39.930
who really like
each other's work.

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:44.180
And who really want
to all rise together.

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:47.390
Who are kind of doing, not
necessarily the same thing,

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:49.550
but adjacent enough things.

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:52.890
And like what each other
are doing well enough.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:56.297
Because otherwise,
it's very hard.

00:47:56.297 --> 00:47:57.880
One of the hardest
things about taking

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.338
feedback, one of
the hardest things

00:47:59.338 --> 00:48:03.050
to learn, I think-- and I
don't feel like I learned this

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:06.410
until I had been writing
for maybe 15 years--

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:08.220
was how not to take feedback.

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.300
The feedback to
leave on the table.

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:14.680
And a lot of times
the problem is,

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:18.110
when somebody-- when you get
critiques from critters.org,

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:20.180
frequently you'll get
five or six critiques

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:23.160
that are all kind of pulling the
story in opposite directions.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:27.120
Because they all want something
different from the story.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:31.660
And so, as a result, I do think
that you get better editing

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.950
when you're being
edited by people

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:37.780
who want to read the story as
opposed to by people who want

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.776
critique on their own work.

00:48:39.776 --> 00:48:41.224
Yes.

00:48:41.224 --> 00:48:43.640
AUDIENCE: As a practical matter,
how much of an impediment

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:48.260
is copyright law to the
production of fan fiction?

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.260
NAOMI NOVIK: So copyright law
has the fair use exemption

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.010
here in this country.

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:56.970
And that could be an entire
separate talk on its own.

00:48:56.970 --> 00:49:01.050
But it makes exemptions
for transformative,

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:03.510
not exemption specifically,
but there's a fair use test,

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:04.070
basically.

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:07.340
And some of the characteristics
that it looks at

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:10.300
are whether our work
is transformative.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:11.799
And whether work
is non-commercial,

00:49:11.799 --> 00:49:13.340
whether it's competing
in the market.

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:16.740
Obviously, the kind of fan
fiction that I'm talking about

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.990
is non-commercial.

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:20.780
It is being posted for free.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.570
It's not competing
with the original work.

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:25.430
And in fact, generally,
you don't really

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:28.780
see fan fiction for something,
unless it's also just

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:29.860
like a hit.

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:33.070
Because you need a big
enough base of audience

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:35.240
for people who want
to write in that

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:39.220
fandom to find each
other in a way.

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:44.910
And so copyright law,
basically, there's

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:49.680
been a lot-- for a long time,
a lot of misunderstandings

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.964
about copyright law and
how it affects fan fiction.

00:49:52.964 --> 00:49:55.380
And a lot of fan fiction writers
were sort of underground,

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:57.090
as a result. Or
would say-- there's

00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:59.680
a default kneejerk thing of
people saying fan fiction's

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.680
illegal.

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.680
No, it's not.

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:06.610
And obviously, any one
individual piece, the fair use

00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:08.160
defense is an
affirmative defense,

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.140
meaning you don't get
to tell-- you don't

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:13.280
get to know whether your
fan fiction story is

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.380
fair use, unless it actually--
unless you actually get sued

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:17.700
and go to court.

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.140
And first of all, nobody's
going to sue a fan fiction

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:21.760
writer because, why would you?

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.660
That's like, and
you're my biggest fan,

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:25.510
I'm going to sue you.

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:28.380
For putting out that free
advertising for my work.

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:29.530
How dare you?

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:33.070
And the fan fiction writer
is, I have no money.

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:34.860
So there's really
nothing, there's

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:36.065
nothing to sue them for.

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:42.570
And also, nobody's
really going to sue,

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:45.280
because nobody wants
to lose that case.

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.570
And one of the
thing the OTW does

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:51.120
is a lot of legal advocacy.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:54.280
And basically, we
feel they would lose.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.720
So that's what I can tell you.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.220
Yes.

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.180
AUDIENCE: What do
you think of authors

00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.763
who maintain more
direct relationships

00:50:59.763 --> 00:51:02.116
with their communities,
especially Brandon Sanderson.

00:51:02.116 --> 00:51:04.490
NAOMI NOVIK: Who maintain
their own interactive community

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:05.698
with their readers, you mean?

00:51:05.698 --> 00:51:09.880
Yeah, obviously, that's
one of the things that's

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:16.840
going on with social media
lowering the barriers,

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.300
lowering the distance.

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:22.220
And making communication
just easier, simply.

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:25.180
A lot of authors are doing that.

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:29.550
But I think it's related but
it's not exactly the same.

00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:36.570
The work of connecting on a sort
of individual basis to people

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:38.660
also does form communities.

00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:41.610
And it also has some
of that same work.

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:43.240
And I do think of
Brandon Sanderson

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.930
as a writer who was
also trying deeply

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:47.970
to entertain his audience.

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:50.320
I do think of him as
one of the writers who

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.529
wants you to have a
really great time when

00:51:52.529 --> 00:51:53.570
you're reading his stuff.

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:53.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:55.820
Also [INAUDIBLE] where he
published all the drafts.

00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:57.260
And then people would
view them on their own.

00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:58.051
NAOMI NOVIK: Right.

00:51:58.051 --> 00:51:59.740
And exactly, he's
inviting-- he is

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:03.570
trying to invite people to come
in and play in that same way.

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:06.884
So yes, it's absolutely--
but there are

00:52:06.884 --> 00:52:08.050
two kind of separate things.

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:10.320
Like what I actually
kind of want

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:13.320
to talk about is more like
the literary aesthetic.

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:15.430
Like the mindset
of the actual work

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:19.200
that you produce when you're
having that kind of motivation,

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.780
which is separate
from a lot of writers.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:28.030
A lot of creators don't have
the ability or the energy.

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:30.430
I mean, Brandon has
crazy amounts of energy.

00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:33.160
I was on a panel recently
where we formed the theory

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:37.320
that every time he finishes a
book, he gets to clone himself.

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:41.410
And that's how he continues
to produce at this level.

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:45.780
But a lot of people just don't
have the cycles, basically.

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:51.110
The time to produce, to
interact on that level,

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:52.440
on a personal level.

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:54.890
And so what I'm kind
of interested in

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:59.512
is how you can, nevertheless,
put yourself in a mindset

00:52:59.512 --> 00:53:02.140
as the writer, where you're
trying to experience,

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:06.240
where you're trying to make
work from that position.

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.680
Even if you're not
actually spending

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:13.819
a lot of time talking to your
direct audience one-on-one.

00:53:13.819 --> 00:53:16.360
AUDIENCE: Also, what about fan
fiction, their own subfandoms?

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.110
Especially "Methods
of Rationality," which

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:20.260
has a number of [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.510
NAOMI NOVIK: What do you mean?

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:25.510
Like people who are writing
fan fiction of book universes?

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:27.530
AUDIENCE: Of other fans fiction.

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:29.820
"Methods of Rationality"
has at least five or six--

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:30.340
NAOMI NOVIK: Oh, sure.

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.590
No, that's all-- I mean, that's
been happening for a long time.

00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:34.160
People write sequels
to each other's

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.470
fanfic constantly in fandom.

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:42.010
And in fact, one of the things
that the archive policies

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:46.720
specifically allow is
that there's actually

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.550
code in there for
listing another story

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:52.030
as the inspiration,
or as the basis

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:54.450
that you either remixed
it or you wrote a sequel

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:56.521
or something.

00:53:56.521 --> 00:53:57.550
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:57.550 --> 00:54:00.720
Just wondering your thoughts
on other sites and platforms,

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.550
like fanfiction.net,
and what you've

00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:04.740
learned from those other
sites and platforms

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:06.780
in building out AO3.

00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:08.990
NAOMI NOVIK: So
fanfiction.net-- and actually,

00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:10.200
are we out of time?

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.951
Is it OK if we keep going?

00:54:11.951 --> 00:54:13.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: Last question.

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.610
NAOMI NOVIK: Last question, OK.

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:17.700
So fanfiction.net has been
around for years and years.

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:22.470
And I feel-- I have
a complicated set

00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:23.590
of feelings about it.

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:25.620
First of all, it came
out of the community.

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:29.410
It was built long before
anybody had the idea that it

00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:31.140
was going to make money.

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:36.010
The people who built it, built
it for basically their friends.

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:40.380
And so, I think of it
as a labor of-- as part

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:43.690
of this community in a way
that I didn't think of.

00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:45.700
For instance, the
company FanLib--

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:48.090
that I talked about briefly--
that came in and was

00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:50.050
going to do it from outside.

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:52.430
They basically just
looked at the Google ad

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:56.110
revenue of
fanfiction.net and were

00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:58.360
like, oh, we want
a piece of that.

00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:04.050
Even though they had literally
no connection to the community.

00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:07.300
The problems with
fanfiction.net is now

00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.780
they are advertiser-supported.

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:11.200
They are for profit.

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:15.530
And that has certain--
that has problems

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:18.990
that we've seen in general
with social media networks.

00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:20.570
I mean, we all know this, right?

00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:24.610
If you're not paying for it,
you're part of the product.

00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:31.352
And so the way that
results, is, for instance,

00:55:31.352 --> 00:55:32.310
you've got advertisers.

00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:33.890
The advertiser's
like, oh, we don't

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:37.620
want any-- we don't want
that Harry-Draco NC-17 slash

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:41.970
on the archive, on the
fanfiction.net site.

00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:44.010
And so periodically,
fanfiction.net

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:48.430
would go in and purge
enormous swaths of stories

00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:51.140
and kick people off with
no warning, no chance

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.610
to save their work.

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:56.490
Similar things happened
on LiveJournal,

00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:58.620
which was enormously
popular around the time

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:01.510
that we were
founding the archive.

00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:06.470
And that, of course, is
terrible from the perspective

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:09.260
of somebody who wants to
preserve the entire community.

00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:12.180
And really see the kind
of work that's being done.

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:18.610
And so that's why the archive
is-- we're really aggressively

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:20.280
protect the free speech rights.

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.110
We don't take any advertising.

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:24.050
It's like public
radio, basically.

00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:26.570
We have a fundraising
drive twice a year.

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:28.140
And we ask people to support it.

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:30.720
And people have supported
it, more than enough

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.780
to continue it,
keeping it afloat.

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:38.700
But that's sort of the problem
with fanfiction.net I think

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:41.300
it's-- and for a long time.

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:45.490
And now Wattpad
similarly-- anything

00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:49.390
that ultimately has
a for profit motive,

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:53.800
is not reliable when
what you're producing--

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:57.530
when you don't have--
where you don't

00:56:57.530 --> 00:57:00.861
have the power of
an actual contract.

00:57:00.861 --> 00:57:03.110
Where you don't have the
power, that your thing is not

00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:04.952
making you money.

00:57:04.952 --> 00:57:06.660
Your fan fiction is
not making you money.

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:12.800
And so you can't actually afford
to spend money on it, in a way.

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:16.640
You can't afford to
have a legal battle.

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.380
That's my general feeling.

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:21.090
That's why we made
the archive nonprofit.

00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:23.140
The OTW is non-profit.

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:24.710
All right, thank
you so very much.

00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:28.060
[APPLAUSE]
