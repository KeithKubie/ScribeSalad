00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.600
I recently gave a talk, here at the Ri,
 on Quantum Mechanics

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.920
which, I was very pleased to see,
got a big response.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.220
However, some people,
some viewers of that talk

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.880
expressed some bafflement,
or worse

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.400
about an analogy
that I used during it.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.080
And so, I wanted here

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.000
to go through that analogy
 in a little more detail,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.880
hopefully a little more clearly, 
and explain what it's really about,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.680
and what it's really
trying to show.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.260
It's an analogy
 to try to understand

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.540
the quantum phenomenon
 called entanglement.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.220
And I want, first of all, to point out
that the analogy isn't mine.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.620
It's not something
that I've invented.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.140
It's adapted

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.280
from an analogy
 that was devised in the late 1990s

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.360
by two physicists, Sandu Popescu and Daniel Rohrlich.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.260
And they were trying to understand

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.440
the implications of this quantum property of entanglement.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.820
And I'll come back, at the end, to what it was that they were exploring.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.440
Now, I think some people had the impression

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.560
that this was just a very complicated way
of talking about entanglement.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.120
It's not doing that.   This analogy is actually
doing something a little more than that.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.740
But I'll talk, first of all,
about what entanglement is.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.460
It's what happens
when any two quantum particles interact.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.540
It has to happen.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.440
And what results from that
 is that those particles,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.000
once they've interacted, they are "entangled",
and it means that their quantum states are interdependent.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.240
There's a correlation
between them,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.360
so that if one is
 in one particular state,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.380
then the other one has to have
some other particular state,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.960
depending on the kind of entanglement
 that they have.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.360
So, the classic example
 would involve, say, 2 electrons.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.240
And electrons have
a quantum property called spin,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.900
which you don't
need to know anything about,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.860
other than that
 the spin of an electron can have 2 values.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.360
It's a bit like a sort of
quantum heads or tails.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.340
An electron can be
spin up or spin down.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.660
And if the electrons
become entangled,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.700
...then...

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.820
this may create a situation
where those two spins are correlated,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.500
such that if one of the electrons
 has a spin up,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.120
then the other one
must have a spin down.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.440
Now, this is a prediction
of Quantum Mechanics.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.780
And it was pointed out {that this property}...
this...   this phenomenon of entanglement CAN happen.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.080
It was pointed out
 by Albert Einstein, in 1935.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.700
And he figured
 that there was something wrong about it.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.440
I explained in the talk
 how we can think about entanglement.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.920
In some ways, this correlation
 between the 2 states of electrons

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.560
in some ways, it's a bit like having 2 gloves,
 a left-handed and a right-handed glove.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.860
Now, if you imagine
 that you have those 2 gloves,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.100
and you send them out to 2 people
 on different sides of the world, maybe.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.298
And these 2 people
 - we're going to meet them again shortly -

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.680
are called
Alice and Bob.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.240
Amm...  And they know
 that these gloves are a pair.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.720
And so, as soon as Alice

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.360
receives her glove, and opens the package,
and finds she has the left-handed glove,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.740
then she knows,
right away, that Bob

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.580
must have the right-handed glove,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.400
because there is 
this correlation between them.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.800
There's nothing magical
 about how she gets that information.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.380
It's just simple logic.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.100
However, here's the complication
in Quantum Mechanics.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.300
Because Niels Bohr, the Danish physicist
 who pioneered early Quantum Mechanics,

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.060
suggested that, 
in the case of quantum particles,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.960
it's not the fact that they have this property, 
whatever it is, spin or whatever,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.580
all the time.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.440
They only have that property,
 with a fixed value, when we observe it.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.040
So, for these 2 entangled photons {electrons},
if we think of sending those out

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.520
to Alice and Bob,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.080
Bohr said:

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.140
While they're going outwards,

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.220
they DON'T HAVE
 a fixed orientation of their spin.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.940
All we can say is that
those spins are correlated.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.360
So, if Alice then measures her electron,
and finds it has spin up,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.200
then Bob's will have spin down.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.600
But that spin wasn't determined
until Alice measured it.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.160
And this is where Einstein felt
 there was a problem with entanglement,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.120
because it seemed to indicate that
 the act of Alice measuring her electron spin...

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.300
somehow affected Bob's spin.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.860
So that once Alice had found
the spin had to be spin up,...

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.320
somehow, magically
 - or "spookily," as Einstein said -

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.440
that seemed to sort of transmit

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.180
some kind of influence to Bob's spin, 
to make sure that it was spin down.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.500
Alice could equally
 have measured her electron

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.700
and found that it had spin down, 
in which case Bob's would be spin up.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.700
So, there seemed to be this - what Einstein called
 "a spooky action at a distance" - implied...

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.680
by Bohr's idea
 of Quantum Mechanics.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.620
Einstein and two colleagues,
Podolsky and Rosen,

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.740
suggested in 1935 that, actually, 
there has to be some alternative to this,

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.680
because "spooky action at a distance"

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.600
shouldn't be allowed in Physics.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.100
Einstein had showed that it is impossible
 for any signal, any information

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.540
to be transmitted faster than light.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.340
And so, you can't have
this instantaneous "action at a distance".

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.100
There has to be some time
 for a signal to span the distance.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.720
And so, Einstein suggested that,
what must be going on instead,...

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.660
is that, all along,

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.160
these two electrons

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.600
had some property
 that somehow fixed their spins already.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.760
It's just that it was a property
that we couldn't measure.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.780
He called them "hidden variables".

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:47.340
So you couldn't find out,
in any experiment, which of the 2 possible spins...

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.300
Alice's electron had as it was going towards her,
but, nevertheless, it was fixed.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.140
And so, that then reduces the situation to being
like the left-handed and the right-handed glove,...

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.080
which were left-handed and right-handed
 all along, in transit.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.960
So, there were
 these 2 possibilities

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.340
for what entanglement was about,
Bohr's view and Einstein's view.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.880
The trouble was,

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.720
there was no obvious way
 of distinguishing between them,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.920
because they both
predicted the same outcome,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.380
which was that we would measure
— or Alice and Bob would measure —

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.680
that there are
 these correlations that exist

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.140
between the spins
 of the 2 entangled electrons.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.740
How do we know if that's due to hidden variables,
 or due to something else,

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.080
that Bohr was suggesting?

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.200
That changed in 1964, 
when the Irish physicist, John Bell,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.060
suggested an experiment.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.160
It was...  In that case, at that stage,
 it was just a thought experiment

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.640
that he said 
would allow us to distinguish

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.880
between these 2 possibilities.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.040
And it's John Bell's experiment

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.300
that these boxes,
 these quantum boxes, are mimicking.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.600
Personally, I've never seen
an explanation of John Bell's experiment

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.280
that is at all easy to follow.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.160
So, instead of trying to
explain John Bell's experiment,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.160
that's what these boxes are for.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.840
So, here's how
 this box analogy works.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.280
There are these 2 boxes.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.980
They are machines,
slot machines,

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.480
into which you can put a coin
 and get out a toy.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.320
So you can put it in either...   they will take
 either 1-pound coins or 2-pound coins.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.160
And out will come

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.100
one of 2 types of toy, 
either a rabbit or a dog.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.860
And there are particular rules
 for each kind of machine,

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.060
so that if you put in...   that will tell you,
 if you put in a certain coin,...

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.240
then you will get out a
certain animal, OK?

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.240
We have to

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.560
figure out

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.920
combinations of which coins
 give which kind of animals,

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.360
in order to satisfy 3 rules.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.440
And I'm just going
 to POSTULATE these rules.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.860
But, of course, they've actually
 been carefully chosen

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.920
so that they replicate
the kind of situation

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.220
that Quantum Mechanics imposes
in John Bell's experiment.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.900
And the rules go as follows.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.840
The first rule is very simple,

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.300
that if Alice puts in
 a 1-pound coin into her box,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.560
it will spit out a rabbit.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.880
The second rule is that,
if both Bob and Alice

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.120
put in 2-pound coins
into their boxes,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.820
then the boxes will produce
1 rabbit and 1 dog.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:30.100
And it doesn't matter
which way 'round that is, but they will have
that combination.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.740
The third rule is that
any other combination of coins,

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.020
other than two 2-pound coins,..

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.740
will produce
 either 2 rabbits or 2 dogs.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.960
So we have to find
inputs and outputs

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.260
that satisfy these 3 rules.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.580
So what can they be?
Well, let's work through them.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:55.800
We know already what the output of Alice's box
 has to be if she puts in a 1-pound coin.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.060
It has to be a rabbit. 
That's the first rule.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.200
Now, when we think about it,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.140
this means that,
 no matter which coin,

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.420
- whether a 1-pound or 2-pound -
Bob puts into his box,

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.460
it has to produce also a rabbit.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.920
That's because,

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.480
if Alice has produced
 a rabbit with 1 pound,

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.580
then

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.060
the only way
 we can get a dog

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.480
is that   
if they both put in 2 pounds.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.040
So Alice already put in 1 pound.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.340
So, Bob's box has to produce a rabbit
 in both of those cases,

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.940
with a 1-pound
 or a 2-pound.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.260
So, we've almost

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.600
already figured out
 what our rules have to be.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:40.240
So, all we need to figure out now is
 what a 2-pound coin in Alice's box will produce.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.020
Well, let's think about it.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.200
If she puts in a 2-pound,
Bob puts in a 2-pound, too.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.520
We've also got the second rule, 
which says that

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.880
two 2-pound coins have to produce
a rabbit and a dog.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.760
So that must mean
 that a 2-pound in Alice's box produces a dog.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.060
And then we've satisfied
the second rule.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.660
The trouble with that

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.780
is that those [outputs]
inputs and outputs

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.480
violate the rules
in another case.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.920
Because for a 1-pound
and a 2-pound,

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.920
we've got this combination
of rabbit and dog.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.120
But we're only meant to get that
if they both put in 2 pounds.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.620
So in one time,
 out of the 4 possible permutations,

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.600
the rules are violated.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.040
And no matter
how you try and do this,

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.880
no matter how you try
 and think of different combinations,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.200
you will find that you can never do better
 than 3 times out of 4.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.960
Now, if you think
 that you have found a solution

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.720
that satisfies these 3 rules
 all the time, in all 4 cases,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.540
it's probably that you've come up
 with a solution like this one.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.040
A solution in which, let's say,

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.420
Alice's box
alters its output

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.020
depending on
 which coin Bob put in.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.040
There is no physical way,
if these boxes are unconnected

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.120
— there is nothing
 that passes between them —

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.120
there is no physical way
 in which we can build a machine

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.980
hat does that, that somehow
 magically or telepathically knows

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.980
what the other person
 has put in into their box.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.660
So that's not going to work.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.980
However, there is a way

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:18.020
that we can allow that to happen,
 which is that we produce

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.560
a physical connection

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.740
between the boxes,
 that sends a signal between them.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.260
So that

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.200
So that Bob's box, for example,

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.540
receives a signal telling it
 what Alice has put into her box.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.840
And then it might
alter its output accordingly.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.340
It's perfectly possible
 to produce a mechanism like that.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.540
The trouble with that
 is that Bob has to wait

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.400
until the signal
is received from Alice's box,

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.460
or until she's put in her coin
and the signal has been sent.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.380
He has to wait
 until that's happened

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.540
before he puts in his coin,
 so that his box knows what to do.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.080
That takes some
finite amount of time.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.600
Even if the signal is travelling
at the speed of light,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.940
it's still going to take
some time to get there.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.740
So,

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.580
that's not going to work

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.240
if we're trying
 to make boxes that satisfy

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.360
these rules instantaneously,
when Bob and Alice

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.100
put in their coins
 at exactly the same moment.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.980
We want an instantaneous solution
 to this problem.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.960
So that's
 never going to happen!

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.140
At least, it's never going to
happen for classical boxes.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.300
If these are quantum boxes,

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.520
if we allow them this property
of quantum entanglement,

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.820
so that the {2 boxes can be...}
their inputs and outputs

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.800
can be correlated in some way,

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.900
then,...we can do better.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.880
And in fact, we know exactly
 how much better we can do,

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.780
because the laws of
quantum mechanics,

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.200
— the rules, 
the mathematical equations —

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.580
allow us to calculate
 exactly how much more often

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.740
we can satisfy the...the 4 rules,
compared to the classical case.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:58.400
So, in the classical case, we can only get...
get it 3 times out of 4, 75% success rate.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:04.280
Quantum Mechanics tells you
that you can get roughly 85% success rate.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.640
And why...   why 85?

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.100
Well, that is...   is just a number
that the equations give you.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.634
It's actually, 
more precisely, it's, ahh,...

00:13:11.634 --> 00:13:13.550
it's a number that involves
the square root of two.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.300
We don't need to worry about that.
It's just approximately 85%.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.280
But I will come back
to why 85% later.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.240
So, Quantum Mechanics allows you to do better
 if these two boxes are entangled.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.200
And this is really
what Bell's experiment

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.360
was allowing you to do.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.920
You did
 the equivalent measurement

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.140
with 2 particles
that were entangled.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.980
And Bob and Alice
 were making measurements,

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.140
making choices about 
how they make those measurements,

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.900
and seeing how strong
 the correlation was between them.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.840
According to Classical Physics,
 you could only get a 75% correlation.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.800
But the same was true,
John Bell showed,

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.400
of Einstein's hidden variables.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.880
It was only if Quantum Mechanics
 went beyond that,

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.940
as Bohr suggested it did,

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.600
that you could do better,
 and get 85%.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.560
Well, as I say, this was
 just a thought experiment for John Bell.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.240
But very soon, physicists realised
 that you could do it for real.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.560
You could create 2 entangled particles
 and make the measurements.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.920
And this was done.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:18.580
It was first done in the 1970s,
and then, more definitively, in the 1980s.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.820
And since then, it's been done many, many times,
 in many, many different ways.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.240
Every single time, 
the result has been very clear.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.420
The classical limit,
 or the hidden variables limit

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.340
of 75% correlation between the particles
 is always exceeded.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.960
You get this 85% success.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.760
And so, this suggests
that Einstein's idea

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.920
that there are these things
called hidden variables,

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.160
which fix the properties
of quantum particles

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.720
before they're measured,
this doesn't apply.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.360
It seems that Bohr was right.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.900
Now,...

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.400
this doesn't imply, 
as you might sometimes hear,

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.400
that there really is
 some "spooky action at a distance".

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.620
Many times, when experiments
like this have been done,

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.880
the newspaper headlines
have proclaimed

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.300
that Einstein is proven wrong,

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.600
and "spooky action at a distance" is real.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:15.480
Spooky action at a distance was 
what Einstein's interpretation of entanglement involved.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.280
But, actually, it is a better way
 to think about entanglement

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.600
to say something
 a little different.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.400
And one way to think about it is to say that,
 once the 2 boxes become entangled,

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.140
they are no longer
 separate objects!

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.400
So that what happens over here

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.380
is completely independent
 of what happens over here.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.340
They are, in some quantum sense, 
the same object.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:41.260
And that remains the case,
 no matter how far apart they are.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.340
Even if the particles
 that you measure

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.000
were separated,
were on the opposite sides of the galaxy,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.220
they remain, in some sense,
a single quantum entity.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.540
Another way of thinking
 about that, is to say

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.940
that there is some kind
 of sharing of information between them.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:02.200
And this is really what Popescu and Rohrlich's
 quantum boxes were about.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:07.700
It was expressing this situation
in terms of a kind of sharing of information.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.600
Physicists call this
quantum nonlocality.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.280
And it's distinct
from this notion that, somehow,

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.600
making a measurement
 on this particle is transmitting information

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:26.080
— is transmitting a signal — to the other particle,
 to fix what the value of its property is.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.240
That doesn't happen.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.220
If it did happen, 
it would violate special relativity,

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.760
as Einstein suggested.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.112
But Quantum Mechanics
tells you something else.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.800
It tells you that there is this property,
 called quantum nonlocality,

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.120
which is very hard
 to find words for,

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.860
but that is a real property
 of the world.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:48.160
So, if you see headlines saying
"spooky action at a distance" is real, don't believe them.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.820
Now I want to come back,
 finally, to what

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.560
Popescu and Rohrlich
 were trying to do with their boxes.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.660
Because

00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:01.120
one physicist, ahh,...
Yakir Aharonov, suggested, umm...that…

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.220
…perhaps what we're seeing here,
 with this quantum nonlocality, is kind of

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:09.980
a stretching of the normal laws
 of cause and effect,

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.440
as far as 
special relativity will allow.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.860
umm... So that somehow,
 Quantum Mechanics is sort of…

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:23.420
…almost violating the spirit of special relativity, 
without violating it actually in practice,

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:27.020
without actually allowing you
 to transmit information faster than light.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.640
Perhaps Quantum Mechanics
 is doing this

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.000
you know, right up to the limit
 of what is physically possible.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.580
Well, Popescu and Rohrlich thought,

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.340
Let's see about that!

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.240
Can we imagine a case?

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.060
in which there is
 some kind of entanglement

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.480
that does better
 than Quantum Mechanics,

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.980
that does better than 85%?

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.200
And they thought about it, and they came up
 with this idea of these two boxes,

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.920
that, they showed,

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.020
could have a set of rules
 that, without violating special relativity,

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.320
allows you a 100% correlation.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.840
It's physically

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.440
breaking no laws, let's say,

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.380
Ahh... that we know of,
 to have a situation like this.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.540
A kind of...   if you like, a kind of
super-quantum correlation.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.980
And so the question becomes,
why isn't the world like this?

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.340
You see, we often think
about Quantum Mechanics…

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:22.680
as something sort of added on,
 or something different from Classical Mechanics.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.780
Classical Mechanics give you
 this sort of 75% success rate in this case.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.680
Quantum Mechanics
does something more.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.010
So we kind of think, you know,
where does that come from?

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.620
Why does Quantum Mechanics
allow you to do these things

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.816
that you can't do classically?

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.480
Popescu and Rohrlich

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.840
approached it
 from another angle.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:45.340
Because they showed, that actually things could be,
 even, if you like, MORE quantum than they are.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.120
And so why aren't they?

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.420
And so, that raises
a new question.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.440
If we could understand
why Quantum Mechanics is limited

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.400
in what quantum
nonlocality can do,

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.940
— limited to this 85% figure, instead of 100% —

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.120
if we could understand that, 
then maybe

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.300
we would understand
a little more

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:10.360
about why it is that the world
has these quantum properties

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.960
that it seems to have
 at the level of fundamental particles.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.940
If you still find this analogy
 a little bit confusing,

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.580
then probably
what you need to do

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:23.180
is to look it up in
my book, "Beyond Weird",

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.180
which talks
 about this and more, and goes

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.620
into more detail
 about what quantum entanglement

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.160
does and doesn't mean, 
and also about how

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.700
we're starting to make use of it
 in quantum technologies,

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.720
like quantum computing,
and quantum cryptography.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.140
And let me remind you,
 if you haven't already

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.520
subscribed to
 the Ri YouTube channel,

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.500
then you should do that.
