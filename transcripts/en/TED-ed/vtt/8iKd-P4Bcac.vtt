00:00:24.876 --> 00:00:28.321
A boy named Prince Tamino
runs through a dark wood

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:30.631
pursued by a dragon.

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.870
Just as it rears up to devour him,

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.190
three mysterious ladies appear

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.401
and slay the dragon 
with their fierce battle cry.

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:43.351
So begins Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's
"Die Zauberflöte,"

00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:47.122
or "The Magic Flute."

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:48.730
This fantasy singspiel,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.701
a type of folk opera with music
and dialogue,

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:56.011
premiered in 1791 in Vienna.

00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:58.412
Though it may seem 
like a childish fairytale,

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:02.212
this intricate opera is full of
subversive symbolism,

00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:07.032
and it's now regarded as one of the most
influential operas in history.

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:11.382
Tamino's run in with the dragon
is only the start of his journey.

00:01:11.382 --> 00:01:14.810
The three women summon their leader,
the Queen of the Night.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.551
She, in turn, sends Tamino on a quest
to rescue her daughter Pamina

00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:22.742
from the evil sorcerer, Sarastro.

00:01:22.742 --> 00:01:27.332
And to help him on his journey,
she gives him the titular magic flute.

00:01:27.332 --> 00:01:31.251
Tamino eventually finds Pamina
at Sarastro's temple,

00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:32.702
but behind enemy lines,

00:01:32.702 --> 00:01:36.623
Tamino and Pamina learn 
that they're on the wrong side.

00:01:36.623 --> 00:01:41.263
The Queen of Night actually wants
to plunge the world into darkness.

00:01:41.263 --> 00:01:43.932
Everything Tamino thought he knew
was wrong,

00:01:43.932 --> 00:01:46.612
filling him with doubt and confusion.

00:01:46.612 --> 00:01:50.132
So, a new quest begins for Tamino
and Pamina.

00:01:50.132 --> 00:01:52.082
They must pass three trials of wisdom,

00:01:52.082 --> 00:01:56.283
and only then can the day 
vanquish the night.

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:58.073
Helped by the flute's magic power,

00:01:58.073 --> 00:02:04.562
the two youths overcome these trials
and the Queen's attempts to sabotage them.

00:02:04.562 --> 00:02:09.653
They're finally initiated into the temple
having restored balance to the kingdom.

00:02:09.653 --> 00:02:12.073
Many elements in this peculiar fairytale

00:02:12.073 --> 00:02:16.173
were inspired by Mozart's involvement 
in Freemasonry,

00:02:16.173 --> 00:02:19.834
a network of fraternal organizations
throughout Europe.

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:23.965
Much of their history, symbolism,
and ritual came from the Middle Ages.

00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:26.023
But the Freemasons of Mozart's time

00:02:26.023 --> 00:02:30.262
were also influenced 
by 18th century European ideals -

00:02:30.262 --> 00:02:35.524
rationalism, humanism, and skepticism
towards traditional authorities,

00:02:35.524 --> 00:02:38.284
like monarchy and the church.

00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:41.734
The symbols of Freemasonry 
and these ideals of the Enlightenment

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:44.184
are found throughout the opera.

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:49.251
If this sounds like a conspiracy theory,
that's because it sort of was at the time,

00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:51.324
but it's now taken quite seriously

00:02:51.324 --> 00:02:55.408
and has been the subject of considerable
scholarly publication.

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:59.065
For example, some Mozart scholars
believe the Queen of the Night

00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:04.576
symbolizes Maria Theresa,
the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire

00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:08.794
who opposed Freemasonry
and banned it in Austria.

00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:11.815
While there continues to be debate
as to the specific meaning,

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:12.902
interpretation,

00:03:12.902 --> 00:03:15.525
and location of these masonic references,

00:03:15.525 --> 00:03:20.495
scholars agree that they're there
and are fully intentional.

00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:23.055
One of these symbols is the number three,

00:03:23.055 --> 00:03:27.051
which represented balance and order
to Freemasons.

00:03:27.051 --> 00:03:31.603
Now the number three is, of course,
easy to find in any work of storytelling,

00:03:31.603 --> 00:03:34.973
but it's particularly prominent
in "The Magic Flute":

00:03:34.973 --> 00:03:36.095
three trials,

00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:37.153
three ladies,

00:03:37.153 --> 00:03:38.457
three spirits,

00:03:38.457 --> 00:03:40.265
and three doors,

00:03:40.265 --> 00:03:43.107
much of the music 
is written in E-flat major,

00:03:43.107 --> 00:03:46.856
which has three flats 
in its key signature,

00:03:46.856 --> 00:03:51.527
and historically, masonic rituals
began with three knocks.

00:03:51.527 --> 00:03:55.570
The opera references them by opening
with three majestic chords

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.419
complete with dramatic pauses.

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.346
Those chords, which reoccur 
throughout the opera,

00:04:01.346 --> 00:04:03.378
serve another purpose.

00:04:03.378 --> 00:04:07.307
They capture the dramatic 
arc of the opera in miniature.

00:04:07.307 --> 00:04:12.148
The first chord, E-flat major,
is in its most natural root position,

00:04:12.148 --> 00:04:14.459
simple and unadorned.

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.720
It echoes the child-like Prince Tamino,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.570
who, in his naiveté, accepts everything
the Queen and her ladies say

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.490
without question.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.929
The second chord is C minor,

00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:28.870
a sour sonority that mirrors Tamino's 
sadness and doubt

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.650
in the middle of the opera.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.900
That's when his world and notions of
good and evil get turned on their heads.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.647
And good and evil are just two of the
opera's extreme opposites.

00:04:39.647 --> 00:04:44.041
It features some of the highest
and lowest notes in opera,

00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:45.603
day and night,

00:04:45.603 --> 00:04:50.110
simple hummable melodies
and complicated forward-looking music.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.351
The opera's central theme concerns
balancing these extremes

00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:56.775
to achieve perfect harmony.

00:04:56.775 --> 00:04:57.801
To reflect this,

00:04:57.801 --> 00:05:01.570
the final chord in the opening
restores musical order.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.291
It returns to the triumphant E-flat major,

00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:08.494
the same chord it started with
but inverted,

00:05:08.494 --> 00:05:12.130
meaning Mozart moved the bottom note
to the top.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.893
Although it retains its original harmony,
the chord sounds higher,

00:05:15.893 --> 00:05:17.892
pointing towards enlightenment.

00:05:17.892 --> 00:05:19.963
That's similar to Tamino,

00:05:19.963 --> 00:05:23.811
who in passing his trials restores balance
to the kingdom

00:05:23.811 --> 00:05:27.572
while growing stronger, wiser,
and more complete.
