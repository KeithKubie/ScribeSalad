okay so to start off with shale gas it

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:12.379
okay so to start off with shale gas it
 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.109
okay so to start off with shale gas it
is very easy if you live here in

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:14.119
is very easy if you live here in
 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:15.910
is very easy if you live here in
southwestern Pennsylvania to think that

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920
southwestern Pennsylvania to think that
 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.950
southwestern Pennsylvania to think that
we are the center of the world on shale

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960
we are the center of the world on shale
 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.019
we are the center of the world on shale
gas but I wanted to start with telling

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029
gas but I wanted to start with telling
 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.269
gas but I wanted to start with telling
you that we're not shale gas is a global

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279
you that we're not shale gas is a global
 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.220
you that we're not shale gas is a global
phenomena and this is an image just to

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230
phenomena and this is an image just to
 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.290
phenomena and this is an image just to
show you some of the resources in shale

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300
show you some of the resources in shale
 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.660
show you some of the resources in shale
gas that we know about the very light

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670
gas that we know about the very light
 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.429
gas that we know about the very light
gray are areas in the world where we

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439
gray are areas in the world where we
 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.710
gray are areas in the world where we
just don't know so just about everywhere

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720
just don't know so just about everywhere
 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.840
just don't know so just about everywhere
we've looked indeed we do have shale gas

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850
we've looked indeed we do have shale gas
 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.090
we've looked indeed we do have shale gas
resources I will not say the words game

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100
resources I will not say the words game
 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.130
resources I will not say the words game
changer I will leave that to all of the

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140
changer I will leave that to all of the
 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.290
changer I will leave that to all of the
folks on the economic side but there is

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300
folks on the economic side but there is
 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.540
folks on the economic side but there is
a major resource in shale gas on the

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550
a major resource in shale gas on the
 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.880
a major resource in shale gas on the
planet and that is likely to change how

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890
planet and that is likely to change how
 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.819
planet and that is likely to change how
we deal with our energy resources and in

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829
we deal with our energy resources and in
 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.160
we deal with our energy resources and in
case you were unaware there's a lot of

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170
case you were unaware there's a lot of
 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.729
case you were unaware there's a lot of
water on the planet to just about

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739
water on the planet to just about
 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.189
water on the planet to just about
everywhere on the planet and if you look

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199
everywhere on the planet and if you look
 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.590
everywhere on the planet and if you look
at the world from space mostly you see

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600
at the world from space mostly you see
 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.389
at the world from space mostly you see
water but I'm here to tell you that all

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399
water but I'm here to tell you that all
 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.160
water but I'm here to tell you that all
that green stuff there's water

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170
that green stuff there's water
 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.770
that green stuff there's water
underneath that so almost everywhere

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780
underneath that so almost everywhere
 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.749
underneath that so almost everywhere
that you find shale you're also going to

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759
that you find shale you're also going to
 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.540
that you find shale you're also going to
find water what this means is that our

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550
find water what this means is that our
 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.789
find water what this means is that our
water resources and our shale resources

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799
water resources and our shale resources
 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.780
water resources and our shale resources
in fact all of our energy resources are

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790
in fact all of our energy resources are
 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.760
in fact all of our energy resources are
co-located on the planet so shale gas

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770
co-located on the planet so shale gas
 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.190
co-located on the planet so shale gas
extraction is of course going to happen

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200
extraction is of course going to happen
 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.640
extraction is of course going to happen
near water everything happens near water

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650
near water everything happens near water
 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.950
near water everything happens near water
we're up here on the surface of the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960
we're up here on the surface of the
 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.890
we're up here on the surface of the
earth those tiny little bitty things you

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900
earth those tiny little bitty things you
 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.870
earth those tiny little bitty things you
can barely see the people I drew in here

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880
can barely see the people I drew in here
 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.679
can barely see the people I drew in here
that's us okay shale gas extraction

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689
that's us okay shale gas extraction
 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.149
that's us okay shale gas extraction
starts on the surface of the earth but

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159
starts on the surface of the earth but
 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.249
starts on the surface of the earth but
then of course we have to go down down

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259
then of course we have to go down down
 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.690
then of course we have to go down down
down down down down down down down down

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700
down down down down down down down down
 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.910

down all the way down to where the shale
is drill through all of these layers of

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009
is drill through all of these layers of
 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.240
is drill through all of these layers of
earth through that tiny little sliver up

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250
earth through that tiny little sliver up
 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.490
earth through that tiny little sliver up
here that is the aquifer from which

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500
here that is the aquifer from which
 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.170
here that is the aquifer from which
you're receiving a lot of your drinking

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180
you're receiving a lot of your drinking
 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.359
you're receiving a lot of your drinking
water we have to go through all of those

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369
water we have to go through all of those
 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.480
water we have to go through all of those
resources to get to the shale we drill

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490
resources to get to the shale we drill
 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.060
resources to get to the shale we drill
through and we send water down through

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070
through and we send water down through
 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.280
through and we send water down through
in order to hydraulically fracture the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290
in order to hydraulically fracture the
 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.230
in order to hydraulically fracture the
shale which is break the shell into

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240
shale which is break the shell into
 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.090
shale which is break the shell into
little bitty pieces so that the gas

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100
little bitty pieces so that the gas
 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.120
little bitty pieces so that the gas
flows back to the surface what that

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130
flows back to the surface what that
 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.220
flows back to the surface what that
means is that when you do this kind of

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230
means is that when you do this kind of
 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.259
means is that when you do this kind of
development it's critically important

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269
development it's critically important
 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.060
development it's critically important
that you protect the surface water from

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070
that you protect the surface water from
 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.220
that you protect the surface water from
spills of the chemicals that we use in

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230
spills of the chemicals that we use in
 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.870
spills of the chemicals that we use in
this operation and of the water that

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880
this operation and of the water that
 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.390
this operation and of the water that
comes back

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400
comes back
 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.580
comes back
to the surface that is hardly surprising

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590
to the surface that is hardly surprising
 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.520
to the surface that is hardly surprising
there are no industries really where you

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530
there are no industries really where you
 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.199
there are no industries really where you
wouldn't say there's a potential for

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209
wouldn't say there's a potential for
 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.770
wouldn't say there's a potential for
something affecting our water resources

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780
something affecting our water resources
 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.630
something affecting our water resources
it's also critical that we isolate

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640
it's also critical that we isolate
 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.759
it's also critical that we isolate
groundwater from this drilling activity

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769
groundwater from this drilling activity
 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.229

the time that the gas is coming up we
 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.140
the time that the gas is coming up we
get water that kind of looks like this

I'm here to tell you that it's a lot
 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.830
I'm here to tell you that it's a lot

city so about the same water use of a
midsize city in the United States it's

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940
midsize city in the United States it's
 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.120
midsize city in the United States it's
not a lot of water what tends to matter

this out of Aetna during flooding we're

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:06.980
this out of Aetna during flooding we're
 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.540
this out of Aetna during flooding we're
all okay with that how much waste water

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550
all okay with that how much waste water
 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.700
all okay with that how much waste water
last thing I want to talk about is what

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710
last thing I want to talk about is what
 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.710
last thing I want to talk about is what
happens to all of that produced water so

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720
happens to all of that produced water so
 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.390
happens to all of that produced water so
this is some analysis my group has done

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400
this is some analysis my group has done

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.060
with a sharp increase in Marcellus Shale
drilling we saw a significant increase

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.070
drilling we saw a significant increase
 

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.460

the Marcellus Shale formation but you

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039
the Marcellus Shale formation but you
 

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:08.560
the Marcellus Shale formation but you
still see now that we know the

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:08.570
still see now that we know the
 

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.990
still see now that we know the
conventional from the Marcellus so this

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000
conventional from the Marcellus so this
 

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.180
conventional from the Marcellus so this
dark blue down here looks kind of a lot

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:13.190
dark blue down here looks kind of a lot
 

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.940

like it's looked forever right so sorry

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:15.950
like it's looked forever right so sorry
 

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.860
like it's looked forever right so sorry
about that again so our produced water

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:17.870
about that again so our produced water
 

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.990
about that again so our produced water
levels from conventional have stayed

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000
levels from conventional have stayed
 

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.879
levels from conventional have stayed
about the same but the Marcellus

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:21.889
about the same but the Marcellus
 

00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:23.920
about the same but the Marcellus

with about twice as much as conventional

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:28.190
with about twice as much as conventional
 

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.010
with about twice as much as conventional
in 2010 and about three times as much as

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.399
in 2010 and about three times as much as
conventional in 2011 so what's the story

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:33.409
conventional in 2011 so what's the story
 

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.620
conventional in 2011 so what's the story

withdrawals it's not too much water but
 

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.240
withdrawals it's not too much water but
you have to be careful about where

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.250
you have to be careful about where
