00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.835
What we're going to do in this
video is take the function y

00:00:03.835 --> 00:00:07.460
is equal to the cube
root of x and then rotate

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.970
this around the x-axis.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.986
And if we do that, we
get a solid of revolution

00:00:11.986 --> 00:00:12.860
that looks like that.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.880
And we're doing it between x is
equal to 0 and x is equal to 8.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.030
And you get something
that looks like this.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.190
And you could find the
volume of this actually

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.162
quite easily using
the disk method.

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:25.620
But just to show you that you
could do it an alternate way,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.530
we're going to use
the shell method.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.321
But we're going to use
the shell method now

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:32.630
to rotate around a horizontal
line, and specifically

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.510
the x-axis.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.660
So how would we do this?

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.360
Well, what we want to do,
what you could imagine,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.360
is constructing a rectangle
that looks like this.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.580
Let me do it in
this salmon color.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.070
So you have a rectangle that
looks something like that.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.650
Its depth or its height,
you could say, is dy.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.180
And then its length
right over here

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.780
is going to be 8 minus
whatever x value this is.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.780
Let me make this clear.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.580
The width is going to
be 8 minus whatever

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.119
x value this is right over here.

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.660
And you might already realize
that if this is going to be dy,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.826
we're going to be integrating
with respect to y over

00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:21.420
an interval of y.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.530
And so we really want to have
everything in terms of y.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.520
So this x value, whatever
it is, as a function of y.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.580
So if y is equal to
the cube root of x,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.320
we can cube both
sides, and we can

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.410
get x is equal to y
to the third power.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.540
These are equivalent
statements right over here.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.110
And so, this distance right over
here is going to be 8 minus y

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.980
to the third, if we were to
express it in terms of y.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.005
And then when you rotate
that thing around the x-axis,

00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:53.910
it's going to construct
the outside of the cylinder

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.370
or shell, as we like to call it.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.720
And I'll try my best
to draw that shell.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.560
So it will look
something like this.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:13.250
So you're going to have a
shell that looks like this.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.180
And there you go.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.510
And actually, this shares
a common boundary right

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.610
over here.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.350
So you're going to have a shell
that looks something like that.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.080
So that hopefully
helps a little bit.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.163
Let me give it some depth.

00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:27.320
You'll have a shell that
looks something like that.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.500
If we could figure out
the volume of that shell,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.600
which is really going to be
the area of the outer surface

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.290
area times the depth.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.090
And then if we were to sum
up all of those shells,

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.730
this shell is for a
particular y in our interval.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.730
If we were to sum up over all
of the y's in our interval,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.560
all the volumes of
the shells, then we

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.770
have the volume of this figure.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.330
So once again, how do we figure
out the volume of a shell?

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.280
Well, we can figure
out the circumference

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.900
of I guess the left or the
right, in this case-- the left

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.774
or the right of our cylinder.

00:03:02.774 --> 00:03:04.440
If we can figure out
that circumference,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.720
that circumference is equal
to 2 pi times the radius.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.360
And what is the radius?

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.990
The radius of these things are
just going to be your y value.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.020
That's this distance
right over here.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.580
That's just going
to be the y value.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.590
So it's going to be
equal to 2 pi times y.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.040
And then if we want the
area of the outer surface,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.300
we just multiply
the circumference

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.260
times the width of our cylinder.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.300
So let me write it over here.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:46.720
So outer surface area is
going to be equal to our 2 pi

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.675
y times our 8 minus
y to the third.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.840
8 minus y to the third
is just this length.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.423
You multiply that
times circumference.

00:03:59.423 --> 00:04:01.180
You get the outer surface area.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.370
Now, if you want to find the
volume of this one shell,

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.830
it's going to be the
outer surface area.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.780
2 pi y times 8 minus y to
the third times the depth,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.130
times this dy right over here.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.290
I'll do the dy in purple.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.860
So that's the
volume of one shell.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.440
If we want to find the volume of
the entire solid of revolution,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.132
we have to sum all these up
and then take the limit as they

00:04:31.132 --> 00:04:32.590
become infinitely
thin, and we have

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.550
an infinite number
of these shells.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.690
So we're going to take the
sum from, and remember,

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.790
we're dealing in y.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.220
So the volume is
going to be equal to,

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.170
so what's our interval
in terms of y?

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.900
So y definitely starts off at
0, and when x is equal to 8,

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.040
what is y?

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.280
Well, 8 to the 1/3
power is just 2.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.020
So y is 2, this value
right over here.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.520
Let me make it a
little bit clearer.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.140
This value right over here is 2.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.700
So y goes from 0 to 2, and
we've set up our integral.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.450
And this one looks
pretty straightforward.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.491
So I think we can crank
through it in this video.

00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:08.140
So this is going to be equal
to, we can take out the 2 pi,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.630
2 pi times the definite
integral from 0 to 2.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.910
Let's multiply the y of
8y minus y to the fourth.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.285
All of that dy.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.680
This is going to be equal to
2 pi times the anti-derivative

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.960
of this business.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.510
Anti-derivative of
8y is 4y squared.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.310
Anti-derivative of 1
negative y to the fourth

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.960
is negative y to
the fifth over 5.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.910
And we're going to
evaluate it at 0 and 2.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.455
So this is going to be
equal to 2 pi times,

00:05:51.455 --> 00:05:56.884
we evaluate this business at 2,
2 squared is 4 times 4 is 16.

00:05:56.884 --> 00:06:03.320
16 minus 2 to the fifth is 32.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.200
So minus 32/5.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.100
And then, you evaluate this
stuff at 0, you just get the 0.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.980
So that's what we're left with.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.800
And now, we just
have to simplify

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.080
this thing a little bit.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.720
So let's see.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.630
16 over 5, this part
right over here.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.650
16 is the same thing,
I should say, as 80/5.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.580
And from that, we
are subtracting 32/5.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.150
And so, that is equal to 48/5.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.787
So all of this business
is equal to 48/5.

00:06:38.787 --> 00:06:39.620
Did I do that right?

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.470
80 minus 30 is 50, and then
minus another 2 gets us to 48.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.880
So this is 48/5 times 2 pi.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.920
And now we deserve
our drum roll.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.100
48 times 2 is 96.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.610
Let me do this in
a new color, just

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.720
to emphasize that
we're at the end.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.502
48 times 2 is 96
times pi over 5.

00:06:58.502 --> 00:07:00.210
So once again, this
is something that you

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.870
could have solved using the
disk method in terms of x.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.380
And we're just showing that
you could also solve it

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.410
in the shell method
in terms of y.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.710
The shell or the hollowed
out cylinder method,

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.730
whatever you want to
call it, in terms of y.
