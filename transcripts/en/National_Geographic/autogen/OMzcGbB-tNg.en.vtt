curiosity about to land and it did it

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710
curiosity about to land and it did it
 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.120

became clear quite quite soon that this

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130
became clear quite quite soon that this
 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.370
became clear quite quite soon that this
was that they landed in a place that was

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380
was that they landed in a place that was
 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.440
was that they landed in a place that was
very different than other landing sites

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450
very different than other landing sites
 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.190

previously they found pebbles that were
 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.080
previously they found pebbles that were
very interesting because they seemed to

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090
very interesting because they seemed to
 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.300

rocks that that did the same and then

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470
rocks that that did the same and then
 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.140
rocks that that did the same and then
also they were there was the proximity

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150
also they were there was the proximity
 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.420
also they were there was the proximity
to what appeared to be a fossil stream

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430

all of which are kind of beyond cool

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169
all of which are kind of beyond cool

interested in Mars uh so and and the
 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.580

mountain in the middle of the crater but
 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.530
mountain in the middle of the crater but
they decided against that and decided

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540
they decided against that and decided
 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.140
they decided against that and decided
instead to take a detour to what turned

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150
instead to take a detour to what turned
 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.780

out to be named Yellowknife Bay now look

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790
out to be named Yellowknife Bay now look
 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.830
out to be named Yellowknife Bay now look
at this what does that look like a

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840
at this what does that look like a
 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.080
at this what does that look like a
dried-up lake right what do you think it

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090
dried-up lake right what do you think it
 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.040
dried-up lake right what do you think it
was a dried-up lake you know that's kind

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050
was a dried-up lake you know that's kind
 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.330

of the conclusion that they came to

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340
of the conclusion that they came to
 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.790
of the conclusion that they came to
probably nothing like this has ever been

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800
probably nothing like this has ever been
 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.620
probably nothing like this has ever been
seen on Mars before or any other planet

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630
seen on Mars before or any other planet
 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.470
seen on Mars before or any other planet
outside of the earth and it is an

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480
outside of the earth and it is an
 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.250
outside of the earth and it is an
enormous breakthrough to your upper left

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260
enormous breakthrough to your upper left
 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.070
enormous breakthrough to your upper left
is Mount sharp and that is

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080
is Mount sharp and that is
 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.800
is Mount sharp and that is
where they didn't go but they will they

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810
where they didn't go but they will they
 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.980
where they didn't go but they will they
will go yeah because that's what the

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990
will go yeah because that's what the
 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.740
will go yeah because that's what the
program says you're supposed to go to

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750

all right now the red planet right you

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780
all right now the red planet right you
 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.869
all right now the red planet right you
know Mars the red planet every story

00:06:59.869 --> 00:06:59.879
know Mars the red planet every story
 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:02.270
know Mars the red planet every story
except for mine say the Red Planet I say

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280
except for mine say the Red Planet I say
 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.520

no it's not red it has Rouge on it this

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.530

this shows a rock that was run over by
 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.490
this shows a rock that was run over by
the rover and look what color it is

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500
the rover and look what color it is
 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.240
the rover and look what color it is
inside blueish grey and it turns out

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250
inside blueish grey and it turns out
 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.230
inside blueish grey and it turns out
that most of Mars is colors other than

kind of covers things so the Red Planet

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150
kind of covers things so the Red Planet
 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.110

I don't think so the blue green planet

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120
I don't think so the blue green planet
