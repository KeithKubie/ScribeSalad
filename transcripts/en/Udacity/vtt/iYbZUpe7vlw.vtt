00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's start off with this problem--let's pick a location to define

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a potential energy U to be equal to 0.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm going to choose just this line here, a place where the skier will land

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and where all of our heights are measured from just to make things nice and easy.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The first part of the problem, I want to figure out what the speed of the skier is

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
at this point right here when he finally just leaves ramp

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
because that is just a projectile motion problem, and we know how to do that from unit 2.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I want to figure out using energy techniques.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What his kinetic energy and therefore what his speed will be when he's leaving the ramp right here.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now, we know from conservation of energy that the skier's kinetic and potential energy

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
must add up to the same value in both his starting position here and when he's just leaving the ramp.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We can actually get rid one of these four variables already.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
At the beginning of the jump, the skier isn't moving yet, so we know his kinetic energy must be 0.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Doing a little Algebra, I find that his final kinetic energy should be equal to the difference

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
between his original potential energy and his final potential energy.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And doing a little algebra and plugging in the values we were given,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
we find that the skier's velocity is 40 m/s when he's leaving the ramp here.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now that I know the speed of the skier at the tip of the ramp,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I can now calculate using kinematics how far away from the ramp he will land.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Note that in the previous part of the problem, 40 m/s was what we called

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the final speed, and it was for that part.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It was what the skier's speed was at the end of the first part of the problem

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
when he was just on the tip of the ramp.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
But now, that 40 m/s is the original speed for the second part of the problem

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
when the skier is flying through the air.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
That's why I'm using this convention of calling this V0 now.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The first thing I'm going to do is break this original velocity

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
into x and y components based on this angle α.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And in doing so, I find that the original Vx is 34.64 m/s, and the original Vy is 20 m/s.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now, I'm going to use this kinematic equation to solve for the time t

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
when the skier lands on the ground and that's when his change in y would be -10 since 10 appeared

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and then he goes down to 0, a change of -10, and doing a little algebra, I write this quadratic equation.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Now, it doesn't look like I can factor this quadratic equation,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
so I'm going to have to use the quadratic formula.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And plugging these numbers into the quadratic equation,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I get two solutions, t=-0.45 s and t=4.45 s.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Now, what's the deal with this negative time one?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Well, if we look back at our graph, we can actually imagine

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the skier going backwards in time on his trajectory, prodopdopdop.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And he would actually intercept the y equal 0 line right about here.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Our solution is actually still correct. It's not quite what we're looking for in this problem.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Instead we're going to focus on this positive solution, t=4.45 s, and that sounds reasonable.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It sounds like it might take about 4.5 s for the skier to go in the air and land back on the ground.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Okay. Now, I'm going to use this equation to figure out how far in the x direction

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
the skier travels during that time he is in the air.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Now keep in mind there's no acceleration in the x direction so this term goes to 0,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and we are left with just Δx=V0x&lt;i&gt;t.&lt;/i&gt;

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And plugging in the numbers we were given, we got that the final change in x.

00:03:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The distance d that the skier lands away from the ramp is 154.1 m. If you got this answer, great work
