- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.
Bipedal, naked large-brained. Long the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.670
master of fire, tools and language. But
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.660
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.150
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.540
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.360
to exchange insights on who we are and how
we got here. An exploration made possible

- [Leslie] So, one thing that I sort of
noticed this afternoon is the number of

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.340
times some of my earlier workers have been
criticized and that's good, that's normal.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.210
It shows how the field is growing and
developing and building. And I've been

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.560
asked to talk about the evolution of human
life history patterns. And this is also a

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.630
reasonably new approach to study in human
evolution and we can understand a lot

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.010
about the evolution of the genus Homo by
looking at life history and by looking at

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.230
modern people. So basically, life history
is more than just looking at the evolution

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.190
of the physical body form. What it is is
looking at how we got to this body form.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.400
Life history is your tempo and mode of
growth and development. And if you look

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.580
across the primates, you'll find a variety
of different patterns. And if we delve a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.590
little bit into life history, as I said,
we can learn a tremendous amount about

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.730
ourselves. And it starts out in childhood.
You have a difference in the growth and

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.380
development pattern that's very obvious.
For example, chimpanzees all mature by the

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.740
time they're about 12 years old. For
humans it takes up until your late teens,

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:29.140
17, 18 years old. And our colleague, Barry
Bogan, has been very clear about the tempo

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.770
differences that you have if you compare a
chimpanzee with a human. The chimpanzee

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.560
graph there shows that you have a rapid
decline in the velocity of growth. A

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.780
relatively small plateau period, that's
the juvenile period. And then another

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.810
relatively rapid decline in how fast
you're growing. Humans are very different

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.760
in the corner. We have that same decline
in the velocity of growth but we have a

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.250
much longer plateau period where our
children are not growing very rapidly.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.450
And this is followed by the adolescent
growth spurt and then it falls off again.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.180
This pattern is very unique and it's very
important to our evolution. The last graph

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.140
is from the work of Kristin Hawkes who's
here in the audience. It shows you not

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.120
only do you have the difference in the
pattern of the growth but we also have a

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.910
very much longer longevity or life span.
Now what I find fascinating particularly

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.730
about the early childhood growth is that
it has a lot to do with the brain. We know

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.820
that humans have brain sizes about three
times the size of a chimpanzee and that

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:51.950
brain grows and develops at different
paces in the two species. Now in humans,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.760
as a child is growing, a very young child
with a huge head uses about 60% of the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:06.240
energy budget just to support that brain
size. And as we grow and our body begins

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.200
to grow, the brain growth slows down and
the energy balance tips. One of our

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:20.170
colleagues, Chris Kozawa, has come up with
I think is a brilliant look at the

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.420
relationship between this brain growth and
body growth. In these graphs, the red

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:32.460
line, one for males, the second graph for
females. The red shows the energy that the

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:39.600
brain takes as you move from birth up
through five years of age that is one of

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.700
the most energy expensive periods of brain
growth in childhood because of all the

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:52.530
mileazation that's going on and then it
drops off. The blue line is the velocity

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.620
of your somatic growth, your body growth.
So basically there's almost a perfect play

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:04.390
off between brain growth and somatic
growth. And this goes terribly long ways

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:10.340
to explaining why we have this extended
period of childhood that basically

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:16.240
correlates and is a necessary correlate in
energetic terms with the growth and

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.950
development of the large human brain
cells. Now we all may think this is fine

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:27.300
and good but it's actually not. So some of
our other colleagues from Switzerland,

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.350
Karin Isler and Carel van Schaik have
developed something they called the gray

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:40.450
ceiling. And what the importance of this
is you can just take so long in your

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.920
growth and development or you aren't going
to be able to replace your population

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:52.910
size. Now think in terms of dependent
childhood and if a child is dependent on a

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:58.150
mother for five years, six years, seven
years, she's going to come back into

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:03.350
fertility. You're going to extend that
inter birth interval. You aren't going to

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:10.210
be able to have enough surviving children
to replace your population from one

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.440
generation to another generation. Okay,
this is what they call the gray ceiling.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:22.210
And if you look at the graph here, there
is a lot of primates. The red dots are the

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.740
apes with the increasing brain size. And
what this shows is that with some of our

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:33.190
apes like the orangutans, the gorillas and
all, what they're arguing is they're

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:40.300
hitting the gray ceiling and the only way
to avoid that gray ceiling is to somehow

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.030
increase your reproductive output. Now if
we go back to that same little chart I

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:53.460
chose earlier, at the bottom is the period
of infancy. And in chimpanzees, infants

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.620
are dependent on their mother, they're
still nursing. They are four to four and a

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.320
half years old before they're weaned. In
humans, it's of course very much shorter

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.890
and this particular graph shows about two
years, it varies. But what the take home

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:15.480
message of this is is you can have twice
as many kids if you shorten that period of

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:21.360
infancy. And if you then shorten your
interval between birth. Now again you may

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.190
think this is fine, this is a good trick,
we've all developed it, but it has

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:31.430
tremendous problems. And I've got this
picture hanging in my office and whenever

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:38.210
I think I'm having a hard day I think of
her. Because what you have once you start

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:47.600
to double up this is you have a woman who
may be pregnant. The infant that she's

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:54.520
probably in the last stage of nursing and
a dependent kid. And she has to get the

00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:00.500
food to support her own large body weight,
her own large brain size, and to provide

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:07.540
all of the calories for the kids she's
nursing. She has to provide the food for

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.590
the young infant. Now this is very
different from what we see in the

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:19.910
chimpanzees or other apes where mothers
focus on one infant. And once the infant

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:25.660
has stopped nursing they will gather their
own food. There's very little energetic

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:31.650
involvement with the mother. Now this is a
huge paradox and this is where the

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:37.390
evolution of sharing and cooperation comes
in. And of course this is where we have

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:44.250
the grandmother hypothesis and the
argument that a lot of the extra resources

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:50.060
for the grandkids come from the
grandmother by provisioning the mother and

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:55.990
the kids. Now there's a number of other
arguments also that involved greater

00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:03.270
cooperation among all individuals in the
society, males as well as sibling care and

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:09.010
sibling cooperation. The take home message
is that once you begin to develop a large

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:14.180
brain size, you have growth and
development implications. And these growth

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:19.120
and development implications have
implications for the evolution of what we

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.920
would recognize as a human type of
cooperative social organization. Okay, the

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:31.740
big question is, can we tell when this all
happened in human evolution? And we'd like

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.900
to think, oh, this is a characteristic of
the root of the genus Homo, that's a

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:41.410
hypothesis. Now if we go back to the
evolutionary tree, we have one way into

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:47.100
this in terms of cooperation. And if we go
back to the gray ceiling and I know Burden

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:53.420
isn't going to like my brain size against
a million year graph. But if we put the

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:59.250
gray ceiling onto this and again what
Isler and van Schaik argue is that gray

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:05.440
ceiling is about 700 milliliters. Now of
course there is, you know, big ranges of

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:10.910
variation around this, but what's
interesting about this is this just about

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:18.870
divides our Homo erectus from the earlier
hominids. And if we put it on our

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:24.060
evolutionary tree here, it comes at this
very interesting time between two million

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:30.450
and one million years ago where you have a
proliferation of hominids, a variety of

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:38.840
different species, and you have this big
variation in the brain sizes that we have.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.920
Now as we've also heard, this time period
correlates with the radical change in

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:49.440
human adaptation. And particularly in
evidence for the precedence of animal

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:56.090
based tissues in the diet, it also
correlates again with our Turkana boy here

00:11:56.090 --> 00:12:01.710
and this general time period where you
have the evolution of what we call Homo

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:07.620
erectus. Now what's interesting about this
also is it also correlates with the time

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:14.320
period where hominids begin to move out of
Africa. So our question here is how much

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.920
does this cooperative behavior that we can
infer from the brain size and we can refer

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:26.700
from the life history really affect the
hominid's ability to adapt to a variety of

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:33.150
different habitats not only in Africa but
also throughout the world? Now the only

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:39.050
direct evidence we have for any type of
cooperation comes from the side of Dmanisi

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:46.040
and our friend here with no teeth. And I'm
sure it feels very familiar with the

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:52.250
argument that this individual must have
whatever you want to argue, been taken

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:57.880
care of. The message from this is we don't
really know how to recognize this

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:05.120
cooperation in the fossil record. It would
be very nice if we could. Now if we come

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.710
back to the fossils, is there any way from
the fossils we could tell what their tempo

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:16.320
of growth is? And in this case, one of our
colleagues, Chris Dean, has been working

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:22.570
on how to infer growth and development
from the formation of the teeth. I've been

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:27.640
very impressed by some recent work by
Chris and his colleague, Helen Livesidge

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:33.640
in London. Not on teeth this time in
particular, but on body size because what

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:40.040
Chris has done is sort of bracketed the
age of our Turkana boy at death to

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:45.940
somewhere between seven and eight years
old. Now what these graph show were really

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:53.010
startling to me because the green one is
stature. And the histogram is the stature

00:13:53.010 --> 00:14:00.360
of modern human kids who are between about
7 and 10 years old. The red line there is

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:06.310
the estimate for the Turkana boy. It's way
in excess of the stature that you would

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:13.760
expect. The blue is body mass or body
weight. Again way outside of what you

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.650
would expect in modern human kids. Now
what does this tell you about the growth

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:25.970
and development of the Turkana boy? If we
go back to Barry Bogan's figures, what

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:33.490
it's telling you is that the Turkana boy
was growing on a trend very much more

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:43.110
similar to the apes than to modern humans.
And if you look on the chart, in fact just

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:48.500
above age there on the chimp chart is
eight years old. And you've come out of

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:55.740
that plateau of slow growth velocity, the
individual would be then growing towards

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:02.460
his adult weight. In humans, it would be
still well within that plateau before that

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:09.830
growth explosion, that's the adolescent
growth spurt. Now this, to me, is very

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:15.440
convincing evidence that the Turkana boy
was not growing and developing on the

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:21.180
human pattern. Now what that would mean is
that it would reach maturity much more

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:28.080
rapidly than if it was growing on the
modern human sort of tempo and mode. Now

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:34.720
is there anything more we can tell? Your
eruption of teeth tends to still also

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:41.040
measure how long your growth period is.
And what's become very clear recently is

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:47.480
there's a tremendous amount of overlap not
only between living human tooth eruption

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:54.020
and tooth formation patterns and apes, but
also overlap in the fossil hominids. And

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:58.520
when it comes down to it, if you're
looking at tooth formation, your best

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:03.310
tooth in terms of distinguishing us
between the chimps and humans is your

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:08.920
third molar. But again the take home
message from this comes in the bottom

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:18.520
graph. And the blue line there is the
tooth development for your second premolar

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:24.670
and that's in the chimps, the red one is
in humans. The vertical lines are your

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:30.730
early Homo fossils. The green one is the
Turkana boy. And although the teeth are

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:35.610
developing at the very, very fast end of
modern humans and there's a tremendous

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:42.240
amount of variation, it's squarely within
the ape pattern as well. And if we're

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:49.680
going to argue about what the life history
patterns of some of these early Homo are,

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.470
basically we're talking about a much more
ape-like growth and development pattern

00:16:54.470 --> 00:17:00.180
than a human-like growth and development
pattern. Okay, the next questions comes in

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:07.860
is when did we start to grow and develop
as humans? And the first indication is

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:14.860
with Homo antecessor which is about a
million, not .9 million years old. The

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.940
teeth are still developing more rapidly
than ours, meaning they're developing more

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:24.570
rapidly. But the argument is made that the
first ones that are closer to modern

00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:31.300
humans than to the early Homo, the early
australopithecine pattern. And then as we

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:38.490
move up to the top at about a 160,000
years ago at the Moroccan side of Jebel

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:43.890
Irhoud and this is some of some John Jack
Hublin's and his group right there in the

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:50.780
fourth row, where you have a very modern
human growth and development pattern. Now

00:17:50.780 --> 00:18:01.140
what I want to do is sort of finish with
what is probably everybody's favorite

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:06.330
fossil and that's the neanderthals. And
they're a long way up the record from what

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.960
we're talking about in the evolution of
the genus Homo. But I think the lessons we

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:16.370
can learn from the neanderthal growth and
development, we can usefully bring down

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:22.380
the record and apply to some of the
australopithecines. Now neanderthals of

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:28.990
course are the alternatives to modern
humans. They have brain sizes that overlap

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:37.720
with ours. They are in the blue series of
Xes there. They lived in Europe during the

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:44.580
last ice age while anatomically modern
humans were evolving elsewhere in Africa.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:49.730
What, again, another piece of evidence
that struck me that comes out of Martin

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:55.640
Gonzales and some of his colleagues' work
from Spain is the growth and development

00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:01.910
of the little neanderthal kids. So the
blue lines here are your growth from not

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:09.070
years, up to 70 months. The horizontal
lines are the equivalently aged

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:15.260
neanderthals in relation to that modern
human growth pattern. So here you can say

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:21.580
the little neanderthals are basically
plateauing much earlier than you would see

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:27.350
in the human growth curve. Now think about
being a neanderthal. I'm often happy I

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:34.030
wasn't born a neanderthal because, you
know, what the authors are arguing here is

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:39.200
not only do they have the energetic stress
of growing and developing that large

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.400
human-like brain size, they also have a
serious thermoregulatory problem. Because

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:50.740
in fact with Steve Churchlin I've done
some modeling on the energetic

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:55.090
requirements in neanderthals and it's
about the same as to say somebody riding

00:19:55.090 --> 00:20:02.020
the Tour de France in the Alps. It's about
500 kilocalories a day. And you think of

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:07.730
these poor little neanderthals trying to
support that brain and also keep warm. Now

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:15.090
there is a second piece also that comes
from other research. This is from Smith et

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:23.680
al in 2010. And the green lines here are
your expected and predicted ages for human

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:29.360
teeth and the blue lines are the
neanderthals. The take home message is

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:37.500
their teeth are developing more rapidly so
they have a more attenuated growth and

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:43.810
development process. Now coming back to
this and where you would expect to say a

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:48.670
modern human populations to have more
rapid growth and development. It's in

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:54.150
situations where you have a higher
mortality rate. Now think about these poor

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:59.110
neanderthals, they have a very high
mortality rate, every three calistosis.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:05.570
It's the same as rodeo riders in the
southwest. And you have these poor little

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:13.570
stressed neanderthals with a shorter body
size. Now if we come back to all of our,

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:19.240
you know, fossil species, our
australopithecines and early Homo, living

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:25.580
in a period of very fluctuating climate in
Africa, and this little zig-zag chart is

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:30.890
just from East Africa, but also
experiencing all of these environments

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:35.750
around the world. What we really want to
know is what their growth and development

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:42.690
patterns are and how these reflect what's
happening in their lifestyle. And what I

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:50.580
tend to think is that the same processes
that affect us today were also affecting

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:56.210
them. And this is a huge challenge, it's
very exciting research and I think as soon

00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:01.400
as we're able to screw down into it, we're
going to find similar neanderthal-like

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:07.580
patterns among the hominids that are
living different types of lifestyles. To

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:14.240
end, I'd like to thank CARTA. We were all
having a great time here. And I'd

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.910
particularly like to thank all of the
attendees of a Wandergrand conference,

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:23.840
some of you are sitting in the audience
here, that we held on human biology and

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:30.730
the origins of Homo. And a lot of these
life history ideas were developed in a

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:35.338
week-long meeting in Portugal. So thank
you very much.
