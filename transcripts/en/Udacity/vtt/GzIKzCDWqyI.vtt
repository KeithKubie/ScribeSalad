00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If you look at the equations of the SIR model, the meaning of this constant

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in front of the I here is pretty clear.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This number of 5 days controls the infectious period of the disease,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but what about the first constant here that controls the rate of infection.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Assume that we're looking at a secluded small town with 1,000 inhabitants in total

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and assume that everyone meets 25 persons per day, and third, assume that the infection probability

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is 2% per contact, which number should be entered here.

00:00:33.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Just input that number.
