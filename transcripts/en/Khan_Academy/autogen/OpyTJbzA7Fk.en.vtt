00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
 Let's look at the molecular structure 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.393
 of triglycerides. 

00:00:07.483 --> 00:00:11.320
 In everyday language we often call them fat. 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.500
 We call triglycerides fat. 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.700
 Fat is a word from which people are afraid, 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.360
 but as we will see, fat is extremely important for life. 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.360
 Fats in liquid form are sometimes called oils. 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.920
 A more technical term for triglycerides 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.550
 is a word that you can hear 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.291
 in the Lekarski cabinet. 

00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:32.430
 Triglycerides are also called - 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.650
 I will write different parts in different colors. 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.520
 Triacylglycerol. 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.659
 Actually I like this name more, 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.489
 because it is very logical if we divide it into parts, 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.159
 triacylglycerol. 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.760
 Triglycerides are fat. 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.950
 When most people talk about fat, 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.160
 have in mind triglycerides. 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.490
 If you check your cholesterol 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.290
 or if your parents check your cholesterol, 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.090
 they will probably get a report on their triglycerides, 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.029
 in which the concentration was measured 

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:06.590
 of fat in their blood. 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.930
 Let's think about what triglyceride is. 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.499
 Here I have the molecules they build 

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:13.977
 a triglyceride. 

00:01:13.977 --> 00:01:18.479
 This molecule on the left is glycerol. 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.750
 I will paint it in the same blue, 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.129
 in which I wrote glycerol. 

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:25.649
 This is glycerol. 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.160
 On this side we see that we have three carbon chains. 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.830
 Each of these carbon atoms is connected 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.529
 with a hydroxyl group, a -OH group. 

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:33.960
 If you connect to a -ON group. 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.870
 you become alcohol, 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.090
 so that glycerol is alcohol. 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.520
 Sometimes it's called a triol. 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.690
 There are three hydroxyl groups here. 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.700
 And is considered a trivalent aliphatic alcohol. 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.300
 A trivalent aliphatic alcohol. 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.800
 We see why there is alcohol, there are hydroxyl groups. 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.892
 It's also cute. 

00:01:50.892 --> 00:01:53.459
 If you drink the solution on 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.050
 glycerol, it will be sweet. 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.480
 You may already have the word glycerol known to you 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.090
 from the famous Bush song - Glycerine (glycerin). 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.250
 Glycerin means glycerol. 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.360
 Glycerin. 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.830
 ♫ Glycerine ♫ 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.019
 So here's glycerol. 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.560
 Triglyceride occurs when the molecule is glycerol 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.330
 reacts with three molecules of fatty acids. 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.650
 These molecules on the left, 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.789
 each of which is fatty acid. 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:26.090
 Each is a fatty acid. 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.750
 It's a fatty acid, it's another fatty acid, 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.560
 and this is third. 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.460
 But why do we call them "fatty" 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.630
 and why - "heartburns"? 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.050
 Part of them consists 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.920
 of these large carbon chains. 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.960
 I have drawn these points because 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.670
 the number of carbon atoms may be different. 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.180
 They may be, 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.020
 according to my research, 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.990
 more than 20 carbon atoms. 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.760
 In most biological systems they have 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.760
 even number. 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.050
 And most animals 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.232
 the number is from 16 to 20 carbon atoms. 

00:02:57.232 --> 00:03:00.220
 We're talking about 16, 18, 20 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.290
 carbon atoms constituting these fatty acids. 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.290
 Everyone I've painted has only single links. 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.400
 We have a maximum number of related hydrogen atoms to carbon. 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.860
 But there may also be double bonds. 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.720
 We will pay more attention to this when we talk about 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.420
 saturated and unsaturated fats. 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.630
 Here we have a carbon chain. 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.030
 This part is hydrophobic and will not dissolve in water. 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.976
 That's why it's called fat. 

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:27.630
 And on the left, 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.530
 or at least as I have painted it is on the left, 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.300
 we have a carboxyl group. 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.460
 This is a carboxyl group here. 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.600
 Carboxyl group. 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.760
 This group is acidic. 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.460
 It easily gives off hydrogen, 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.920
 releases hydrogen 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.660
 or more specifically a hydrogen proton. 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.760
 If this oxygen atom takes these electrons, 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.230
 the negative charge can be divided between 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.430
 this and this oxygen atom. 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.070
 Therefore, the carboxyl group very much wants to yield a hydrogen proton, 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.900
 making it acidic. 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.600
 And that's where "acid" comes from. 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.220
 Fatty Acid. 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.760
 These three molecules 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.090
 should not be the same. 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.260
 This can have 18 carbon atoms. 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.900
 This one can have 16, 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.630
 and this may have 20. 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.360
 They can also have double bonds. 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.590
 They may be different. 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.350
 Thinking exactly how they together form a triglyceride. 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.600
 Like the 80's robot movies, like Voltron. 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.860
 What is happening 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.360
 is a process of organic chemistry - 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.800
 dehydration. 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.530
 We have a free e-pair 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.260
 at each of these oxygen atoms. 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.790
 These oxygen atoms are part of the hydroxyl groups. 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.130
 Let me draw it. 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.190
 We have a free e-pair here 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.750
 or actually two free electronic pairs. 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.860
 We have two free electronic pairs here. 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.470
 We have two free electronic pairs. 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.040
 If we imagine that 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.650
 the two molecules meet in the right way, 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.960
 this carbon here 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.620
 partial positive charge. 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.760
 There are three bonds with two oxygen atoms. 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.390
 Oxygen atoms are highly electronegative. 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.510
 And if that atom strikes that in the right way, 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.450
 these electrons can be used 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.550
 to form a bond with this carbon, 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.600
 which has a partial positive charge. 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.260
 When this happens, this connection can be destroyed. 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.878
 This oxygen says, "Okay, do you participate in another electronic couple?" 

00:05:18.878 --> 00:05:19.990
 "I'm tired of this." 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.190
 "I will take these electrons for myself" 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.760
 "or better yet, I will take them for myself" 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.160
 "and I will attract a hydrogen proton, or I will first draw a hydrogen proton." 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.370
 It can happen in different ways. 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.070
 "I will draw a hydrogen proton and become" 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.820
 "this compound here." 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.790
 "I will become a water molecule." 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.360
 This is a very simple description of the mechanism. 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.660
 You can go into more detail, 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.320
 when you are dealing with organic chemistry. 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.630
 And this can happen three times. 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.820
 It can happen again here. 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.670
 It can happen again here. 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.860
 This atom - 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.320
 Let's draw it in the same white color. 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.090
 This atom takes these electrons, 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.960
 who so much wants to go back and use them, 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.200
 to grab a hydrogen proton. 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.900
 It can be the other way. 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.000
 Maybe it first attracts a hydrogen proton 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.560
 and when it's gone, that oxygen comes. 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.970
 There are different ways in which it can happen, 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.560
 but that's the basic idea. 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.000
 The same happens for the third time down here. 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.640
 One of these free electronic pairs 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.630
 comes and forms a connection with this carbon atom. 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.160
 With the carbon atom in the carbonyl group, 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.130
 which is part of this carboxyl group. 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.460
 And again, 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.690
 this atom here can take these two electrons 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.220
 and share this electron pair with a hydrogen proton. 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.620
 Which again leads to the formation of an aqueous molecule, 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.180
 a water molecule is formed. 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.075
 Generally three water molecules are obtained. 

00:06:43.075 --> 00:06:44.830
 So it's called dehydration. 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.750
 We lose three molecules of water, 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.650
 to form these links. 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.790
 What will the molecule look like after all this has happened? 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.290
 Let him go down 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.760
 and approaching the picture. 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.530
 I'll go down. 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.560
 This green link - 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.220
 This green link, this is the curved green line here 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.420
 is this green link. 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.050
 This second green link 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.330
 is this green link. 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.120
 And this third green link is this green link. 

00:07:21.188 --> 00:07:23.091
 As I have painted the molecule now, 

00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:27.321
 none of these oxygen atoms has released its hydrogen atom. 

00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:28.821
 And this can happen before 

00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:30.611
 either after or simultaneously with the other processes we described. 

00:07:30.611 --> 00:07:32.990
 Chemistry is not a very pure science. 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.621
 But I could, if I want, to paint the hydrogen atoms here. 

00:07:41.774 --> 00:07:45.011
 I can draw hydrogen atoms. 

00:07:45.011 --> 00:07:47.881
 I can paint the hydrogen atoms here, 

00:07:47.881 --> 00:07:50.761
 then these will have a positive charge. 

00:07:50.761 --> 00:07:52.461
 These will have a positive charge. 

00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:55.701
 But you can imagine that 

00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:59.631
 these hydrogen protons become part of another water molecule 

00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:02.787
 and are cleaved from each of these oxygen atoms. 

00:08:02.787 --> 00:08:05.331
 Then we remain 

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.291
 this molecule here. 

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:14.830
 And remember, we get three molecules of water. 

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.920
 One, 

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.860
 two, 

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.401
 three water molecules. 

00:08:24.401 --> 00:08:26.420
 If we abstain from the water molecules around, 

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.720
 this molecule 

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.380
 is triglyceride. 

00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:31.451
 I'll write it again. 

00:08:31.451 --> 00:08:33.821
 I will write the more technical term, 

00:08:33.821 --> 00:08:37.231
 called 

00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:40.231
 triacylglycerol. 

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.661
 We know where "glycerol" comes from. 

00:08:45.661 --> 00:08:48.991
 There is this spine from 

00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:50.591
 glycerin or glycerol herein. 

00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:52.121
 What does "acyl" mean? 

00:08:52.121 --> 00:08:54.891
 Acyl is a functional group, 

00:08:54.891 --> 00:08:59.791
 in which a carbon atom is part of a carbonyl group. 

00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:03.721
 It may be connected to some kind of organic chain. 

00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:05.651
 Here, I will call it R. 

00:09:05.651 --> 00:09:08.621
 And it's also something else. 

00:09:08.621 --> 00:09:12.191
 And we have three acyl groups, from which comes triacyl. 

00:09:12.191 --> 00:09:15.961
 So this is an acyl group here. 

00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:18.491
 This is an acyl group here. 

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:20.011
 This is an acyl group here. 

00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:24.551
 Each of these is linked to an oxygen atom. 

00:09:24.551 --> 00:09:26.121
 This gives us more exercise options 

00:09:26.121 --> 00:09:27.761
 with another functional group. 

00:09:27.761 --> 00:09:31.461
 When we have a situation like - 

00:09:31.461 --> 00:09:32.991
 I'll take another color. 

00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:37.621
 When we have a carbonyl group 

00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:41.441
 and say just a organic circuit here, 

00:09:41.441 --> 00:09:43.071
 here oxygen, 

00:09:43.071 --> 00:09:45.973
 here another organic chain. 

00:09:45.973 --> 00:09:48.171
 This 

00:09:49.851 --> 00:09:51.981
 is called an ester. 

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:56.561
 We can see three esters here. 

00:09:56.561 --> 00:09:59.301
 We see this ester. 

00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:01.431
 This ester here. 

00:10:01.431 --> 00:10:04.191
 This ester. 

00:10:04.191 --> 00:10:06.621
 And this ester here. 

00:10:06.621 --> 00:10:09.051
 It was not just an exercise 

00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:12.451
 for fat or triacylglycerol, or triglycerol. 

00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:14.291
 These are different words for the same thing. 

00:10:14.291 --> 00:10:17.031
 We have also exerted all these functional groups. 

00:10:17.031 --> 00:10:18.911
 You now understand the meaning of the name triacylglycerol. 

00:10:18.911 --> 00:10:20.291
 We have a backbone of glycerol 

00:10:20.291 --> 00:10:23.161
 and these three acyl groups, 

00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:26.791
 by which fatty acids are attached to glycerol. 

00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:30.611
 These are the fats people often talk about. 

00:10:30.611 --> 00:10:31.611
 And this is a picture of fat. 

00:10:31.611 --> 00:10:34.731
 This is coconut oil. 

00:10:34.731 --> 00:10:37.621
 It is at a temperature below that of melting, 

00:10:37.621 --> 00:10:39.376
 therefore it is in its hard form. 

00:10:39.376 --> 00:10:41.051
 Below we have a picture of butter, 

00:10:41.051 --> 00:10:43.511
 I'm not sure which, but at a temperature higher than its melting temperature, 

00:10:43.511 --> 00:10:44.651
 so it is in a liquid state. 

00:10:44.651 --> 00:10:48.231
 People call this oil. 

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:51.521
 But it consists of triglycerides. 

00:10:51.521 --> 00:10:54.078
 Here's a big mixture of triglycerides. 

00:10:54.078 --> 00:10:56.051
 And if we could see their molecules, 

00:10:56.051 --> 00:10:57.691
 they will have this form, 

00:10:57.691 --> 00:11:00.361
 but the fatty acids will have a different number of carbon atoms 

00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:02.891
 and may have a different number of double bonds.
