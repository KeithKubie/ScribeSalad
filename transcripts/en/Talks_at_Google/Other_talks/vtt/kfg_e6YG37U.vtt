00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.059
&gt;&gt;Jonas: My name is Jonas. I invited Kelly
to speak today. Kelly founded San Francisco

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.990
CrossFit about five years ago with his wife,
Juliet, who is also in the audience. Thanks

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.770
for coming. And I think some time last year,
Kelly started with his mobility project. And

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.380
he was mainly posting a YouTube video on mobility
per day for a full year.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:35.390
You are at about 270 right now I think. And
for me, that really showed what you can do

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.739
with a little bit of knowledge, good intentions,
a camera, and an internet connection. So I've

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.640
been watching a lot of those videos. I work
at YouTube, so I've been looking for things

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.239
to watch at night. And so, the videos were
super helpful.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.000
Thanks for posting all that. And I thought
Kelly would be a great fit for Health@Google's

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.949
speaker series. And why don't you come up
to the stage and teach us how to use the time

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.740
in the office for our bodies rather than against
it? Thanks for coming.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.979
[applause]

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.710
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: First, thanks for coming
on your lunch. I appreciate it. My name is

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.670
Kelly Starrett. I'm a clinical doctor of physical
therapy. I own a strength and conditioning

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.399
center in San Francisco with my wife. And
Jonas was referring to the fact that about

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:23.399
a year--.

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.719
We see lots of athletes and we specialize
in the gamut from children all the way up

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.649
to the most elite scary power lifter you can
see. So we see--. We have lots and lots of

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.310
athletes come through, lots and lots of people
come through. In the last six years, we maybe

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.469
estimate we've seen 60 thousand athlete sessions
at our gym, which is a lot of pattern recognition.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.399
So first and foremost, I'm a strength conditioning
coach, but I'm also a physical therapist.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.469
And what I was seeing was that I was running
into the same patterns and the same problems

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:57.079
over and over again. And people were running,
sitting at their desks, doing their due diligence,

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.299
eating right, trying to exercise like mad.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.579
And we were finding that people were making
the same errors and same type one mistakes

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.509
over and over again. And I'd see a lot of
people would come and talk to us about their

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.290
back pain or their knee pain or their ankle
stuff. They injured themselves in college,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.480
whatever.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.990
And they were coming to see me after having
an MRI, getting a physician's referral for

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.520
physio. And there were very simple things
that we were, that they could have done. They

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.240
didn't need that. There should've been some
basic information that your Grandma should've

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.000
passed down to you.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.370
That your Mom should've said, "Oh, you have
knee pain? Why don't you do this? This is

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.530
your Granddad’s favorite knee squat test,
stretch your quad kind of thing." So, what

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.850
happened was that we started a project that
we were gonna be committed to changing the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.870
way that people thought about taking care
of themselves, that they should be able to

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.430
perform basic maintenance on themselves.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.440
One of the crucial factors is examining and
drawing consciousness to how it is you sit,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.050
what are you normal patterns every day? I'll
tell you that sitting in a chair and talking

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.700
about sitting at a desk is probably the most
dry, horrific topic on the planet. And it's

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.040
much akin to talking about the differences
in toilet paper. Come on.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.680
What I want you guys to know is that if you're
here and learn some very few basic organizing

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.110
principles and understanding about how your
body works, you'll be able to apply it everywhere.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.010
And you can take this time sitting at your
desk and you can actually use this as a launchpad

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.610
to get a lot of work done, so that your time
off the desk is not influenced by the time

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.610
on the desk.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.730
And that's the underlying principle where
we're going. I wanna make sure we have time

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.570
to answer individual questions, but we have
a lot to get going through. My wife always

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.450
reminds me that I speak quickly and I get
excited sometimes. So, if I start to haul

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.510
butt a little bit, slow me down.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:54.331
Stop me and we'll make sure you understand
the concepts, OK? All right. So, again, our

00:03:54.331 --> 00:03:59.750
essential premise is that you should know
this. This should be free information. Your

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.501
basic understanding of how you work and how
you sit should not be happenstance. You should

00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:07.480
arrive at a system of movement.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.950
And some of you were elite-level gymnasts,
I can tell, as kids. And some of you were

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.810
obviously high-level fighter pilots. You're
tipped back in your chair the same amount--.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.150
They actually tip fighter jets for the fighter
pilots back 'cause they didn't know how to

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.500
teach airplane pilots and fighter jet pilots
how to protect their backs, so they just tipped

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.500
the seat back.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.229
And that's one of the ways that you can naturally
get out of that position. We can see it. We

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.090
start judging our athletes immediately when
they come in the door. So, if we start to

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.620
have some basic concepts, some understanding,
we can get rolling.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.710
And what I wanna show you that is that in
the news recently, in every dirty men's fitness

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.759
journal, Men's Fitness, Men's Health, they're
talking about trying to scare you that sitting

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:55.990
is going to kill you. And I'll tell you that
that is the worst, worst way to get my attention.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.569
And I'll tell you an example why. How many
people in here flossed this morning? Raise

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:06.569
your hands. Right. Yet you all know you should
floss religiously. And the problem is if you

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.710
don't floss, what's gonna happen? Not flossing
is like not wiping, one of our friends says,

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.979
but that's an aside, right?

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:18.139
The issue here is that you aren't flossing
and you know you may or may not lose your

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.279
teeth in the long haul, but tomorrow you'll
wake up and you'll still have your teeth.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:26.360
And flossing didn't improve your life. You
did not see any direct improvement based on

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.360
the flossing.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.340
You couldn't feel change. You didn't wake
up feeling supple. You didn't PR on your 5K.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.590
And that's the problem when we try to make
things germane to people, relative to "Hey

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.669
do this or else.

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.509
Sit in your chair, or else." You're like,
"Dude. I'm a World Champion. I sit in my chair

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:46.190
all day long and then I go rock the kickball
league and it doesn't affect me." So what

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:53.289
we wanna do is try to tie more of the behaviors
of why we should be doing things, into things

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.050
that we can change and things that we can
see, and not--.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:02.039
Flossing scare model is a bad model. So, let's
move on. What we wanna do is start thinking

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:07.409
about sitting as a skill. And it's a high-skill
activity. In fact, if you look at yoga and

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:13.360
you look at the Buddha and how these people
are sitting. They've spent a whole millions

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.669
and thousands of years organizing themselves
to be able to sit effectively.

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:24.990
And Buckminster Fuller, great thinker, talked
about that all systems that are true and organized

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.349
are mutually accommodating. And that once
you start to understand and see some basic

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:34.620
organizing principles to which you're falling
to everyday and maybe not paying attention,

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.999
you'll be shocked when the veil of illusion
comes away from your eyes.

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:42.639
And you're sitting like the Buddha all day
long. At Google. Which is really the dream.

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:47.090
You start sitting at an early age for some
reason. And did your Mom ever teach you how

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.330
to sit? No. Did we teach our kids how to sit
at school? No. It's just one of those assumptions.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.479
While you’re sitting, you’re sitting fine.
Everyone can sit. But yet, it's probably the

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:58.860
highest skill, highest demand thing that we
do. This is one of my daughter's friends sitting

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.849
in the chair. And my daughter is wisely sitting
on the ground. Just wanted to put that out.

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:09.020
So we go from sitting at an early age, to
suddenly this very complex minutia of, "Hey,

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.219
I have the right thing," and this angle at
my knee. And what I wanna show you is that

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:17.479
that's great. You can sit in this position.
You have the computer right, but look at how

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:19.711
many 90 degree angles are in that human being.

00:07:19.711 --> 00:07:25.629
Can you see that? If you're in an idealized
state of sitting at a computer, according

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:30.939
to our ergo brothers and sisters, you have
one at the ankle, one at the knee, one at

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:36.689
the hip, one at the elbow. And you spend a
nice chunk of your day stuck in 90 degrees,

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:39.360
because that's what we say is the best way
to go.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.939
So imagine you and I are having lunch at the
most famous cafeteria in the whole world and

00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:48.089
you notice that I can only bend my arm halfway
to my face. That would be a little strange

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:53.229
because eventually, I'd start complaining
of neck pain, wrist pain. But imagine if I

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:59.499
spent ten hours a day, or longer, stuck with
90 degree angles in my body.

00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:02.939
Suddenly, you might just see like, "Hey, what
are you doing Kelly?" "Well, I'm practicing

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:07.580
eating for lunch. It's gonna be fine." And
what happens in a lot of times is that we

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:13.110
see this slow decay, slow transformation of
the body to reflect the reality of what we

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.110
do every day.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:18.599
We like to say that muscles and tissues are
like obedient dogs. And your body will respond

00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:23.819
in kind all day long. All you have to do is
practice. So if you wanna sit in 90 degree

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:27.809
angles, easy. So, where do we go from there?
I'm gonna show you a little, quick video of

00:08:27.809 --> 00:08:30.809
an athlete who is a very, very strong power
athlete.

00:08:30.809 --> 00:08:35.510
I want you to notice that she's working full
ranges of motion. There is oftentimes, we

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:41.660
see that people literally will not bend their
legs past 90 degrees for an entire day. They

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.140
wake up. They get off the bed. They sit on
the loo. They go down to have breakfast. They

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.140
go to work.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.810
They're in their car. And that leg has never
bent more than 90 degrees the whole day. And

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:54.310
yet, you're designed to be a moving machine.
You are an elegant moving machine. So here's

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:59.810
an athlete squatting. Going for one rep max
back squat. It's a very technical move.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.610
She's using this West-side style approach.
What I want you to notice is the full range

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:10.740
of motion. I want you to notice that her knees
go out when she stands up. OK? This is Caroline

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:18.810
Starrett, my other daughter, at age 11 months.
At some point, we stop thinking about why

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:19.810
do we move the way we move?

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.839
You're gonna notice that she's gonna squat
all the way down to the grass. Butt to grass

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:29.690
squat here. Perfect positioning. Shin is vertical,
minimizing sheer across the knee, etc., etc.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:34.500
Watch this. Perfect squat up. That was the
paleochair, by the way. All the way down.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.800
If you don't have a chair. The Starrett girls
are so advanced athletes that they squat and

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.180
eat at the same time. It's really the next
evolution of working and moving. And then

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.980
she's sitting down on that chair. But what's
happening is that she's, by default, sitting,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.940
getting up and down up off the ground.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.709
Cultures that even sleep and toilet on the
ground, we see a lot less hip disease. We

00:09:55.709 --> 00:09:59.620
see a lot less back disease. Which is why?
Because we use it. We use those ranges of

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.610
motion. So the question is what's happening?
And I want you guys to do a quick test for

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:05.610
me. If you--.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.660
Some of you guys are eating. Don't worry about
it. But if you can, I want you guys just to

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:14.779
stand up for me real quick. You need to experience
it to really understand. All right. Here's

00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:20.680
what we're gonna do. I want you to stick your
hands in your pockets. Grab this big chunk.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.000
Bend over and grab this big chunk of skin
here. It's like chicken skin. That's the crackling

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.620
of the human being, right there. Got it? OK.
Guys, not sexy. Grab it. Grab hold. It's not

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:34.420
your shirt. It's your skin. Got a big handful
of it? OK. Now, this represents about a 90

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.420
degree angle in your body.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.630
Got it? Now go ahead and stand up. Hold that
skin. Do not let that skin go. What happens

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:45.420
to your back? How does that feel? It's awesome.
Right? You overextend. Can you feel you're

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.600
tight in the hips? And you've had to make
a compromise based on the fact that you're

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.600
hips are tight.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.970
Can you guys feel that if you reach and grab
that skin? And if you try, you're gonna tear

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:55.810
that skin off your legs. Don't do that. Or,
you're gonna have to make some compromise.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:11:00.290
Well, this is what happens to us after we
sit for even a short period of time. Your

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.470
body instantaneously reflects what's going
on underneath.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:09.340
Now, what's interesting is that a lot of our
athletes and Google people out here have switched

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:14.710
to a standing desk, which is fantastic, but
yet, still has its own unique set of problems.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:20.080
And if I stand all day long in a bad position,
it's the same thing as sitting all day long

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.080
in a bad position.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.810
In fact, you'll see very, very sophisticated
yoga enlightened people stand and they put

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:29.350
one leg up. What are they doing? They're trying
to figure out a way not to have their backs

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:33.400
hurt. If you've ever gone drinking at a bar,
you notice that they have that bar at the

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.400
bottom of the bar.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.279
Captain Morgan position, right? What that's
about so we can make it easier to stand up.

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:45.101
And you'll see examples like this all the
time. But what's really happening when you

00:11:45.101 --> 00:11:50.910
picked up that hip is that you were playing
what we call "Gas-O Brake-O." Your body has

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.399
the capacity to generate lots of force, run
away from bears instantaneously.

00:11:55.399 --> 00:12:00.550
You have a model that can generate lots of
force over lots of periods of time very quickly

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.259
in spite of your tight hips. And so, by the
time we've actually worn out a joint or caused

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:08.690
some pain, it's because you've been running
around with your hand brake.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:15.310
And Gas-O Brake-O is a game that we used to
play when we would travel in rental cars on

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:19.709
the National team. And what we would do is
basically turn the car on and floor the gas

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:23.000
pedal all the time because, of course, that's
what it's there for--the gas. Right foot.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.370
So you turn the car on. You floor the gas
pedal. You can't drive 90 miles an hour all

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.100
the time, so you put your foot on the brake
at the same time. So the car's revving to

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.240
eight thousand RPMs. And you've got your foot
on the brake. Can you see how that works?

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.910
And then you just accelerate and decelerate
the brake.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.800
We work with the military. They told me that's
called "tactical driving." But when we did

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.790
it, we called it Gas-O Brake-O. So, you play
Gas-O Brake-O till you think you're gonna

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:50.450
die or the car's gonna blow up. We've pulled
into the hotel in South America, Team USA.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:54.590
We get out. And the young, nice man was there.
He's like, "Senor, senor." And we're like,

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.769
"No, no. It's OK. We're Team USA. We're here."
And he's like, "No, no. Senor. Senor." We're

00:12:57.769 --> 00:13:00.170
like, "No, really. We're checking in for the
world championships. We're here." And he's

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.250
like, "Your wheel is on fire, Senor."

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.250
[laughter]

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.940
And we had literally set the tire on fire.
And of course we were so shocked. How could

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:12.850
that possibly happen? I have no idea. Well,
we were running around with our Ferrari engines

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.890
of that rental car with the brake--on.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.430
And that's what's happening to a lot of our
athletes. We sit down. And unbeknownst to

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.430
us, that hand brake starts to come up a little
bit and you start playing Gas-O Brake-O. So

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:27.699
we're gonna show you how to ameliorate that.
And the model is simple. It's movement and

00:13:27.699 --> 00:13:28.699
mobility.

00:13:28.699 --> 00:13:32.180
We want you to think about you have to know
how to organize and how to get moved, how

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:36.440
to move correctly. And it's very simple. And
at the same time, you have to be able to treat

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.440
yourself. So there's our model--movement and
mobility. First thing in the movement we'll

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.750
take off is get organized.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:46.259
Spine, then limbs. So, here's what I wanna
show you. I'm gonna show you guys the two-hand

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:51.800
rule first. So, what I want you to do is sit
up tall. Take a look at the difference. Every

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.579
single person in this room is now gonna sit
up. So, you caught yourself in what we call

00:13:56.579 --> 00:13:57.660
an "open circuit position."

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.080
We're literally--. You're hanging on your
spine, slightly flexed. Or, you're over there

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.790
in the back and you're just ramrod straight
like your Mom told you. And you're also in

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.790
an over-extended, non-supported position.
So, the two-hand rule is that if you take

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:10.790
your sternum--.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.920
Actually, come stand up for me. It'll be even
easier. If you find your sternum right here.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.550
It's the bottom of your rib cage. That's where
you're not--. That's your xiphoid process.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:21.170
Don't do CPR there, right? Remember that?
Make a flat hand. Take your other hand and

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:25.240
put it on your pubic bone.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.129
Now, check this out. Make your belly as tight
as you can and squeeze your butt as hard as

00:14:29.129 --> 00:14:33.269
you can with your feet straight. Get that
tight. So, if someone walked up and punched

00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:37.629
you in the stomach, you would laugh. No problem.
Here we go. I'm gonna show you what I'm talking

00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:38.629
about.

00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:39.629
[laughter]

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:42.060
Right. So, you're nice and tight. That is
neutral spine. If your butt is squeezed and

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.980
your abs are on, that is straight up and down
balance and supported. You're braced. Now,

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.839
you can't walk around flexing your cobrahood
all the time 'cause it's weird, right?

00:14:49.839 --> 00:14:52.740
[strained voice]
"Good morning. How are you? Stable, braced."

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.220
[normal voice]
What we need to do, though, is think you gotta

00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.259
have 20% of that best effort on all the time.
So, if you just give me squeeze your butt

00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:05.130
20% , belly tight 20% , you'll notice that
you found yourself in a good position. Now

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.879
if you go to sit down and your hands.

00:15:07.879 --> 00:15:13.629
Keep your hands there. If your hands go apart,
that's a fault. That's a broken spinal position.

00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:17.740
Or, if you're sitting in the chair and your
hands start coming together, you're ending

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.250
up in the dreaded dog poop position. Same
thing.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.250
[laughter]

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:26.410
Dreaded spine flexion, herniation. Danger.
It's not bad. It just looks bad. So, go ahead

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:31.910
and see if you can hold that neutral spine
for me, that 20% of your abs, and sit down

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:32.910
and pay attention.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.839
So now as you sit down, now you have some
base line. And it's easy to find that organized

00:15:36.839 --> 00:15:40.399
position when you're standing. And that's
one of the reasons we like to have our athletes

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:45.379
and office, our executive athletes stand because
it's really easy to be in this organized position.

00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:50.939
As soon as I sit down, my athlete capsules.
My tight jeans are all pulling me into a bad

00:15:50.939 --> 00:15:54.939
position. I have to overcome that. So if I
get organized in a standing position, it's

00:15:54.939 --> 00:15:58.380
easier. And it's easier to see. And you can
see that many of us are like, "That was an

00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.410
awesome demo."

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:04.129
And then my hands are basically touching each
other. So, the first error is that it doesn't

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:07.920
matter what you're doing with your keyboard,
or how high your desk is or where your mouse

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:13.490
is. If your back is trashed and you're hanging
out on your joints all day long, it's no good.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:19.430
And one of the things that we'll see is that
from a chi standpoint, or neurological outflow

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.959
efficiency, when we see changes in spinal
positioning that happen like this or at the

00:16:23.959 --> 00:16:28.759
back of the head, it radically affects your
power output and radically affects your reaction

00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:29.959
time, your neural output.

00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:34.310
Let me show you. Come on up here, Jonas. Yeah.
And I'll have you--. Can you hold? I'll have

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:42.490
you hold the microphone. Come on. So, I'm
gonna show you with these head positions make

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:46.149
a big difference. Now you're all sitting up.
You have a nice model. You should always have

00:16:46.149 --> 00:16:47.339
your abs on 20% .

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:52.170
You don't ever get to go on vacation unless
you're sleeping. Always 20% . Now, here's

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:54.879
the deal. I'm gonna have Jonas put his hand
out towards the wall in the back. And he's

00:16:54.879 --> 00:16:57.990
gonna spread his fingers out. And spreading
his fingers out is the same thing as making

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.139
his elbow stiff.

00:16:59.139 --> 00:17:03.199
And so now his elbow is stiff. And how he's
braced. And they'll--. Keep your eyes up.

00:17:03.199 --> 00:17:06.199
I'm gonna try to bend them. Don't let me move
you. OK?

00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:13.140
[strained voice] Hold. Hold. He's very strong.
OK. I can't do it. He's German. OK. Now, when

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.959
I have him look down, watch what happens instantaneously
to his position.

00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:20.490
So all he's gonna do is just look at the floor
a little bit. 'Cause you can't relate to that

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.890
at all on the computer, OK?

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.779
&gt;&gt;Jonas: Or not.

00:17:24.779 --> 00:17:30.090
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: Hold. Now look up. Hold.
Do I move you? And look down. And he breaks

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:36.049
right away. It's weird, like magic. The same
thing will happen if he looks up. So, if he's

00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:39.529
sitting in a bad position, either way, if
we see the deviation in neck or spine, we'll

00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:41.870
see the same break.
[strained voice]

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:49.260
Hold. Hold. And just look up. Even if he looks
up a little bit, we see that--thank you--big

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.460
change in output. And that's why we need to
pay attention to what's going on. Do I have

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:56.830
a braced model? Do I have 20% of my trunk
on all the time? So, I'm gonna walk around

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.280
and just be able to punch my co-workers.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.659
Twenty percent is my best effort in their
stomach all the time. They appreciate that.

00:18:02.659 --> 00:18:07.309
And actually, in our family, we call it the
"belly smack." And our daughter, at her gymnastics

00:18:07.309 --> 00:18:09.651
class, that's how they teach the kids. They
just give them a little smack in the belly

00:18:09.651 --> 00:18:10.651
and they figure it out.

00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:15.750
Twenty percent. OK, so you've got that model
in your head now. You've gotta not violate

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:19.640
the two-hand rule. You can't extend. You can't
flex. You gotta have on--. See, you did it

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:24.820
again. Easy to figure out. Big landmarks.
And ultimately, you become a fencepost, which

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.850
is the highest degree of Zen you can achieve.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:34.590
Now, the second part to understanding this--.
First I said, first trunk, then limbs. So

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.740
the main thing that we need to talk about
are shoulders and the hips. These are the

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:42.059
real issues for our bodies when we sit. If
I'm disorganized at the trunk and hip, or

00:18:42.059 --> 00:18:44.840
at the trunk, it doesn't really matter what's
going on with my shoulder.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.970
I can't ever fix this problem in my elbow
or my wrist, because I'm disorganized here.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:53.201
So now, I've got a plan here. Straight up
and down and braced. Now I need to show you

00:18:53.201 --> 00:18:57.909
a very complex biomechanical principle called
"flexion and external rotation." And I know

00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:59.240
you guys are all superstars.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:04.299
And you're like, "Biomechanics was a sleeper
class." But look. This is flexion in the arm.

00:19:04.299 --> 00:19:08.440
Arm comes straight up. See how simple that
is? Brushing your teeth, being a human being.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:13.779
Most of those movements happen in flexion.
Easy. External rotation is just turning the

00:19:13.779 --> 00:19:15.510
arm out, turning the hand up.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:20.100
That's external rotation. So, flexion and
external rotation. Simple? Lemme give you

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:26.419
a few examples. It's really important. Flexion
and external rotation is how gymnasts turn

00:19:26.419 --> 00:19:30.240
out on the gymnastics rings. Right? Can you
see it? So, they're turned out.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.580
What's important about flexion and external
rotation is that's where the shoulder becomes

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:39.600
stable. That's where the hip becomes stable.
And then I've wound up that joint into a good,

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.679
tight position. And then I can hang out there
all day long with very little muscular problem,

00:19:44.679 --> 00:19:47.159
very little tissue deviation, tissue creep.

00:19:47.159 --> 00:19:51.090
And it gives me an organized position to start
with. And what you'll find is that you'll

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:57.049
see this over and over again in nature. Savasana,
or corpse pose, looks a lot like--. What's

00:19:57.049 --> 00:20:00.691
her hand doing? It's an external rotation.
It's the same as the gymnastics ring position.

00:20:00.691 --> 00:20:07.740
It's the same anatomical position. Screwdriver.
If you wanna tighten a screw, which way does

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.620
the screw turn? It's always set up for right-handed
people. I know there's a right-handed bias

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:16.080
in the world. But its external rotation is
how you tighten a screw, drive the screw in.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.961
You'll see these patterns, even if you turn
your car key on. How does your car start in

00:20:21.961 --> 00:20:26.340
the morning? External rotation. There it is
again. We're having a little yellow-out. There

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:33.430
we go. More importantly, 'cause you're probably
at my generation, Mr. Miyagi taught Daniel-san

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:34.880
in the Karate Kid, what movement?

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:40.610
Wax on, wax off. And what is "wax on, wax
off" really just about? External rotation

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.490
and flexion. So if you understand that you're
gonna see these strong principles over and

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:48.971
over again, and in fact, if we're in a self-defense
class and you grab my hand--. Grab my wrist

00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:49.971
like you're holding me.

00:20:49.971 --> 00:20:52.490
I'm danger, right? I don't know how you got
my hand in the first place, but you've got

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:56.230
it now. I'm gonna break it. And how do they
teach first external rotation? It's a very

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:00.529
strong, powerful position. It organizes the
shoulders. So, if you're sitting at your desk,

00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:04.470
the very first thing you can do to get organized
at the shoulder is that external rotation.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:08.270
And all you need to do is just screw your
arm around to the back of the socket. Can

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:15.110
you do that? Try that. So, look. You're sitting
in Savasana at your desk. Enlightened beings.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:21.160
Now take a look at this. I was an Avatar nerd,
like everyone else. And I really bought in

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.220
to the Unobtainium movement and understood
all this.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:28.409
Until I saw this. Does anyone understand what's
wrong with this photo? I was like, after this,

00:21:28.409 --> 00:21:32.820
I was like, "James Cameron is so unrealistic.
He did not pay attention to any of the details."

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:38.149
Because what position is that person drawing
the bow, the Na'vi? She's in internal rotation.

00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:43.480
No advanced human being life force, whatever,
would draw a bow in a weak position. And so,

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.530
if the hand was on the other side, I would've
bought the movie. But the fault is the person

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:51.529
is internally rotated, which is the same position
that you were not supposed to type in.

00:21:51.529 --> 00:21:56.059
The same position that causes all this not
good positioning and looks really, really

00:21:56.059 --> 00:22:01.130
bad. So, you can see it. This is the break.
So, let's show you something. This is probably

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:07.030
the most critical part of the whole talk,
is what I call the "Western Keyboard" approach.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.120
This is our friend, Mark Bell.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:13.340
He's benching 900 pounds. He's going for the
world record. I think it's crazy. But he's

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:17.190
a good friend. The first thing he does--.
So put your arms out. I'm gonna teach you

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:20.990
how to bench press like Mark Bell. Nine hundred
pounds is coming. Set your shoulders back.

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:25.029
OK? And I want you to pretend like you're
gonna break an imaginary bar, or stick, in

00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:29.929
half. Forty-five degrees. What happened when
we did that? External rotation. See how your

00:22:29.929 --> 00:22:33.919
shoulder got stable? Now, get tight. Bellies
tight. Two-hand rule. Now pull your elbows

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:35.360
down to the side.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.029
Ready to go. You're bench pressing. It's very
heavy. And that's your keyboard position.

00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:43.799
Hey, that's the Western Approach. So, if I
actually rotate again, pull it down, get it

00:22:43.799 --> 00:22:50.580
tight. And guess where my mouse should go?
External rotation. There's that same principle

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.220
that if I'm internally rotating for my mouse,
my shoulder is disorganized.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.371
I'm gonna have problems. So, we teach people
how to get all this good, fancy set-up, but

00:22:58.371 --> 00:23:02.370
we don't ever teach them how to sit and what
positions they should be in. Questions.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.950
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: [inaudible]

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:12.309
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: Oh, the problem with the
earlier slide was that her hand is not in

00:23:12.309 --> 00:23:17.600
an externally rotated position. The hand is
in an internally rotated position, which means

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.800
the shoulder is in a weakened impinged state.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:25.450
It's a disorganized position. All you need
to do is just wax off, and then that's how

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:29.899
you would do it, right? It's easy to see.
Good question. Need the biomechanics. OK,

00:23:29.899 --> 00:23:35.010
so that's our Western Approach. Now, because
we're so much more Zen than Mark Bell, I'm

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.039
gonna show you guys an Eastern Keyboard approach.

00:23:37.039 --> 00:23:41.370
So here's what I want you to do. Go ahead
and externally rotate the arms, like you're

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.600
gonna sit back. And you know that they probably
told you to squeeze your shoulder blades together.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.810
And that never works because the shoulder
blade is never organized in a wound-up, tight

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:49.810
position.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:54.870
So, external rotate. Nice and tight. So now
you're in Savasana. And then, just flip your

00:23:54.870 --> 00:24:01.100
hands over. What position are you in now?
Perfect typing position. And you can find

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.350
it either way, from either from this externally
rotated position down. Or, just flip over

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.350
and turn it back up.

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:10.070
Now, I'll tell you what. This is probably
the easiest way to understand and hold a good

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:15.000
texting machine. So, pull out your texting
machine, whatever that is. Your texting machine

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.780
of choice. This is important. 'Cause then
you're like, "Oh, I'm sitting so good at work

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.710
all day long." And then you're like, "Oh,
text."

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:21.710
[laughter]

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:25.490
And you can fall right back into your little
monkey habit. So here's what I want you to

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:30.490
do. I want you to hold your texting machine
with one hand. Balance it on your hand.

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:35.580
Externally rotate. Bellies tight. Two-hand
rule engaged. And then, just pull it in tight.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:39.309
And then, place your other hand underneath.
And now, your shoulders are supported and

00:24:39.309 --> 00:24:44.220
you will be shocked that your typing rate
will go up. Your number of texts answered

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.220
per minute will go up.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.490
And your shoulders will not ache. And you
see, as soon as you let those shoulders go,

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:53.899
your shoulders round forward, your head goes.
It's terrible, isn't it? And so you just like,

00:24:53.899 --> 00:24:59.159
"What are you doing?" You're like, "I'm getting
ready to meditate with my texting machine."

00:24:59.159 --> 00:25:03.000
And I'll tell you, it also solves the horrible
thumb problem that we see in a lot of people

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.320
who have to be on little Blackberries all
day long. So, if you can externally rotate

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.450
that hand first and then bring it in, we've
solved it. And so much of this, you'll notice,

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.190
that this pattern happens.

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:20.070
And this person, this is the Bodhisattva , who
basically wrote the Yoga Movement. And what

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:26.130
position is Lotus? External rotation, right?
In fact, sitting Indian style, this is actually

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:29.230
the only appropriate use of Indian style.
Everyone else is 'indigenous person' style.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:34.220
But this is Indian style, is that the leg
is externally rotated in flexion, which is

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.390
the same position as the upper body. So, you'll
see these patterns over and over again. And

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:45.299
you'll be mini-obsessed with it. When we saw
Caroline squat earlier--the Bear--she squatted

00:25:45.299 --> 00:25:46.620
and her knees went out.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:51.240
And that same knee-out position is that external
rotation position, which stabilizes her hips.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.350
So we're gonna see this same model at the
hip and at the shoulder. All right. So we

00:25:54.350 --> 00:26:00.780
have some basic understanding of how can I
get my spine organized, two-handed rule, 20%

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:01.780
flexion, external rotation.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:06.000
And then from there, you can basically go
to the Olympics. Do whatever you want. Super

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.390
easy. So, next piece then, I said some movement
and mobility approach. Well, the first part

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.580
of that is that we say hey, is the athlete
in a good position? Is the person sitting

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.741
at the desk in a good position?

00:26:14.741 --> 00:26:19.341
And then the second part is what's going on
with the tissues? And here's that piece where

00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:23.710
we usually skip around. And it doesn't matter
how much massage you get, or stretching you

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:28.470
do, if you just default back to your troglodyte
self, it's just amazing how you go back to

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:29.470
that space.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:33.260
So, you have to fix the position. Then, we
fix the tissues. And now we've got a recipe

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:37.750
for changing things. Here's what you're gonna
do. You're gonna take a little test for me

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:42.799
right now. This is the dirty, secret show.
I want you to pull your pant leg up. Now,

00:26:42.799 --> 00:26:43.980
cross your leg.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:50.120
Pull your pant up so you can see your shin.
This is the technical part. This is your leg

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:57.240
bone right here. So, grab the calf behind
the leg bone and the front. And what you're

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.649
gonna do is you're gonna see there's a flat
part of the middle of that shaft, of that

00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:01.649
tibia.

00:27:01.649 --> 00:27:04.240
Right in the front of the leg, there, in the
shin. See there's a big, flat part of your

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.940
shin? It's flat there. What I want you to
do is take your thumb and drive it right into

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:13.269
the flesh. Not on your calf, the muscle, but
right over the bone. Try to push that thumb

00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:14.269
into the bone.

00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:18.799
Five seconds, hard. So right on the bone,
push hard into the bone. Hard. Hard. Hard.

00:27:18.799 --> 00:27:24.559
You're not pushing hard. I can tell. Get tight.
Good. Now, pop your thumb up. Did you see

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:28.500
a dent in your skin? There's a little dent
there. Raise your hand if you have a dent.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:33.201
Don't be ashamed. I know that there's a global
warming problem going on. This is what we

00:27:33.201 --> 00:27:38.710
call global dehydration. And what that little
pitting edema test is, is it's a metric of

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:42.419
how well your tissues are sliding over one
another. And guess what?

00:27:42.419 --> 00:27:49.260
If your tissues become pitted and nasty and
you're dehydrated, then what ends up happening

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:53.610
is you go through a very complex process where
high temperature--. Let's take a look at another

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:58.000
model. Imagine right now I weigh--. I'm a
200-pound guy. I'm a little more than that.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.460
I'm an adult-sized male, 200 pounds. And I'm
about a hundred degrees, give or take. Right

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:07.450
now, I have about a hundred degrees and a
hundred pounds in each one of my butt cheeks.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:12.519
Just like you. And guess what? Under high
pressure and high temperature, you create

00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:13.909
lamination, or oil.

00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:17.779
That's how we laminate surfaces together,
right. So what's going on right now is you

00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:22.580
are in the complex process of creating what
we call butt lamination. All of the tissues

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:27.889
of your butt and hamstrings are being sandwiched
together under high pressure. For what, seven,

00:28:27.889 --> 00:28:28.911
eight, nine, ten hours a day?

00:28:28.911 --> 00:28:33.760
Plus the car ride. So you can imagine that
if you also failed that dehydration test,

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.049
you don't have any lubrication. You had to
take a drink of water. You couldn't even help

00:28:37.049 --> 00:28:40.950
it. You're so thirsty. And what's happening
is that you're getting those tissues stuck

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:42.399
together.

00:28:42.399 --> 00:28:49.809
And, for lack of a better word, you've created
this sandwich out of most of your bits. Well,

00:28:49.809 --> 00:28:54.639
that's happening in all of your tissues, your
Achilles, the nerves sliding through the nerve

00:28:54.639 --> 00:28:59.101
beds, how the tendons relate. All of these
tissues end up getting sticky and they don't

00:28:59.101 --> 00:29:00.690
slide very well and then they get stiff.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:04.100
And that stiffness is one of the problems
that happens. And so if I'm dehydrated and

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:08.260
then I freeze myself in a 90-degree position.
You can imagine that after a while that's

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.180
gonna be a recipe for pain. I don't know what's
happening, but I used to be a college swimmer

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.840
and now I can't put my arms over my head.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:19.889
And it turns out you need water and salt.
And what are the amounts of water? Well, we

00:29:19.889 --> 00:29:24.760
recommend that people drink half their body
weight in ounces. That's it, every day. And

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.279
what I think you should do--. So, do high
math there. I know you can do it. It's very

00:29:28.279 --> 00:29:29.279
simple.

00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:33.130
It's not a lot of water. You should--here's
the "should"--try doing all that at work.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:36.640
It's one of the ways that we can gain this
process is that I can take care of my hydration

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:41.169
at work. So I can use my coffee in the morning.
Bridge myself to work. I drink all day long.

00:29:41.169 --> 00:29:44.370
And then I go home and I'm gonna have red
wine.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:48.649
And neither of those things count towards
our total water. But what does count is the

00:29:48.649 --> 00:29:52.529
water that you're drinking during the day.
So, baseline without exercise, half your body

00:29:52.529 --> 00:29:56.420
weight in ounces every day. Now the key to
this is that a lot of you drink more than

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.420
that.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:00.710
You're really good. You got your little gallon.
You're refilling your thing. But it turns

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:04.160
out you're not adding any salt. And a lot
of the people we're seeing now are paying

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:08.480
a lot more attention to their diet. They're
very low-salt diets. They're eating primal,

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.789
gluten-free.

00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:13.289
And what's happening is that people are not
salting anything and they've reinvented the

00:30:13.289 --> 00:30:17.179
need for the salt trade. Well it turns out
animals drink ferociously after they eat.

00:30:17.179 --> 00:30:18.909
And the reason is that's when they absorb
water.

00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:22.820
And if you're not regularly going home and
eating animal kidneys, which you're probably

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:28.399
not, then you need to think about your water
as a chance to make it with a little salt

00:30:28.399 --> 00:30:31.820
in it so it's the same salinity as your body
can actually absorb it. So, what ends up happening

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.019
is you dose your kidneys.

00:30:33.019 --> 00:30:36.970
You drink this big bolus of water. You're
so good. And then you just tinkle all the

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:40.909
time. And that doesn't change any of the global
dehydration. And this global dehydration,

00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:44.659
this change in the quality of that stickiness
of the tissues, it takes weeks to develop

00:30:44.659 --> 00:30:46.090
and it takes weeks to undo.

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:51.419
So, what I'm saying is take a little pinch
of sea salt and throw it in your water. Or,

00:30:51.419 --> 00:30:55.161
there are nice companies in the world that
make these great little tablets that you can

00:30:55.161 --> 00:31:00.230
just drop into your bottle. And CamelBak gave
us some of these. It doesn't matter what brand

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.230
you use.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:07.009
There's NUUN. Everyone makes these little
tablets of electrolytes. They're not sugar.

00:31:07.009 --> 00:31:11.710
It's not Gatorade. It won't wreck your insulin,
but it makes the water absorbable. So, make

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.669
sure you're not making that type one error,
that foundational error, of being dehydrated

00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:17.779
and you're drinking all the water, but you're
not absorbing the water.

00:31:17.779 --> 00:31:22.429
Because if we can undo that stickiness of
that tissues, things change radically. What

00:31:22.429 --> 00:31:27.040
happens is you become de-laminated where you
want to become de-laminated. But this is your

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.850
tissue. It becomes stuck. I like the bacon
'cause it's a nice reference for your muscles

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:35.429
running through the grilled cheese sandwich
that is your butt.

00:31:35.429 --> 00:31:40.429
You should be like layers of silk running
over steel springs, not this. And if you stand

00:31:40.429 --> 00:31:43.390
up and then go try to run or play kickball
after this, you're gonna have a problem. So

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:46.850
what do you do about that? So the first and
easiest way to deal with that is we brought

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:47.850
you a gift.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:52.200
If you can hand some of these back. This is
a lacrosse ball. If you can get a couple of

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:57.639
people to pass these around. These lacrosse
balls cost a buck a shot. There's lot and

00:31:57.639 --> 00:32:04.750
lots of fancy myofascia balls. Hand some out.
Thanks, Jonas. We like the lacrosse ball because

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.549
we think it's the most painful, first.

00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:11.080
And second, it turns out they're cheap. And
if someone wants to steal it or take it, we

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:15.389
give it to them. So here's what I want you
to do. Very, very complex task. Take the lacrosse

00:32:15.389 --> 00:32:20.740
ball, and stick it in the grilled cheese sandwich
that is your bottom. Hey. I can do this while

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.139
I'm answering emails, right?

00:32:22.139 --> 00:32:25.809
And what's happened is now you've gotten some
work done while you're doing something else.

00:32:25.809 --> 00:32:29.280
So, grab that lacrosse ball. We got plenty.
We've got more in the back. Don't be shy.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.080
There's a box of lacrosse balls in the back.
I'm trying to change the world one lacrosse

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.080
ball at a time.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:38.139
Here's what I want you to do. So I want you
to sit on the lacrosse ball until you find

00:32:38.139 --> 00:32:42.970
something that hurts. It's pretty simple.
I wish it was more technical and complex than

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:46.710
this. I have an advanced Doctoral degree and
that's all about sticking a lacrosse ball

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:47.710
in your bum.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:51.230
OK? Got it. Now, find something that hurts.
Now, if you stick a nail through that grilled

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:55.529
cheese sandwich, are you gonna have a problem?
Yeah. It's gonna hurt, right? And it doesn't

00:32:55.529 --> 00:32:59.990
change the surface. It doesn't de-laminate
or shear those tissues apart. So if you want

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:01.373
to pull a grilled cheese sandwich apart, what
do you need to do?

00:33:01.373 --> 00:33:04.929
Spread it apart, right? You don't just stick
a nail through it. So what you're doing right

00:33:04.929 --> 00:33:08.101
now is just sticking a nail through your laminated
surfaces and that's why it hurts. So what

00:33:08.101 --> 00:33:13.170
you need to do is roll. So, first thing is
just try to roll past that lacrosse ball anywhere

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:14.170
that hurts.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:18.090
And if it doesn't hurt, find someplace that
does. It's a dirty secret in there. Many of

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:23.120
you guys have been experts at sitting in front
of a blue screen for many, many years. And

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:30.070
it takes a while to undo that lamination.
So, what I'm saying is, how long does it take?

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:34.080
Treat until you make change. How simple is
that? Now, that's one model. Roll around on

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.919
it. Here's the other model. Go ahead and put
it underneath your hamstring, which is this

00:33:37.919 --> 00:33:43.790
big muscle group in the back of your leg.
So kind of tack it down. So now we're back

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.210
to that tack model.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:48.130
And what we're gonna do is what we call an
active tack and stretch. It's a poor person's

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:53.180
A-R-T. I know you guys are working hard for
the man. So you don't have time to go get

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:56.950
massages. So put the ball on your hamstring
and then kick your leg out.

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:57.950
[squeals]
Wah.

00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:58.950
Anyone feel that?

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:02.210
That's fun, huh? That's a pain face. That's
a private face. Don't make that face.

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:03.210
[laughter]

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.220
Straighten your leg. Now, just kick your leg
back and forth. What's happening is that you

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:10.380
created a little micro-tack under that hamstring,
under those posterior tissues, whatever that

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:14.619
tissue is there. And now you're starting to
de-laminate. You're restoring that slideability.

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:20.580
And I'll challenge you this afternoon. Go
ahead and hammer one butt cheek. Then only

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:25.320
floss one hamstring, back and forth. They
call this flossing. This kind of tack and

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.629
stretch. Just move it around. Give it five
or ten minutes. It doesn't take much time.

00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:32.179
And then stand up and just move around.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:35.540
And try to squeeze your butt and you're gonna
be like, one side is like The Hulk. And the

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.790
other side is like the grilled cheese sandwich.
And that's how we know it works. And it's

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:43.079
very, very simple and very low-tech. And someone's
gonna come up to you and, "Can I borrow your

00:34:43.079 --> 00:34:44.079
lacrosse ball?"

00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:49.909
You're like, "Sure." It's a buck. Like, please.
A latte costs more than you treating yourself.

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:56.429
So please take that lacrosse ball. Enjoy that.
So that's one model. The second thing is we

00:34:56.429 --> 00:35:03.420
want you to think about gaming your desk.
I stopped evolving after the Atari 2600, after

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.970
I moved back home from Germany.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:08.670
So, this is my mantra. But one of the things
we do, is we try to drink all the water we

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:12.810
can while we're at work. Use the lacrosse
ball on as many tissues as we can. Now, think

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:16.710
of this as some advanced clinical reasoning.
Could you put that lacrosse ball on the bottom

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:18.550
of your foot?

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:23.920
Yes. Can you put that lacrosse ball in your
knotted arm? Yes. Take the lacrosse ball right

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:29.810
now. Put it over your heart. Yeah, that's
your pec, pec minor. It gets stick and ropey

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:33.710
in there and holds your forward. Your body's
like, "This is the position you wanna be in,

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:34.980
bro? I got your back."

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.780
And so it rolls you forward, pins you down.
And all you have to do is roll that thing

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.430
around right underneath your collar bone.
You can find the sticky bits, yeah? It's super

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:48.421
simple. If you think, "Hey. No one needs to
know, under the desk, what's going on."

00:35:48.421 --> 00:35:49.421
[laughter]

00:35:49.421 --> 00:35:53.200
How's it going? And all you're doing is just
rolling on your feet. And if you're a runner,

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:57.060
or if you stand up or planning or cycling,
we do not take care of our feet. It's a simple

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:01.400
way to get some serious mileage in while you're
at work.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:06.630
And someone just texted me and said, "Hey,
Kel. Big fan. I just was at jury duty for

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:11.230
three hours and I got it all done." So, carry
your lacrosse ball. The lacrosse ball we know

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:15.591
has gone to Afghanistan. We know it's been
deployed with our Navy Seals. And it's very,

00:36:15.591 --> 00:36:16.591
very simple.

00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:20.100
And it's a low-tech way to actually change
the interface of these muscles, the skin,

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:24.270
and the tissue. But now, we're into the executive
stretches. Let me just show you a couple of

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:29.400
ideas. On the end of this presentation, there
are some links with ideas, with some directions.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.970
So, I'm not gonna run you through a whole
gamut. But there's ideas and short little

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:36.590
episodes that you can really click to. But
let's do a little game. Imagine that you're

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:41.260
sitting at your desk. Now, go ahead and stand
up for me. Oh, you failed. The first time

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.260
you sit up.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.960
That means you owe a pounding. So, here's
the first game and we call it the Sit Game,

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:51.210
or what do we say? Kind of sit and pay. So,
every time you get up and down, that's one

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:57.280
pounding. So, here's the first and easiest
thing you can do. Cross your leg. Belly tight.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.980
Don't violate that two-hand rule. Now, if
you're having a hard time getting up or your

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:05.180
knees or your chest, already some things should
be coming clear to you. It's easy. It should

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.609
be easy to get my leg down and tall.

00:37:06.609 --> 00:37:10.030
[whispers]
If your knee's up by your face, that's not

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:11.030
good.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:12.030
Take them down.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.950
[normal voice]
You can't, right? So, go ahead and just lean

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:18.520
forward. Now, the common mistake that people
will make is that they just don't do things

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:23.240
long enough to make change. So, the minimum
therapeutic dose is two minutes. It's easy

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.240
to remember.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.580
Gimme two, right, from Johnny Utah. You can
see all the Submarine sandwiches. Back in

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:34.260
two. And two minutes is a nice way. Most important
is that you just start to do something. And

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:37.630
right now, you can hook your knee underneath
your desk, get some email changed.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:44.160
Take your lacrosse ball. Stick it right behind
the calf bone right there. Hey. Look at that.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:50.359
Right behind that shin bone, press that ball
with both hands right into that fleshy bit.

00:37:50.359 --> 00:37:56.339
Now make circles with your ankles. Hey. That's
OK. Got it? I'll take that. Thank you. So

00:37:56.339 --> 00:37:58.700
right there, anchor that thing and just make
little circles.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:02.770
Just little wheels. And my wife is a world
champion athlete back there, and an attorney.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:06.500
And she's like, "I'm always gonna wear cute
shoes, Kelly, no matter what you say." And

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:10.609
those cute shoes make her calves tight. And
here's that remedy. I'm like, "Here's the

00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:11.609
compromise.

00:38:11.609 --> 00:38:15.520
You can wear cute shoes, but do something
for your feet, please." And this is so simple.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:20.560
So hey, a penalty, every time I got up I have
to do something for a minute. Simple? Gives

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.440
you an idea. Go ahead and stand up one more
inch again. Will I do it?

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:32.619
Hit it. Oh, that's a foul. Good. Next foul.
Watch how high-tech this is. Put your knee

00:38:32.619 --> 00:38:39.000
on the ground. Can you do that right in front
of your desk? Right in front of your chair?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.010
Go ahead. If you've got arthritic knees, don't
do it. Be cool. If it feels sketchy, it's

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:45.010
sketchy.

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.940
How simple is that model? Now squeeze your
bum as hard as you can. Was your bum squeezed?

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:54.569
It wasn't, was it? You were like all over-extended
man belly guy. Don't be that guy. Rib cage

00:38:54.569 --> 00:38:56.619
down. Squeeze your butt. And just push forward.
Now, through the butt.

00:38:56.619 --> 00:39:00.630
Anyone feeling anything tight, like a wolverine
gnawing at your hip right here? Yeah, that's

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:05.490
another way to undo that hip skin, that tightness.
And all you have to do right now is just answer

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:07.472
emails in a very strange position
[audience laughs]

00:39:07.472 --> 00:39:08.589
for what--a minute.

00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:12.910
And you're gonna start to see some change.
It's very, very simple. These tables are a

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:19.060
little bit low, but you can even put your
foot up here and still maintain decorum and

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:25.680
still get some work done. In fact, give that
a try. Don't fall over. It's so simple. We

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.160
call this the couch stretch because it's perfectly
done on the couch.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:34.099
It was built for "So You Think You Can Dance."
So you can watch "So You Think You Can Dance."

00:39:34.099 --> 00:39:38.160
Put that knee to the back corner. Squeeze
your bum and just try to open up that hip.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.470
How long do you do this to make any serious
change? Two minutes. If something goes numb,

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.569
what should you do? Call you doctor.

00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:45.569
[laughter]

00:39:45.569 --> 00:39:50.980
No, stop doing that. Right? That's easy. That
numbness is a serious issue. We've given you

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:56.280
ten different ways, fifteen different games,
on there about taking a look at how to game

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.869
this up.

00:39:57.869 --> 00:40:06.591
But remember that it's gotta be about not
being afraid to try to move a little bit at

00:40:06.591 --> 00:40:13.780
your desk. De-laminate yourself. Roll that
ball around every conceivable place on every

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:16.420
soft tissue you can have access to at work.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:20.640
Create a game where you actually get something
done at work for you, for your body, so that

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:25.920
when you stand up you become that supple leopard
again and you're right back out and your desk

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.800
hasn't imposed a compromise where you're playing
Gas-O Brake-O.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.069
'Cause that's ultimately what we need to do.
We understand that if I was walking around

00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:37.510
like this all day long from my job and then
suddenly had to not be in this position, it

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:44.020
would be a real problem for me. And that really
is a simple exaggeration of what this does.

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:49.240
So whether you're standing or sitting, don't
make the mistakes of losing the spine. Am

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:53.231
I braced? Two-hand rule. Twenty percent on.
And you can see everyone here. I don't know

00:40:53.231 --> 00:40:57.060
if you guys will see each other and you'll
walk right up and slap each other 20% . You'll

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.150
see if that girl's overextended in the back,
you'll say, "I see you."

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.339
[laughter]

00:41:01.339 --> 00:41:04.670
Neutral spine. And as soon as you do that
and then you've got this taken care of. Get

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:09.251
yourself organized. And once you're here,
everything becomes very simple. External rotation

00:41:09.251 --> 00:41:10.319
and flexion.

00:41:10.319 --> 00:41:17.090
Two-hand rule engaged. And get some work done.
Make sense? It's very, very simple. And I

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:26.329
think now we're taking some questions. Nice
to see you still sitting up and drinking water.

00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:27.329
Good job.

00:41:27.329 --> 00:41:32.050
&gt;&gt;Jonas: So please ask questions into the
mic there and then we have a few questions

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:35.540
submitted to the Google Moderator page. So,
I'm just gonna leave this here.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:36.540
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: Great.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:37.830
&gt;&gt;Jonas: You can read the question.

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:38.859
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: OK. Let's take questions
from the audience first.

00:41:38.859 --> 00:41:44.470
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: I've had some problems
with dead lift in my lower back. I've been

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:49.310
experimenting with different ab position for
dead lift. What do you suggest for--? Is it

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.610
a similar kind of two-hand rule for dead lift?

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:55.181
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: So the question is when
I pick heavy things up off the ground, what

00:41:55.181 --> 00:41:59.089
do I do with my spine? That's really the question.
Whether it's my two-year old, my six-year

00:41:59.089 --> 00:42:05.260
old, it's 500 pounds. It's the same thing.
And the idea is where should I get organized?

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:09.800
Should I wait till I'm tight down here and
get all organized and stiff? No. I do it at

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:15.030
the top where I not violate the two-hand rule.
Get as organized and stiff as I can and then

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:19.510
move from there. So we always prioritize the
spine first, and then look to create torque

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:21.079
at the hip second.

00:42:21.079 --> 00:42:24.211
So, I would say absolutely getting organized.
And whether you breathe into that tightness--.

00:42:24.211 --> 00:42:27.240
Do this little experiment for me. Take a huge
breath. Hold it. Now, try to get tight. How's

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:33.530
that working for you? It's like putting a
Bounce House into a duffel bag, isn't it?

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:39.920
Yeah, absolutely. Now, let's become cobras.
Get tight. Now try to breathe into that tightness.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.960
It's like putting air into a compressed tank.
And that second model of stiffness and position

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.569
first, and then breathing second.

00:42:45.569 --> 00:42:51.820
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: So, your thing
about the external rotation like, having the

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:55.319
mouse out, do you have any suggestions when
you have to work a lot on a laptop where you

00:42:55.319 --> 00:42:57.840
got the track pad in the middle to keep that
going?

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.609
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: So, the question is how
do you manage a compromise? You're playing

00:43:01.609 --> 00:43:06.010
Tetris with your body. And like, you've got
the perfect setup. You're about to get the

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.010
space shuttle.

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:10.359
And what's about to happen? It's like the
worst piece comes down, right? And you gotta

00:43:10.359 --> 00:43:13.880
put that piece somewhere and you're like,
"No, I don't know. It doesn't fit anywhere."

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.950
Well, that's what's going on with that little
mouse pad. I'm pretty sure wireless mouse

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:18.950
is A this large.

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:23.530
So you can always make a better decision,
which is my wife's best parenting advice.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:28.809
Make a better decision, to me. The second
idea is that I can still be in an external

00:43:28.809 --> 00:43:31.530
rotated position to maintain the shoulder
in a good, organized position and then swing

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:32.790
my hand in.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:35.950
And that's what's cool about having this extra
joint. It allows for some differentiation.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:36.950
[laughter]

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:41.150
And that's what you need to know. The main
thing is to get the primary joint organized

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:44.530
and then I can spin back in. But the second
that misses, then I'm toast.

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:47.150
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: But I kinda got
in the habit of doing that. Do you have any

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:49.790
ideas how to remind yourself to get out of
that habit, then?

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:51.240
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: So I do this all the time.

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.240
[laughter]

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.240
What should I not do?

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.839
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: I do this all the
time.

00:43:54.839 --> 00:43:58.120
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: You're gonna have to realize
that you need to spend some time working on

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:03.800
it and practicing. And we've given you some
links and some resources to encourage that,

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.059
but just motor control and consciousness is
[whispers ]pretty powerful stuff.

00:44:06.059 --> 00:44:08.460
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Is internal rotation
ever good?

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.200
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: Always good. And extension.

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.380
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Absolutely.

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.880
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: So when the arm comes behind,
it's the opposite. That's beyond the scope

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:18.349
today. Does that make sense? So you still
think about what are the principles I can

00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:19.349
control.

00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:22.890
What can I control? And then hold it there.
And holding your little texting machine. And

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:27.160
if I can get my laptop up a little bit and
not do all ten errors at once. [whispers]

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.540
My precious.
[normal voice]

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:29.540
Next question.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:33.240
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: There's been a
lot of minimalist footwear out there, like

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.980
FiveFingers and Merrell makes some, too. Any
thoughts on those as far as are they good

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.710
for realigning everything? Or, are they bad
for the joints? I've seen both thoughts out

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:41.710
there.

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:44.970
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: The question is what do
you think about minimalist footwear? I think

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:50.450
it's awesome. I personally--and I'll probably
get sued for this--but I don't think my wife

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:53.569
would go on a date with me if I wear FiveFingers.

00:44:53.569 --> 00:44:58.650
So, that's my fashion statement. Comma, you
can always make a good decision. In fact,

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:02.710
our daughters run around in ballet slippers.
I think there's probably people here wearing

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:08.619
very flat sandals. There's always a choice.
Whatever shoe company that you're at, you

00:45:08.619 --> 00:45:11.420
get a lot of input from your feet to the world.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:14.960
And if you're in a disorganized position,
or collapsed, or insulating yourself, you

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:19.829
can't actually hear the messages from the
ground up. And so, do we encourage good mechanics

00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:22.470
first? Yeah. It's always solving the movement
problem first.

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:28.250
And if I have a $500 shoe and I'm putting
my heel out, to stop a $500 heel strike, and

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:32.710
it's a problem. I think there's even a correlation
between the more expensive your shoe and severity

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:39.670
of your knee injury. Convenient. Other questions?
Do what works for you.

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:45.200
All right. So here are a couple other questions.
"Standing appears to be a lot better for the

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.309
body than sitting. What are the do's and don'ts
when working at a standing desk, though?"

00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:51.380
So, this is the problem is that we're thinking,
"Hey, I'm an enlightened human being.

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:56.680
I'm just gonna stand now and do all the same
things." In fact, I stand and my back hurts

00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:00.290
even worse and now I'm overextended all day
long. And you'll know what I'm talking about

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:04.740
if you see these guys stand like that. Oh
no you didn't. This is me trying not to have

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.339
my back hurt and I stick my hip out.

00:46:06.339 --> 00:46:12.599
See what you're doing in the back? It's cute.
But it's not organized. That's right. That's

00:46:12.599 --> 00:46:17.530
the problem. And dancing, that's different.
So, one of the issues is how do I avoid that?

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:22.380
And we'll see guys will stand out like this
all the time. We'll see people roll out on

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:23.380
the bottom of their feet.

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:28.609
And what they're all trying to do is solve
that broken spinal position problem. Standing

00:46:28.609 --> 00:46:33.010
like this with your foot over. So, the best
thing you can do is at your work station,

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:38.579
give yourself a place to go. One of the concepts
is your best position is probably your next

00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:39.579
position.

00:46:39.579 --> 00:46:46.309
So, any one position is Han being frozen for
a long time. That guy was stiff and dehydrated.

00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:51.160
But I'll tell you what. If they allowed Han
to refreeze, he probably could have hung out

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:54.770
in that Carbonite a lot longer without detrimental
effects, without the blind sickness.

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:59.200
And it makes a big difference because even
if I'm in a perfect position all day long,

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:03.559
it turns out that the Yogi's knew they had
to meditate in these very externally rotated,

00:47:03.559 --> 00:47:07.380
neutral positions, but then they had to stand
up and prepare the body to be able to sit

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:08.569
in those positions.

00:47:08.569 --> 00:47:12.750
Originally, the breath training, the mindful
training, the yoga, the movement practice,

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:16.370
was about being able to sit and organize.
And that's what we need to be thinking about.

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:19.980
What am I doing? And so now, we've got at
least a model, or two or three models, of

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:22.900
rolling around on a ball and doing some hip
mobility stuff.

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:29.260
Does that make sense about that? And standing
all the time is overrated, too. But this is

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:32.460
a high position. This is why everyone goes
for these little tables first at the little

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:38.880
cafe. Next question is, is it better to work
in one good position for the most of the day,

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:39.970
or mix it up?

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:45.670
What's the right answer? Mix it up. Absolutely.
Any recommendations on how to keep external

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:49.990
rotation in the shoulder, arm, when using
a touch pad? You're a plant. That was great.

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:54.320
Yeah, absolutely. So, start as best that you
can. Get as organized as efficiently as you

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.320
can.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.950
Make as few compromises, then come back in.
And what you'll notice is that it's not today

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:04.119
that you'll see change. It's a week from now,
a month from now. You'll be like, "I just

00:48:04.119 --> 00:48:07.421
feel great. This job is saving my life." And
that's where we need to be going with this.

00:48:07.421 --> 00:48:13.680
Make sure we don't have any others. We do
not see the exercises remotely. We only see

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:19.560
the slides. Any way we can use the lacrosse
ball exercises? Yes. On mobilitywod.com is

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:23.450
our Open Source network idea about trying
to put this out there.

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:27.230
So, you shouldn't have to pay for it. This
should be--. You should come out of the womb

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:32.290
and your Mom hands you a lacrosse ball. It's
all on there. And there's some links on the

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:34.119
back of these slides to those videos as well.

00:48:34.119 --> 00:48:35.420
&gt;&gt;Jonas: YouTube channel.

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:40.780
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: YouTube channel. It's all
YouTube. Absolutely. Viva la YouTube. We were

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:46.099
just saying I think we're up over three millions
users on that thing, which is insane for stretching

00:48:46.099 --> 00:48:47.099
videos.

00:48:47.099 --> 00:48:51.790
I previously worked at a standing workstation.
I found that after a while during my day,

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:56.491
my feet would hurt. What would you do to avoid
this plan? This problem. What do you do if

00:48:56.491 --> 00:48:57.849
you stand all day long and your feet hurt?

00:48:57.849 --> 00:48:58.849
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Change position.

00:48:58.849 --> 00:49:03.400
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: That's right. Changing positions,
but look what I could do at my standing work

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.730
station. There's this thing called stretching
your calf all day long. You should have the

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:11.520
most supple, long, sexy calves if you're standing
up at your workstation because it's easy to

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.250
get in there and open those up, or get the
foot up.

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:17.960
And sometimes we see downstream problems when
people get stiff and it's because their spines

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:21.099
are disorganized. Whenever you're having any
problem, ask yourself, "Is my spine in a good

00:49:21.099 --> 00:49:26.240
position or bad position?" Am I in a good
position check. Am I organized? Yes. And all

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.780
these concepts again are out there. Yes, ma'am.

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:33.430
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: Do you mind talk
about how we should walk? Do we go heel first?

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:41.231
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: That's a big can of worms,
except it's not. Really the main thing is--.

00:49:41.231 --> 00:49:48.380
Let me say. If we have full normal motion
and we watch a kid walk, it's absolutely heel

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:53.470
first. No, walking is not varied. There's
not a lot of flexion. Not a lot--.

00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:58.320
The problem is--let me just make this clear--is
that when I walk I'm usually taking a very

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:03.030
little stride and my foot is right up underneath
my body. So the force that goes through the

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:07.400
heel is transmitted underneath the base of
the support, which is not so different than

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:11.829
me falling forward and then just keeping my
feet underneath me.

00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:16.431
That's actually how children run. And if you
watch how children walk and initiate and you're

00:50:16.431 --> 00:50:20.140
like, "Georgia, get over here." And she's
like, "Sure, Dad." And then they run after

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:24.780
you and that's because that falling position
is how we maintain this neutral spine. But

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:25.780
what do I do?

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:30.990
I'm like, "No problem. There." And now I have
to make all of these cool walks. Had a girl's

00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:35.119
name as a kid. It's how I developed the cool
walk that hurt my back. So, shorter steps.

00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:39.950
You know how gymnasts walk? They're nice and
tightly organized and their feet are underneath

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:41.131
them. Does that answer your question?

00:50:41.131 --> 00:50:43.730
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: What about running?

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:49.710
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: Running? The best way to
do running is, are you pain-free? And what's

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:53.050
the best and most efficient way? We think
the best and most efficient way to run is

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:57.290
to put that ball of the foot on the ground.
Not heel strike first.

00:50:57.290 --> 00:51:01.819
But if you wanna keep heel striking, I'll
give you my physical therapy information.

00:51:01.819 --> 00:51:04.720
Running is the most dan--. Running with your
heel down is the most dangerous sport in the

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:08.359
entire world. And again, what's interesting
about running is we're like, "Oh, all kids

00:51:08.359 --> 00:51:09.369
run. It's so cute."

00:51:09.369 --> 00:51:13.390
No one taught them to run. Running is a high
skill, just like sitting. And there should

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:17.359
be some thought to it. We shouldn't take anything
about the way we move for granted. You're

00:51:17.359 --> 00:51:18.359
welcome.

00:51:18.359 --> 00:51:22.960
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: Hi. Should we be
teaching our children how to sit? At what

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.119
age? How?

00:51:24.119 --> 00:51:27.760
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: Great question. When should
you teach your children how to sit? Go home

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:34.290
and teach them how to sit. Now. As soon as
they learn. If I was a race car and my wheels

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:39.030
pointed in different directions, would that
be a problem for me?

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:43.540
Is it a problem, then, if I walk with my wheels
pointed in different directions? Absolutely.

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:47.020
And what's happening is that that arch isn't
supporting yourself. You're not walking--.

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:51.110
The analogy is that we talk about it at home
about having our kids know that their feet

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:53.670
go straight, and they walk with their feet
straight.

00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:57.040
And it's an easy cue thing. And what does
that look like to sit? Well, I'll tell you

00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.442
that all of the modern thinking about education
is don't make kids sit day long. And that's

00:52:00.442 --> 00:52:04.400
the worst thing for them. And that having
kids on the floor and having them adopt the

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:08.220
positions where they're comfortable and these
kids are stuck in these positions.

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:13.520
And you can imagine you have to suppress that
urge and terror of, [yelling] "Get out of

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:19.290
the desk." And then you learned to muffle
it down. And once we started this conversation--.

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:23.610
This is why gymnastics and some kind of system
of movement and this consciousness is a big

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:25.520
deal. Do you teach your kids how to go to
sleep? Yes?

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.829
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: Yup.

00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:30.140
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: They have to learn that.
You're gonna go to sleep now and cry for five

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.339
hours. It's OK. It'll be good for you. Do
you teach them what to eat? Yeah, absolutely.

00:52:33.339 --> 00:52:36.960
We should be teaching our children how to
stand and walk and run. Absolutely.

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:37.960
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: Thanks.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:38.960
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: You're welcome. Any other
questions?

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.819
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #9: Yeah, I got one
other question. I saw some of your videos

00:52:41.819 --> 00:52:46.720
and I saw that you had these jump stretch
bands that looked like it pulled some joints

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:50.240
apart or something like that. What's the idea
behind that, if I understood that?

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:53.359
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: Definitely not necessarily
pulling joints apart like a chicken. That's

00:52:53.359 --> 00:52:58.559
the wrong message. One of the tools that we
use all the time in the Mobilitywod is a big,

00:52:58.559 --> 00:53:01.450
thick, jump stretch rubber band. It's like
an inner tube tire.

00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:06.790
And the idea is that with that inner tube
tire, or that band, we can actually change

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:13.520
and encourage how the joint moves within the
socket. So, it's a more special motion. But

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:18.680
what ends up happening is that if you're a
thick, strong athlete with big hip capsules

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:24.790
and you're powerful, or you're just a human
whose stiff, stretching sometimes doesn't

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:27.569
affect all of the systems in a system of systems.

00:53:27.569 --> 00:53:33.060
And by using that band, we can have a much
better outcome. Our metric is, if you can't

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:37.849
see change, there's no change. It's very simple.
It should be observable, measurable, and repeatable.

00:53:37.849 --> 00:53:41.290
And that's why we know it works and that's
why I'm standing here talking to you because

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:46.619
the things that you're doing should see change
influence throughout your life. And if you

00:53:46.619 --> 00:53:51.130
can't observe it, or track the data, or see
the changes, then it's not working. And that's

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:52.130
a pretty simple model.

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:53.130
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #10: What about the
neck?

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:58.140
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: What about the neck?

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:03.640
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #10: Yeah, I tend
to go like this. How do I remind myself?

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:09.280
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: Well, so the good question
is how do I remind myself of my neck positioning?

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:14.470
Well, this mid-line stabilization concept,
the two-hand rule, actually extends all the

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:17.230
way down to the bottom of your sacrum and
to the top of your head.

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:21.630
And so, if I'm in a good position, you see
how my head is still in neutral? And it's

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:26.200
a continuation of my spine. And that, when
we pulled Jonas up and we had his head go,

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:30.079
in fact, his head is that keystone. His shoulders
went and everything else went. And so, if

00:54:30.079 --> 00:54:32.569
I can yell at my kids to sit up straight.

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:37.020
Instead, if I just say, "Hey, fix your--.
Are you tight? Are you in neutral? Fix your

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:42.059
head." Then everything else fixes. So, head
in line, but again, there are a lot of people

00:54:42.059 --> 00:54:46.710
who only ever turn their neck when they drive
and look in the back seat. And what we need

00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:47.710
is more of everything.

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:52.539
We need motion. Motion is lotion. That's why
we've got to tack and stretch. And we have

00:54:52.539 --> 00:54:55.260
lots of neck stretching and neck mobility
ideas on the site.

00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:58.549
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #11: From everything
you've said, it sounds like you'd also be

00:54:58.549 --> 00:55:04.960
a fan of the ball chairs and the chairs that
move around for strengthening your core, things

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.770
like that. Is that right or wrong?

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:11.829
&gt;&gt;Kelly Starrett: Well, I think that all tools
are tools. And so, the problem with the ball

00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:15.280
chair, if I'm sitting on a ball chair and
if you love your ball chair, stick with it

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.619
if it's working for you.

00:55:16.619 --> 00:55:20.039
What ends up happening is that people get
on this unstable ball chair surface and they're

00:55:20.039 --> 00:55:23.869
bouncing around and they feel good and then
they get tired and they have to stop that

00:55:23.869 --> 00:55:28.299
ball chair from bouncing around. And they
do that by shutting off the circuit of their

00:55:28.299 --> 00:55:30.380
spine and now they're in a flexed position.

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:33.172
Or, more importantly, 'cause you're an evolved
person and you have a ball chair, and you're

00:55:33.172 --> 00:55:38.220
like, "Bam." And now I'm overextended and
I've violated the two-hand rule from the front

00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:43.140
and I'm stable, good to go. No idea why my
belly sticks out like this, though. It's strange.

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:48.430
So, I think all tools are good and that standing
on a ball. The physio ball revolution actually

00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:54.210
came from early in the pediatrics physical
therapy, working with kids with polio. And

00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:58.020
then they actually abandoned it because it
didn't quite get what they wanted out of it.

00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:02.880
The reactive balance doesn't really transfer
into other things. So, if it helps you to

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.390
get through your day and it's another way
to get some movement in there, it's a fantastic

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:07.390
model.

00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:12.250
And it should be one more tool that allows
you to get out of your desk and thrive and

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:16.390
not get out of your desk and survive. Good?
Thank you guys so much. I appreciate your

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:17.390
time.

00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.749
[applause]
