00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.920
It's evidence for a distant giant planet
in the Solar System.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.940
So the authors here are Batygin and Brown,

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.400
and a big part of the reason
why we're back down to eight planets

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.880
is because Brown is—his other
name is—he's better known as @plutokiller

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.160
because he's the guy who kinda got Pluto
demoted from planet status to just

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.220
another dwarf planet by basically
discovering lots of other dwarf planets

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.859
and pointing out that Pluto really is nothing
special, and if we're not careful we're gonna

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.139
end up with thousands of planets in
the Solar System this way.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.260
So he's killed one, and clearly
guilt has gotten the better of him

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.560
'cause now he's trying to bring one back.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.860
Basically, they found evidence for a
large-ish ninth planet in the outer Solar System,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.760
so they haven't actually
seen the planet is the important point to get in first.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.500
They have come across
indirect evidence that there probably

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.600
is a planet out there somewhere, and
because it's indirect evidence,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.100
you can't make very definite statements about it,
but it has to be at least 10 times the

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.770
mass of the Earth. So you're talking about a serious-sized planet. It's not just, you know,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.770
another little Pluto; it really is a
serious planet we're talking about here.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.560
Planets are actually quite hard things to spot, especially ones which are a long way from the Sun,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.719
because the planet doesn't actually
give out any light of its own.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.599
All you're seeing is the reflected light from the Sun.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.520
So when you get out to large distances, there isn't a lot of reflected light out there, and so actually

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.020
by the time it gets from the Sun to the planet and then reflected back to us, they really are very faint.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.619
Plus, there's a lot of space out there.
So the way you typically

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.920
find minor bodies like asteroids and things is you take a picture and then you take

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.179
another picture and you see what's moved. Now these things are moving relatively

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:25.359
slowly, so it's being quite a tricky
exercise to actually track them down.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.299
Having said that, something this big really should be findable. So having now made a

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.529
prediction of what it roughly is and
roughly where to look for it, I suspect

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:36.649
there will now be a concerted effort and if it's there, it'll probably be found.

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.540
So the primary piece of evidence is that there are a whole bunch of these things called

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.049
Kuiper belt objects, these sort of low-mass objects in the outer Solar System.

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.729
You can see there's a whole family of
them which are all pointing in really

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.180
pretty much the same direction in space. And if you do a kind of calculations and say,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.920
"Well, what's the chances of all these
things being that closely lined up?",

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.469
it turns out there's a very low probability that
they'll get lined up that closely.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.079
So the Sun is in the middle there, and then all these very elliptical orbits that carry them around the Sun.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.809
­(BRADY) I didn't know Kuiper belt objects had orbits quite so eccentric or came that close to the Sun!

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:10.679
(PROF. MERRIFIELD) There are different families of them, but there are all these ones that cross into

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.810
the inner Solar System and then

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.040
whiz back out again. Well, it depends on how you define the inner Solar System. We think of them

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.420
all being out in this thing called the Oort cloud, but actually quite a lot of them are on these kinds of orbits

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.480
that carry them in, erm, within the orbit of Neptune,
so they don't actually come into the...

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.400
(BRADY) Oh, Neptune, they're not gonna smash into Earth.
(PROF. MERRIFIELD) No, they're not gonna smash, no, no, no.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.150
So, yes, don't worry about a Kuiper belt object falling on your head but, um, but, yeah, they do,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.260
they are on these very eccentric orbits. Now, the interesting thing about that: how do they

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.730
end up aligned like that? Well, maybe
however they got made in the first place

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.860
just had some preferential direction in it, and for whatever reason they all ended up

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.460
forming on these orbits, because it went -- once you put a planet on an orbit,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.560
it stays on the same orbit, and it will just stay there. But the interesting thing is

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.380
because they are coming quite close into the inner parts of the Solar System,

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.650
they get relatively close to some of the outer planets, and the net effect of that

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.120
over many orbits is that they'll
gravitationally interact with them and those

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.180
orbits will kinda get scattered, so
instead of pointing that way, maybe a bit later

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.510
on it will have a close encounter and end up coming out in that direction.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.849
And you can do a calculation to say, "Well, what's the lifetime, and how long will they stay if

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.480
they formed in this?", and the answer is at least, on the on the time scale of the life

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.019
of the Solar System, it's quite short. If
they formed in that pattern, they won't

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.180
have stayed in that pattern to the present day. So we know it can't just be the origins of it,

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.130
so that means it has to be
something holding them together.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.959
Now, there are usually two ways you can kind of hold a pattern of things together

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.620
like that: it can either be the gravity of the things themselves holding it

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.500
together or it can be kind of something else marshalling it, and so you can do a

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.310
calculation to figure out "OK, so how much mass is there out there in these kind

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.310
of objects, is it enough for the grav... the sort of mutual gravity of it to hold it together?"

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.030
And it turns out it fails by some very large fraction, so, actually, that can't

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.459
be the explanation, which means you need something else that's marshalling them,

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.370
and that was sort of the first piece of
evidence that you need something else

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.609
out there in that outer Solar System that actually leads to this arrangement.

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.329
People hadn't really thought about what could do that, and one of the nice things

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.660
that comes out of this paper is they've
done a whole bunch of simulations to say,

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.910
"OK, so what could be doing it?" It has to be a reasonably massive body to have this effect.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.120
It has to be about 10 times the mass of the Earth or more, and when you've got a

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.670
massive body like that, it turns out that the interaction between something on

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.100
this anti-aligned orbit with this
collection of things over here is enough

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.970
to keep them relatively well marshalled together. And you can see they're not

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.039
perfectly aligned, so actually there clearly are things going on but it's enough to

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.139
stop them from wandering too far away. And if that were the end of the story,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.440
I would kind of say, "Well, you know, it's one of those things where they found

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.650
something, and, yes, it's a low probability but maybe—how did they collect them in

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.010
the first place, how did they select the
data, which things have they ignored?"

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.390
But they found that if you make this Planet Nine on that kind of orbit, it does a

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.010
couple of other things as well, which
also turn out to be things that we

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.430
know about. So, for example, there's
another of these minor bodies, Sedna, and it

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.320
has a couple of friends as well, which is on a rather strange orbit for these

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.419
Kuiper belt objects. Most of these Kuiper belt objects are on orbits which get, at some point in their orbit,

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.500
get close to Neptune. Sedna is not on one of those orbits, and so for a long time

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.430
people have wondered "Well, how did it end up on that orbit, given that we think that

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.470
the way you end up with these kinds of
orbits is by close interactions with

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.979
with Neptune?" And what they found is that if you got this Planet Nine, once in a while

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.190
it kicks something off one of these sort
of Neptune encountering orbits onto a

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.890
completely different orbit, just like the
kind of orbit that Sedna's on.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.340
So now they've got an explanation for where Sedna comes from. And then the final piece

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.700
of the jigsaw is they also found, sort of unexpectedly while they were doing this

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.490
calculation, is that there's a completely different family of planets as well,

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.070
minor planets as well, so these Kuiper belt objects which end up on orbits which are

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.430
kind of perpendicular to the plane of
the Solar System, so all these things are

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.990
more or less in the plane of the solar
system.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.030
You end up with another family which is almost perpendicular to it, and they thought,

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.719
"Well, that can't be right" and then, but then they went and checked and it turns out

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:35.639
there are a whole bunch of things on these perpendicular orbits as well.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.560
So, by invoking this one rather extreme idea, namely there's a ninth, rather large planet in

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.870
the outer Solar System, you can explain three things, and, scientifically,

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.160
that starts to look like a win, right? In science, if you can, if you dream up something which only

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.080
explains one thing, you kind of think
"Well, you know, that could be

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.240
anything, could be that, could be something else," but it starts to get more efficient

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.400
if you've got one thing you've dreamed up that actually explains three different things.

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.490
At that point, you start to say, "Well, that's, maybe that's, you know, the evidence

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.849
is building up, maybe that really is the
way things work, and maybe there is

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:09.159
that ninth planet lurking out there somewhere."
So it'll have to be one of these things that sort

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:13.729
of like an ice giant like Neptune or Uranus, one of those big, gaseous,

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.921
very cold bodies. When you do simulations of the formation of the Solar System

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.890
or stellar systems with planets around them,

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.320
you do, actually, sometimes find that the planetary system starts to form, and then

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.550
several of the big planets which are forming have a close encounter with each other,

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.350
and one of them kinda gets gravitationally
kicked out.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.870
So it is, actually, quite plausible
there could be a large body which

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.030
probably initially formed rather closer to the Sun but then as the

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.420
system formed, that then got kicked out onto one of these orbits. Now, then you have to

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.460
do something else to it, because if you just kick it out, it will end up on a very elliptical orbit,

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.370
but if it gets gets kicked out and then encounters some of the minor bodies out there or

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.610
gas or something that it can gravitationally interact with, then it can get on the

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.830
more circular orbit and end up very much like the planet we see.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.430
