hi my name is torn or B and I work on

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980
hi my name is torn or B and I work on
 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.820
hi my name is torn or B and I work on
the tools Android team so today I want

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830
the tools Android team so today I want
 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.980
the tools Android team so today I want
to show you the brand new IDE that we

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990
to show you the brand new IDE that we
 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.919
to show you the brand new IDE that we
have for Android as you can see here it

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929
have for Android as you can see here it
 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:16.820
have for Android as you can see here it
looks sort of dark

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830
looks sort of dark
 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.460
looks sort of dark
that's a optional dark theme that a lot

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
that's a optional dark theme that a lot
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.460
that's a optional dark theme that a lot
of us have liked a lot and on the left

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470
of us have liked a lot and on the left
 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.200
of us have liked a lot and on the left
here you can see the project Explorer

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210
here you can see the project Explorer
 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.279
here you can see the project Explorer
which shows you the files in your

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
which shows you the files in your
 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.109
which shows you the files in your
project then we have the code editor in

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119
project then we have the code editor in
 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.880
project then we have the code editor in
the center and the code editor is really

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890
the center and the code editor is really
 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.009
the center and the code editor is really
the star of this IDE it is a very very

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
the star of this IDE it is a very very
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.010
the star of this IDE it is a very very
intelligent editor that can do really

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020
intelligent editor that can do really
 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.990
intelligent editor that can do really
really fast refactoring code completion

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000
really fast refactoring code completion
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.430
really fast refactoring code completion
and so forth and I want to show a few of

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440
and so forth and I want to show a few of
 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.729
and so forth and I want to show a few of
those edit features in detail today

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739
those edit features in detail today
 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.869
those edit features in detail today
alright so here we're looking at some

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
alright so here we're looking at some
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.959
alright so here we're looking at some
pretty typical Android code but notice

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
pretty typical Android code but notice
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.850
pretty typical Android code but notice
that we have some hard-coded strings

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860
that we have some hard-coded strings
 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.529
that we have some hard-coded strings
here or what appear to be hard-coded

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
here or what appear to be hard-coded
 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.180
here or what appear to be hard-coded
strings turns out they're actually not

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190
strings turns out they're actually not
 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.939
strings turns out they're actually not
this IDE can present these strings as if

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
this IDE can present these strings as if
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.220
this IDE can present these strings as if
they had been hard-coded so you can see

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230
they had been hard-coded so you can see
 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.990
they had been hard-coded so you can see
here as I hover I can see the real code

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
here as I hover I can see the real code
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.060
here as I hover I can see the real code
I can click on it and I can go in and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070
I can click on it and I can go in and
 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.830
I can click on it and I can go in and
actually look at the real string but the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
actually look at the real string but the
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.360
actually look at the real string but the
ID gives me a much simpler view of the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
ID gives me a much simpler view of the
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.660
ID gives me a much simpler view of the
code which makes it a lot easier to read

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670
code which makes it a lot easier to read
 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.280
code which makes it a lot easier to read
and we don't just do that for Strings if

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290
and we don't just do that for Strings if
 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.810
and we don't just do that for Strings if
you look further down here you can see

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820
you look further down here you can see
 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.810
you look further down here you can see
we are manipulating some icons and over

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820
we are manipulating some icons and over
 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.490
we are manipulating some icons and over
in the gutter on the left you can see

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
in the gutter on the left you can see
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.950
in the gutter on the left you can see
the real icon itself and we also help

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960
the real icon itself and we also help
 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.890
the real icon itself and we also help
you with the completion here so if I

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
you with the completion here so if I
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.510
you with the completion here so if I
invoke code completion or and just do

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
invoke code completion or and just do
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.359
invoke code completion or and just do
show doc with f1 you can see we get this

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
show doc with f1 you can see we get this
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.280
show doc with f1 you can see we get this
completion dialog which shows me all the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290
completion dialog which shows me all the
 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.649
completion dialog which shows me all the
assets as well and that works not just

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
assets as well and that works not just
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.630
assets as well and that works not just
for icons but for strings as well so if

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640
for icons but for strings as well so if
 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.999
for icons but for strings as well so if
I for example click on on this one you

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
I for example click on on this one you
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.490
I for example click on on this one you
can see we have actually we only have

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
can see we have actually we only have
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.069
can see we have actually we only have
two translations for that string and

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079
two translations for that string and
 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.179
two translations for that string and
furthermore this all also works on

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189
furthermore this all also works on
 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.100
furthermore this all also works on
colors so if I jump to for example the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
colors so if I jump to for example the
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.530
colors so if I jump to for example the
color file you can see that we see all

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
color file you can see that we see all
 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.249
color file you can see that we see all
the colors previewed in the gutter let's

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
the colors previewed in the gutter let's
 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.190
the colors previewed in the gutter let's
take a look at the code again one of the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
take a look at the code again one of the
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.929
take a look at the code again one of the
really nice things about this new IDE is

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939
really nice things about this new IDE is
 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.429
really nice things about this new IDE is
that it does really deep code analysis

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439
that it does really deep code analysis
 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.080
that it does really deep code analysis
so if I for example scroll to the bottom

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
so if I for example scroll to the bottom
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.780
so if I for example scroll to the bottom
here you can see that it has highlighted

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
here you can see that it has highlighted
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.219
here you can see that it has highlighted
this line and it's saying that this is a

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
this line and it's saying that this is a
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.380
this line and it's saying that this is a
potential nullpointerexception the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390
potential nullpointerexception the
 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.940
potential nullpointerexception the
reason it knows that is that we have

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950
reason it knows that is that we have
 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.459
reason it knows that is that we have
added annotations into the Android

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469
added annotations into the Android
 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.920
added annotations into the Android
platform so we know which methods can

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
platform so we know which methods can
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.859
platform so we know which methods can
return all which methods can't and in

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869
return all which methods can't and in
 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.080
return all which methods can't and in
fact we also know for example which

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
fact we also know for example which
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.490
fact we also know for example which
constants are allowed

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500
constants are allowed
 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.190
constants are allowed
which api's so it is flagging this call

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200
which api's so it is flagging this call
 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.560
which api's so it is flagging this call
right up here to set layout direction

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570
right up here to set layout direction
 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.840
right up here to set layout direction
right which looks good but you can see

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850
right which looks good but you can see
 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.190
right which looks good but you can see
it's telling me that the concept we were

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200
it's telling me that the concept we were
 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.350
it's telling me that the concept we were
expected the pass in here is one of

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360
expected the pass in here is one of
 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.650
expected the pass in here is one of
these named constants and so we use this

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660
these named constants and so we use this
 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.360
these named constants and so we use this
data not just for code analysis but for

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370
data not just for code analysis but for
 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.610
data not just for code analysis but for
code completion as well so for example

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620
code completion as well so for example
 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.360
code completion as well so for example
context get system service you now if I

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370
context get system service you now if I
 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.770
context get system service you now if I
invoke code completion you can see it's

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780
invoke code completion you can see it's
 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.810
invoke code completion you can see it's
offering all the valid strings which is

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820
offering all the valid strings which is
 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.190
offering all the valid strings which is
a which is something we couldn't do in

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200
a which is something we couldn't do in
 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.110
a which is something we couldn't do in
the past you can invoke actions using

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120
the past you can invoke actions using
 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.240
the past you can invoke actions using
the show action dialog so I'm going to

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250
the show action dialog so I'm going to
 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.550
the show action dialog so I'm going to
type inspect code and you can see

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560
type inspect code and you can see
 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.860
type inspect code and you can see
inspect code lets me run on the whole

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870
inspect code lets me run on the whole
 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.380
inspect code lets me run on the whole
project or individual files and this is

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390
project or individual files and this is
 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.479
project or individual files and this is
how you basically run code inspections

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489
how you basically run code inspections
 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.540
how you basically run code inspections
and we've integrated lint so you get all

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550
and we've integrated lint so you get all
 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.220
and we've integrated lint so you get all
the lint errors but you also get a lot

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230
the lint errors but you also get a lot
 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.860
the lint errors but you also get a lot
of code analysis that IntelliJ already

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870
of code analysis that IntelliJ already
 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.860
of code analysis that IntelliJ already
comes with and it's really great at

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870
comes with and it's really great at
 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.080
comes with and it's really great at
finding a lot of bugs in your code now

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090
finding a lot of bugs in your code now
 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.810
finding a lot of bugs in your code now
let's talk about layout so if I jump

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820
let's talk about layout so if I jump
 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.260
let's talk about layout so if I jump
into a layout file like this one you can

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270
into a layout file like this one you can
 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.330
into a layout file like this one you can
see that we now offer you a preview on

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340
see that we now offer you a preview on
 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.460
see that we now offer you a preview on
the right of the layout and this preview

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470
the right of the layout and this preview
 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.130
the right of the layout and this preview
stays in sync with my edits so if I for

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140
stays in sync with my edits so if I for
 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.930
stays in sync with my edits so if I for
example click on this text right here

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940
example click on this text right here
 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.810
example click on this text right here
and I change the text let's see what

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820
and I change the text let's see what
 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.910
and I change the text let's see what
should we change it to about to reset

update and the reason that this one
 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.930
update and the reason that this one
didn't is because this is using a

create other item in the layout editor

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830
create other item in the layout editor
 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.890
