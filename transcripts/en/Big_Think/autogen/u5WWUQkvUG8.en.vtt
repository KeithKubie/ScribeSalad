00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.370
think it was you know to be with the
soul to be with them before they

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380
soul to be with them before they
 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.900
soul to be with them before they
actually went through basic training and

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910
actually went through basic training and
 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.210
actually went through basic training and
be went from civilian to soldiers and

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220

made that transition it was I wanted to
 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.900
made that transition it was I wanted to
be with them at that at the point in

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910
be with them at that at the point in
 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.520
be with them at that at the point in
their life before that so we can know

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530
their life before that so we can know
 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.830
their life before that so we can know
who they were before and why they made

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840
who they were before and why they made
 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.490
who they were before and why they made

really that that transition from
 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.670
really that that transition from
civilian to soldier where it's the the

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680
civilian to soldier where it's the the
 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.640
civilian to soldier where it's the the
total control period where they're they

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650
total control period where they're they
 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.870
total control period where they're they
can't do anything they can't read

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880
can't do anything they can't read
 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.279
can't do anything they can't read
anything and it's that the very

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289
anything and it's that the very
 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:00.839
anything and it's that the very
stereotypical scene of the sergeants

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849
stereotypical scene of the sergeants
 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.730

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.520
and humanely
and that slowly changes they have this I

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530
and that slowly changes they have this I
 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.620

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850
then white phase of bootcamp which they
 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.439
then white phase of bootcamp which they
go through and the red is a really

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449
go through and the red is a really
 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:20.719
go through and the red is a really
intense one but boot camp was you know

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729
intense one but boot camp was you know
 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:22.550
intense one but boot camp was you know

what they go through and whether it's
 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.330
what they go through and whether it's
it's the different training it seems so
