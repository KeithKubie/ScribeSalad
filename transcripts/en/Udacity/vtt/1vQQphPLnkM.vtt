00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.910
To reinforce your understanding
of reinforcement learning,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.840
you're going to take on
a project from a new technology.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.370
In the first video in this unit,
we actually talked about smart cabs, and

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.390
that's the project you're going to do.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.120
Given some information about
maintenance, about navigation,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.880
about safety,
can you design a smart cab that can

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.630
learn over time how to
drive safely on the roads?

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.770
Can you design a smart cab that will
learn over time how to avoid accidents

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.350
that have happened in the past?

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.738
Or can optimize its route more
efficiently in the future?

00:00:25.738 --> 00:00:27.620
That's what you'll deliver for
this final project.
