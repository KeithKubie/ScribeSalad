00:00:09.298 --> 00:00:13.349
In the ocean’s depths,
two titans wage battle:

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.086
the sperm whale and the colossal squid.

00:00:17.086 --> 00:00:21.318
Sperm whales use echolocation 
to hunt these squid for food,

00:00:21.318 --> 00:00:26.799
but even against this gigantic animal,
squid can put up an impressive fight.

00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:30.949
Scientists know this because on the bodies
of washed-up whales,

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.970
they frequently find huge, 
round suction scars,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.200
emblazoned there by large, 
grasping tentacles.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.238
Ranging in size from 
this giant’s impressive 14 meters

00:00:43.238 --> 00:00:47.108
to the 2.5 centimeters 
of the southern pygmy squid,

00:00:47.108 --> 00:00:52.149
these creatures fall into the group 
of animals known as cephalopods.

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.050
There are about 500 squid 
species worldwide,

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.530
and they live in all the world’s oceans,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.348
making them a reliable food source
for whales,

00:01:00.348 --> 00:01:01.278
dolphins,

00:01:01.278 --> 00:01:02.150
sharks,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.969
seabirds,

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:03.787
fish,

00:01:03.787 --> 00:01:05.879
and even other squid.

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:09.609
Indeed, squid themselves 
are fearsome ocean predators.

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:12.139
But their most extraordinary adaptations

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:16.850
are those that have evolved 
to help them thwart their predators.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.959
Squid, which can be found mainly

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:22.757
in estuarine, deep-sea, 
and open-water habitats,

00:01:22.757 --> 00:01:25.289
often swim together in shoals.

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.307
Being out in the open without anywhere 
to hide makes them vulnerable,

00:01:29.307 --> 00:01:34.628
so as a first line of defense,
they rely on large, well-developed eyes.

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:38.868
In the colossal squid, 
these are the size of dinner plates,

00:01:38.868 --> 00:01:42.216
the largest known eyes 
in the animal kingdom.

00:01:42.216 --> 00:01:44.716
When it’s dark or the water is murky, 
however,

00:01:44.716 --> 00:01:47.538
squid rely on a secondary sensory system,

00:01:47.538 --> 00:01:53.058
made from thousands of tiny hair cells 
that are only about twelve microns long

00:01:53.058 --> 00:01:56.089
and run along their heads and arms.

00:01:56.089 --> 00:02:00.998
Each of these hair cells is attached
to axons in the nervous system.

00:02:00.998 --> 00:02:03.077
Swimming animals create a wake,

00:02:03.077 --> 00:02:06.448
so when the hairs on 
the squid’s body detect this motion,

00:02:06.448 --> 00:02:08.379
they send a signal to the brain,

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.910
which helps it determine 
the direction of the water’s flow.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.269
This way, a squid can sense an oncoming 
predator in even the dimmest waters.

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.640
Aware of the threat, a squid 
can then mask itself from a predator.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.548
Squid skin contains thousands
of tiny organs called chromatophores,

00:02:27.548 --> 00:02:33.594
each made of black, brown, red 
or yellow pigments and ringed in muscle.

00:02:33.594 --> 00:02:36.394
Reflecting cells beneath 
the chromatophores

00:02:36.394 --> 00:02:40.630
mirror the squid’s surroundings,
enabling it to blend in.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.877
So, when the muscles contract,

00:02:42.877 --> 00:02:45.128
the color of the pigment is exposed,

00:02:45.128 --> 00:02:48.760
whereas when the muscles relax 
the colors are hidden.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.318
Each of these chromatophores

00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:53.898
is under the individual control 
of the squid’s nervous system,

00:02:53.898 --> 00:02:57.059
so while some expand, 
others remain contracted.

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:59.418
That enables countershading,

00:02:59.418 --> 00:03:03.068
where the underside of the squid
is lighter than the top,

00:03:03.068 --> 00:03:07.659
to eliminate a silhouette 
that a predator might spy from below.

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.099
Some predators, however, 
like the whales and dolphins,

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:17.116
get around this ruse by using sound waves
to detect a squid’s camouflaged form.

00:03:17.116 --> 00:03:22.310
Not to be outfoxed, the squid still 
has two more tricks up its sleeve.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.799
The first involves ink, 
produced inside its mantle.

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.419
Squid ink is made mostly of mucus
and melanin,

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.400
which produces its dark coloring.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.497
When squid eject the ink,

00:03:34.497 --> 00:03:36.879
they either use it to make 
a large smokescreen

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.238
that completely blocks the predator’s view

00:03:39.238 --> 00:03:44.619
or a blob that roughly mimics the size 
and shape of the squid.

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:48.594
This creates a phantom form, 
called a pseudomorph,

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:52.568
that tricks the predator 
into thinking it’s the real squid.

00:03:52.568 --> 00:03:56.329
As a final touch, 
squid rely on jet propulsion

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.251
to rapidly shoot away from their hunters,

00:03:59.251 --> 00:04:05.298
reaching speeds of up to 25 miles per hour
and moving meters away in mere seconds.

00:04:05.298 --> 00:04:09.409
This makes them 
Earth’s fastest invertebrates.

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.679
Some squid species have also developed 
unique adaptive behaviors.

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:16.749
The deep-sea vampire squid,
when startled,

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:21.041
uses its webbed arms to make 
a cape it hides behind.

00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:25.188
The tiny bobtail, on the other hand, 
tosses sand over its body

00:04:25.188 --> 00:04:28.019
as it burrows away from prying eyes.

00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:32.619
The Pacific flying squid 
uses jet propulsion for another purpose:

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:35.700
to launch itself right out of the water.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.478
Squids’ inventive adaptations 
have allowed them

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:41.849
to proliferate 
for over 500 million years.

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.799
Even now, 
we’re still uncovering new species.

00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:46.179
And as we do,

00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:50.369
we’re bound to discover even more
about how these stealthy cephalopods

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:54.930
have mastered survival 
in the deep and unforgiving sea.
