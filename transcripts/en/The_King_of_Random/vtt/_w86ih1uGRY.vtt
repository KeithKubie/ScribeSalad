00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.359
hey guys!

00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:02.489
I'm nate welcome back to the workshop today we're going

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.150
to be building our very own gumball machine using easily available parts and materials

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.939
Here's what we'll be using to build our gumball machine first we have an angled plastic candy jar we have a piece of?

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.219
foam core board that a lot of the internal workings will be built out of a plastic bottle with straight sidewalls

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.459
plastic bowl that came in a pack of four for just a couple of bucks some small diameter wooden dowels of course a bunch of

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.519
Gumballs the hot glue gun a circle compass and exacto knife and we're gonna be using a drill even though it's not strictly necessary

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.500
To start off let's take our

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.079
foam core board and start cutting out a few shapes the first thing we'll build is the mechanism that catches the gum ball inside the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.209
container and drops them down into the dispenser here's the basic idea of how this mechanism will work

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.159
dowel will go through a hole in our foam core board that will spin around and we'll have a small

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.219
cup that can catch our gum ball inside the container then the whole device will be a circle

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.460
the gum ball will fall out of the machine down into the circle with the notch cut out and then as we twist it it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.579
will get dropped out of the bottom into the dispensing device

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.150
now this is an

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.290
extremely rough

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.129
Drawing of how this device is going to work but it does work as something of a measurement tool we can see that the gum?

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.519
Ball will fit in a slot that size we want to be sure that it's the same

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.040
distance on all sides of our axle

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.779
So we can take a rough measurement of this circle that i've drawn and we come up with about

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.489
two and a quarter inches so that is the size of circle that we will make our mechanism

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.339
Since we want our final circle to be two and a quarter inches in diameter we need to set our radius at one and 1/8

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.979
inches wide

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.879
to make sure that our mechanism is wide enough to hold the gumball well we need to cut out four of these circles

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.359
We can see that with four pieces of our foam core it's wider than the gumball so we should be able to

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.789
completely contain the gumball inside the mechanism

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:29.259
Like cutting the notch out of one circle and then tracing it on to another we can be relatively certain that we'll get the same

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
size and shape every time

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.480
you

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.169
go our gumball fitting nicely inside the notch cut out in our mechanism now let's glue these four pieces together

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.299
drill a hole down through the center and we'll use that to attach the axle which will be made from our wooden dowel

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.020
as a test fitting let's fit the dowel through the hole that we just carved see how this is looking

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.849
that's exactly what we were hoping for right there mechanism will catch the gumball

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.600
Rotate and drop it down into the dispenser now you may have noticed that there's an issue with this mechanism if we put it like

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.629
this it will catch the gumball and then the gumball will just drop right out

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.560
And that's not the goal so let's build a box that fits around this

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.779
mechanism so that there are side walls keeping the gumball from falling out until we want it to

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.300
we want our box to contain the rotating mechanism

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.050
but

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.749
We want it to be very close to the edges so let's cut out a square

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.769
That's got the same diameter as our circle two and one-quarter inches

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.379
we go to squares that fit just about

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.280
perfectly around our

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.879
interior

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.908
mechanism now we just need to add a couple of holes so that our axle can run through the sides of the box as well

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.269
See now how the sides of our box are going to contain the gum ball

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.699
so it doesn't fall out and tell we're ready for it to now at this point when i turn it it'll just fall out on

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.179
The side here because we haven't added the sides to our box yet

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.080
now our mechanism isn't

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.280
Perfectly round and largely that's because when you cut something out using the exacto knife it's hard to follow the lines just the way you

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.820
want sometimes the knife will be at an angle sometimes you'll miss your mark a little bit

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.169
To make sure that our wheel isn't going to start rubbing on the sides of the box i'm

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.729
Looking at a little bit of a high point here so i'm gonna try and take that down to some sandpaper just

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.669
To make sure everything will turn easily once it's all put together

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.949
alright i think that did a pretty good job

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.758
None of the ridges are standing up as higher than the others at this point so i suspect

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.848
That'll help it rotate even more smoothly inside our box

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.459
At this point we want to start building our box around this mechanism so let's give ourselves a little bit of

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:13.059
Extra dowel on either side clip it off and then glue the mechanism in place so that it's firmly affixed

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.849
To the dowel by applying the glue

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.449
To the dowel and then pushing our little mechanism over the glue

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:26.379
hopefully we've smeared glue on the inside in between the dowel and the mechanism so that it will be nice and firmly attached

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.859
We're doing that because as i said we're gonna want the mechanism inside to rotate but we don't want the box itself

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.409
To rotate with the mechanism firmly attached

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:41.769
To our dowel axle and the sides of the box freely spinning it's now time to add the other sides to our box

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.569
measure how wide we want those to be just by putting it down on top of our foam core

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.080
drawing where we want to cut it

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.829
with our side pieces cut out now let's attach them, to the other sides of our box

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:11.970
there we go now with the sides of our box attached our gum ball doesn't fall out until it gets to the bottom and

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.809
we're actually going to take the bottom of our box and add a

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:22.170
Little bit of a lip on either side so that become al doesn't fall out until it's right down in the middle of the bottom

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.659
now before

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:30.729
We attach these two pieces which will direct the gum bowl to fall out into the middle we're also going

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:37.568
To add a small piece in either corner to make sure that the gum ball doesn't try and get stuck in this little spot

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.939
When it's upside-down

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
now that we have those two pieces in place

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.609
let's attach these two to direct the gum ball to only fall out the very center of the bottom of our mechanism

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.899
We've got our mechanism assembled now let's test it out by dropping in a gumball and see if we can get it to drop out

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.900
The bottom

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:12.009
go

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:18.489
perfect with our mechanism built we now want to attach it to the bottom of our angled container the first step will be drilling or

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.490
cutting a hole in the center of our container

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:26.499
Large enough to fit over the opening of the mechanism but small enough that we're not going to have gumballs is pouring out everywhere

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.430
i

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:43.269
was exciting didn't think about the bit getting quite that much grip on the container but it did

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.060
we can now see that if we set our mechanism right beneath that hole it should

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:57.459
feed the gumballs pretty well down into it to help make sure that the gumballs really get funneled in

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.609
Let's cut down the edges of the sides of the box on the inside just a little bit so that they have a sort of

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:10.750
Downward slope into the candy catching portion to make sure we don't get too many let's raise up the bottom of our mechanism

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.229
So it's a little bit closer to the top that way the gumball will sit at the very edge and then the second gumball won't

00:08:17.229 --> 00:08:19.229
Be able to fit in let's try that

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.339
the bottom of our candy bowl has just a slight

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.450
concavity to it so we want to make our mechanism fit flush up against that

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.949
So to make it work what we want to do is take down the edges just a little

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:41.088
bit at an angle so that they fit nicely with the shape of our pool

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:49.700
it's like only one at a time fall down into mechanism now that's just one seat

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.089
even if there's others on top of it they just get pushed out of the way

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:59.299
Perfect our mechanism is now working nicely with the hole we have in the bottom of our bowl so let's glue it in place

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.850
So it's permanently attached

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.879
We now have a bowl and we have our dispenser mechanism so we need to attach them

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.010
To the tower in the base that will be part of the gumball machine

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.390
to start let's cut the top off of this water bottle as flat and level e as we can

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.830
To help as a guide i'm gonna wrap some tape around it and if the tape lays

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.499
perfectly straight then we should be able to get a nice clean cut

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:27.890
there we go that tape is pretty straight the fact that it met up almost exactly where it started means that it's lying

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:34.700
Pretty much in a straight circle around the bottle it may not be a hundred percent perfect but fortunately it doesn't have to be

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:44.449
now, we can see that the whole mechanism can fit nicely into the bottle but of course the wooden dowel sticking out in the front

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.580
In the back is impeding it from fitting inside

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:52.939
so what we want to do is trim off the dowel in the back and then we'll drill a hole into the front of the

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:58.340
Bottle and we'll be able to fit that through the hole and have it sit down inside the bottle entirely

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.309
When our candy container is resting on the bottle we can see the height that we're going to need a hole

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:09.350
For our turning mechanism to leave the bottle it's marked out with a pen and then drill out a hole

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.819
we're only going to want the mechanism that we turn on the front to be about a

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:23.540
Quarter of an inch away from the bottle so we can trim down this dowel fair bit as well i used some heavy wire cutters

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.679
To clip the dowel on the back but i want the dowel to be a little bit smoother in the front so i'm going to

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.680
try cutting through it with a hacksaw

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:38.239
there we go with our dowel shortened a little bit hopefully we can now fit the whole mechanism down inside our bog

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.209
there we go if you gumball

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:49.100
Should be able to just drop one down hey there it's going

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.149
but as you can see we're just dropping gum balls down inside of a sealed container

00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:02.029
So what we need to build is a small ramp that we can connect to the mechanism inside out

00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:07.878
To the front of the bottle i think this will be too long but let's start out by cutting a piece about four inches long

00:11:08.149 --> 00:11:14.299
let's make our ramp wide enough that the gum ball can easily fit even after we've added some walls that will keep it from rolling

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.300
Off, to the side?

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.740
that should give us a line up ramp for a gumball to roll right out

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:35.700
We also need to have enough space that the gumball can fit out the bottom of the mechanism so we can't have it flat up

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.459
Against it of course and even if we angle it there's not

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.650
Really enough room for it to get out we need to angle it and

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:45.090
Add a little bit of a spacer so let's add some space onto the back of our ramp

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.570
One thing to keep in mind is that we are going to want this ramp at a bit of an angle so if we cut

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.709
the bottom of our spacer it should sit at an angle on our ramp

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.219
you, can see that i've cut an angle

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.409
and when i glue it onto the back of our ramp it won't sit straight up and down at a 90 degree angle

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.740
It will sit a bit like that now it is going to attach

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.580
To this back portion of our

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.910
Mechanism so to just give it a little bit better of a grip let's fill in the gap in between these two pieces

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.669
now our ramp will have something nice and solid to attach to

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.529
of course we will need a hole cut into our bottle before the gumballs to get out through

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:31.709
we can line our ramp up with our mechanism and see approximately what height you need to cut that hole

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.490
This will be the bottom of the hole and then we need to have enough space

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.900
for our ramp to pass through and for a gumball to easily fit through

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.859
to get a good height for the side walls of our ramp we can line our ramp

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:55.089
along one piece of, foam core and then trace out the shape

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:05.409
Now, we have a piece that fits in nicely but is too tall and would get in the way of the mechanism so we need

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.529
to cut off the sidewall at the same height as this backing piece

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.709
That's one wall of our ramp now let's do the same thing on the other side

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.940
now let's use our glue to attach the two side walls on your ramp

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:27.729
there we go a ramp with walls so the gumball can't fall out and land in the bottom of our container i

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.980
think that is looking pretty dang good

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:35.109
This is more ramp than a gumball delivery system really needs so let's trim this off

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.270
With our gumball delivery system we also want to make sure that it's easy for us to grab the gumball out

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.540
So at the end of our ramp let's lower the wall height a little bit

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.350
So it's easier to grab and

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:52.209
Now because we don't necessarily want our gumball just shooting out onto the floor or a desk let's add a front piece onto this to

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.210
stop it from rolling when you don't want it to

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:59.139
at this point our ramp is complete and we just need to attach it to our dispensing mechanism

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.779
now this might be one of the most delicate

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:08.410
Pieces of this entire build we need to attach the glue onto the ramp and then fit it in through the hole and

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.290
press it up against the bottom of the mechanism

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:18.069
And at this point we can also start making our other connections permanent we can use the glue to attach the bottle to our candy

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:23.830
container and run some glue along the outside of the front of the ramp to fold everything rigidly in place

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:29.140
At this point all the moving parts of our gumball machine should be functional so let's pour in some gumballs and give it a test

00:14:37.089 --> 00:14:42.599
I wanted to make sure it didn't bounce out it would be super easy to just add a slightly higher wall

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.039
But it doesn't bother me now that everything is working at this point there are only two things left

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.390
To do one is to cut a hole in the bottom of this bowl so we can fit our

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:57.180
bottle down inside it and the other is to add something that makes it a little bit easier to turn our mechanism i have a

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:01.229
Roll of tape that is almost the exact same diameter as our bottle so i'm going

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.140
To use that to trace out a circle onto our bowl and then cut that out

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:15.239
Nice there we go our bottle fits nicely inside of our bowl so let's just use some glue to attach that and make it permanent

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:22.199
we're gonna try and use one of these king of random logos as our turning mechanism

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.570
so i've peeled the sticker off and i'm just gonna attach this onto our foam core and i'll cut that out

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.900
work

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.810
Now let's see if we can get the sticker to peel off

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.720
For just a minute so i can drill a hole into the phone cord

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
we apply our sticker right

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:08.710
Now the glue has set all the way we should be able to twist the internal mechanism by twisting the logo

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.439
let's fill er up with gumballs and she'll be ready to go

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.470
needs more gumballs

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.210
gumball

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:37.420
It's a pretty fun little build and you can probably even get it to work with things other than gumballs

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:42.609
i haven't tried but there may be other small candies which would fit in here nicely as well i think about everything at this build

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:48.400
from walmart and i don't think i spent more than like 12 bucks the only thing i didn't get from walmart was the gumballs

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.579
themselves and i got those from my local grocery store where they're sold in bulk

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.530
thanks for joining us for this video and don't forget to come gear yourself up with hats shirts and other cool merch at the king

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.530
of, random calm see you there

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.180
foam core board that will be

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.820
when you really really need to go

00:17:15.689 --> 00:17:17.689
you
