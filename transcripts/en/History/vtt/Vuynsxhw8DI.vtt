00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:02.669
[music playing]

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:07.540
NARRATOR: Off Alaska's southern
coast sits one of the most

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.109
dangerous spots on any map.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.780
Kodiak Island.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.184
3,600 square miles of
windswept unforgiving land.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:21.388
Home to some of the most
unique wildlife in the world,

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:25.191
including the
fiercest predators,

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.528
the Kodiak Brown Bear.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.830
While most wouldn't
dare to tread here,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.334
Mike Horstman wouldn't dream
of living anywhere else.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:37.303
First thing I ever killed when
I was a kid in upstate New York

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:38.638
was a bear.

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:40.707
I've always been
fascinated by them.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.842
I always liked to hunt them.

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:48.448
I moved to Kodiak in
1979 to hunt brown bears.

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:52.886
I have sacrificed everything
just to hunt bears.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:56.055
NARRATOR: Over nearly 40 years,
Mike's carved out a homestead

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:58.691
overlooking the Gulf
of Alaska and hidden

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:01.928
away from the world of men.

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:04.030
MIKE HORSTMAN (VOICEOVER): I
live out here, because there's

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.132
nobody else out here.

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:08.067
Bears are the only thing here.

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.869
And I wouldn't have
it any other way.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:14.841
NARRATOR: Kodiak
bears are the largest

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.309
brown bear in the world.

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:20.113
And here on the island,
the population is thriving.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:23.383
With an average of one
bear per square mile,

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:25.685
Mike makes his living
as a guide to outlanders

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:31.324
looking to hunt the big game
during the 11 week bear season.

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:35.328
I've guided bears on Kodiak
Island for over 30 years.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:39.132
A lot of guys, this is
the hunt of a lifetime,

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:42.469
primarily because the
largest bears in the world

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.070
come from Kodiak.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.472
NARRATOR: The rest
of the year, Mike

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:48.641
survives on a small inlet
known as Eagle Harbor,

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.377
50 miles away from
any other human

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:53.680
and 30 miles from the mainland.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.684
But on Kodiak, Mike
is never alone,

00:01:57.684 --> 00:02:00.487
even in the deepest winter.

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:03.056
These bears, it's not
unusual that some of them

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.491
don't go hibernate.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:07.160
There's always one or two
that are wandering around.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.362
They didn't get enough
to eat in the fall.

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:12.332
And they'll be poking
around, causing trouble.

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.901
NARRATOR: Without a
reliable hibernation cycle,

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:18.171
the island's bears are
a year round threat that

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:21.508
require a constant defense.

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:25.645
I've got that trail camera up
here alongside this bear trail.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:28.915
We're going to go check that
and see what's going on.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:32.018
I'd like to not have a
picture of anything on it.

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:34.687
If all we had is a picture
of a fox or a deer,

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:36.422
that would be perfect.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:37.790
NARRATOR: To help
keep safe, Mike

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.893
makes daily rounds
of his property

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:44.364
looking for signs of predators
moving in on his turf.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.466
What do you smell?

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:47.300
What do you smell?

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.637
Something, huh?

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:51.971
[music playing]

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.175
You stay close to me.

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:57.076
You stay close.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:04.050
[bleep]

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:09.322
There has been a
bear through here.

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:12.825
I'm concerned that he
could still be around,

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:15.228
traveling down this
trail, that he's going

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:18.932
in the direction of the cabin.

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:20.433
NARRATOR: Mike's
inland hunting cabin,

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.468
5 miles deep in
the Bear Country,

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:25.838
is a frequent target
for break-ins.

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:27.774
You stay close to me.

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.108
Stay close.

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:30.376
Right here.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:32.912
Right here.

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:34.581
What do you smell?

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:36.583
Pay attention, now.

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:38.451
[music playing]

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:57.103
It looks like something's been
in here and tore the door open,

00:03:57.103 --> 00:04:01.374
tipped the freezer
over, clawed around.

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:04.744
Probably disappointed
nothing to eat.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.245
The bear, apparently,
just went in there

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:09.782
and had its way with the
freezer for a few minutes.

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:12.652
But there's no fish or bait
or anything laying around.

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:16.789
So we were fortunate there.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.625
Screen's intact.

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:23.129
All the windows are
intact back here.

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.998
I don't see any other
sign of the bear

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:26.499
going around the house.

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:27.967
NARRATOR: The unusual
behavior makes

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:29.802
the bears a constant threat.

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:32.805
And to survive here, Mike
has to be prepared to stand

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:36.409
his ground, at all times.

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.177
Hopefully, he went
on his way to the hills

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:41.180
and sleeping it
off, disappointed

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.783
enough with no food
that next year he

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:45.385
doesn't come through this way.

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:47.453
