00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.930
Okay, so this is what I wrote. The document

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.470
object model stores data about the content of a page

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.080
and the properties of each note word. To build the

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.940
DOM, the browser parses HTML and creates tokens from HTML

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.540
tags. Some tokens indicate a tag start, others indicate a

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.490
tag end. The tokens are converted into node objects, forming

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.810
a tree structure, which we call the DOM. The relationships

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.260
between objects in the DOM tells us which ones are

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.130
parents and which ones are children. It's also worth noting that

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.960
DOM construction is incremental, which means that we can start building the

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.720
DOM as soon as we have the HTML and we don`t

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.160
need to wait for the entire HTML page to start building it.
