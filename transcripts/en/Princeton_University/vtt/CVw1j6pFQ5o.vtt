00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.340
ANDREW APPEL: 2012 is the 100th
anniversary of the birth

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.470
of Alan Turing, who in many
ways is the founder of

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.160
computer science.


00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.170
When Alan Turing arrived at
Princeton in 1936, there was

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.680
no such thing as a
computer science

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.000
department, here or anywhere.


00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.870
The math department, as it was
at Princeton in the 1930s, had

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.980
been built by Oswald Veblen.


00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.620
He recruited some of the best
mathematicians and logicians

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.200
in the world.


00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.240
The Institute for Advanced Study
was founded in about

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.990
1930, in Princeton, and for
the first 10 years of its

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.550
existence it shared a building
with the Princeton math

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.680
department, here in
the old Fine hall.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.070
And this is where Turing and
Church and von Neumann and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.750
even, Einstein, would have had
their afternoon tea and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.320
discussion.


00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.300
So when Alan Turing was about
23 years old, in Cambridge,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.990
Alan Turing sent his paper "On
Computable Numbers" off for

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.630
publication and then he came
to Princeton, to study with

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.470
Alonzo Church.


00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.530
Turing's paper, in 1936, was so
revolutionary that very few

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.580
people understood it.


00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.870
Alonzo Church understood it, at
Princeton, and Kurt Godel,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.440
but these were geniuses.


00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.230
One could say, that the greatest
computer science

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.610
department in the world in the
1930s was the Princeton math

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.770
department because


00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.640
Church's lambda calculus
became the prototype

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.450
of programming languages
that we use.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.360
Turing's machine became the
prototype of the computers

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.030
developed by John von Neumann at
the Institute for Advanced

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.140
Study in Princeton, in which the
program is just stored as

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.960
data in the memory
of the computer.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.670
When we program a computer
today, we don't have to go

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.060
change the wiring, we just load
in a program and that

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.570
concept goes back through von
Neumann, to Turing, and in

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.610
some ways all the way back
to Kurt Godel, in 1931.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.010
Today Princeton, in the 21st
century, has a real computer

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.090
science department.


00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.450
It Is one of the great computer
science departments

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.940
of the world.


00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.830
We study many of the same
things that Alan Turing

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.030
himself, was interested in; the
theory of computation, the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.890
construction of real computers,
we study artificial

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.550
intelligence, which Turing
became interested in in the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.250
late 1940s, we study the
applications of computation to

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.670
biology, which Turing
became interested in

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.230
in the early 1950s.


00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.850
We owe a lot to Alan Turing
and the mathematicians at

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:10.850
Princeton in the mid-20th
century.
