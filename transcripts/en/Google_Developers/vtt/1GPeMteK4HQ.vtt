00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.901
Bailey: Okay, so our final
speaker this afternoon

00:00:02.901 --> 00:00:04.000
 is Kurt Schwehr,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.300
from the University
of New Hampshire.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.467
And Kurt's a proper techie geek.

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:12.901
So it's fitting we
end with one.

00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:15.634
But he's involved
in using his skills 

00:00:15.634 --> 00:00:18.534
in a number of areas,
in planetary--

00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:20.400
but, in particular,
ocean data.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.467
And it's that he's going
to be talking about today.

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:27.634
How he's developed uses
of geo special data

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:31.234
in Google's GeoTools.

00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:32.567
Schwehr: All right,
thank you.

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:34.100
I want to start off
with a figure,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.400
to remind you all

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.601
that New Hampshire
indeed does have a coastline.

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:40.000
We have 17 miles of coast.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.734
We actually do touch the ocean.

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:44.100
Most people don't seem
to realize that.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.601
And I'd also like
to acknowledge my collaborators,

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:50.267
many people at NOAA,
Cornell University,

00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:51.934
and the U.S. Coast Guard
have contributed

00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:55.501
to the products
that you'll see up here today.

00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:58.634
And I want to go back
into the not-too-distant past

00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:00.501
and talk a little bit
about where we used to be,

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:03.300
before we had Google Earth
and--and some more tools.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.868
When we were at NASA,
we used to have to spend

00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:09.834
huge amounts of money
trying to buy a large SGIs,

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:11.400
keep them running,
and then write

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.801
all of our software
on our own.

00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:16.133
Just to make this crummy
looking earth that's up here.

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.901
And there's no
nice textured background.

00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:21.000
It sort of looks
like north America.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.100
And we sort of have
a red blob on there,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.934
and if you click on it,
it pops up

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:27.267
an actually fairly
nice graphic of something,

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:29.667
but there's no way
to scale in between the two,

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:30.901
and handle
all the nice things

00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:32.467
that Google Earth
now handles for us

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:35.667
for pretty much free here,
with KML.

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:38.601
And you used to have
to get a van,

00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:40.234
and truck it all over to
where you're gonna do your demo.

00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:42.234
And today,
we take our laptop, open it up,

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:43.701
and you're good to go.

00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:46.801
That's had a dramatic effect
on how we looked at data,

00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:48.434
and how much data
we can look at.

00:01:48.434 --> 00:01:50.567
I'd like to take
a little bit of a tour

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:53.167
where we went,
and what kinds of things

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:55.367
we're trying to do
to support the mariners,

00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:57.200
who are out there
on our waterways,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.567
trying to get commerce
through,

00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:00.701
and to keep
our economy running.

00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:03.968
My background is
a little bit of geology,

00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:06.734
so I want to show you sort of
how I got into Google Earth,

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:09.334
and what we
started looking at at first.

00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:11.200
So here's
the Santa Barbara basin,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.767
off of California.

00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:15.234
And we started looking
at what we could do

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:17.100
with, say, taking
a journal paper,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.000
and scanning the figures in.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Or using something
like Fledermaus

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.300
to generate a 3-D model,
and then slap it in there.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.934
Or actually, just texture your
bathymetry onto the ocean floor,

00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:28.701
where we have
a high-resolution survey.

00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:32.501
This--in this case,
it's from MBARI's research ship.

00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:35.701
And as you go through that,
I started playing

00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:38.133
with the idea
of taking each scientist,

00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:40.601
and maybe we could build
a Google Earth resume.

00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:43.634
So it's a concept of,
for a particular scientist,

00:02:43.634 --> 00:02:45.667
where they've been
as they go through their career.

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:46.901
And you can
actually glean a lot

00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:49.033
as they go
through the geologic record,

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:50.968
trying to figure out
what's going on.

00:02:50.968 --> 00:02:53.000
A lot of insight
comes from what problems

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.300
we're looking at,
and when in their career,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.601
and how
that influences things.

00:02:56.601 --> 00:02:59.400
If you went back a ways,
you might see the revolution

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.734
that occurred
in earth sciences,

00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:04.400
where people realized that
plate tectonics is a real thing.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.601
It was a huge change
of thought to people.

00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:10.300
And a lot of that is buried
in the literature,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.667
in terms of where
they were looking on the ocean,

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:13.200
and how they looked
at the earth.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.868
They went from an old model
to a brand-new model.

00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:18.434
That was a
really radical change.

00:03:18.434 --> 00:03:20.400
And so I think, as we dig back
into that--those archives,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.901
we'll start pulling out
more of that,

00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:26.634
and really see
a historical change.

00:03:26.634 --> 00:03:28.934
Now, to jump into
some of our modern tools

00:03:28.934 --> 00:03:31.067
that we're looking at,
and give you a sense

00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:32.934
of what we can actually do
for the mariners,

00:03:32.934 --> 00:03:35.968
to change their world,
and make it a better place

00:03:35.968 --> 00:03:37.567
for them to move out
on the waterways,

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:39.067
and for those
who are managing it,

00:03:39.067 --> 00:03:41.834
I used an open source tool,
just to get going.

00:03:41.834 --> 00:03:43.334
We took a NOAA chart,

00:03:43.334 --> 00:03:46.667
which are the little red lines
you'll see up on the screen.

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:48.601
And on that chart, we've dropped
it on top of Google Earth.

00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:50.567
And if you look
at the pier in the middle,

00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:53.968
next to the orange arrow,
you'll see a really long pier

00:03:53.968 --> 00:03:57.634
next to
a really short red icon--

00:03:57.634 --> 00:04:00.734
little iconographic
description of the pier.

00:04:00.734 --> 00:04:02.300
Now which one is right?

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.834
If you came through
in the middle of the night,

00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:05.200
do you want to find out?

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.200
So we've been looking at
if you can just drop a chart in,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.434
and do a quick look,
you can catch a lot of errors

00:04:11.434 --> 00:04:13.567
that would've been very
difficult to see down the road.

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:15.968
I'll show a couple
more examples of kinds

00:04:15.968 --> 00:04:18.100
of surprising things
that we've found,

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.334
and how tools like Google Earth
can just pop this right out,

00:04:21.334 --> 00:04:24.067
without having to go through
and dig through databases,

00:04:24.067 --> 00:04:25.834
and try to look at
Excel spreadsheets

00:04:25.834 --> 00:04:28.200
and figure out
what's going on.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.033
Now as these ships
move around,

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:32.734
there's actually a new
technology that's been deployed

00:04:32.734 --> 00:04:34.100
for about the last five years.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.067
And it's coming
into more and more use.

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:38.434
And it's called the
Automatic Identification System.

00:04:38.434 --> 00:04:40.801
So planes, for a long time,
have had devices

00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:42.133
that tell you where they are.

00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:44.567
And the FAA can tell you
what ship is where

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:45.734
in the United States.

00:04:45.734 --> 00:04:49.067
Well, now we have that
for the maritime world.

00:04:49.067 --> 00:04:51.334
So, ships are trying
to put these transponders on.

00:04:51.334 --> 00:04:53.467
And they're mainly meant
for collision avoidance,

00:04:53.467 --> 00:04:56.100
so instead of just having
to rely on your radar,

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.734
you have a device
that actually tells you

00:04:57.734 --> 00:04:59.300
who's around you,
and what they're doing.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.734
Now, for us as researchers,
we'd like to see

00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:04.734
what the ship's doing,
why are they out there,

00:05:04.734 --> 00:05:06.334
why are there problems,
where are there areas

00:05:06.334 --> 00:05:07.534
that are working well?

00:05:07.534 --> 00:05:09.501
And so what you see up here
is a combination

00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:11.868
of a little bit
fancier nautical chart.

00:05:11.868 --> 00:05:14.634
Here I've used
the EarthNC charts,

00:05:14.634 --> 00:05:16.400
and I've taken a couple layers
out of their tools,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.467
and merged it
with AIS ship tracks

00:05:19.467 --> 00:05:22.000
throughout entry
to Delaware Bay.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.300
And you can see that
there's vessels moving all over.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.701
Some are using
the green traffic lanes,

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.968
and following the rules
of the road.

00:05:28.968 --> 00:05:30.434
They aren't required to.

00:05:30.434 --> 00:05:32.234
And then there's other vessels
that are crossing it.

00:05:32.234 --> 00:05:33.968
And then there's vessels
that have to wait around

00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:35.167
for some reason.

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:37.133
And so we need
to go in there and look at,

00:05:37.133 --> 00:05:39.400
as they're out there,
what's delaying these ships,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.000
And how can we optimize
what they are doing,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.801
while keeping them safe?

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:47.634
Now it's not always
safe out there

00:05:47.634 --> 00:05:48.667
and things do happen.

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:50.334
So we can use techniques
like this

00:05:50.334 --> 00:05:52.400
to look at events,
like the Cosco Busan.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.801
This ship, in 2007, ran into--
or as they call it

00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:59.501
in the maritime world--
alighted with a fixed object,

00:05:59.501 --> 00:06:02.167
called the
San Francisco Bay Bridge.

00:06:02.167 --> 00:06:04.767
And by having the ship
tracking and recorded

00:06:04.767 --> 00:06:05.968
by all the transponders,

00:06:05.968 --> 00:06:08.267
we can see
what was going on with that.

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:10.200
And the investigators--
I'm not involved in that--

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.901
but they can
actually look at these tracks,

00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:13.534
and start
to understand what's going on.

00:06:13.534 --> 00:06:15.567
And we can provide them
with graphics,

00:06:15.567 --> 00:06:17.100
where they can go in
with a time slider,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.300
 move things around.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.734
They can remove
all the ships

00:06:19.734 --> 00:06:21.167
except for the ships
that they care about.

00:06:21.167 --> 00:06:24.167
And start really digging into
why this incident happened.

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:26.400
And hopefully
with those investigations,

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.467
they an create new rules
or remove rules

00:06:28.467 --> 00:06:30.601
that were causing problems,
to make the waterways

00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:32.467
more effective and safe.

00:06:32.467 --> 00:06:35.300
And you can kind of combine
that information with things

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.934
like in the bottom left,
we have an image

00:06:36.934 --> 00:06:39.667
that was captured
by the ship's radar.

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:41.901
And so investigators can
really get a fuller picture

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:45.334
of maritime incidents
as they happen in the waterways

00:06:45.334 --> 00:06:49.100
much better than
they ever have in the past.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.901
Now, as a part of that,
in addition to things like AIS,

00:06:51.901 --> 00:06:54.467
we also need to get
more sensors out there.

00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:57.100
NOAA, the EPA
and other federal agencies

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.801
have got a pretty good
infrastructure out there,

00:06:58.801 --> 00:06:59.968
but we need more.

00:06:59.968 --> 00:07:01.400
We need sensors
that really go in

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.200
and tell us what's going on
in the environment.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.868
So here, I've shown you
an example of company

00:07:04.868 --> 00:07:07.100
that's trying to push
that innovation curve,

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.434
Sensorware Systems.

00:07:08.434 --> 00:07:10.300
And they're
trying to place all sorts

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.734
of sensors out
in the environment,

00:07:11.734 --> 00:07:14.167
and give us tools to be able
to go in and look at this stuff

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:17.934
24-7, 365,
good days or bad days,

00:07:17.934 --> 00:07:20.200
and tell us what's going on
out in the environment.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.601
That way, we as scientists
and researchers

00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:23.901
can really understand
what it is

00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:26.601
that's causing
those trouble spots,

00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:28.634
and why things are working the
way they are in the waterways.

00:07:28.634 --> 00:07:30.400
If you don't know
what's happening out there,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.667
how are you supposed
to help them out?

00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:36.267
Now, one of the things
that we try to do

00:07:36.267 --> 00:07:39.100
is once you have an incident,
there's a short time period

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.701
where responders have
to get in there

00:07:41.701 --> 00:07:45.133
and really start to work with
the local enforcement folks,

00:07:45.133 --> 00:07:47.200
and try to get
that environment cleaned up

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.400
and restored
back to where it was.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.767
So to give you an example
of some of the things

00:07:50.767 --> 00:07:52.200
that we're
seeing in the waterway,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.667
I'm showing you a picture
of a grounding in Alaska.

00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:56.934
This could be anywhere
in the United States.

00:07:56.934 --> 00:07:58.868
There's a lot of incidents
on the waterways.

00:07:58.868 --> 00:08:01.634
It's getting busier out there,
so things do happen.

00:08:01.634 --> 00:08:03.200
It's like
being on the highway.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.901
You don't expect
to have an accident,

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.734
but every once in a while,
something happens

00:08:06.734 --> 00:08:08.701
that may even be
out of your control.

00:08:08.701 --> 00:08:11.234
So we've been working
on web interfaces to provide

00:08:11.234 --> 00:08:14.133
a consistent environment
for each of ports to have,

00:08:14.133 --> 00:08:15.567
that they can call up.

00:08:15.567 --> 00:08:17.400
And responders who come
from out of town

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.767
may have never been
in this particular area,

00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:22.467
they need a consistent view
of what's in the area,

00:08:22.467 --> 00:08:23.968
a consistent
set of data products,

00:08:23.968 --> 00:08:26.601
and access to the management
plans that have been in place.

00:08:26.601 --> 00:08:29.334
So that they can
quickly respond to things

00:08:29.334 --> 00:08:31.868
such as oil spills,
where every minute or hour

00:08:31.868 --> 00:08:34.300
that you can't get out there
and figure out what to do,

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.300
causes you to not be able
to recover as much

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.200
of the oil or debris
that's out in your waterways.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.334
So here, for example, we're
showing multibeam bathymetry,

00:08:42.334 --> 00:08:45.968
showing super high resolution
features of the waterways.

00:08:45.968 --> 00:08:47.868
And this is
Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

00:08:47.868 --> 00:08:50.133
And you can see such things
as sand waves

00:08:50.133 --> 00:08:52.701
that are just a meter
or two across.

00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:55.734
And you combine that
with your roads and highways.

00:08:55.734 --> 00:08:58.200
And the icons show you
all of your caches

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.868
for your response tools.

00:09:00.868 --> 00:09:02.968
This way, the people
that come out on site,

00:09:02.968 --> 00:09:04.400
they may not have been
here before,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.167
but they can get going
right away,

00:09:06.167 --> 00:09:07.534
and start to figure out
what they need to do

00:09:07.534 --> 00:09:11.167
in the first few hours
of a response.

00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:13.400
Now, once
you're way past that,

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.334
and you've gotten
past your investigations,

00:09:15.334 --> 00:09:18.501
such as the Cosco Busan, 
the coastguard keeps a database

00:09:18.501 --> 00:09:20.501
of incident investigations.

00:09:20.501 --> 00:09:23.400
Part of that database sits
inside of a tool,

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.701
called MISLE.

00:09:24.701 --> 00:09:26.667
and it's the
Marine Information for Safety

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:28.133
and Law Enforcement database.

00:09:28.133 --> 00:09:29.701
And part of that--

00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:31.167
we have access
to these incidents,

00:09:31.167 --> 00:09:32.667
and we can color code them.

00:09:32.667 --> 00:09:37.200
Here, I've used the OSHA symbols
for industrial accidents.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.300
Not quite the right icons,
but it gives you a gist

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.767
of what's going on
in the waterways.

00:09:40.767 --> 00:09:42.467
And you can see
what are the areas

00:09:42.467 --> 00:09:43.801
that are having
the most trouble,

00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:45.868
and where we need to focus
our research efforts,

00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:48.834
to make this
a much more focused research

00:09:48.834 --> 00:09:50.300
and find those problems
that need to be addressed.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.467
You can see
that the Gulf Coast

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.100
has the majority
of the incidents.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.000
With a fairly good number going
on in our inland waterways.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.567
So those folks refer
to themselves

00:09:58.567 --> 00:10:00.033
as "the brown water crowd."

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:02.167
They have plenty of incidents
they need to work on, too.

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:04.434
There's a lot
of tight waterways

00:10:04.434 --> 00:10:06.300
and passing arrangements
that are difficult

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.200
with these big ships trying
to move our economic resources

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.167
up and down
the Mississippi River.

00:10:13.167 --> 00:10:15.567
Let's zoom in here.
This is Norfolk, Virginia.

00:10:15.567 --> 00:10:17.667
And you can take
a look at their database.

00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:18.968
We've started to create tools

00:10:18.968 --> 00:10:21.067
that help associate
these together,

00:10:21.067 --> 00:10:23.167
without having to dig
into their Oracle database.

00:10:23.167 --> 00:10:24.868
So anyone can go in

00:10:24.868 --> 00:10:27.133
and associate
a particular incident

00:10:27.133 --> 00:10:29.267
with the details
of the accident,

00:10:29.267 --> 00:10:32.133
or you can drill down and
get the entire accident report.

00:10:32.133 --> 00:10:33.934
And that way,
we can start looking

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:35.167
at what actually happened
to incident.

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:36.501
Is there something
that we can address?

00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:39.133
Or is this, say, an act
of nature or a weird occurrence?

00:10:39.133 --> 00:10:41.067
Something
that we can't control?

00:10:41.067 --> 00:10:42.901
Therefore, there's nothing
we can do about it.

00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:45.367
Or can we add a sensor
to help ships out

00:10:45.367 --> 00:10:47.300
as they come
into particular areas.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.801
An example
of that might be...

00:10:48.801 --> 00:10:51.033
the inland waterways,
some of the locks,

00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:52.367
as you approach them,

00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:53.801
have really horrible
cross currents

00:10:53.801 --> 00:10:55.234
that vary with time.

00:10:55.234 --> 00:10:57.067
So can we put sensors
in the water column

00:10:57.067 --> 00:10:58.367
that will
tell you the currents

00:10:58.367 --> 00:11:02.033
and report that back
to the ships?

00:11:02.033 --> 00:11:03.868
Now as mariners
go through the waterways,

00:11:03.868 --> 00:11:06.534
they're relying on groups
such as NOAA

00:11:06.534 --> 00:11:07.868
to provide them
with the resources

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:08.901
to understand where
they're going.

00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:11.834
This is the road atlas
for ships.

00:11:11.834 --> 00:11:14.334
And it starts
with field data entry.

00:11:14.334 --> 00:11:15.834
There's validation.

00:11:15.834 --> 00:11:18.200
And then NOAA produces
what's called the "Coast Pilot."

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.434
This is a document that's been
around for a very long time.

00:11:21.434 --> 00:11:22.734
Over 100 years.

00:11:22.734 --> 00:11:24.601
And it hasn't changed
in 100 years.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.400
So we have
a really excellent tool.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.834
Mariners count on this.

00:11:27.834 --> 00:11:32.300
But can we do better
with a geo-spatial tool?

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.834
We took a look at LIDAR.
And LIDAR is great.

00:11:34.834 --> 00:11:37.467
You can generate thousands
of laser points

00:11:37.467 --> 00:11:38.968
ranged into your environment.

00:11:38.968 --> 00:11:42.534
And you can look
into buildings, see trees,

00:11:42.534 --> 00:11:43.767
all sorts of stuff.

00:11:43.767 --> 00:11:45.067
But it generates
a lot of data,

00:11:45.067 --> 00:11:47.300
and you're going
to overwhelm your people at--

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.934
who are trained mariners

00:11:48.934 --> 00:11:51.200
who are not used to dealing
with point clouds--

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.868
with data that isn't going
to necessarily help them.

00:11:53.868 --> 00:11:55.701
This might be helpful
for a modeler.

00:11:55.701 --> 00:11:57.968
And we've looked into what we
can do with producing models

00:11:57.968 --> 00:12:02.100
to supplement those that--that
people like Google have created.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.367
And we can
add the waterway critical

00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:07.334
to buildings and markers.

00:12:07.334 --> 00:12:09.701
So here, we've done
a lighthouse on Cape Cod.

00:12:09.701 --> 00:12:12.701
This is Highland Light,
modeled by Christiana.

00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:16.000
And in this model, it gives us a
good sense of what's out there.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.367
But unfortunately, if we were
to do all the lights,

00:12:18.367 --> 00:12:21.067
and waterway devices that
we wanted to have out there,

00:12:21.067 --> 00:12:24.000
it's prohibitively expensive
and time consuming

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.634
to model each of these.

00:12:25.634 --> 00:12:28.300
It takes us going out to a site,
running around the building,

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.901
building a model, validating it,
going through all of our tools,

00:12:31.901 --> 00:12:33.367
and dropping it
into sketch up

00:12:33.367 --> 00:12:35.067
and placing it
into Google Earth.

00:12:35.067 --> 00:12:36.501
The last two steps are easy.

00:12:36.501 --> 00:12:38.567
All that leads up to that
is actually fairly challenging

00:12:38.567 --> 00:12:40.801
for these
unusually-shaped objects.

00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:43.167
It would be nice if all
of our lighthouses were square,

00:12:43.167 --> 00:12:46.434
but unfortunately,
they're not.

00:12:46.434 --> 00:12:50.000
So we've looked at an approach
of running around with a camera.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.133
And cameras are
getting better every day.

00:12:52.133 --> 00:12:53.834
They're adding sensors
that we need.

00:12:53.834 --> 00:12:57.534
It used to be that adding a GPS
to a camera was difficult.

00:12:57.534 --> 00:13:00.167
Now, you can go to the store,
and you can buy a camera

00:13:00.167 --> 00:13:04.200
that has a GPS, and it has a
three-axis magnetic compass--

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.667
so you know which way
it's pointed.

00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:08.767
Another engineer and I--
Matt--

00:13:08.767 --> 00:13:10.334
We went through Boston Harbor
in one day,

00:13:10.334 --> 00:13:13.300
and photo surveyed
the entire harbor.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.901
...

00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:19.968
But you can go in on one day
and survey an entire harbor.

00:13:19.968 --> 00:13:22.834
Now, how can we use that
information to present something

00:13:22.834 --> 00:13:25.467
to go along with that text,
to produce a new environment,

00:13:25.467 --> 00:13:27.734
that's helpful
for our mariners?

00:13:27.734 --> 00:13:30.767
So we've come up with a process.
Collect a whole bunch of photos.

00:13:30.767 --> 00:13:33.434
So here's Matt and I
collecting photos in Boston.

00:13:33.434 --> 00:13:36.434
You need to match
those photos to features.

00:13:36.434 --> 00:13:39.868
You need to crop those photos,
register them, orient them,

00:13:39.868 --> 00:13:42.000
and get them
into a database.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.667
And once we have that,
we can try to create interfaces

00:13:44.667 --> 00:13:47.634
to these--
this new type of data.

00:13:47.634 --> 00:13:51.200
We've been playing with, as
Matt calls it, the multirama.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.334
Where basically, you have
an oriented image slice,

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:56.133
and a render of pics,
which one to do

00:13:56.133 --> 00:13:58.033
based on which way
you're looking at it.

00:13:58.033 --> 00:14:00.734
The nice thing about this
is unlike a CAD model,

00:14:00.734 --> 00:14:02.767
you catch all those features
that cue the mariner

00:14:02.767 --> 00:14:04.300
into what to look for.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.334
So if a building
is buried among the trees,

00:14:06.334 --> 00:14:07.534
you capture all those trees
that you would

00:14:07.534 --> 00:14:09.834
never want to model
in a 3-D world.

00:14:09.834 --> 00:14:12.300
It's just too expensive.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.567
So in our lab,
we've gone ahead and prototyped

00:14:14.567 --> 00:14:17.067
a little version of this
to see what we might be.

00:14:17.067 --> 00:14:18.767
You're welcome to download it
and give it a try.

00:14:18.767 --> 00:14:20.601
We're always looking
for feedback.

00:14:20.601 --> 00:14:22.300
We've got some features
that we haven't figured out

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.467
how to do
in Google Earth yet.

00:14:24.467 --> 00:14:27.501
As you move around this world,
you'll see pictures moving--

00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:29.300
smaller and larger,
based on where they are

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.467
in your
field of view.

00:14:30.467 --> 00:14:31.567
Things are bigger
in the center,

00:14:31.567 --> 00:14:32.934
and they shrink
as they go away.

00:14:32.934 --> 00:14:36.167
We've played
with the aspect-oriented--

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:37.767
which picture to choose.

00:14:37.767 --> 00:14:41.634
And we've had hyperlinks between
the text and the 3-D world.

00:14:41.634 --> 00:14:45.033
We think with the new
JavaScript API for Google Earth,

00:14:45.033 --> 00:14:46.167
that that might be
a great way

00:14:46.167 --> 00:14:48.534
to create
at least the basics of this.

00:14:48.534 --> 00:14:50.667
And then work through
how we're going to implement

00:14:50.667 --> 00:14:51.868
some of these
other features on top

00:14:51.868 --> 00:14:54.000
of what exists
in the current KML.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.868
I think we can do a lot.

00:14:55.868 --> 00:14:57.934
But we have yet to figure out
what that might look like.

00:14:57.934 --> 00:14:59.200
There's a lot we can do,
and we're going 

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.801
to try a few things
in the next couple months.

00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:03.567
But we look forward to feedback
on that first prototype,

00:15:03.567 --> 00:15:05.801
to see what might be
a good match for people,

00:15:05.801 --> 00:15:09.400
without loading the interface
with too many things.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.667
Now I'd like
to show you something

00:15:10.667 --> 00:15:14.234
in our actual in-the-field
implementation of stuff.

00:15:14.234 --> 00:15:16.901
This is a project that's
just going online right now.

00:15:16.901 --> 00:15:21.100
The Right Whale AIS project
aims to notify mariners,

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.701
without any effort
on their part,

00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:25.567
of where right whales
might be in critical habitats.

00:15:25.567 --> 00:15:26.968
The right whales
on the east coast--

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:29.934
they were down
to about 350 right whales.

00:15:29.934 --> 00:15:32.267
So we'd like to give
the mariners as much tools

00:15:32.267 --> 00:15:35.467
as possible to avoid
running into these whales.

00:15:35.467 --> 00:15:38.234
Or if it's impossible to know
that the whale's there,

00:15:38.234 --> 00:15:39.634
to at least
be going slow enough

00:15:39.634 --> 00:15:42.868
that any impact with a whale
might not be fast enough

00:15:42.868 --> 00:15:45.734
to actually harm the animal
enough to kill it.

00:15:45.734 --> 00:15:48.968
So to give you a sense of what's
going on in the Boston area,

00:15:48.968 --> 00:15:50.767
here's a figure
to give you a view

00:15:50.767 --> 00:15:54.000
of a couple of types of ships
and how they use the waterway.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.834
Some ships, such as fishing,
or tugs, or research vessels--

00:15:57.834 --> 00:16:00.534
they're the worst--
don't really work in a very nice

00:16:00.534 --> 00:16:02.267
easy-to-work-with manner.

00:16:02.267 --> 00:16:06.033
However, that cargo and
liquefied natural gas carriers

00:16:06.033 --> 00:16:08.434
tend to really run
a very consistent line.

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:11.000
They use the traffic lanes
very consistently.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.400
And as a part
of a new deep-water port

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.901
that's being put in here
for LNG, right off the coast,

00:16:16.901 --> 00:16:20.234
the coast guard, NOAA
and the local

00:16:20.234 --> 00:16:21.501
natural gas companies
have agreed

00:16:21.501 --> 00:16:25.033
to spend money
to put in buoys all along this

00:16:25.033 --> 00:16:27.467
to let mariners know
when whales have been hurt

00:16:27.467 --> 00:16:29.100
in a particular area.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.534
So let me show you
the first implementation

00:16:31.534 --> 00:16:33.200
of this user interface
for the mariners.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.501
We did it in Google Earth.

00:16:34.501 --> 00:16:36.834
It was the easiest tool
to create an interface

00:16:36.834 --> 00:16:38.434
that we found.

00:16:38.434 --> 00:16:40.968
And what we have is a circle
for each of our buoys.

00:16:40.968 --> 00:16:43.000
And when that buoy
detects a right whale call,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.334
it goes back to mission control
at Cornell university.

00:16:46.334 --> 00:16:47.667
They verify a whale,

00:16:47.667 --> 00:16:50.901
and the little ring
on the screen turns yellow,

00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:52.801
letting the mariner know
that there was a whale there

00:16:52.801 --> 00:16:54.567
sometime in the last 24 hours.

00:16:54.567 --> 00:16:57.000
This way, mariners can
use their best judgment

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.501
to understand what to do,

00:16:58.501 --> 00:17:01.100
or if your the LNG carrier,
you're actually required 

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.634
by your contracts
with the coastguard

00:17:02.634 --> 00:17:06.300
to go less than 10 knots.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.033
Now that we have those kinds
of things in place,

00:17:09.033 --> 00:17:11.467
we also need to start working
on our background data.

00:17:11.467 --> 00:17:12.767
And we've been looking
at how to deal

00:17:12.767 --> 00:17:14.534
with multibeam data
with Google Earth,

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:17.667
so we can have rapid turnaround
of validation of our tools,

00:17:17.667 --> 00:17:20.434
without having to deal
with the multi-day process

00:17:20.434 --> 00:17:22.100
of pressing
with the high-powered tools

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.534
such as CARIS.

00:17:24.534 --> 00:17:27.133
Here's an example
of a really unusual system,

00:17:27.133 --> 00:17:29.400
and how easy it is to drop
into Google Earth.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.300
I used a combination
of MB-System and Google Earth

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.934
to drop in the track lines,
make sure that this wave rider,

00:17:35.934 --> 00:17:39.267
which is a little jet ski-like
device with a SONAR on it--

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:43.767
driven by Tom Lipman,
of our institution--

00:17:43.767 --> 00:17:45.601
to actually go in
and quick make a model of this.

00:17:45.601 --> 00:17:48.534
...

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.801
...into Google Earth.

00:17:56.801 --> 00:17:58.467
...go through all the stuff
we're trying to deal

00:17:58.467 --> 00:18:00.334
with a whole bunch
of research papers

00:18:00.334 --> 00:18:01.634
that are focused
on various waterways

00:18:01.634 --> 00:18:04.100
and the bottom of the ocean,
things like that.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.434
We have a request of Google.

00:18:06.434 --> 00:18:08.567
We would love to see--
instead of just Google Scholar--

00:18:08.567 --> 00:18:10.334
"Google Spatial Scholar."

00:18:10.334 --> 00:18:12.968
So we've actually done a quick
prototype of what it might be

00:18:12.968 --> 00:18:15.133
to lay in the historic data.

00:18:15.133 --> 00:18:17.267
We had a whole
team of graduate students,

00:18:17.267 --> 00:18:18.434
who came up
with these projects,

00:18:18.434 --> 00:18:20.501
and they
took old multibeam data,

00:18:20.501 --> 00:18:22.133
their figures and papers,

00:18:22.133 --> 00:18:25.400
and laid it on Google Earth
where those figures should go.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.334
And maybe in the end result,
you really want these things

00:18:27.334 --> 00:18:29.434
glued right on the planet
where they're supposed to be.

00:18:29.434 --> 00:18:31.834
But this shows the idea of being
able to take a database

00:18:31.834 --> 00:18:34.567
such as EndNote,
and export a KML,

00:18:34.567 --> 00:18:36.033
and be able to just spin
around the globe,

00:18:36.033 --> 00:18:37.434
and see where
the papers are.

00:18:37.434 --> 00:18:39.467
So if you're interested
in Hawaii, you fly into Hawaii,

00:18:39.467 --> 00:18:43.467
and you just
get the Hawaii papers.

00:18:43.467 --> 00:18:46.934
Now I'd like to finish up
with an example of a tool

00:18:46.934 --> 00:18:49.400
that's--that's
about to come online.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.567
It'll be a little bit longer
than the whale system.

00:18:51.567 --> 00:18:54.300
This is nowCOAST,
done by NOAA.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.200
And they've worked with the
University of New Hampshire

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.033
to create a tool
called FloVis,

00:18:59.033 --> 00:19:00.300
and get it on the web.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.167
This is an ArcIMS interface.

00:19:02.167 --> 00:19:03.601
So if you go to nowCOAST,
this will be there

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:05.300
hopefully
in the next month or two.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.534
And we've worked
on visualization techniques

00:19:07.534 --> 00:19:10.100
that actually are based
on the human visual system.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.868
So this sort
of "Starry Night" view

00:19:11.868 --> 00:19:15.167
is the current velocities
along the U.S. east coast.

00:19:15.167 --> 00:19:18.434
You can see the Gulf Stream
nice and clear.

00:19:18.434 --> 00:19:20.167
As we were working on this,
we thought...

00:19:20.167 --> 00:19:21.234
What if we did it in Google?

00:19:21.234 --> 00:19:22.367
What if it was
right on the globe,

00:19:22.367 --> 00:19:24.501
And we weren't
always in ArcIMS?

00:19:24.501 --> 00:19:25.634
So we've taken
a quick look at that,

00:19:25.634 --> 00:19:27.334
and it looks
really promising.

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:29.667
Here, I used Fledermaus
to go in and drop

00:19:29.667 --> 00:19:31.868
a geoTIFF onto Google Earth.

00:19:31.868 --> 00:19:33.601
And the results
are really quite stunning.

00:19:33.601 --> 00:19:35.300
Being able to fly around
and really see

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.767
this kind of flow model
is fantastic.

00:19:37.767 --> 00:19:39.267
This is something when
I had to take Oceanography

00:19:39.267 --> 00:19:40.501
as a grad student,

00:19:40.501 --> 00:19:42.367
I would've killed
for this visualization.

00:19:42.367 --> 00:19:44.667
I still don't totally
understand flow visualization,

00:19:44.667 --> 00:19:46.767
and I'm not an Oceanographer.

00:19:46.767 --> 00:19:48.868
I'm a marine geologist,
and geophysicist.

00:19:48.868 --> 00:19:50.634
But it's really great
to see this stuff,

00:19:50.634 --> 00:19:52.634
and understand
the context of my geology

00:19:52.634 --> 00:19:55.033
within the currents
of the area.

00:19:55.033 --> 00:19:56.367
So, thank you all for listening.

00:19:56.367 --> 00:19:58.968
If you have any more interest
in this type stuff,

00:19:58.968 --> 00:20:00.601
my blog at Schwehr.org

00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:03.033
has a lot more pictures
of all this stuff,

00:20:03.033 --> 00:20:04.767
and you can download
some of the files.

00:20:04.767 --> 00:20:08.534
Thank you for listening.

00:20:08.534 --> 00:20:12.133
[applause]

00:20:12.133 --> 00:20:14.133
Any questions?

00:20:14.133 --> 00:20:15.267
Yes.

00:20:15.267 --> 00:20:21.200
man: [indistinct]

00:20:23.033 --> 00:20:24.767
Schwehr: Can you repeat
the question?

00:20:24.767 --> 00:20:30.701
man: [indistinct]

00:20:32.634 --> 00:20:34.801
Schwehr: We would rather have
Google do that than us, yes.

00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:37.267
It would be great
to have a street-view car,

00:20:37.267 --> 00:20:39.567
that we plunk on top of a ship,
and drive around the harbor.

00:20:39.567 --> 00:20:43.734
We're in a way emulating that,
except for one aspect.

00:20:43.734 --> 00:20:45.701
In street view,
you want to show everything,

00:20:45.701 --> 00:20:48.834
because people are interested in
all sorts of different features.

00:20:48.834 --> 00:20:51.033
Here, we have a community
that actually wants you

00:20:51.033 --> 00:20:52.434
to go in
and decimate the data,

00:20:52.434 --> 00:20:54.100
and just find
those key features.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.634
So when they're coming
into a harbor,

00:20:55.634 --> 00:20:58.067
they don't want to know every
nook and cranny of the harbor,

00:20:58.067 --> 00:21:00.100
they want to know the key
lighthouses, the buildings,

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.868
the features they need
to go to where they're going.

00:21:03.868 --> 00:21:05.200
So they're going
to aim for that lighthouse,

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.100
take a left at the third pier
and head for home.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.901
And it may be foggy and dark.

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:11.734
So they want
to have that best knowledge

00:21:11.734 --> 00:21:14.200
without all of the street view
like stuff in there.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.267
So we have an
extra decimation problem.

00:21:16.267 --> 00:21:18.501
Yes?
Next question.

00:21:18.501 --> 00:21:24.501
man: [indistinct]

00:21:24.501 --> 00:21:25.667
Schwehr: nowCOAST?

00:21:25.667 --> 00:21:30.367
man: [indistinct]

00:21:30.367 --> 00:21:31.467
Schwehr: That one?

00:21:31.467 --> 00:21:33.000
man: [indistinct]

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.767
Schwehr: Before the whales.

00:21:34.767 --> 00:21:36.667
man: [indistinct]

00:21:36.667 --> 00:21:37.868
Schwehr: That one, yes.

00:21:37.868 --> 00:21:42.400
man: [indistinct]

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.934
Schwehr: This is not
Google Earth.

00:21:43.934 --> 00:21:46.601
This is our in-house OpenGL
implementation.

00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:48.901
And we hope to have
a Google Earth implementation.

00:21:48.901 --> 00:21:52.734
We have a couple different teams
taking their own take on it.

00:21:52.734 --> 00:21:55.000
We have one in Florida.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.968
man: [indistinct]

00:21:56.968 --> 00:21:58.701
Schwehr: We've looked at
photo overlays, and we think

00:21:58.701 --> 00:22:00.467
that might be a way to go.

00:22:00.467 --> 00:22:04.501
We have some questions on
how to control the image use,

00:22:04.501 --> 00:22:06.567
to maybe do
something like the multirama.

00:22:06.567 --> 00:22:08.634
We think we might be able
to pull that out

00:22:08.634 --> 00:22:12.634
with sort of a, you know, level
detail region-type feature

00:22:12.634 --> 00:22:13.968
where you pick
which region,

00:22:13.968 --> 00:22:15.801
and it's not true
level of detail.

00:22:15.801 --> 00:22:18.133
So perhaps
those kinds of things.

00:22:18.133 --> 00:22:22.467
But this is
not currently Google Earth.

00:22:22.467 --> 00:22:24.200
I wish it was.
But it's not.

00:22:31.701 --> 00:22:34.634

00:22:37.701 --> 00:22:40.067
