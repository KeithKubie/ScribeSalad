00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.770
So, sometimes it feels like
users are from Earth and

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.910
monetization is from Mars.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.250
What do we know about users?

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.220
&gt;&gt; We know that most of
them favor free apps.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.180
In 2014, over 90% of the apps that
were downloaded were free apps.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.930
Users wish to avoid paying upfront,
but they don't mind paying

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.730
in the right moment when they see
the value in front of their eyes.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.560
This is the reason most apps
are using in app payments.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.200
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.600
So users prefer free apps, but

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.490
they don't mind paying once
the app proves its value.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.050
So besides in app purchases,
what other models do we have?

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.250
&gt;&gt; We have many monetization options.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.360
In-app billing,
you can sell digital goods and

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.050
real goods to your users
from the free app.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.720
In app payments,
you let your user purchase item, level,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.810
points, special tools from your app.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.920
Ads, we got lots of options
with different types like

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.440
display advertising, in text links,
videos, and many more.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.330
The important thing to note here
is that you wish to blend the ad

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.800
into your experience and
not to interrupt it.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.830
Another opportunity is with affiliate.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.810
You could make money by
referring to other services.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.640
Ahh, and there's lots of other models

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.000
if you want to check if they
are appropriate to your case.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.840
Email campaigns, selling data,
auction, flash sales,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.410
merchandising, premium support and
many more.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.360
&gt;&gt; That's a lot of models.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.080
I mean, how do you know that
you're choosing the right one?

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.760
&gt;&gt; It's a real challenge.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.400
We will provide more information
that will help you get

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.990
to those answers in the next lessons.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.470
One thing to take from this lesson is
that your goal is to deliver direct

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.800
monetization to the right
user at the right time.
