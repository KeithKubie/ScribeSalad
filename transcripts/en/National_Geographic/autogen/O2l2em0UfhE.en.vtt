phenomenon called leucism lu system is
 

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.829
phenomenon called leucism lu system is
whereby the melanistic pigment is not

00:09:04.829 --> 00:09:04.839
whereby the melanistic pigment is not
 

00:09:04.839 --> 00:09:07.980
whereby the melanistic pigment is not
very there and as a result the color of

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:07.990
very there and as a result the color of
 

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.250
very there and as a result the color of
the body turns white which is not nice

it is when they are cleaning it and that
also makes it difficult for the wound to

also makes it difficult for the wound to
 

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.470
also makes it difficult for the wound to
recover very quickly because they the

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480

the maenge animals as a result of mange

00:26:40.159 --> 00:26:40.169
the maenge animals as a result of mange
 

00:26:40.169 --> 00:26:43.460

they have lost that tassel let's look at
 

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.039
they have lost that tassel let's look at
that so I cannot see that very well but

00:26:46.039 --> 00:26:46.049
that so I cannot see that very well but
 

00:26:46.049 --> 00:26:48.320
that so I cannot see that very well but
I can see that the tassel there is not

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:48.330
I can see that the tassel there is not
 

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.990
I can see that the tassel there is not
highly developed so I am suspecting that

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000
highly developed so I am suspecting that
 

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.600
highly developed so I am suspecting that
that lion we are seeing there with that

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:53.610
that lion we are seeing there with that
 

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.549

a very beautiful tail must be the
mankini as the manga lemurs are also

00:26:57.799 --> 00:26:57.809
mankini as the manga lemurs are also
 

00:26:57.809 --> 00:27:00.470
mankini as the manga lemurs are also
recovering from mange at the moment they

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480
recovering from mange at the moment they
 

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:05.200
recovering from mange at the moment they
are getting much better

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:05.210
 
 

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:08.570
 
so mange is not something good to have

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:08.580
so mange is not something good to have
 

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.330
so mange is not something good to have
because it is a contagious disease which

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:11.340
because it is a contagious disease which
 

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.030
because it is a contagious disease which
can is which can get transmitted from

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:14.040
can is which can get transmitted from
 

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.400
can is which can get transmitted from
one animal to the other especially when

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:16.410
one animal to the other especially when
 

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.860
one animal to the other especially when
animals are sharing food together when

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:18.870
animals are sharing food together when
 

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.260
animals are sharing food together when
animals are sharing the same shelter and

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:21.270
animals are sharing the same shelter and
 

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:24.320
animals are sharing the same shelter and
sharing the breath as well so it can

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:24.330
sharing the breath as well so it can
 

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.720
sharing the breath as well so it can
also pose danger so I don't know if

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:26.730
also pose danger so I don't know if
 

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.970
also pose danger so I don't know if

maybe in a very short space we will
 

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.070
maybe in a very short space we will
start to see some developments on this

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080
start to see some developments on this
 

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:48.440
start to see some developments on this
one or maybe they will survive it

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:48.450

become 16 to 20 month two years in full
 

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:58.640
become 16 to 20 month two years in full
is when they start to learn how to be

00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:58.650

by themselves but when they are younger
than that the chances of them to take

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920
than that the chances of them to take
 

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.980
than that the chances of them to take
down something is very much low and

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:12.990
down something is very much low and

down something is very much low and
again they can spoil the chances of the

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:10.860
our morphism between hyenas in general
 

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:14.390
our morphism between hyenas in general
and so generally the females are bigger

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400
and so generally the females are bigger
 

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.080
and so generally the females are bigger
than males

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:15.090
than males
 

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:17.600
than males
but a dominant female is generally even

but a dominant female is generally even
bigger so then others males are

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:20.070
bigger so then others males are
 

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:22.490
bigger so then others males are
generally much smaller but these three

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.500
generally much smaller but these three
 

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:24.920
generally much smaller but these three
look very similar in size at the moments

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:24.930
look very similar in size at the moments
 

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:26.360
look very similar in size at the moments
and there's it's very difficult really

energy this has got something to do with
 

01:51:35.149 --> 01:51:37.659
energy this has got something to do with
the management of energy so that they

01:51:37.659 --> 01:51:37.669
the management of energy so that they
 

01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:39.879
the management of energy so that they
conserve energy during the daytime in

01:54:08.429 --> 01:54:18.160
 
so you can see that now they are still

01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:18.170
 
 

01:54:18.170 --> 01:54:20.860

ticks pride but they aware about I am

01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:24.710
ticks pride but they aware about I am
 

01:54:24.710 --> 01:54:26.950
ticks pride but they aware about I am
not too sure but I hear that the east s

01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960
not too sure but I hear that the east s
 

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:29.530
not too sure but I hear that the east s
takes pride in the area which is one of

01:54:29.530 --> 01:54:29.540
takes pride in the area which is one of
 

01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:32.080
takes pride in the area which is one of
the beautiful prize as well but the

01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:32.090
the beautiful prize as well but the
 

01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:34.480
the beautiful prize as well but the
chances of seeing the sticks prize are

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:34.490
chances of seeing the sticks prize are
 

01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:38.560
chances of seeing the sticks prize are
very much low at the moment so just same

01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:38.570
very much low at the moment so just same
 

01:54:38.570 --> 01:54:41.050
very much low at the moment so just same
applies to the Tala mati I have last

01:54:41.050 --> 01:54:41.060
applies to the Tala mati I have last
 

01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:52.150
applies to the Tala mati I have last
seen them long time ago so at least the

01:54:52.150 --> 01:54:52.160
seen them long time ago so at least the
 

01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:55.330
seen them long time ago so at least the
humans are becoming much more regular

01:54:55.330 --> 01:54:55.340
humans are becoming much more regular
 

01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:58.090
humans are becoming much more regular
because these are the ones I'm seeing a

01:54:58.090 --> 01:54:58.100
because these are the ones I'm seeing a
 

01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:16.060
because these are the ones I'm seeing a
lot of times together with their focus

01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:16.070
 
 

01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:23.330
 
so

01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:23.340
 
 

01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:26.180

01:55:27.930 --> 01:55:42.370
well but just here do you want to know
something about me and the vehicle

01:55:42.370 --> 01:55:42.380
 
 

01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:46.810
 
James that is a very important question

01:55:46.810 --> 01:55:46.820
James that is a very important question
 

01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:50.660
James that is a very important question
when I am in the vehicle all I've got to

01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:50.670
when I am in the vehicle all I've got to
 

01:55:50.670 --> 01:55:54.169
when I am in the vehicle all I've got to
do every time is to remain seated if I

01:55:54.169 --> 01:55:54.179
do every time is to remain seated if I
 

01:55:54.179 --> 01:55:57.530
do every time is to remain seated if I
stand here now I am going to break the

01:55:57.530 --> 01:55:57.540
stand here now I am going to break the
 

01:55:57.540 --> 01:55:59.870
stand here now I am going to break the
shape of the vehicle these lines you are

01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880
shape of the vehicle these lines you are
 

01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:02.330
shape of the vehicle these lines you are
seeing here in front of me when seeing

01:56:02.330 --> 01:56:02.340
seeing here in front of me when seeing
 

01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:05.570
seeing here in front of me when seeing
me in the vehicle as well as sensor they

01:56:05.570 --> 01:56:05.580
me in the vehicle as well as sensor they
 

01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:09.500
me in the vehicle as well as sensor they
see us as one object when we stand is

01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:09.510
see us as one object when we stand is
 

01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:12.260
see us as one object when we stand is
when we are going to break the shape and

01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:12.270
when we are going to break the shape and
 

01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:15.080
when we are going to break the shape and
they will start to notice and realize

01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:15.090
they will start to notice and realize
 

01:56:15.090 --> 01:56:17.600
they will start to notice and realize
there is a movement so that is why it is

01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:17.610
there is a movement so that is why it is
 

01:56:17.610 --> 01:56:20.540
there is a movement so that is why it is
important that we remain seated and we

01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:20.550
important that we remain seated and we
 

01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:33.289
important that we remain seated and we
move very slowly

01:56:33.289 --> 01:56:33.299
 
 

01:56:33.299 --> 01:56:35.809
 
so you can see that the presence of the

01:56:35.809 --> 01:56:35.819
so you can see that the presence of the
 

01:56:35.819 --> 01:56:39.109
so you can see that the presence of the
vehicle is not worrying these lines they

01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119
vehicle is not worrying these lines they

about rank changing with a new clan well

02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760
about rank changing with a new clan well
 

02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:06.420
about rank changing with a new clan well
what would cause a a clan to change and

02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:06.430
what would cause a a clan to change and
 

02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:08.070
what would cause a a clan to change and
what would cause them to do that and

02:04:08.070 --> 02:04:08.080
what would cause them to do that and
 

02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:10.680
what would cause them to do that and
maybe a mid sort of ranking female might

02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:10.690
maybe a mid sort of ranking female might
 

02:04:10.690 --> 02:04:13.410
maybe a mid sort of ranking female might
move often she might find herself or

02:04:13.410 --> 02:04:13.420
move often she might find herself or
 

02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:15.660
move often she might find herself or
take with her some males and most

02:04:15.660 --> 02:04:15.670
take with her some males and most
 

02:04:15.670 --> 02:04:17.910
take with her some males and most
certainly if a female or two females

02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920
certainly if a female or two females
 

02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:19.950
certainly if a female or two females
moved off then one of them would most

02:04:19.950 --> 02:04:19.960
moved off then one of them would most
 

02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:23.130
moved off then one of them would most
likely through dominance display it

02:04:23.130 --> 02:04:23.140
likely through dominance display it
 

02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:27.300
likely through dominance display it
looks painful the dominance display will

02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:27.310
looks painful the dominance display will
 

02:04:27.310 --> 02:04:29.250
looks painful the dominance display will
then establish who would be the

02:04:29.250 --> 02:04:29.260
then establish who would be the
 

02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:32.370
then establish who would be the
matriarch so most certainly rank would

02:04:32.370 --> 02:04:32.380
matriarch so most certainly rank would
 

02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:35.640
matriarch so most certainly rank would
probably change but within a clan it can

02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:35.650
probably change but within a clan it can
 

02:04:35.650 --> 02:04:38.670
probably change but within a clan it can
only change through dominance and it's

02:04:38.670 --> 02:04:38.680
only change through dominance and it's
 

02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:40.530
only change through dominance and it's
not a it's not a common for it to happen
