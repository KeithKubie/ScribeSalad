00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.640
 Do you hear "Yanni"? 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.780
 Mother of "Laurel"? 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.940
 A recent poll found that 47% of the people hear "Yanni" while 53% hear "Laurel" 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.900
 It is clear that this created controversy in the Internet which led to the division of the nation 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.940
 So what is science behind madness? 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.300
 One of the first aspects is setup 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.860
 If you play this section without providing the option "Yani" or "Laurel" 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.220
 You may not have heard any of these words 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.420
 But by reading them, you are preparing to hear one or the other. 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.620
 Second, when you talk, you produce sound waves that spread through the air 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.140
 This is a visual recording of sound waves to record the original Yani / Laurel 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.480
 Created by Brad Stewart, Professor of Speech, Language and Hearing 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.280
 Here is his portrayal of saying "Laurel" 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.360
 You can see that the audio characteristics are very similar 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.240
 Here is a depiction of him saying "Yani" 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.700
 The audio features are also similar 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.420
 So, the words "Yani" and "Laurel" are more vocal than you think 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.720
 Whether you're listening to a laptop, phone or headphones 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.860
 It will affect what you hear based on the sound quality 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.220
 But what if you listen through the same device but you hear different things with someone beside you 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.840
 This may be related to the age of your ears 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.920
 Sounds in "Yani" play on the highest frequency of the votes in "Laurel" 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.600
 As we get older, our ears are less able to hear higher frequencies 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.220
 If you hear "yani", you may have younger ears 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.800
 Luckily with the help of the Internet, we can hear both 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.340
 The wonderful Twitter user posted "xxv @" cut to the sound tone brought down and up 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.760
 When you hear it low 30%, you will hear "Yanni" 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.500
 Yani 2x 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.460
 But when you hear her with a 30% higher note, you are likely to hear "Laurel" 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.540
 Laurel 2x 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:03.640
 Your brain has a lot of stimulation at all times, using existing information and subtle neural pathways to focus its attention 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.280
 This is why in a noisy party you can listen to your friend by your side 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.920
 But pay close attention to another conversation if necessary 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.600
 Similarly, your brain unconsciously chooses any frequencies in the recording to notice it 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.780
 So ... what is the final answer? 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.660
 If you hear "Laurel", you are right! The original recording is Laurel's saying 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.260
 But with higher frequencies added, create ambiguity 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.060
 You love learning about amazing and interesting things in the world? 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.640
 In fact, we just started a new podcast called "SIDENOTE" 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.300
 Where we explore things that hinder us or make us curious in life 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.260
 Then enter all the sciences that raise the mind behind them 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.220
 We are happy to check it out on iTunes or any podcast application you use 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.540
 Your support means a lot to us as we slowly embark on a journey to explore more science in a new way 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.500
 Again it is called SIDENOTE which is new, so we are excited to know what you think 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.800
 We'll leave some links below 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.800
