00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.388
So now let consider any equation of a circle that's centered at the origin. So,

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:09.084
here's a new piece of string. And I'm going to cut it. So that way, I don't

00:00:09.084 --> 00:00:15.620
know the radius. So we'll let the length of this string be r. We don't know it.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.120
And at this length, we'll represent the radius of our new circle. And remember,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.216
we can create this circle by plotting all the points of the end of the string.

00:00:26.216 --> 00:00:33.682
If we do this, what equation describes this circle? Write that equation here.

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:40.543
Now, if you're a little stumped. Remember that you're centered at the origin.

00:00:40.543 --> 00:00:42.904
And any point out here is x, y.
