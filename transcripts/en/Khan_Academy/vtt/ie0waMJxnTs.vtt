00:00:00.648 --> 00:00:04.817
Voiceover:We have one, two, three,

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:08.104
four, five blueberries here,

00:00:08.104 --> 00:00:10.535
so we have five blueberries,

00:00:10.535 --> 00:00:19.466
and we have one, two, three
cherries, three cherries.

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:23.088
Now, if I wanted to figure
out the total number

00:00:23.088 --> 00:00:24.952
of fruit that I have here,

00:00:24.952 --> 00:00:28.327
I could say the total
number of pieces of fruit,

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:33.138
what should I do? Should
I add five plus three?

00:00:33.138 --> 00:00:36.122
So, should I add five plus three,

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:40.743
or should I subtract? Should
I do five minus three,

00:00:40.743 --> 00:00:44.705
to get the total number
of fruit that I have?

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:46.983
I encourage you to pause the video now,

00:00:46.983 --> 00:00:50.522
and try to think about it on your own.

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:52.627
If I want the total number of fruit,

00:00:52.627 --> 00:00:54.987
I'm starting with five blueberries,

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:57.387
and now I have three more.

00:00:57.387 --> 00:00:59.288
I'm going to add three.

00:00:59.288 --> 00:01:01.833
I'm going to get a larger number of fruit.

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:04.877
I start with five; I'm
going to have three more,

00:01:04.877 --> 00:01:07.955
so I am going to add three,

00:01:07.955 --> 00:01:10.131
and so, how many blueberries do I have?

00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:13.404
What's five plus three?
It's one, two, three,

00:01:13.404 --> 00:01:20.437
four, five, six, seven,
eight pieces of fruit.

00:01:20.437 --> 00:01:22.450
Eight pieces of fruit.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.750
Now, what would five
minus three have meant?

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.360
What would five minus three,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.305
five minus three, what would that mean?

00:01:33.305 --> 00:01:36.996
You can imagine starting off
with five pieces of fruit,

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:41.277
let me copy and paste
that, copy and paste that,

00:01:41.277 --> 00:01:43.955
so, if you start with
five pieces of fruit,

00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:46.116
and now if you're subtracting three,

00:01:46.116 --> 00:01:48.891
this means taking away
three of your fruit,

00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:51.889
so take away one, take away two,

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:55.303
and take away three, so
how many are you left with?

00:01:55.303 --> 00:01:59.090
You're just left with these,
one, two, right over here,

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.729
so five minus three is two.

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.916
If someone says, "Hey,
I have five blueberries,

00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:05.562
"and then I have three more cherries,

00:02:05.562 --> 00:02:06.673
"how many pieces of fruit?"

00:02:06.673 --> 00:02:08.467
well, now I'm going to be adding.

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:10.249
If someone says, "I have five blueberries,

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:12.085
"and then I ate three of them,

00:02:12.085 --> 00:02:13.549
"how many do I have left?"

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.284
well, then you have two left.
