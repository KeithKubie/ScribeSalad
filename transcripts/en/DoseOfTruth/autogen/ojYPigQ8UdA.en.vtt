even have a conversation with any of
 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.849
even have a conversation with any of
these women they were hysterical about

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859
these women they were hysterical about
 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.710
these women they were hysterical about
the subject of biology they knew nothing

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720
the subject of biology they knew nothing
 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.289
the subject of biology they knew nothing
about hormones right I mean I I probably

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299
about hormones right I mean I I probably
 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.759
about hormones right I mean I I probably
got in fistfights over this they went

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769
got in fistfights over this they went
 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.710
got in fistfights over this they went
people were so convinced that biology

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720
people were so convinced that biology
 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.629
people were so convinced that biology
had nothing whatever to do with gender

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639
had nothing whatever to do with gender
 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.089
had nothing whatever to do with gender
differences see that also seems to me to

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099
differences see that also seems to me to
 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.339
differences see that also seems to me to
be related to the postmodern emphasis on

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349
be related to the postmodern emphasis on
 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.650
be related to the postmodern emphasis on
power yeah because there's a there's

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660
power yeah because there's a there's
 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.689
power yeah because there's a there's
something terrible underground going on

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699
something terrible underground going on
 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.580
something terrible underground going on
there and that is and I think this is

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590
there and that is and I think this is
 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.050
there and that is and I think this is
the sort of thing that was reflected in

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060
the sort of thing that was reflected in
 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.000
the sort of thing that was reflected in
the Soviet Union too and the especially

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010
the Soviet Union too and the especially
 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.589
the Soviet Union too and the especially
in the 20s when there was this idea a

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599
in the 20s when there was this idea a
 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.569
in the 20s when there was this idea a
radical idea that you could remake human

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579
radical idea that you could remake human
 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.369
radical idea that you could remake human
beings entirely right because they have

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379
beings entirely right because they have
 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.129
beings entirely right because they have
no essential nature and so if your

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139
no essential nature and so if your
 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.259
no essential nature and so if your
fundamental hypothesis is that nothing

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269
fundamental hypothesis is that nothing
 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.720
fundamental hypothesis is that nothing
exists except power and you believe that

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730
exists except power and you believe that
 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.210
exists except power and you believe that
then that also gives you the right in

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220
then that also gives you the right in
 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.939
then that also gives you the right in
some sense to exercise your power at the

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949
some sense to exercise your power at the
 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.710
some sense to exercise your power at the
creation of the kind of humanity that

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720
creation of the kind of humanity that
 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.960
creation of the kind of humanity that
your utopian vision envisions and then

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970
your utopian vision envisions and then
 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.180
your utopian vision envisions and then
that has no that and that also seems to

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190
that has no that and that also seems to
 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.399
that has no that and that also seems to
me to justify the postmodern insistence

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409
me to justify the postmodern insistence
 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.379
me to justify the postmodern insistence
that everything is only a linguistic

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389
that everything is only a linguistic
 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.300
that everything is only a linguistic
construct it again goes down to the

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310
construct it again goes down to the
 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.860
construct it again goes down to the
notion of power which Derrida and

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870
notion of power which Derrida and
 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.899
notion of power which Derrida and
Foucault and Lacan so bloody obsessed

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909
Foucault and Lacan so bloody obsessed
 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.149
Foucault and Lacan so bloody obsessed
with and so and it seems to me what

with and so and it seems to me what
 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.920
with and so and it seems to me what
they're trying to do is to it to tape

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930
they're trying to do is to it to tape
 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.290
they're trying to do is to it to tape
all

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300
all
 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.270
all
all the potential power for the creation

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280
all the potential power for the creation
 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.189
all the potential power for the creation
of human beings to themselves without

of human beings to themselves without
any bounding conditions whatsoever right

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330
any bounding conditions whatsoever right
 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.510
any bounding conditions whatsoever right
there's no history there's no biology

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520
there's no history there's no biology
 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.149
there's no history there's no biology
there's and and everything is a fluid

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159
there's and and everything is a fluid

and so meaning in Canada there are

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569
and so meaning in Canada there are
 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.020
and so meaning in Canada there are
terrible arguments right now about

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030
terrible arguments right now about
 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.339
terrible arguments right now about
biological essentialism let's say and

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349
biological essentialism let's say and
 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:45.839
biological essentialism let's say and
one of the things that happened which

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849
one of the things that happened which
 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.820
one of the things that happened which
was something I objected to precisely a

year ago is that the social

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.180
constructionist view of human identity
has been built now into Canadian law so

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190
has been built now into Canadian law so
 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.879
has been built now into Canadian law so
there's an insistence that biological
