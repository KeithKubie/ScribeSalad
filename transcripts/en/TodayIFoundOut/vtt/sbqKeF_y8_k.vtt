00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:17.410
In 
mid-2005 players logging on to play the popular

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.700
online multiplayer game World of Warcraft
found themselves besieged by a virulent virtual

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.500
plague nobody knew how to cure or effectively
combat.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.260
For around a month the plague spread unchecked
throughout the kingdom of Azeroth, killing

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.989
tens of thousands of players’ characters
and intriguing experts who’ve since used

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.040
the plague as a model for real world bioterrorism
and epidemic research.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.580
Known as the Corrupted Blood Incident, the
plague’s genesis can be traced to a September

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.430
13th World of Warcraft update that introduced
a new dungeon and super-boss for high-level

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.050
players to test their mettle against- an ancient
blood god called Hakkar the Soulflayer.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.930
While felling the powerful foe, any player
who got too close to Hakkar while he was in

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.960
the throes of death would be afflicted with
potent debuff called Corrupted Blood which,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.490
in addition to considerably initial damage,
would cause additional damage every 2 seconds

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.259
for a total of 10 seconds.

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.650
As an idea of how dangerous this debuff was,
it’s noted that this single attack could

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.520
near instantly kill any low-level player.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.820
On top of all this, the debuff was also highly
contagious and could be spread to any nearby

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.820
player if they similarly got too close while
a given player was still being affected by

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.820
it.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.299
Further, because of the way the debuff worked,
a player who survived an initial infection

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.110
could be re-infected by an ally and in turn,
pass the debuff on to others, with this process

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.229
potentially being repeated until the player
either died or left the vicinity of Hakkar’s

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.610
corpse or another who was infected.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.440
Now the original intention on behalf of Blizzard
(the makers of World of Warcraft) was for

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.590
this debuff to be limited exclusively to the
encounter with Hakkar and by extension the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.990
special high-level dungeon he resided in.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.049
However, as with many plagues, it turns out
there was a very simple way to spread this

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.189
to the wider world- animals.

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.979
You see, players (and eventually Blizzard)
realised that a character’s pet could similarly

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.030
be infected with Corrupted Blood, and it didn’t
take long for players to notice that this

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.580
could be spread to other places if they dismissed
their pet within a few seconds of it being

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.580
infected.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.280
Why was this important?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.670
Because the player could then recall the still
infected pet at any time, including, say,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.409
in the middle of a populated city.

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:28.790
Exactly who first noticed this isn’t clear
and Blizzard themselves have since admitted

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.970
they have no idea who the virtual patient
zero was or if the initial spread was intentional

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.590
or just by accident via recalling a pet the
person didn’t know would still be infected.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.430
Whoever it was, the first server known to
be struck by the virtual plague was the Realm

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.290
of Archimonde, which was devastated when an
unknown player unleashed the Corrupted Blood

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.030
on the city of Iron Forge.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.540
Because, as noted previously, those afflicted
with Corrupted Blood would immediately receive

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.610
significant damage, Corrupted Blood was potent
enough to outright kill some low-level players

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.150
while many higher level characters were killed
by the resulting drip feed of damage caused

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.180
by the debuff’s secondary effect and the
ability to get it again from others around.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.390
You might think that this would burn itself
out quickly with no widespread damage, but

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.329
here’s the thing- while NPCs (Non Player
Characters) could be afflicted with Corrupted

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.040
Blood, because they couldn’t die, they would
act as carriers of the disease, facilitating

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.890
the spread of the plague and ensuring that
after everyone died and respawned, the reaping

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.939
of life would begin anew.

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:28.400
For days after, the cities throughout Archimonde
were littered with skeletons and news of the

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.299
virulent, deadly plague sweeping across the
server caused quite the commotion in the spheres

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.909
of gaming and tech journalism.

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.950
Initially, most assumed that the plague was
an in-game event of some kind, perhaps to

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.150
celebrate the recent update, and some even
applauded Blizzard for their ingenuity in

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.580
creating what one player described as “the
first proper ‘world event’” ever seen

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.580
in World of Warcraft.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.950
Internally, however, Blizzard employees were
initially baffled by the spread of the virtual

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.900
disease and it took some time to figured out
that Hakkar the Blood God was responsible

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.260
for the untold death and destruction being
rained down upon the denizens of Azeroth.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.459
During this time, the plague spread to other
servers and before long entire cities were

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.230
devoid of life- the streets paved with the
bones of the dead.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.890
Frustrated with a lack of communication from
Blizzard, as Blizzard’s chief of staff,

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.200
Shane Dabiri, would later discuss, without
instruction players began setting up their

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.030
own quarantines around major population centres
to halt the spread of the plague.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.780
In addition, higher-level players who were
capable of surviving the effects of the Corrupted

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.130
Blood began venturing into the cities to seek
out clues as to what was going on, while lower

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.320
levels players who couldn’t, would stand
guard outside, warning approaching players

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.060
not to enter the infected area.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.470
On top of this, players with characters that
had access to healing magic rushed to help

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.070
in any way they could, working in shifts to
heal infected players and stem the flow of

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.350
virtual blood.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.640
Again, nobody told anyone to do this, the
players did it of their own volition, and

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.320
by the time Blizzard released an official
statement about the plague that also asked

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.170
players to voluntarily quarantine themselves
while they fixed the problem, players in the

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.270
most severely infected areas had already done
exactly that.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.320
Unfortunately for everyone, Bilzzard’s first
few attempts to put a stop to the plague failed

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.660
spectacularly thanks to a small, but equally
as dedicated subsection of players who actively

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.460
resisted Blizzard’s attempts to eradicate
the plague.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.210
This began a game of cat and mouse between
Blizzard and players who wanted to keep spreading

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.570
the disease, apparently just for their own
amusement- just as in real life, some people

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.450
just like to watch the world burn.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.860
A shadowy cabal of players intent on spreading
the plague further and further spent their

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.630
time hiding in the mountains, periodically
returning to cities to break quarantines and

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.980
ensure NPCs remained infected, as well as
hopping between realms to avoid server purges.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.260
All in all it took Blizzard around a month
to fully rid the game of the plague and they

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.340
were forced to quite literally reset the entire
world, as well as issue a patch to get rid

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.620
of the bug that allowed pets to spread the
disease beyond its intended original boundary.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.790
Along with being a frankly amazing story,
the Corrupted Blood incident has endlessly

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.110
intrigued experts on infectious diseases and
bioterrorism who feel the reactions of players

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.570
and Blizzard can serve as a useful model for
real world pandemics and terrorist attacks.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.540
For example, in 2008, epidemiologist Nina
H. Fefferman noted that the Corrupted Blood

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.610
incident closely (though not perfectly) mirrored
a real world epidemic, pointing specifically

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.810
to how many players initially ignored Blizzard’s
warnings to stay away from populated areas

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.860
and the fact that opportunistic players quickly
used the situation to break long held in-game

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.570
taboos, all especially similar to how real
people react in a comparable real world situation.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.820
Fefferman also noted that the origins of the
Corrupted Blood plague and it’s spread were

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.720
eerily similar to modern epidemics, noting
of the virtual disease:

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.190
it originated in a remote, uninhabited region
and was carried by travelers to urban centers;

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.240
hosts were both human and animal, such as
with avian flu; it was spread by close spatial

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.530
contact; and there were asymptomatic individuals
– in this case, invulnerable NPCs

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.230
Likewise terrorism experts have also noted
that there could be some value in studying

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.950
the response of players to the Corrupted Blood
incident.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.600
For example, in a 2008 interview with Wired
Charles Blair of the Center for Terrorism

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.080
and Intelligence Studies explained that the
game and the mentality of players who willingly

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.880
engaged in spreading a virtual plague could
potentially be used “to study how terrorist

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.120
cells form and operate”.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.470
As to why players’ behaviors in many cases
mimicked real life, Dr. Sherry Turkle of MIT

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.740
noted, “It’s not that it’s not part
of your real life just because it’s happening

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.740
on the screen.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.070
It becomes integrated into really what you
do every day.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:33.230
And so where you have loss of that part of
your life that was involved in the habits

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.200
and the rituals and the daily life, it’s
very traumatic.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.530
It is play, but it’s very serious play.”

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.270
Unsurprisingly, Blizzard weren’t happy about
these types of comparisons, releasing a statement

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.520
that read, in part:

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.730
As we have always stated, World of Warcraft
is first and foremost a game.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:57.680
It’s never been designed to mirror reality
or anything

00:07:57.680 --> 00:09:28.149
in the real world.
