00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.020
What can termites teach us about
designing green buildings?

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.270
As it turns out, a lot.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.550
In Namibia, SEAS researchers led by Professor
L. Mahadevan are studying

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:20.700
how African termites use solar energy to heat,
cool and ventilate their massive colonies.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.520
Termite mounds have long fascinated scientists.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.480
These feats of natural engineering built
from saliva and mud can reach up to 20

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.510
feet high.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.909
While they might look like sky scrappers
termites actually live deep underground.

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:44.829
The mounds are complex climate control systems,
regulating temperature and CO2 for the colony

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.379
underneath.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.809
In a recent paper, professor Mahadevan and
his team found that mounds in India and Africa

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.239
harness periodic solar heating to drive
ventilation inside them in very different

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.740
environments, functioning as an external lung.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.799
Using a specially designed sensor, the researchers
found that solar heating creates temperature

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.880
gradients that drive wind currents inside
the mound.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.530
As the sun moves across the sky, the wind
circulation inside the mound reverses,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.229
moving gases around in the mound
and allowing for carbon dioxide and oxygen

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.840
to be exchanged efficiently across the walls
of the mound.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.680
The researchers hope this will inspire
human

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.340
architects to design better heating, cooling
and ventilation systems, making our buildings

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.640
greener and more efficient.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.640
