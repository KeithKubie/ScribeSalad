00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We're back in our editor, and we have our app that if the submission is not valid,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we just rewrite the form out, and if it is valid, we say, Thanks!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now let's work on this invalid case. Let's make that a little bit more friendly.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The first thing we want to do is tell the user there was an error.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Let's figure out a way to do that.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We're going to add a little section to our form here

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
for a little placeholder for our error message.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
After our form, we're going to have a . You remember .

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's just a block element with no special styling or anything like that.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It'll just make a new line for us, and inside that, we're going to print our error message,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and we're going to use the string substitution we just learned to print our error message.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now I'm going to do 1 more thing here as I'm going to make this text appear red.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm going to add a little CSS--style, color, red.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now this is--like I said, we're not going to spend a whole lot of time in CSS,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but this is 1 example of how'd we use it.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This will make this text in this appear red.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Okay, so we need to update our form a little bit or the way we use form to use this.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Since we're going to be printing the form in a couple of places--here and here--

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
let's generalize this into a function.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So I'm going to add a new function called write_form,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and this is going to take a parameter for the error message,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and the default value of this parameter is going to be the empty string.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
All this is going to do is just going to self.response.out--it's going to write our form

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
like we've been doing before, but we have to use a string substitution now

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
because we've included a variable in our form.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We have to address it here, and we're going to say, error equals error.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So this is going to say the string error in our form will be equal to the value

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
of this variable here, error.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So this variable in the function is used down here,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and it refers to the string substitution error here.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Okay, now we need to use this function, and we have this new function write_form,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
so let's use it everywhere where we draw our form now.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So we can use it here in our GET function,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
so now we can say self.write_form,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and error takes a default parameter, so we don't need to specify it here.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We can also use it down here in our POST function.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We can say self.write_form, and now we can give it an error message.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Okay, so what have we done?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We've updated our form.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We've made a new write_form function that should be a nice way of calling this,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and we've used our write_form function here.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Our GET, remember, just draws the empty form

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and our POST, down here, should draw the form with a new error message.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So let's give this a try out in practice.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
There's one last thing we forgot to do.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The first parameter to all of our functions inside a class should be self

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
because otherwise this self here wouldn't be referring to anything.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Okay, so we've got that in place. Let's try this out in our browser.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Here we are in our browser.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Let's give our form a shot.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I'm going to type in some invalid data first because that's what we were just testing.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So invalid everything, and we submit this form.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Aha! Now we have our error message, and it appeared red like we wanted it to.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Really cool!

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So now the user has an opportunity to submit the form again in a valid way.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Okay, so we're going to fill out this form with correct data,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and when we submit it now, we still see our success message. Cool!

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Alright, so we're making progress.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
One thing that would be nice is if when we entered bad data--

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
when we entered an invalid form--and we submit this,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
it would be nice if it left our values in here for us, so we don't have to enter everything

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
over and over again, especially the ones that are already valid.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Let's make that work.
