00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,090
They're very excited about
that. Um, and by the way,

10
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:34,400
I asked the director if it's okay
if I tell you what movie it is,

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,500
cause I never know, you know, do you leak
out information? He said it was cool.

12
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:40,400
So the movie's called

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,840
Front Runner Front Rado and
it stars Hugh Jackman and uh,

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,400
directed by Jason Reitman.
Okay, there you go. So, oh,

15
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:56,510
freckles has a little part in there.
Don't blink your eyes,

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,250
you might miss me. But uh, that
is what I am working on out here.

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,850
And um, every time I go down
to set, I'm telling you,

18
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:09,170
they show me something that they shot
and it looks really, really fucking cool.

19
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,970
So I'm very excited to be in a,
in this movie here.

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,050
But uh, yeah, so I got
one day, one a I like,

21
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,040
I got one scene today site and
I'm the first one out of the gate.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,830
That's about as good as it gets.
You know what I mean?

23
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:27,050
Sometimes you the first
scene and the last scene,

24
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,700
but you get to see everybody else act and
everything like that. And that's cool,

25
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,630
right? The only thing that's bad about
being there the entire fucking day is for

26
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:39,650
whatever reason, um, when
you're on a movie set,

27
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:42,140
you just eat like a fucking,
I don't even know why.

28
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:44,270
You don't even know why you're eating.
You're just sitting there going,

29
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,470
why am I eating right now?

30
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,020
Just standing around and all of a sudden
they bring around some fucking, uh,

31
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,080
oh Halloween's coming up here.
Some fucking Halloween cookies.

32
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,290
They start eating like Erin in the
fifth grade, literally eating it,

33
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,890
looking at another adult
who's also eating, getting
you both say the same time.

34
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,350
But the fuck are we doing?
Um,

35
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,460
I've actually been pretty good on this
shoot and the food's been awesome. So, uh,

36
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:15,461
and I did lay off the Halloween cookies
and I'm doing my fucking catio today.

37
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,980
But in a professional,
God dammit,

38
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,030
you guys all know what a
freckle booze bag bag am, right?

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,740
You all know how I can't lay off the
booze. Um, I've been doing it man,

40
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:30,620
70 fucking days. So a, I don't know,

41
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,570
think on day 73 already be 20%
of the year already have that in.

42
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,920
I might go a year, I might go a
year. I might fucking bows tonight.

43
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,330
I don't know. Who knows? It's
exciting. It's an exciting time.

44
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,480
You think that world series game
last night was fucking riveting?

45
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,060
That was, that was a joke compared
to watching me try to walk by a bar.

46
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,240
Um, I was on set last night
so I didn't get to, I saw, uh,

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,010
it was three

48
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,010
to one and then,
uh,

49
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,170
we were shooting the final thing and I
checked the score and I saw was three to

50
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:09,850
three is like, Holy Shit.
The Astros came back and um,

51
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,090
we ended up wrapping and uh,
it was like five to three.

52
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:16,924
Houston.

53
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:18,570
Yeah.

54
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,850
So I, you know, we go down there,

55
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,290
we get out of our fucking
clothes and all that shit.

56
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:27,210
We had get back into the regular
clothes to head back to the hotel,

57
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,570
everything shut down here.
And me and another actor went into the,

58
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:34,380
this bar that we saw that was open and uh,

59
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,020
try and get something to eat.

60
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:41,130
I think it was like after 12 at that
point was gonna slip tickets around the

61
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:42,810
area that we're staying at.
And uh,

62
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:46,200
we walked into the bar and saw that
it was five to five. I was like,

63
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,010
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
Well, maybe it was seven to five.

64
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,280
Seven to five.
Yeah.

65
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:58,281
The last I saw it was five to three
Astros' and in the time it took me to get

66
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,870
off set, jump in the van and head
back, it became seven to five Astros.

67
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,340
And I was like,
what the fuck happened?

68
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,500
I'm missing one of the greatest
world series games probably ever.

69
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,230
And um, so we go in there and we
asked the guy behind the bar, right.

70
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,120
You know, and the guy's like, he's
like, sorry, fellows. The fucking,

71
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:23,910
I can't even explain how
high this guy's voice was.

72
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,260
I Dunno if he was in the middle of
transitioning or whatever. I have no idea.

73
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:29,094
But it was like,

74
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,280
it was like Michael Jackson
level high inexplicably,

75
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,740
and the guy had stubble on his face.
I don't get it right.

76
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,370
Um, you look like a giant, like marionette
puppet and he's gone. Sorry fellows.

77
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:46,470
If you want [inaudible] you gotta go.

78
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,530
So fortunately this guy with the
high pitch voice told us where to go.

79
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,060
We ended up going all the
way down the street and uh,

80
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,330
like four or five blocks down and
it was really cold, uh, for Atlanta.

81
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:02,820
I thought he meant I'm sitting with a
little fucking sweatshirt and we went down

82
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:07,350
and found this bar that was still open
and we get in there, it's seven to five.

83
00:05:07,351 --> 00:05:10,710
And as we walk in the door,
the Dodgers hit a home run,

84
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,770
I think to make it seven to six.

85
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,630
Okay.

86
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,380
They're only down by running. It's
like, you've gotta be kidding.

87
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:20,380
This is unbelievable.
And um,

88
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,810
unfortunately the game ended day.

89
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:25,510
I was sitting there because I wanted the
Astros to tie it up cause I want more,

90
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,310
more baseball. I want to see a, I want
to see a seven game series here. But uh,

91
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,940
I wanted the Dodgers to tie it
up cause I was hoping, you know,

92
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,860
I wasn't going to bed.
I was fucking wired.

93
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:37,780
I was hoping to get like
15 innings of baseball,

94
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:41,320
but congratulations to the Astros.
You know,

95
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,850
and things are getting a
little chippy out there.

96
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:45,880
I guess they're imitating some guy in the
Dodgers. That guy with the Blue Mohawk,

97
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:47,110
I don't know anybody's fucking name.

98
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,920
I guess he flips the bat and sticks his
tongue out so they're like, oh yeah,

99
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,280
well we're going to flip the bat.
We're going to stick our tongues out.

100
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,480
These are adult males, everybody, um,

101
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,800
stupid shit ever. But it's
been a, a incredible series.

102
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:07,130
So I'm hoping game three,
I'll actually be, uh,

103
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,600
I'll be home and I can sit down and
watch it. Now watch game three will suck.

104
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,890
You know what I mean? The pictures
dull, not even a good one.

105
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,350
They believe stranded base
runners. Um, and that's it.

106
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:24,440
That's all the fuck I got. I don't know
what to tell you. I'm just been, um,

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,270
working like a maniac. So I mean
the first scene tonight, uh, today,

108
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,970
which is great because,
um,

109
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,400
I'm actually going to do a
little promotion here. Um,

110
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,050
there's a 30 for 30 coming out,
an arguably one of the greatest,

111
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,030
if not the greatest entertainer of all
time and wrestler of all time ric Flair,

112
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,230
the ric flair,

113
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,210
30 for 30 is coming out and they're
having a premiere tonight and uh,

114
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,780
I'm going to go to it and I think
ric flair is going to be there.

115
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,070
So I'm going to go a little Jim Norton
here and try to get my picture cause I've

116
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:03,550
had a Twitter photo up on my,
uh,

117
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,350
whatever they buy Twitter accounts since
then. That was taken in June of 2014.

118
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:12,220
I still remember, I got
to meet him, talk to him.

119
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:17,170
He was the coolest fucking dude
ever was telling stories and uh,

120
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,600
just an awesome guy. So I'm hoping
that tonight I can update my photo.

121
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,040
I'll call that be haven't updated it in
three years because it was a ric flair

122
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:28,270
photo. Hopefully I can update it again
with another one. Um, and if I don't,

123
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:30,460
who gives a shit?
I get to watch the ric flair 30 for 30,

124
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:34,030
which everybody should watch.
I don't care what's going on in your life.

125
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:37,870
I don't care if your wife's going
like maybe third time together.

126
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:42,610
We go to the pumpkin patch.
[inaudible] you got to say,

127
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,080
lady, this is one. I'm not
doing the Tivo want this one.

128
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:51,010
I'm going to watch live
fucking what do I lie? Right?

129
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,150
You got to see this one live.
And um,

130
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,510
how do you, how do you wrap up
ric flair story in 30 minutes.

131
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,100
Yeah.

132
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,500
Is that what it means? Right.
30 stories, 30 minutes long.

133
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,230
They've already done way more than 30, so
they should, you know, I already saw Dan,

134
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,190
the Dan Marino football life and that
was 30 minutes like with commercials or

135
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:19,120
something like that was her day should
have been at least 90 minutes. Um,

136
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,980
how much the game has changed

137
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,690
and how much the game had the change.

138
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,900
And how did it had it be dead to become
borderline illegal to cover a receiver

139
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,940
past, you know, your
first little, you know,

140
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,500
two yard chuck or whatever you're allowed
to do. Now all of that had to happen.

141
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,510
NFL had to try to go global and
try to get all these fucking,

142
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,390
you know, half fans by,
by running up the scores.

143
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,410
All of that had to fucking happen for
Dan Marino's records that stood for 30

144
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:55,290
years to start the fall. That's
all I'm saying. You know,

145
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,880
that should have been 90 minutes.
No, I guess you can't do that.

146
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,100
Cause then all the other legendary
players who'd be like, well,

147
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:05,740
how come my we Joey
dirty 90,

148
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,870
he sticks his Toga,

149
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,980
flips the bat and then
they'd get all fucking upset.

150
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,360
I did things too, you know. So anyways,

151
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:21,200
I'm looking forward to that
and um, I dunno, and that's it.

152
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,580
Other than that, I'm going out of
my mind, uh, being stone sober,

153
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,310
remembering every fucking
waking moment of the day. Um,

154
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,010
every day that I'm sober,
I'm reminded why I drank.

155
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,190
You know, I, I got to go to an AA meeting.

156
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:43,220
I got to hear people talk
positively about being sober.

157
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,670
Cause I gotta be honest with you,
I don't fucking get it.

158
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,550
And when I fucking lay off the booze,

159
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:51,740
all it does is make me want to try drugs.

160
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,503
You know?

161
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,120
I never smoke weed. I don't smoke. I'm not
into it. I just don't, I'm not into it.

162
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:01,700
But then if I don't drink everyone
they know a couple of times a month,

163
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,880
I'm just like, I got to fucking do
something to break up the monotony.

164
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,200
I have such a respect for
these straight edge people.

165
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,120
I don't know how they do it.

166
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,550
Okay.

167
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,040
Can I tried to tell me about being sober?
He goes, you know, you don't understand.

168
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,240
Is that like, you know, alcohol kills.

169
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,400
I haven't seen endorphins.

170
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:26,090
I don't know what it is that actually
makes you feel good about your life.

171
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:29,480
He goes, I don't drink. I'm actually,
I don't need it. I don't need a bill.

172
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,040
I'm like high on life, you know? And
I was just looking at him. I was just,

173
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,950
I couldn't help but think
you're full of shit.

174
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,010
No you're not. You know, when you're
high on life, when you're a kid,

175
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,910
you know, and you never throw out your
back and your shoulders not fucked up.

176
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:51,550
You don't have a psychotic nerve issue.
Your feet don't hurt.

177
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,710
He just get out of bed.
You're brand new,

178
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,160
you're jumping around the fucking
house doing cartwheels and shit,

179
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:59,530
running around. Hey, let's
go in the living room.

180
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,750
You just get up and you'll
run to the other room. Then
you're high on life. Yeah,

181
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,620
you don't have any credit
card debt, right? You know,

182
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,950
got a lady in your life going to wish
they didn't have a date night, right?

183
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,840
None of that bullshit. Then you
can be high on that. You on life.

184
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,630
Then you know what happens. Uh, you
know what happens? You become an adult,

185
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,610
all right? And all of a sudden
you started understanding why,

186
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,290
why it is that technically,
you know what I mean?

187
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:33,730
If you live in down on the equator,
you actually standing sideways,

188
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,990
okay? And why you don't go
flying off the fucking plan.

189
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,400
You start to understand it.
It's the weight,

190
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,900
the weight of the universe being on
this thing that's fucking spin it right.

191
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:51,820
And all this fucking debt you're fucking
accumulate and it's all coming down on

192
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:56,500
you. And the holidays coming up right
on the holidays. Fun Anymore, Huh?

193
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,700
Do you get into the Christmas spirit the
way you got to start growing around and

194
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:03,640
fucking seeing everybody and
getting on a fucking plane.

195
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,520
Watch it some Douche bag
after they just said,

196
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,610
only one thing per person
in the overhead compartment.

197
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,920
Stick three fucking bags up there.

198
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,023
You know what I mean?

199
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,860
And that's when the stewardess
comes by and she just goes,

200
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,760
can I get you something? Could you like
something to drink? It's like, yeah, lady.

201
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,920
You know those little
bottles of booze you have?

202
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,620
How many of you think you
could carry in both your arms?

203
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,600
Why don't you stuff a few in your fucking
breezier over there and bring them

204
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:35,720
over here so I can get to
this goddamn flight? Right.

205
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,650
Um, or maybe, you know, maybe you
still enjoy that time of year.

206
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,710
It's that time of year when you could say,
look at that.

207
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:51,470
I was just singing a Christmas song
when I was still in the fucking was that

208
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,160
headphone as a beer commercial
head for the mountains.

209
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,410
That taste is smooth and it's Busch beer.
Busch beer.

210
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:04,670
I love how they have the balls to do a
commercial now as if their beer tastes

211
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:07,200
good. Everybody knows
that. Busch Beers for,

212
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,610
that's what that's like when you're hung
over and you want to get back in the

213
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:13,900
game. You know that
said, you know, Cook me.

214
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,780
Let me fucking slit your fucking eyelids.

215
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,090
Cause you were all swollen up
from the booze the night before.

216
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:24,920
And that's what that bears, let's put
Busch beer and all those fucking beers.

217
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,010
Cores, light, Busch, Busch light.

218
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,100
All of those fucking beers are when
you drank so hard the night before.

219
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,520
You know,

220
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,030
and you just don't have an opinion not
to drink the next day and you need to get

221
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:42,080
back in the game. It's the cortisone
shot of alcohol. That's what it is.

222
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,270
It's fucking stupid

223
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,650
fucking commercials with the guy
standing next to a damn river.

224
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,490
What does that all about?

225
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,740
To let me know how watered down that
fucking Cannop pisses that I'm going to be

226
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:59,260
drinking. But God bless you because
it still gets me fucked up. Um,

227
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,840
anyways. I don't know. Do I need
therapy? I don't know what it is.

228
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:07,850
I think I just need to
get home. Um, so anyways,

229
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,960
um, yeah, I just been going on in my
mind here, unless I'm down on the set,

230
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:15,180
if I'm just fucking hanging
out and it keeps saying,

231
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:17,880
I keep threatening to myself that I'm
going to go down to the college football

232
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:18,391
hall of fame,

233
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:22,280
but I don't think I'm going to make it
again today because I got to go the fuck

234
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:27,000
an elliptical burn off all
the food I ate yesterday.

235
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,050
I didn't do bad. I ate the fish
yesterday and I got to tell you,

236
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:35,100
the catering on this movie has been out
fucking standing. It's been delicious.

237
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,710
You know,
I dunno what,

238
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:41,070
what catering has gone to another
level since I started doing my, uh,

239
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,970
my three lines per movie acting career.
You know,

240
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,050
why don't they have awards for that?
For people like me on movies,

241
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,000
you know,
they,

242
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,890
they are best supporting actor.
Right.

243
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:57,500
But you mean you still gotta be
like a major part of the movie?

244
00:14:57,501 --> 00:15:01,460
What about people like me? Where's
my award? I think that my award,

245
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:05,810
just an awards show. They should
do that. Just have it on youtube.

246
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:06,770
And they just had,
right.

247
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:11,270
You have a host nobody's heard of and a
bunch of actors you can't fucking name,

248
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,330
you know, and then you
let people vote, you know,

249
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,630
best two lines in a movie for 2017.

250
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,410
And uh, I dunno, whatever
awards you, you win.

251
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:25,050
It's like made out of chocolate or
something. You eat it or something.

252
00:15:25,051 --> 00:15:29,130
I don't know what it is. Maybe it's
a little, it's a shot of the flask.

253
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,340
I don't know. I don't pretend to
understand these fucking things. Anyways,

254
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,380
guess what I'm doing next week? Everybody,
other than seeing my beautiful family,

255
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,580
spending every fucking second with them,
um,

256
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,810
is I am going to be playing the surf
Baldwin ballroom, sorry, in Iowa.

257
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,820
And this is where, uh, you
know, uh, uh, buddy Holly,

258
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,600
the big bopper and Richie
Valens all did their last show.

259
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,750
It's a little fucking more, but,
you know, but I want to go there.

260
00:15:57,751 --> 00:15:59,220
I want to see it right.

261
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,920
And I'm flying right into the same airport
that they took off from and crashed.

262
00:16:04,921 --> 00:16:08,780
And everybody's going, dude, what
the fuck? And it's like they,

263
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:13,230
they had ice on their wings.
That's what happened.

264
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:15,390
That's why they crashed that
in an experienced pilot.

265
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,790
And they had ice on the wings
and they didn't have the,

266
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,310
they didn't have the technology
back then, the spray, the chemicals.

267
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:24,540
So I'm going to go out on a limb and
say that I'm going to be all right. Um,

268
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,831
so anyways,

269
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:30,240
I'm going to be doing that
on a Thursday of next week.

270
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:34,740
And then Friday, Saturday, I'm in one of
my favorite goddamn cities in the world.

271
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,720
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. All right. And, uh,

272
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,550
Dean del Ray's going to be
doing the Thursday one and
then I got forsee and Bard

273
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,383
.
Nick,

274
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:45,760
yeah.

275
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,200
In Milwaukee for Z.
Bart,

276
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:53,350
nick and myself and one of
my favorite cities ever.

277
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:58,330
And, uh, I have to somehow try to
maintain being sober. I'm going to do it,

278
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,810
I'm going to do it, but I don't know
how much fucking longer I can go.

279
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,290
I got 70 days in.
All right.

280
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,600
You know what it is.

281
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,650
I know when I have that neck strength
that I'm just going to be on again for

282
00:17:11,651 --> 00:17:14,080
another two fucking years.
That's what I'm hoping.

283
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:17,920
What I can do is I'm going just what
I'm going to do when I come back,

284
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:20,770
when I returned after this injury,
right?

285
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,040
When I make my return to the big leagues
of Booze, I would like to fucking,

286
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,800
I would like to boos the way I smoke
cigars now cause I got that under control.

287
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,080
Like I smoke a cigar like
once every fucking three
weeks or something like that.

288
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,280
That's how, right. Right. 12 to
15 a year. I'm so full of Shit.

289
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:45,520
I've smoked more than that this year, but
whatever, I at least I make an attempt.

290
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,180
Okay. The third base coach with
the cigars is holding people up.

291
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,231
All right?

292
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:56,610
But that fucking lunatic with the booze
is just waving me around every time.

293
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,610
Um, I don't know. I
gotta be honest with you.

294
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:06,480
Having a is a great way to fucking
not drink. You know what I mean?

295
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,930
You can't just sit there and getting
drunk when you have a kid in the house.

296
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,510
And plus even if you do like a moron,

297
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,620
the next morning your kid's going to
wake up at like seven in the morning and

298
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:20,070
then I'll give a fuck about a hangover.
Um,

299
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,080
so I guess it's just one, I'm on the road.

300
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,750
I don't know what it is or maybe
I just like booze and you know,

301
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,160
it's all of that shit. I really
enjoy it. I miss it. You know,

302
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,650
I think I'm going to sober dial
my fucking my booze itself.

303
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,320
Um, anyway, so I'm going to be doing that.

304
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:44,220
And then I go up to Green Bay and uh,

305
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,280
and then that Monday night Boba bubble
though to go to green bay as a Monday

306
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,390
night football game that I was going to
go to with [inaudible] and Bart. Nick,

307
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,160
I'm on, you know, I can't
even say, unfortunately,

308
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,900
I got to get back to do my last
three days on the movie. And, um,

309
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,300
so I can't make that one.
But Jesus Christ,

310
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:05,730
if you're not going to go to Lambeau
field, it's a pretty good excuse, right?

311
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,400
Cause you're going to be in a great
fucking movie starring Hugh Jackman called

312
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:12,000
front runner. There'll be coming out
in 2018 please tell all your friends,

313
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:15,180
please go to the movie
theaters and go see it. Um,

314
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,250
who knows if the schedule changes, maybe
I'll get to go, but I think versus the,

315
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:22,590
and partner could still gonna go.
Um, and that's it. Other than that,

316
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:24,930
I don't think I have anything left
to tell you other than my shoulders

317
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,570
completely fucked up again.
Um,

318
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,960
I turned the corner with
my rotator cup and um,

319
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,330
that I went too far.

320
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:37,620
I don't know if it's cause I did depths
or I tried to do a pull up with one of

321
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:42,060
those fucking assist
bands, things, you know,

322
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:46,620
I tried to do, I just pushed it too far
and then I got to start all over again.

323
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:51,180
It's fucking frustrating.
How are you going to do? He
can't do it. Hey, you know,

324
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,210
it's fucking annoying.
Two years,

325
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,710
say ag nerve last year and I got
my fucking shoulder, you know,

326
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,280
but fortunately I've been eating like
a lady, some staying in shape here.

327
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,150
Alright Indochina, everybody. Ah, we're
doing the reeds here and don't cheat.

328
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,360
Oh fuck, fuck the reads.
You know something?

329
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:11,010
I was reading this
thing about this couple,

330
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,510
that mountain climbs and they were
trying to climb one of the more difficult

331
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:18,090
ones where you're literally
walking in the jet stream.

332
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,870
It was wind was blowing so bad
they couldn't sleep at night.

333
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:28,130
So of course one of these fucking morons
gets lifted up in the air by the wind,

334
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,520
slammed down between two rocks.

335
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,020
Her foot gets stuck in between the rocks
and then the wind is blowing so hard,

336
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,930
it twists her body around and
she breaks her fucking leg.

337
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:45,290
Now the other two fucking jerk offs who
were also completely safe before they

338
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:48,040
decided of out

339
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,330
of the bucket blue on a nowhere
to put their lives at risk,

340
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,583
right?

341
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,020
With absolutely no respect for anybody
else in the world who gets tortured,

342
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,930
who lives in these horrible fucking war
torn conditions. You know what I mean?

343
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,770
And all they want to do is just
be able to come home and be safe.

344
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:07,750
These two fucking free morons.

345
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:09,843
Okay.

346
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,630
Decide that they're going to go up there
with deliberately put their lives at

347
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:13,901
risk.

348
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:17,920
So now the other two assholes have to
carry this lady down with their spiral

349
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:21,760
fracture taking turns while
walking into the jet stream.

350
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,420
And I don't know what I'm supposed to be
doing during this when I'm reading this,

351
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,320
my supposed to be thinking, wow, what
incredible human beings. I don't,

352
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:33,790
I just think what a couple of fucking
morons because then some poor bastard has

353
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:38,560
to fly a helicopter up there and try
and meet them and risk his fucking life.

354
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,953
Okay,

355
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,740
Sandra? I, I just, I don't know. I don't
know how people in the coast guard do it.

356
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,070
I don't know how these people in like
helicopters around the fucking world,

357
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,840
their job. What is your job, sir?

358
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:57,700
What is your job man? We all want is
my job. Oh, I rescue fucking morons.

359
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,810
You don't have, I mean the fire department
has that too. To a certain extent.

360
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,350
You know, somebody sitting
there smoking a cigarette,

361
00:22:09,351 --> 00:22:14,210
eating a pop tart and bed nod off and
he likes his fucking bed on fire, right?

362
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,720
Then they got to go in there and go
get the guys he's hiding in the closet,

363
00:22:17,721 --> 00:22:21,220
you know with the frost and still
around his lips that start in the milk.

364
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,370
They have to go in there.
They got to go get the gun.

365
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,920
I don't have the MD. You want to
talk about fucking hero? How do,

366
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,830
how do they do that?

367
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,150
Yeah.

368
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:37,590
You have to go risk your
life to save a fucking moron.

369
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:44,840
Is there making the call? Yeah. Hey, well,
hey my, my wife broke her leg. I got,

370
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,500
Oh yeah, where are you?
Where's your house out? Nah,

371
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,240
we climbed up a mountain.
The fuck did you do that for?

372
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:59,090
Oh God, I would love to take those calls.
What the fuck did you do that for? Great.

373
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,110
Great. So now let me guess. Now you
want us to go up there and go get you.

374
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:04,580
You fucking moron.

375
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,100
You know we should leave you up there,
right. You know you deserve that. Right.

376
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,653
Okay.

377
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,080
Do you understand the person flying
up there and the helicopter isn't it,

378
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,580
is expecting it to.

379
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,700
He's becoming a father and another month
and he might not make it because you

380
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:28,701
fucking idiots left a perfectly good
hotel room and decided to climb up there.

381
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,940
So what? You could talk loudly about it
in a bar with your frostbit and cheeks.

382
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,850
You dumb cunts.
Tell you what,

383
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:40,020
walking up a thousand feet down the
fucking mountain, I'll check the forecast.

384
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:41,490
Maybe I'll pick you up in a week.

385
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,950
I guess you got to be cut out for
that job. I don't know. All right. In,

386
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:53,710
don't cheat. All right. Talk about
how every man looks better in a suit.

387
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,130
You know, every day I'm checking
out guys walking by, you know,

388
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:02,560
you know, I like it. Nice George Michael
Stubble. I'm not gonna lie to you,

389
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,100
right? But I gotta be telling
me, be honest with you. You know,

390
00:24:06,101 --> 00:24:10,210
nothing makes me want to give my number
to another man, like a man in a suit.

391
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,730
Jesus Christ or they look good.
Um,

392
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,200
Endo Cito is making it easy to get a
perfectly tailored suit and an incredible,

393
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,190
I was just picturing a guy in a
suit doing that stupid Michael, uh,

394
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,020
whatever his fucking name is.
Is it Michael?

395
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,280
Got Ahead faith the faith
faith when I pulled on his too,

396
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,880
I like to wear show anyone like
fucking Joe [inaudible] in good fellas.

397
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,330
Um, end of Chito was making it easy to
get a perfectly tailored suit and an

398
00:24:37,331 --> 00:24:38,170
incredible price.

399
00:24:38,171 --> 00:24:43,171
You can choose from hundreds of top
quality fabrics and personalize your suit

400
00:24:43,301 --> 00:24:46,270
just the way you want it.
Who the fuck knows about fabrics?

401
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,580
Whether it then I get to learn about
that. I know. I don't want wool.

402
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,970
I know. I don't want it to be so shiny
that when I walk, you can hear me coming

403
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,490
is I come down the
fucking I'll, um, anyways,

404
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,770
whether it's for work or wedding
or other special occasions,

405
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:10,771
Indochino has suited up hundreds of
thousands of men and are now the largest

406
00:25:11,441 --> 00:25:16,300
made to measure men's
wear brand in the world.

407
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,760
Here's how it works.
We get a bunch of silk worms,

408
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,090
right? And we booted him right in the ass.
And then I'll come to the fucking silk.

409
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:30,400
Right. Isn't like silk from
like this spittle of a God damn.

410
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,000
You gotta admit the intelligence
of human beings. You know,

411
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:35,930
I'm not saying I'm wonderful,

412
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:39,720
but how the fuck do you do see
some goddamn little worm mining?

413
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,610
It's so God damn business making a little
spider web, whatever the fuck it is.

414
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:45,020
They do any like,
you know what?

415
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,750
I bet I could take that stuff
and make a shirt out of it.

416
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:49,980
Yeah.

417
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,813
Um,
visit a shoe.

418
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,840
Visit a showroom or shop online.

419
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:05,550
indochino.com do these fucking little
silkworms realize that they're working in

420
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:10,830
a factory.
They give them a little cute lunch pails.

421
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,370
Do they get two weeks vacation a year?
That's what I'm asking you.

422
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:17,670
I'm sure somebody is doing a
documentary on it. Pick your fabric.

423
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:22,671
Choose your customizations from lapels
to pleats to jacket linings in more

424

ass being disappointed?

It's time to make your ass proud again
with a pair of me undies and check this

537
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:27,380
out. I'm not the only one who loves
me on, you know I love me undies.

538
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:31,160
It's not even their underwear. I just
like singing even though I'm, you know,

539
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,900
I could barely carry a tune.

540
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,470
Listened to what my long
time listeners and me undies,

541
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,420
enthusiasm George has to say
a note from George and bill,

542
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:45,770
burr listener and be undies fan.
This is how much you guys so much.

543
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:48,740
You guys have done a solid with me on
this. You guys actually write them,

544
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,850
telling them how much you liked my songs
to the point they're now sending me

545
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,220
your fucking tweets or Instagram,

546
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,340
whatever the fuck you send it to them
and now this is part of the copy I guess.

547
00:33:59,090 --> 00:33:59,511
Anyways,

548
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:03,740
this is from George and who allegedly
exists and wrote this and this is not from

549
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,000
some advertising company.

550
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,130
I decided to try me on these because I
love bill burrs. Me On these jingles.

551
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:15,140
I smile every time he sings
it. A man wrote that. Now,

552
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:16,250
if this was a lady,

553
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,390
I believe that a lady would be emotionally
open enough to say that I smile every

554
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:24,290
time he sings it. I think
this has been edited. Um,

555
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,620
although it's so easy to
skip ads in a podcast,

556
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:32,540
I always capital's listened to bill's
reads and I'm so glad me undies has stuck

557
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:32,870
with them.

558
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,500
It's probably been two years since I
first bought a pair of me undies and now I

559
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:40,460
have a monthly subscription
because they are that comfortable.

560
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,760
Doesn't this Raul read is
phony before me undies.

561
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:48,350
I used to buy the three pack of underwear
at the retail stores until I realized

562
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:52,580
that I wanted to treat my junk to
something more comfortable and that starts

563
00:34:52,581 --> 00:34:55,850
with a great pair of BMDS,
cradling my family jewels.

564
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:59,120
This is so fucking written
by their advertising teams.

565
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,980
I know you guys are writing them in.

566
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,350
I know you're writing these

573
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:30,170
that's 35 minutes. Okay, well I got,
I got to work in my little workout.

574
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:33,590
I'm going to go put,
put on my pink legwarmers you know,

575
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,350
and do a couple of buck blasters.

576
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,590
All I do now is I just get on
the elliptical. That's all I do.

577
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,190
And I put on my fucking, uh, you guys
want to hear about why my cardio?

578
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:52,620
This is my cardio. I like to listen
to mindless music when I'm on,

579
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,990
you know,
I finally have given into gym music.

580
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:58,980
Like I used to walk around the gym and
I'd be like, Ugh, why are they playing?

581
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:03,810
Pour some sugar on me? It's like, you
know, cause it's actually, you know,

582
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,830
I go through different periods.

583
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:08,820
Sometimes I didn't want to listen
to a fucking absolutely genius,

584
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,910
um, album or something like that.
Or I just don't even want to think.

585
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:18,000
And lately I don't want to fucking
think and I know what it is,

586
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,170
is because I'm missing my family.

587
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:21,870
That's what it is that I mentioned
that 5,000 fucking times.

588
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:27,030
So right now I just want to go into
like, you know, it's like, why, you know,

589
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:30,720
I like washing dishes. It's fucking
mindless, you know what I mean?

590
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,620
Uh, but the water in the tank
with the top and I Bunkage

591
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:38,370
until it's clean and it's just gives you
something to do, something to focus on.

592
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:42,900
Like why can't I get that fucking brand
flake that looks like now it's been

593
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:46,240
sandblasted under this bowl here. Why
can't I get that off clock? Shocking.

594
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,880
You know, you get a little anger
out. Um, here, here is my, um,

595
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,800
my mindless music.

596
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:58,440
I listened to fail it steel feel
it still from Portugal, the man

597
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,030
[inaudible] [inaudible] and
my comment at a left field,

598
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,670
Oh god, he got it. Got that Gagaku

599
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,640
that gets me,
it gets me through the first five minutes.

600
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:17,140
And then I listened to mark
Ronson, uptown funk. Oh,

601
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,480
this is the same song, the same
song they write every summer, right?

602
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:28,510
Boop, boop. I listen to that
shit. Right? Slightly embarrassed.

603
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:33,430
But I listened to it and then I
listened to the honey drippers rocket at

604
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:36,580
midnight.
And uh,

605
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,330
then I just have a bunch of Tom Petty,
and this isn't mindless music,

606
00:37:40,331 --> 00:37:43,660
but I'm kind of stopping listening
to that. I kind of switch off.

607
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:47,530
Then I've listened to three mindless
songs in a row and I love Tom Petty,

608
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:51,550
but he just died. So it makes
me sad. So I just saw primus.

609
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:55,170
So after those three mindless
songs, I then go into, oh,

610
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,640
I go into awesome music
music that I really like.

611
00:37:57,641 --> 00:38:01,480
I'll listen to Primus or Mars Volta,
my new favorite band,

612
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:06,460
fucking dope found out about them fucking
15 years after they were together.

613
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:10,720
So stupid. Um, so anyways, and that's
when I have to go do so everybody,

614
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:14,140
you guys want to share with me your a
little cardio fucking list. I need you.

615
00:38:14,141 --> 00:38:14,501
I need,

616
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:19,501
I need another three fucking songs as
mindless as those first three that I just

617
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,010
sent to you.
This silly to happy.

618
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,040
And next thing you know, I looked
down and all I had, you know,

619
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,930
I only do like a half hour,
you know what I mean?

620
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:34,510
I only do a half hour because these needs
have to last me a lifetime. All right,

621
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,340
I'm with this bullshit.
Um,

622
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,830
there's going to be a little music here
and you're probably not going to know

623
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:43,030
what the music is and I'm not going to
know what it is either because Andrew

624
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:46,390
Feminists, uh, you know, he goes deep,
he goes deep into the music world.

625
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:47,710
So if you have any questions,

626
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:53,010
just ask what song it is on our
Twitter app at the MM podcast.

627
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:58,570
All right. And ask Andrew and they very
polite, respectful way, what the song is.

628
00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:02,860
I'm sure he'll get back to you. All
right. And uh, then we'll play after that.

629
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:07,450
There'll be another half hour, this
podcast, a classic half hour, um, of,

630
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,720
of classic clips from a Thursday
afternoon, just before Friday,

631
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:15,130
Monday morning podcast that, um, I
don't know, maybe from early this year,

632
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:16,960
maybe from three years ago.
I have no idea.

633
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,500
You might even listen to me talking about
how much fun I had boobs in the night

634
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,110
before, you know, uh,
that's it. All right.

635
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,380
Have a great weekend and
I'll talk to you on Monday.

636
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,373
[inaudible] [inaudible]

637
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,190
[inaudible]

638
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,690
anyways,
I get them into the biggest,

639
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:10,340
dumbest fucking fight last
night with my girl, right?

640
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,660
We had this great day, you
know, everything's going great.

641
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:20,090
So I stay in, I take a night off from
comedy and I say, Hey, why don't we watch,

642
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,940
why don't we watch a movie?
You know what I mean?

643
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:27,230
Cap Off this wonderful fucking
day. Everything's going
great. What could go wrong?

644
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,470
This is like the beginning of a horror
movie where they just show like the

645
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:34,010
perfect family and everything's great
and people are wearing like white linen,

646
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:35,560
you know?

647
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,120
And then all of a sudden they just
start showing the camera and the bushes,

648
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,540
like a POV of like Mike Myers.
This is basically what happened.

649
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:43,790
So 60 minutes comes on,
right?

650
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:47,000
Who doesn't want to watch that show
and pretend they're smart, you know,

651
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:52,190
I like it some more that Morley
safer comes on and you know,

652
00:40:52,191 --> 00:40:55,280
we smells like an old person. Some old
people don't smell like old people,

653
00:40:55,281 --> 00:40:57,950
but he looks like he smells
like an old person, you know,

654
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:04,010
smells of cigars, ash trays,
you know, couple of wars,

655
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,230
maybe a date rape.
Um,

656
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:13,010
so he's interviewing Meryl Streep,
alright,

657
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,960
the great Meryl Streep,
and they're going through all oral,

658
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:19,610
oral frigging life and all the movies
and all the different characters that

659
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:22,310
she's played. Oh, first
of all, they start,

660
00:41:22,311 --> 00:41:27,200
they start the report off with
Morley safer just sitting there,

661
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:31,730
right. Smelling a fucking Ben
Gay in whiskey. Right. And uh,

662
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:32,930
he says,
how you,

663
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:38,690
how over in England, you
know, they, you know, I dunno,

664
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,060
they make their, their actors, they,

665
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,060
they award them by calling
them lords and they night them.

666
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,920
But over here in America,

667
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:49,190
all we do is just give him the
shiny statue and it's just like,

668
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:52,910
starts off right off the bat for some
reason, just shitting on America.

669
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:58,370
I don't know why.
Like an Oscar is somehow beneath

670
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,360
sir, uh, Anthony Michael Hall. I mean,
or, or Lord, what it Lord of what,

671
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,850
what are what.
At least you can fucking hold our statue,

672
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,160
your lord of what kingdom,

673
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:18,530
that phony horseshit that you have with
Prince Charles in the popper or whatever

674
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:21,140
the fuck is going on over there.
You know,

675
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,630
look up the Rothschilds night you over
there, then that fucking means something.

676
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,190
Then you can come become
part of their yacht convoys.

677
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:33,530
They go around the world figuring out
how to take over another currency, right?

678
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,100
Then you're in with them. Okay. But if
you're, if you're fucking, you know,

679
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:41,810
Lord of this and your, your wing man
is the Duke of Elton John. I mean,

680
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:44,660
that's the whole thing is fucking
stupid, right? So right off the bat,

681
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:48,250
it's already bugging me. But I know Nia
hates when I talk to the TV rights. So I,

682
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,183
you know,

683
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,750
I keep my big fucking Yap shut and
they started talking about Meryl Streep

684
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,000
[inaudible] gone through the whole thing
and then I'm the old guy there smelling

685
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:02,630
of uh, you know, prescription
meds goes, uh, you know,

686
00:43:02,631 --> 00:43:05,300
whenever they talk about the roles
you play, they always say, you know,

687
00:43:05,301 --> 00:43:09,050
you play independent minded women,
very strong women. And Merrill goes,

688
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:11,570
I know that's, yeah, that's what
they say. You know, when a guy,

689
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,770
they never say to a guy, oh, you're
playing a strong willed character,

690
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,820
Yadda Yadda Yadda. I let that go,
whatever, no Biggie, I'll take that.

691
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,440
It's probably true. The fuck do I
know I'm not a whole woman. Right.

692
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,540
But then they show her after she played
Margaret Thatcher and she's given a

693
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:34,220
speech to a bunch of women's young girls.
She's trying to inspire them and she,

694
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,660
she takes a quote from Margaret Thatcher
and it was something along the lines of,

695
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:40,670
if you want a bunch of
people to talk around,

696
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:44,570
talk is staying around talking
about doing something. You know,

697
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,200
something, I go to Iga,
you got to talk to men,

698
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:50,900
but if you want it to actually get done,

699
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:55,760
you gotta get a woman and then all the
chicks go, whoo, like flipping out. Right?

700
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:59,570
So I laughed and I'm like,
Yay. Reverse sexism, right?

701
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:04,280
Just seeing, you know, my,

702
00:44:04,281 --> 00:44:06,920
my whole fucking theory how
everybody is just a piece of shit.

703
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,460
You just don't have the power to act
out what the fuck you want to do because

704
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:14,030
that, that right there, if
you flip that around as a guy,

705
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,690
if you're running for president,
it's fucking over. He can't be like,

706
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,420
let me tell you know,

707
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,420
tell you what after I get you
jobs and after I fix this economy,

708
00:44:23,451 --> 00:44:26,180
okay. And I'm the man to do it
because I'll tell you right now,

709
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:30,920
if you're looking for someone to
stand around and talk about doing,

710
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,560
you get a woman, you want to
get done, you gotta get 'em man,

711
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:37,110
here are my nuts right here on the podium.
Volt from me.

712
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:39,660
November 4th go fuck
yourself. Right? You did that.

713
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:43,980
Your presidential campaigns over.
She does it. It's fucking adorable.

714
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:47,880
And it's just as fucking ignorant.
You know what I mean?

715
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:52,080
What a fuck do you get off saying
that we stand around and do nothing,

716
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:56,100
Meryl Streep or quoting Margaret
and you too, Margaret Thatcher.

717
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:02,280
Let me taste you bitches something. All
right, we faked a fucking lunar landing.

718
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:08,040
Okay? You think that's just talking.
Anybody can land on the fucking moon.

719
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:08,880
That's easy.

720
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,680
But to pretend you did it all right and
get everybody to shut the fuck up about

721
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:16,980
it. That, that, that, that right
there, that takes skill. So whatever.

722
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:20,970
So I make that little comment and um,
did I just go with it that, that, that,

723
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:23,370
that are certainly fucking porky pig.
So,

724
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:26,280
so I make that comment and like,
you know,

725
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:29,100
I've been with Nia long enough that I
can tell by the side of her face when

726
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,630
she's just thinking about like,

727
00:45:30,631 --> 00:45:33,630
what if I just grabbed everything I
really cared about and walked out of this

728
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:38,010
house right now?
She got like that fucking mad at me,

729
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,520
you know? And I'm like, she's just like,

730
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:48,250
right after the story was over, she just
shut the fucking thing off. And, uh,

731
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:53,110
I only happen to excel. I'm walking
to seven 11 and get some ice cream.

732
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:58,390
I've not even, what happened
was all going great. You know,

733
00:45:58,391 --> 00:46:01,120
I might be asshole there.
What am I?

734
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:05,230
Am I supposed to just fucking sit there
with my mouth hanging open with drool

735
00:46:05,231 --> 00:46:07,890
coming out when I watch TV?
If somebody says something Douchey,

736
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,550
I'm not supposed to say it.
Yeah. Whatever, whatever.

737
00:46:12,551 --> 00:46:15,760
So I just finally just said, you know
what? Fuck this. I take the dog out.

738
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:20,590
I go around the block. What do I do?
I'm calling my guy friends, right?

739
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,130
They're all backing me up. I'm not
saying who I called, I don't name names.

740
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:25,523
All right.

741
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:29,200
And they're all laughing their ass
off and they get 100% agree with me,

742
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,820
which is all I'm looking
for at this point.

743
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,410
I just want people to say that I'm right.

744
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,600
I don't want to learn
anything from this experience.

745
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:38,200
Just tell me I was right so I
can be an ignorant ass again.

746
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:42,370
I don't know. Why don't you guys weigh
in on that? Am I a Dick for saying that?

747
00:46:42,371 --> 00:46:46,810
Should I just let that one go? You
know? Oh, you know what she said?

748
00:46:46,811 --> 00:46:49,360
That fucking drove me up the
wall. She goes, why are you,

749
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:56,300
she didn't say intimidated.
She used one of those words.

750
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:03,180
Why are you threatened by what she said?
It's like I'm not threatened.

751
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,380
I, yeah, Jesus Christ. Then
I take the bait, you know,

752
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:10,980
it just sends me right all day, like
threatened about what? Oh my God.

753
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:15,090
This person that I don't know who has
never called me, nor will ever call me,

754
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,420
who has no effect on my life.
How do you get threatened by that?

755
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,570
I'm just calling it for the bullshit.
That is, cause you know what?

756
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,430
This is what fucking drives me nuts.

757
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:28,620
I can't stand when somebody tells me
that this shit sandwich tastes worse than

758
00:47:28,621 --> 00:47:32,560
my shit sandwich. Okay, go fuck yourself.

759
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,240
At what point am I supposed
to have empathy as I'm
sitting here eating the shit

760
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:41,110
sandwich and you're telling me how
much worse yours yours is. You know,

761
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:45,350
at the end of the fucking day, you know
what I mean? Sure. Mine might be on a,

762
00:47:45,351 --> 00:47:46,840
you know,
a better slice of bread,

763
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:50,230
which I guess would make it
taste a little bit better,

764
00:47:50,231 --> 00:47:53,320
but at the end of the fucking day,
right? The end of the fucking day.

765
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,330
All right, I'm going to end up
in a FEMA camp with you. Okay?

766
00:47:58,331 --> 00:48:02,980
You think when the next fucking psycho
comes along, I'm going to make the cut.

767
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:07,840
What the fuck do I put? What do I
bring to the world? Huh? Exactly.

768
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:09,430
And be standing right next to you.

769
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:13,840
So go fuck yourself and you just
fucking woman. Every time she sneezes,

770
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:18,100
they give her another goddamn award. She
still pitching, still fucking bitching.

771
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:21,880
You know it's, I remember when I
did this Oscar nominated part out.

772
00:48:21,881 --> 00:48:25,210
Go Fuck yourself with your wigs.
Don't think just, you know,

773
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,720
that's what fucking pisses me
off when I watched this shit.

774
00:48:28,721 --> 00:48:32,560
If you really want to know my
perspective is from where I come from,

775
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,620
I can't bitch about shit cause
everyone's like, oh go fuck yourself.

776
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,500
You hit the lottery. Right. But I
gotta sit here and listen to you bitch.

777
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:43,450
Even if you fucking killing it,
even if you're killing it, you know,

778
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,920
Yale School of drama and
he's still doing the ball.

779
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:52,510
Go Fuck yourself with your goddamn yachts.
Alright,

780
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,390
there you go. That, that felt
good. It's probably ignorant.

781
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,273
[inaudible]

782
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,980
dental assistant billion.
I recently,

783
00:49:25,981 --> 00:49:28,230
I recently watched a talk show appearance.

784
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,010
You posted on your Twitter you
mentioned. Yeah, I did the, uh,

785
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:32,970
the Willie Hunter show.

786
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:35,550
MMM.

787
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:38,760
And I think that that's what I posted
when that fucking twice that I'd like to

788
00:49:38,761 --> 00:49:43,630
choke to death with a garden hose
sent me that tweet. Um, yeah,

789
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,940
it was on the Willie Hunter show.
And he said,

790
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:49,590
you mentioned you were a dental
assistant, um, for your father.

791
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,350
Did you ever consider becoming a dentist?
Did you ever,

792
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:57,150
did your father ever have ambitions for
you to become anything in particular?

793
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:02,740
Um, no. My Dad, my parents
were great. Like they,

794
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,240
they wanted you to base it.
They didn't force anything on you.

795
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:08,460
It was like whatever you wanted to do.

796
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,153
MMM.

797
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,810
They supported it 100%.

798
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:19,360
And I remember being working with my
dad in the dental office when I told him

799
00:50:19,361 --> 00:50:21,290
that I was going to become a comedian.

800
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:25,130
We were in like the break room and I
remember I was sitting there like going

801
00:50:25,131 --> 00:50:25,964
like,

802
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:31,450
how is guy going to take this when he
has such a classic like stable job here?

803
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,260
You know that I'm going to tell
him that I'm going to fucking

804
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,880
basically make a living,

805
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:48,900
try to make a living doing exactly what
he's been yelling at me for for the last

806
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,890
fucking 20 years of my life,

807
00:50:50,891 --> 00:50:55,891
which was fucking off and acting like an
idiot and screwing around all the shit

808
00:50:56,141 --> 00:50:57,730
that you know,

809
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,680
when he would give me Christ
check up box in a town clown,

810
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,340
what do you be giving me?
Shit.

811
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:08,350
Which I totally deserved because if you
ever saw the grades I got in school,

812
00:51:08,351 --> 00:51:13,000
I mean they, they, they are, they
are horrific, fucking horrific.

813
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:18,280
The high water mark for me was
like a c minus or a c like I was,

814
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,073
it was brutal.

815
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,920
I want you to head to go to summer
school every fucking year of high school

816
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,750
except my sophomore year

817
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,530
because my math teacher hooked me up
in my senior year. I should've gone.

818
00:51:30,531 --> 00:51:33,080
I just didn't give a fuck. I was like,
what's the point? You know what I mean?

819
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,270
That's like, you got the ball
with 10 seconds left in you.

820
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:40,860
What are you going to do? You just
fucking, you know, you're down by 30 dad.

821
00:51:40,861 --> 00:51:43,770
Just throw up a half court shot. Did it go
in? Who gives a fuck? It doesn't matter.

822
00:51:43,771 --> 00:51:47,750
You know? Um, so no,

823
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:52,010
I mean for half a second. You know what
you know, and I did like, I like the, uh,

824
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,300
I like the pouring up
models when I was in a,

825
00:51:56,301 --> 00:51:59,630
when I was in the dental office, that
was my favorite thing. I was in the back.

826
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:00,650
I was isolated.

827
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:04,400
I wasn't around anybody and it tapped
into that little kid thing of playing in

828
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:05,234
mud

829
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,870
and he used to pour up the models and
they had this vibrating thing and you had

830
00:52:11,871 --> 00:52:14,840
to tap on it to make sure you
have got all the bubbles out.

831
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:20,050
And I prided myself on not
being able, you know, I've,

832
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:24,110
I've having it without no having
no bubbles. If you got bubbles,

833
00:52:24,111 --> 00:52:26,450
if there was bubbles on the bottom,
basically,

834
00:52:26,451 --> 00:52:29,100
you know when they stick that pink shit
in your mouth, they got to take a, uh,

835
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:30,530
an impression of your teeth.

836
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:34,610
Then somebody's got to take that out of
your mouth going in the back room and

837
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:35,091
then you got it.

838
00:52:35,091 --> 00:52:39,800
You got to mix this powder with water up
in the little green rubber bowls. Jesus,

839
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:40,940
this is all coming back to me.

840
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,560
And then you poured it into the
fucking impression you took.

841
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:46,350
And then there was this,

842
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:51,200
this thing that sounded exactly like
your cell phone vibrating on a table and

843
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:54,800
you just, you just tapped it on that
to get all the air bubbles out of it.

844
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,720
And if you didn't do it enough after one
of the things set and you took it out,

845
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,160
um,
if the bubbles were at the bottom,

846
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:06,150
that's where the teeth were
the most crucial thing,

847
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:11,210
the exact fucking thing that trying to
get a gauge on so they can, you know,

848
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:14,960
whatever the hell they were trying to
do, make a bridge or something. Um,

849
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,030
the whole thing would be fucked.

850
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:22,780
And then you couldn't go and just rapport
the model into that same mold because

851
00:53:23,151 --> 00:53:25,980
somehow like it had shrunk up
little bit and it wouldn't be

852
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,950
accurate.
And my dad used to flip out.

853
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,100
He would, he would take them
off, he'd be like, Christ,

854
00:53:32,101 --> 00:53:34,460
there's air bubbles and this,

855
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:41,310
you know, and it was beyond your boss
yelling at you. It was also my dad's.

856
00:53:41,311 --> 00:53:43,590
So I already had,
you know,

857
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:48,591
I was going through my fucking teenage
and early twenties when you're rebelling

858
00:53:48,721 --> 00:53:51,330
the most against your fire.
Already had the live with the guy.

859
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:54,990
And then I was working with the most
fucking hilarious and he used to give me

860
00:53:54,991 --> 00:53:58,770
shit. Bye. You know, like I was his kid.

861
00:53:59,700 --> 00:53:59,880
Okay.

862
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,930
But we,
we really have,

863
00:54:00,931 --> 00:54:05,220
we actually talked about how we had to
tone that shit down because it didn't

864
00:54:05,221 --> 00:54:09,180
come off as professional in front
of patients or whatever. But uh,

865
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,930
but that was a part I thought if I ever
got into dentistry that I would, I would,

866
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,730
I would work in the lab.

867
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,280
I liked that part of it, like, um,

868
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,190
and not just pouring up
the models like the actual,

869
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:25,260
I know there was a precision to it
that I liked. I didn't like to fight.

870
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:26,370
I didn't like the,
uh,

871
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,550
the front line shit going in the mouth
with all that crap and looking at

872
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:33,060
people's fucking horrific teeth,
just horrible fucking teeth.

873
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:35,400
All my jokes were about that
shit when I first started.

874
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:38,330
I told you guys that story,
right?

875
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:42,140
I used to work totally clean
when I first started stand up.

876
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,340
Um, and not because I want
it to be this comedy purist.

877
00:54:46,341 --> 00:54:49,760
I just was afraid of offending
somebody in the crowd, getting heckled,

878
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,380
not having a comeback,

879
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,440
losing my place in my act and
then bombing horrifically. Yeah.

880
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:01,350
And, and just having my career
and total fear catastrophizing,

881
00:55:01,351 --> 00:55:04,550
like way of looking at it.
And um,

882
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:12,220
yeah. Oh Jesus Christ, that really
just fucking brought me back to,

883
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:14,110
I was standing on stage at sticks,
stitches.

884
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:17,740
Fucking somebody heckled me
was that the vault in Boston,

885
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,520
somebody had called me and I completely
lost my fucking train of thought and I

886
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:25,540
had nothing and I didn't. And it took
me like basically three seconds to, to,

887
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,740
to re to remember what the fuck
I was talking about. And um,

888
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:34,270
it was the longest 30 seconds of my life
and I didn't know enough to just say to

889
00:55:34,271 --> 00:55:36,730
the crowd like, what the fuck was I
talking about? Cause they'll tell you,

890
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,930
they'll remember. They're not
nervous, they're listening. They,

891
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:44,200
they're not having like this outer
body experience. Um, but anyways,

892
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:47,530
I remember people would come into the
dental office in their teeth would just be

893
00:55:47,531 --> 00:55:48,364
just,

894
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:49,340
yeah,

895
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,230
just what an absolute fucking mess.

896
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,990
And they can tell you right
now, I hate coming to the
dentist. And it's like, yeah,

897
00:55:55,991 --> 00:55:57,940
dude, I can smell it.
You don't have to smile.

898
00:55:57,941 --> 00:55:59,320
I can tell you don't
like coming to a dentist.

899
00:55:59,321 --> 00:56:02,950
You only like fucking brushing your teeth.
Well just one guy said this,

900
00:56:02,951 --> 00:56:04,630
one of the first jokes I did too.
Oh that's right.

901
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:09,430
So I will work totally fucking clean.
And then my last at my, and you just,

902
00:56:09,431 --> 00:56:12,070
you know when I looked
like a young Ron Howard,

903
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:17,130
I look like Richie Cunningham and I was
totally clean and I was clever and I had

904
00:56:17,411 --> 00:56:22,270
these perfect talk show monologue jokes
and everyone was going like, oh dude,

905
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,090
you're going to do the
tonight or this is going

906
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:28,090
to be perfect for and blah blah blah blah
blah. And then the last joke in my act,

907
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:34,330
I quoted this patient who kept having
to get fillings and root canals and he,

908
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,530
and he said, doc, you know, I
don't understand what's going on.

909
00:56:36,531 --> 00:56:39,690
I mean I brushed my
teeth almost every day.

910
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,750
And then my,
my snappy comeback to that,

911
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:47,240
that I thought of that later became the
last joke on my act. I said, really deal.

912
00:56:47,241 --> 00:56:49,640
Wipe your ass almost every
time you take a shit.

913
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:53,300
And that's what I would close
with after working totally clean.

914
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,640
I would say that disgusting lie.

915
00:56:55,641 --> 00:56:59,000
Do you wipe your ass almost
every time you take a shit?

916
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:04,001
Having everybody in the
crowd after looking at this
fucking Norman Rockwell come

917
00:57:05,271 --> 00:57:10,271
to life fucking character
wholesome is hell right.

918
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:11,730
Yeah.

919
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:16,730
And I really was back then as opposed
to the piece of shit that I am now after

920
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:20,590
20 years on the road that I became.
Um,

921
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:26,320
and I literally, they had to conjure
up pictures of somebody skipping,

922
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:30,400
wiping their ass and just that whole,
and they would just literally recoil.

923
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,920
Then I would just be like,
you know,

924
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,440
thanks a lot. Can I get everybody?
You would great. And um,

925
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:39,130
yeah,

926
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:41,290
I had another horrible one that I did,
um,

927
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:45,160
where I actually brought a prop on
stage and if you'd like to see that,

928
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:50,161
I tell the story on the Willie Hunter
show and a willys and up and coming comic

929
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,700
at the comedy store. I've, and
he's the go through the Hula Hoop,

930
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:58,600
took the hula hoop from that girl in,
fucking threw it into the the street.

931
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:02,380
I tell that story too. If you want
to see that shit, check out his show.

932
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:36,810
[inaudible] Hey, what's going on? It's
built, Bro. This is the Monday morning

933
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:41,370
podcasts for Monday, October 26th, 2009.

934
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,840
Holy Shit. Halloween's coming up. I
haven't even bought a pumpkin yet.

935
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:49,230
What the fuck is that all about?
Um,

936
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:56,050
hey, how come there's not pumpkin's the
whole time of the year? All those things.

937
00:58:56,051 --> 00:58:59,290
Seasonal, you know, like tomatoes.

938
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:02,260
Evidently tomatoes are seasonal.
We just don't realize that,

939
00:59:02,261 --> 00:59:07,180
which is why they taste like shit 90%
of the year or according to Jimmy Dore,

940
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:10,600
they pick them before they're even
ripe and they just paint them red.

941
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:14,500
Um, is that true? I mean,

942
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:17,470
how long would that take to sit there
with that little fucking Crayola?

943
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,700
It wouldn't, they taste like wax.
What's the deal with Pumpkins?

944
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,220
You can get Pumpkin Pie, the
whole euro, but you never see you.

945
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:31,980
Um, I've gone out of my fucking my
people, my voice is killing me. Um,

946
00:59:31,981 --> 00:59:35,940
I have something to do
here in fucking 40 minutes.

947
00:59:35,941 --> 00:59:37,530
So this is gonna be a quick podcast.

948
00:59:37,531 --> 00:59:41,100
And this time actually mean it because
it's going to cost me money if I don't

949
00:59:41,101 --> 00:59:46,050
get off the phone here in 40
minutes. Uh, uh, where to start.

950
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,630
Why don't we just start with
what the hell's bugging me? Um,

951
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:53,390
I almost got into a
fistfight yesterday and, uh,

952
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:57,480
I realized that I'm at the awful age of,

953
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,390
it's basically any time there's
going to be a fist fight,

954
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,610
I have these two options.

955
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,170
A I lose and get the
shit kicked out of me,

956
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:13,050
which really, you know, there's no end
to, that shit kicked out of you. Could be,

957
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:16,690
I got a black eye, I
lost a twofer, you know,

958
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,540
or it could be I'm in a coma and you know,

959
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:22,180
the left side of my body doesn't
work anymore. You know what I mean?

960
01:00:22,181 --> 01:00:24,460
You never know because you never
know who you fucker went. Right.

961
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:29,640
So that's option a and option B is I win
and then I get the shit sued out of me.

962
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:37,140
Okay. I see. I'm so fucking
still pissed about this. I'm,

963
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,410
I have to give you the abbreviated
version of this because it's,

964
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:44,370
it's been eating me up inside.
Um,

965
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,890
I was waiting for my girlfriend
to come out of this diner,

966
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:50,130
this one of these places. There's only
one way in and one way out. All right,

967
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:53,010
so there's a parking lot,
parking spot way down,

968
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:56,760
which is actually closer to the fucking
diner in this Douche bag is sitting

969
01:00:56,761 --> 01:00:58,470
there cause he sees my reverse lights on.

970
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:02,820
So I'm way of an Adam to tell him to
go by me so I can just back out of the

971
01:01:02,821 --> 01:01:05,230
fucking light. And he's just sitting
there sitting there. He wouldn't do it.

972
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,040
It's a fire, you know, pull out real
fast. It's like a gravel parking lot,

973
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:12,270
slam on the brakes, slide backwards and
then fly forward. Slam on the brakes.

974
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:13,291
So he pulls in,

975
01:01:13,291 --> 01:01:16,470
obviously knows I'm pissed and I back
up and I put the window down. I'm like,

976
01:01:16,471 --> 01:01:19,860
dude, there's a fucking spot right up
there. And then he immediately goes, oh,

977
01:01:19,861 --> 01:01:23,820
you're so tough with your hybrid. And
he really caught me off guard, man.

978
01:01:23,821 --> 01:01:25,830
He got me with a great money.
Went with the hybrid.

979
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,660
My Dick is bigger than yours because I'm,

980
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:31,800
he's driving a fucking lime green
four door sedan that he looked like he

981
01:01:31,801 --> 01:01:36,170
borrowed from his fucking ant, right? Oh,
this guy, you just this, this fucking,

982
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:37,080
you know what this guy looked like?

983
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:40,560
Remember those coming of age movies in
the 80s where there was the good looking

984
01:01:40,561 --> 01:01:45,120
chick, uh, that the nerd wanted and
she was dating this impossible asshole.

985
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:50,270
Like that blonde hair Douche from our
back to school who gets all intimidated in

986
01:01:50,341 --> 01:01:54,450
the end and fix a leg injury after fucking
a 90 year old Rodney Dangerfield does

987
01:01:54,451 --> 01:01:58,770
a triple, triple Lindy. That's
what this kid look like. All right?

988
01:01:58,771 --> 01:02:01,920
And he's gone fucking Blah, blah,
blah. And I'm like, Hey, yeah,

989
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:06,360
we'd get fucking tight shirt and your big
nose. Go Fuck Yourself. And he's like a,

990
01:02:06,361 --> 01:02:09,120
and then he goes, yeah, I go back
to Jersey. You piece of shit.

991
01:02:09,121 --> 01:02:12,270
That's what he said to me. Right?
And I wanted to go like, dude,

992
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:15,450
I'm not from New Jersey, but my girl
jumped in and said something fucking,

993
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:18,720
you know, that a civilian would
say rather than a comedian.

994
01:02:18,721 --> 01:02:21,080
So I started losing the
argument a little bit.

995
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:24,160
So then he turns around and then I was
just like, where you going? Where you go?

996
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:24,870
And you know,
like,

997
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:29,310
like I was actually going to fight
him because I was so fucking mad. I

998
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:30,680
okay.

999
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,260
But I in the back of my head, the whole
fucking time, I'm thinking like, dude,

1000
01:02:33,261 --> 01:02:35,780
what are you going to do? What? What you,
what are you going to do to this guy?

1001
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,000
When was the last time you had a fight?

1002
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:41,850
You're fucking 41 you're a year older than
Brett. Farve what are you going to do?

1003
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:45,530
It's not even on level ground.
It's in a gravel fucking parking lot.

1004
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:50,200
You know what I mean? I knew
I could've, I, I swear to God,

1005
01:02:50,201 --> 01:02:54,760
I know I could have fucking
killed this guy, but I, well,

1006
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:57,670
I can't do it. [inaudible] I already,
you know what would've happened?

1007
01:02:57,671 --> 01:03:00,070
I would've fucking started fighting him.
Even if I started winning,

1008
01:03:00,071 --> 01:03:04,420
his girlfriend would've jumped on my back.
And then if you do any sort of,

1009
01:03:04,421 --> 01:03:07,150
get off my back with the woman,
I'm going to jail.

1010
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,650
You know? I just, it was
this fucking stalemate.

1011
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,270
There was nothing I could fucking do.

1012
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:19,110
And then I'm driving home and all I'm
thinking about is how much I want to

1013
01:03:19,111 --> 01:03:21,210
fucking kill this guy.
And it got to the point,

1014
01:03:21,211 --> 01:03:26,040
I literally dropped my girl off and I
drove back to the diner and his fucking

1015
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:30,030
car were still there.
And I'm circling the diner in a hybrid

1016
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:37,710
waiting for this guy to come out thinking
about what I'm gonna do to him and

1017
01:03:37,711 --> 01:03:42,060
then also reminding myself that I have
not had a fight in about 20 fucking years.

1018
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:43,890
Okay.

1019
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:48,890
And then also reminded myself legally
the ramifications for leaving and then

1020
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:50,130
fucking coming back.

1021
01:03:50,131 --> 01:03:54,090
I am in no danger whatsoever and I am
going to get the living shit sued out of

1022
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:54,924
me.

1023
01:03:56,140 --> 01:04:00,550
So fortunately a friend of mine happened
to call up and I started telling her

1024
01:04:00,551 --> 01:04:05,140
the story and she was laughing her ass
off and she told the story of solves some

1025
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:06,700
girl didn't hold the door,
you know,

1026
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:09,700
it's one of those really heavy doors and
sorta in its sort of slam back in her

1027
01:04:09,701 --> 01:04:12,640
face. And she said, thank you.
You know, sarcastically tour,

1028
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:15,430
and then the girl goes a one,
I don't have to hold the door for you.

1029
01:04:15,431 --> 01:04:16,360
Go Fuck Yourself.

1030
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:20,320
And how she just wanted to
sticker timberland through
the back of this fucking

1031
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:21,243
chicks.

1032
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:22,650
Yeah,

1033
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:26,760
back. I guess. Look at me. I'm so fucking
mad. I can't even say simple anatomy,

1034
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:31,700
so I just, I dunno.

1035
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:35,270
I was able to just kind of talk myself
out of it and the real thing was I didn't

1036
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:37,970
want to go back and fight the guy. I
really didn't, you know what I mean?

1037
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,850
I really didn't. I did, but I didn't.

1038
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:44,870
There was just no when it wasn't going to
do, you know, I got meetings this week,

1039
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:47,240
I'm going to show up with a loose
tooth and a fucking, you know,

1040
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,310
nobody bleeds like a red head.
You know what I mean?

1041
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:52,790
I'm going to look like fucking
ric flair walking in there.

1042
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,130
There was nothing I could do.

1043
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:03,190
I had to sit there and I think I
actually lost the back and forth.

1044
01:05:03,381 --> 01:05:06,350
Verbal thank you know, I'm so
fucking shot from being on the road.

1045
01:05:06,351 --> 01:05:11,030
I just got off a flight. I wanted to go
straight home. I girls like I'm hungry,

1046
01:05:11,031 --> 01:05:12,410
let's get Sunday,
you know,

1047
01:05:12,411 --> 01:05:17,411
and I made a mental note to be extra
nice to my girl just because I've been an

1048
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:20,350
asshole lately,
you know,

1049
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:24,160
which is probably why I got into
the argument to begin with. But

1050
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,550
it's, it was, it,

1051
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:32,590
I literally that desert desert
fucking reservoir or a lake,

1052
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:36,280
whatever the fuck you call it, near
where I live. This is how mad I was

1053
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:42,840
after my friend talked me out of not
doing what I didn't even want to do to

1054
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:47,530
begin with. Right. Not to mention the,
you already had another guy with him.

1055
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:51,430
I would've lost. I would've
fucking lost. Right. So, um,

1056
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:55,660
I had to go drive to the lake,

1057
01:05:56,020 --> 01:06:01,020
park my car and walk around the lake
in the first 90% of the walk around it.

1058
01:06:01,871 --> 01:06:06,310
I was fantasizing about all the different
ways that I was going to murder this

1059
01:06:06,311 --> 01:06:07,144
guy.

1060
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:12,490
I had one where I was body slamming
him onto his own fucking car,

1061
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:14,410
screaming some shit about hybrids.

1062
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:21,970
I completely like, I haven't been
that mad in so fucking long. And, uh,

1063
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:26,350
it wasn't until the last 10%, you know,
I was kind of going like, you know,

1064
01:06:26,351 --> 01:06:30,580
you really took this walk to
try to forget about this shit,

1065
01:06:30,581 --> 01:06:33,580
so what is wrong with you?
You need to calm down.

1066
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:38,350
So I started to fucking calm down and uh,

1067
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:41,780
then I saw my car again and reminded me
I was driving a hybrid in a fucking piss

1068
01:06:41,781 --> 01:06:44,440
me off again, be told it's been one
thing if the guy was driving a corvette,

1069
01:06:44,441 --> 01:06:46,120
you should have seen this car.
It wasn't lime green.

1070
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:47,710
It was actually kind of a nice screen.
Okay.

1071
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:51,790
If I can actually extend an olive
branch to this fucking cunt.

1072
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:55,600
But I mean it was, it was a
four door sedan. You know,

1073
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:57,400
there was no excuse at his age,
your name,

1074
01:06:57,401 --> 01:07:00,100
he's like in his twenties there was no
fucking excuse for him to be driving that

1075
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:03,190
car or certainly talking shit.
Right.

1076
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:09,280
And also I love that whole go back to
Jersey you piece of shit and like how he's

1077
01:07:09,281 --> 01:07:12,880
the typical La Guy, you
know, judging you, you know,

1078
01:07:12,881 --> 01:07:15,220
you are what you drive out here.
Cause I'm in a hybrid,

1079
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,580
therefore I don't know how to fight
in what you hit. You know my car,

1080
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:23,560
my car runs a home for an odd guess.
Fucking bring Bruce Lee odd,

1081
01:07:23,561 --> 01:07:27,370
you know, he, what is he going
to Rick Shaw, you know, so,

1082
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:32,920
so the last 10% I started talking myself
down and just so happened there was an

1083
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:37,921
open house out here and there happens to
be a zillion houses available out here

1084
01:07:39,071 --> 01:07:42,610
because the state is bankrupt and we
live in a city without a water supply and

1085
01:07:42,611 --> 01:07:46,330
they still want $1 million for a house
that is about the size of a decent one

1086
01:07:46,331 --> 01:07:51,190
bedroom apartment. So a ants,
hence there's a lot of open houses.

1087
01:07:51,191 --> 01:07:52,510
So I actually said,

1088
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:57,250
I actually went into the open house and
looked at it and was thinking the entire

1089
01:07:57,251 --> 01:08:02,251
time that if I had gotten out of
the car and thrown the first punch,

1090
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:05,390
even if I won the fight,
whatever downpayment,

1091
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,450
I woulda had to actually
get a fucking house,

1092
01:08:07,451 --> 01:08:11,560
which is something I'd like to do at some
point in my life that would have been

1093
01:08:11,561 --> 01:08:12,610
out the fucking window.

1094
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:18,650
And as much as it calmed me down today,
it still hasn't made me feel any better.

1095
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:21,860
And, uh, this, this,

1096
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:26,890
this should be like some
sort of gentleman's agreement
of I'm not going to sue

1097
01:08:27,471 --> 01:08:30,590
you in. My friends aren't going to
jump in, maybe even go down to the gym.

1098
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:34,580
You just put the gloves on so
he can just get it out of you.

1099
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:40,100
Because I got to admit it's still
fucking in me. And Ah, I've been,

1100
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:44,780
ah, the, ah, this is how much of a
contents made me and I'm trying to get,

1101
01:08:44,781 --> 01:08:48,440
I'm trying to get rid of this, this,
this little ball of hate that is in me.

1102
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:52,150
When I was, I looked at the
one house, right? And I've,

1103
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:56,750
and I felt better and I'm like, I still
need to look at another house because,

1104
01:08:56,780 --> 01:09:01,000
you know, I'm gonna, I'm
still in a bad mood. And, um,

1105
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,970
I was driving up the street
as I'm driving up the street.

1106
01:09:04,971 --> 01:09:07,960
This white lady is like waving her
hands, like telling me to stop. She,

1107
01:09:08,070 --> 01:09:12,920
she's gives no uniform, no
uniform on or nothing. So I kinda,

1108
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:13,351
you know,
I'm,

1109
01:09:13,351 --> 01:09:16,700
I'm deliberately driving pastor a little
bit before I slowed down cause I'm a

1110
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:19,250
fucking control freak and I like
people telling me what to do.

1111
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:23,900
So she comes up to my window
and I go, what? And she's like,

1112
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:27,140
I'm a tree fell on the road around the
corner. I just didn't want you to hit it.

1113
01:09:27,141 --> 01:09:31,490
And I was just like, oh my God, I am
the biggest asshole ever. I really am.

1114
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:33,290
You don't if I'm really going
to be honest with myself,

1115
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:36,740
the whole fucking reason I had that
fight with that guy is because I'm in a

1116
01:09:36,741 --> 01:09:41,660
grumpy mood because the last seven out of
last eight weeks I've been on the road.

1117
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:46,130
All right there. All right. I
admit my fucking part of it.

1118
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:50,000
Oh do you could have seen the
weather go is just standing there.

1119
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,190
They're fucking shark fin of a noses.

1120
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,510
Hibbs coming out from
those awful sunglasses.

1121
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:00,290
That's going to hurt me for
another couple of days. But, um,

1122
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:05,330
thank God I am a little bit older
and I actually know how my brain,

1123
01:10:05,331 --> 01:10:08,210
I'll tell you, that's what I've been
older is, is knowing how your brain works.

1124
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,430
Okay?
Because the moment is gone.

1125
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:13,340
So now I'm gonna do is just walk
around hate in this fucking guy.

1126
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:15,500
So what I have to do is every
time I think that I just,

1127
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:18,500
I just fucking think of something else.
Um,

1128
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:21,290
and I've been able to do it in my
apartment, but when I get in my car,

1129
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,280
it's like a Vietnam fucking flashback.

1130
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:27,710
So I'm just going to give myself
a week to get over it. And, uh,

1131
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:32,060
and that's it. All right, so there's a
story for you that took a nice 12 minutes.

1132
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:36,230
My fucking voice is killing me.
You know,

1133
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:40,700
I actually bought a book on how to
fucking use your voice properly on stage.

1134
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,450
I should really read it.
I do drink that throat coat.

1135
01:10:44,451 --> 01:10:49,040
Fucking a tea with honey.
Now that's how old I am.

1136
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:50,990
Um,

1137
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:53,930
what I really should be doing is giving
my voice arrest and shutting the fuck up

1138
01:10:53,931 --> 01:10:57,680
rather than yelling about some dude who
doesn't even matter in my fucking life.

1139
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:04,520
Ah. All right, let's
get on with the podcast.

1140
01:11:04,521 --> 01:11:07,250
So this is the Monday morning podcast.
Everybody, if you're new to this,

1141
01:11:07,251 --> 01:11:10,880
you're probably in some sort of a,
I don't know what you would,

1142
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:15,000
what mindset you would be in this
old ceiling fans dry out my throat.

1143
01:11:15,001 --> 01:11:16,920
That's what's going on.
Um,

1144
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:21,300
is this something really
intimidating about a ceiling fan?

1145
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,960
You ever not think that it's just going
to come flying off the fucking ceiling

1146
01:11:24,961 --> 01:11:29,370
and decapitate you? It's
unreal how it just stays. There

1147
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:35,280
are pumpkin seasonal, I didn't even get
back to that. I gotta get, I, you know,

1148
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,400
you know what happened last year is I
carved up a couple of them but I carved

1149
01:11:38,401 --> 01:11:40,980
them up too early and uh,

1150
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:45,870
they started to dry out and the
thing that I, I had carved in there,

1151
01:11:45,871 --> 01:11:49,040
this scary looking face and had
carved like a whole silhouette in the,

1152
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:52,950
in the background, you know what I mean?
It's like a carved out, like a big circle,

1153
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,451
three quarters of the way.

1154
01:11:54,451 --> 01:11:57,390
And then on the bottom I carved the
head into the bottom part of the circle.

1155
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:00,690
So then the candle was behind it and
fucking lift this thing up and it was

1156
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:05,040
awesome. But the weight
of the, uh, the face,

1157
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:08,310
considering it wasn't connected
to any other part of the Pumpkin,

1158
01:12:08,311 --> 01:12:12,780
it started to fall into the
hole. Is it dehydrated? And uh,

1159
01:12:12,781 --> 01:12:15,360
it really wasn't scary come Halloween.
It was just kind of sad.

1160
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:19,230
It looked like a defeated demon. Like
he's looking up in the air like, God,

1161
01:12:19,231 --> 01:12:22,980
what do I have to do to scare people?
Um,

1162
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:30,120
yeah. So anyways, I just came back
from the DC Improv, everybody and uh,

1163
01:12:30,121 --> 01:12:33,600
I want to thank everybody in Washington
DC and the surrounding area of Baltimore,

1164
01:12:33,601 --> 01:12:36,200
Richmond, Richmond, Virginia, Georgetown,

1165
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,010
whatever the hell you
came from West Virginia.

1166
01:12:38,011 --> 01:12:39,720
I just want to thank all
you guys for coming out.

1167
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,940
That was the greatest turnout I have
ever had to any stand up a weekend I've

1168
01:12:44,941 --> 01:12:47,250
ever had.
I actually had to add a show people.

1169
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:51,450
I did a second show on a
Thursday night and it's sold out.

1170
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:56,250
I did six sold out shows
and, uh, three days.

1171
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:59,580
And, um, had the time of my life

1172
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:02,910
ate at this restaurant.
Posh,

1173
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:08,510
got hooked up there by chef Chris is
fucking dude brought us out all his food.

1174
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:12,970
Want to thank him. Oh, it
was a great time, dude.

1175
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:16,620
You know what else I did? I actually,
we got a football to long fucking story.

1176
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:18,780
This is the Peter Pan Lifestyle.
I'm living it,

1177
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:23,070
which really gives me no excuse to get
mad at some guy in a green four door

1178
01:13:23,071 --> 01:13:25,920
sedan in the parking lot
of a goddamn diner. Right.

1179
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:31,320
I played football on a Friday
afternoon around two in the afternoon.

1180
01:13:31,321 --> 01:13:36,240
Like I was still in like the fifth
grade, you know, that she's fifth grade,

1181
01:13:36,241 --> 01:13:39,090
be more around four and it'd be blowing
off my homework or whatever, you know,

1182
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:45,030
and uh, ended up spraining my
finger cause uh, Paul Versey,

1183
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:47,940
the comedian who opened up for me.
It was, we were so fucking hilarious.

1184
01:13:47,941 --> 01:13:50,460
Like typical, you know, he's
still a younger guy, but you know,

1185
01:13:50,461 --> 01:13:55,260
I'm 41 so I'm stretching and
doing all this shit and uh,

1186
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:58,740
we're sitting there lying to ourselves,
but we could still play.

1187
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:02,550
That was a great pair, dude. You hit me
right in stride. Get me right in stride.

1188
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:05,910
He's getting all excited that he's
hitting a 41 year old and stride,

1189
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:07,980
like the defensive back couldn't catch up

1190
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:16,570
in fucking run the thing back for
six the other way. But uh, Nah man,

1191
01:14:16,571 --> 01:14:17,404
I was psyched.

1192
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:22,300
I was really impressed with how fast I
can still run and I'm gonna tell you why.

1193
01:14:22,301 --> 01:14:27,301
It's because I've kept myself in shape
and I stretch on a regular basis for all

1194
01:14:27,641 --> 01:14:31,150
you guys out there. As you get older, you
have a look at older guys and you like,

1195
01:14:31,151 --> 01:14:35,410
you just look at him and you get to an
age at some point where you can't fucking

1196
01:14:35,411 --> 01:14:39,220
run anymore and it blows your
mind when you're young. Like,

1197
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,540
why can't you run anymore?

1198
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:45,541
You just send them that brain signal
to your legs to run and is to promise

1199
01:14:46,121 --> 01:14:50,170
because it hurts. I mean, look,
this, this part of it is, yeah,

1200
01:14:50,171 --> 01:14:52,690
you walked on your legs, your
feet, and you use your body,

1201
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,900
the wear and tear 40 years.
But I swear to God,

1202
01:14:55,901 --> 01:14:59,580
it seems like 80% of it is not stretching.
If you don't stretch,

1203
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:04,300
you get atrophy and your muscles shrivel
up. And that's when you literally,

1204
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:07,240
somebody throws you a ball and it's a
little out of your reach and you go to

1205
01:15:07,241 --> 01:15:11,080
reach for it and all of a sudden you
fucking your kidneys up by where your

1206
01:15:11,081 --> 01:15:12,460
fucking shoulder blade is.

1207
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:16,240
It's a kidney attached
attendance and a fucking knows.

1208
01:15:16,241 --> 01:15:19,790
You know what I'm trying to say? I went
from muscles and tendons to Oregon's, um,

1209
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:25,130
I'm telling you, uh, I,

1210
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:29,050
I have this power yoga tape that
I've been doing forever and forever.

1211
01:15:29,051 --> 01:15:32,590
My friends had been teasing me do,
that's gay. What are you doing yoga for?

1212
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:35,680
What are you trying to suck
your own Dick? Eh, right.

1213
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:41,470
All those fucks continue to eat and they
didn't stretch and I was never fast.

1214
01:15:41,471 --> 01:15:45,070
I could always catch,
he always had great hand eye coordination.

1215
01:15:45,071 --> 01:15:47,470
I could fucking catch anything.
I don't give a shit what it is.

1216
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:52,600
My thing is that there's just going to
be somebody in front of me because I was

1217
01:15:52,601 --> 01:15:56,320
never fast. So this is hilarious.
I was never fast. Okay.

1218
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:58,180
But I kept myself in shape.

1219
01:15:58,181 --> 01:16:01,480
And about seven or eight years ago
when I was in my early thirties,

1220
01:16:01,481 --> 01:16:05,530
I was playing pickup football and we've
been playing for about 20 minutes.

1221
01:16:05,531 --> 01:16:10,210
And for the first time in
my life, somebody on the
opposing team actually said,

1222
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,850
they said, hey, watch out
for Berger. He's fast.

1223
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:17,500
And I almost burst out laughing because
I was thinking of what a statement,

1224
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:21,820
what that was to the horrific shape that
they were in because I was slow when I

1225
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:25,720
should have been fast.
I ran like a 30 year old when I was 17.

1226
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:31,330
So when I'm 33, I got to be
running like I'm 45. Um, you know.

1227
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:35,680
So anyways, we had a great
time and uh, I got to tell you,

1228
01:16:35,681 --> 01:16:37,900
you know what I realized when I
was throwing that football around,

1229
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:41,650
and this is one of the sad things
about being an adult and getting

1230
01:16:41,651 --> 01:16:45,640
responsibility and not being able to
have a fight because you could get sued,

1231
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:49,360
is does a lot of other fun things
that you just stopped doing.

1232
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:52,090
Like throwing a football dean,

1233
01:16:52,091 --> 01:16:54,910
how much I love football and how
much I loved it when I was a kid.

1234
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:57,130
And do you know how long it's
been such I threw a football,

1235
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:58,270
I can't remember the last,

1236
01:16:58,271 --> 01:17:02,530
I think the last time I threw a football
was that day I was talking about when

1237
01:17:02,531 --> 01:17:05,680
they said get berries fast,
which was like 33. Like,

1238
01:17:05,681 --> 01:17:09,950
I honestly in the last eight years can
not remember ever throwing a football.

1239
01:17:09,951 --> 01:17:11,630
Do you know,
fucking tragic that is,

1240
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:17,130
we will out there running post
patterns. It's fucking, you know,

1241
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:17,991
cutting across the middle.

1242
01:17:17,991 --> 01:17:20,370
I was having the time of my
life until I sprained my finger.

1243
01:17:20,371 --> 01:17:21,390
But even then it was all right.

1244
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:25,650
Just say it looks like when a Elton
John's fingers ever see an Elton John

1245
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:28,170
Concert and he plays with those little
fat little sausage fingers he has.

1246
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,400
He always talks about it.

1247
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,040
He doesn't have piano playing fingers
cause he can't really reach that far.

1248
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:35,340
But he's still the shit cause he's
so gifted. That's what I have.

1249
01:17:35,341 --> 01:17:39,660
I have one Elton John Index
finger or Mario Batali.

1250
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,170
Anybody Watch the food
network and you watch when he,

1251
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:46,410
after he does the well
method making the pasta,

1252
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,530
which is something I
really want to fucking try,

1253
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:52,260
always want to try and
make my own homemade pasta.

1254
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:53,970
I really got into cooking for a minute.

1255
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:57,750
I used to watch that show Molto Mario
everyday because he seemed like the real

1256
01:17:57,751 --> 01:18:00,900
deal, you know? Not only
did he understand that dish,

1257
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:04,500
he had been to the country where it
bends it. You know, he'd been to Italy,

1258
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:08,950
hung around with the Italians and they
taught them how to fucking make this

1259
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:12,940
stuff after they gave them a ton of
shit for not knowing what he was doing.

1260
01:18:12,941 --> 01:18:16,360
He can explain the part of Italy that it
came from. It's just a tremendous show.

1261
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:18,700
And I liked that he
does in his own kitchen.

1262
01:18:18,701 --> 01:18:23,170
He just has like a couple of
friends over, you know? And uh,

1263
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:24,280
I don't know,

1264
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,880
I just looked at it and like a comedy
kind of way where he just seemed like a

1265
01:18:27,881 --> 01:18:31,330
comedian who's really a comedian.
Like they don't need props.

1266
01:18:31,331 --> 01:18:34,990
They don't need a catch phrase. He's just
standing there doing his shit. Right.

1267
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:39,340
As opposed to other shows where you got,
you know, like, uh, I was going say,

1268
01:18:39,341 --> 01:18:44,310
Emilio Estevez what the fuck's
that guy's Amro Lugosi you know,

1269
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:46,360
this is not about just how much
I got into the food network.

1270
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:51,130
I could actually tell how much happier
Emeril Lagasse was when he was doing

1271
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:55,750
essence of Emeril as opposed to being
in front of the crowd. You know,

1272
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:59,920
who doesn't like working in front of a,
of a live audience,

1273
01:18:59,921 --> 01:19:03,550
but you could see the sadness in his
face when the crowd just sits there and

1274
01:19:03,551 --> 01:19:05,380
then he has to do all that extra shit.

1275
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:07,720
All of a sudden you got to
turn it into like, you know,

1276
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:14,040
I've got some butter and everybody's like
start screaming where I essence Amroy

1277
01:19:14,191 --> 01:19:17,800
you can just sit down and cook the dish
and not have to sit there throwing flour

1278
01:19:17,801 --> 01:19:21,250
over his shoulder and sugar
into the eyes of his drummer.

1279
01:19:21,251 --> 01:19:25,510
He's got a fucking drummer on a
goddamn cooking show. Um, so anyways,

1280
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,280
that's what I'm saying. Like
look, if you love football,

1281
01:19:27,281 --> 01:19:29,470
you haven't played in a while.
Stretch out and throw the ball around.

1282
01:19:29,471 --> 01:19:33,220
I'm telling you, you got to do it. Do it
before you fucking team plays on Sunday.

1283
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,540
That's one of those silent silent
competitions I have with with other guys.

1284
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:37,871
You know,

1285
01:19:37,871 --> 01:19:41,470
you're going to a sports bar and you
just look at the horror that is a sports

1286
01:19:41,471 --> 01:19:45,250
bar, a complete artist shape, fat fucks,

1287
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:50,620
the bloated alcohol and wings face that
you see every time you turn around.

1288
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:53,920
You know, I always go, I'm going to have
to, every time I go to a sports bar,

1289
01:19:53,921 --> 01:19:57,850
like I always try to work out before
I go there, you know, burn off,

1290
01:19:57,851 --> 01:19:58,900
whatever the fuck I'm
going to eat in there.

1291
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:00,820
Cause I don't want to look at like
those people that are in there.

1292
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,610
So that's what I'm saying. There's a
fun way. If you hate the fucking gym,

1293
01:20:03,611 --> 01:20:07,860
go get a God damn football dude.
I felt like I was in fifth grade.

1294
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:11,700
Like when I was done, I was looking for
my book bag. You know, it was ridiculous.

1295
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:14,900
Of course, two hours later, I
did not feel like a fifth grader.

1296
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:18,720
I felt like I was 48, but it
was fun nonetheless. All right,

1297
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:23,220
so let's get on with the podcast,
uh, questions and whatnot. Hey,

1298
01:20:23,221 --> 01:20:26,760
here's a great thing. If any,
anybody else has like a, um,

1299
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:32,070
had a confrontation, like what
I had. And for whatever reason,

1300
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,470
you didn't have the fight.
And you know,

1301
01:20:34,471 --> 01:20:37,000
it was funny when I was
saying I was so mad and I say,

1302
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:39,930
I was telling Nia I have to go back there.
When I was dropping her up,

1303
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:44,100
dropping her off, she goes, just
go back and slash his tires,

1304
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:51,570
which really took me back to the whole
revenge thing of how damaging somebody's

1305
01:20:51,571 --> 01:20:54,720
car. I literally said that too.
I go, that's the bitch move.

1306
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:58,260
I could slash chuck Norris is tires.

1307
01:20:58,261 --> 01:21:01,530
If he wasn't standing
there and ruin his day,

1308
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:06,240
now go back and fight the
guy or just fucking or,

1309
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:07,253
or don't

1310
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:13,740
go back and rip his antenna off like a
fucking pussy fight or don't fight. Oh,

1311
01:21:13,741 --> 01:21:16,230
take a walk around a lake
and calm yourself down.

1312
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:20,190
It admit to yourself that you're 41 years
old and you probably had a fucking 50

1313
01:21:20,191 --> 01:21:23,090
50 chance of losing the
thing to begin with. Oh,

1314
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:25,980
and I would have been on the ground with
that gravel embedded in the side of my

1315
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:29,880
face. You know, just taking
a boat shoe to the head.

1316
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:36,270
He didn't have on boat shoes. He wasn't
that bad. All right. Okay. Here we go.

1317
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:39,390
Here's a podcast. All right? Last week
I was telling you guys about how I have,

1318
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:43,380
I discovered the magic
word when complaining, um,

1319
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,970
to corporations that the
word is a unacceptable.

1320
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:49,260
All right?

1321
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:52,770
And just in case you guys feel that
I don't know what I'm talking about,

1322
01:21:52,771 --> 01:21:57,480
which is exactly what you should
feel because I am a moron. Um,

1323
01:21:58,590 --> 01:22:03,000
I got this great email from somebody
who, who the fuck is it? God Damn it.

1324
01:22:03,010 --> 01:22:06,960
I thought I had it. You
know what? I am the worst.

1325
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:11,190
Why do you guys listen to this
fucking podcast? No, no, no. I know.

1326
01:22:11,191 --> 01:22:14,470
I put my hand right fucking here in front
of me. All right. It's back on though.

1327
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:18,060
It's back on track. I actually
got, I actually got a,

1328
01:22:18,061 --> 01:22:21,930
an email from somebody who answers the
phones for one of those big corporations.

1329
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:22,390
All right?

1330
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:25,020
And if you want to learn how to do
what I explained it last in last week's

1331
01:22:25,021 --> 01:22:29,910
podcast, at least my story of how I went
about, um, getting my money back. So,

1332
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,900
so this guy sends me this
really nice. Larry says, uh,

1333
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:37,060
just want to say your podcasts are
fucking hilarious. Keep them coming. Uh,

1334
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:42,030
you should do a show in Omaha
sometime. Uh, that's a rough one, dude.

1335
01:22:42,031 --> 01:22:46,020
Omaha's or rough one. I will
at some point. All right.

1336
01:22:46,021 --> 01:22:47,730
I just have to get psyched up for that.

1337
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:50,220
The 28 planes I'm going to
have to take to get there.

1338
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:52,590
That's one of those like fucking states.

1339
01:22:52,591 --> 01:22:57,420
You have to fly past it to
fly into a hub city, you know,

1340
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,770
to finally get there. You know, I'm
flying to Omaha via fucking Tampa.

1341
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,070
What? All right. Um, here we go, Bill. Um,

1342
01:23:06,071 --> 01:23:09,910
also I wanted to say when dealing
with corporations using the word,

1343
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:12,460
the unacceptable line does work.

1344
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:16,840
I am a support agent for a well
known financial company company.

1345
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:21,310
If someone is continually a pain in the
ass about something and are persistent

1346
01:23:21,311 --> 01:23:26,050
about it, eventually they will
get their way. You guys hear that?

1347
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:29,110
I know it's morning. For some of you, you
stir in your coffee. Did you hear that?

1348
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:33,250
If someone is continually a pain in the
ass about something and are persistent

1349
01:23:33,251 --> 01:23:35,350
about it,
eventually they will get their way.

1350
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:38,260
Usually as a customer
service representative,

1351
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:42,280
we are encouraged to try and steer
the conversation away from the,

1352
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:46,540
from things like credits and
try to offer other suggestions.

1353
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,840
And that's the part where you get mad
because you're not getting what you want.

1354
01:23:49,841 --> 01:23:52,530
But that's why you have to keep you
cool. All right. So anyways, he says, uh,

1355
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:57,760
basically we try to bullshit them a
little and try and put them at ease.

1356
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:02,530
Yeah. Lie to them. Okay. But if
a customer is still not happy,

1357
01:24:02,531 --> 01:24:06,400
we will give a credit or whatever
you want. As long as it's reasonable,

1358
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:10,810
that's fair. Um, just to get
you off the phone. However,

1359
01:24:10,811 --> 01:24:14,890
if you start using profanity,
um, while on the phone call,

1360
01:24:14,891 --> 01:24:18,910
chances are we will try and find ways not
to help you or disconnect the call all

1361
01:24:18,911 --> 01:24:21,280
together.
Regardless of rules and procedures,

1362
01:24:21,281 --> 01:24:25,270
representatives do have the ability
to make judgment calls. Basically,

1363
01:24:25,271 --> 01:24:27,430
if you call the customer
service Rep Account,

1364
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,840
I will guarantee you they will not help
you stick to using the unacceptable line.

1365
01:24:31,841 --> 01:24:36,730
Don't give up and you eventually will
get what you want. You see that people,

1366
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:38,643
there you go.

1367
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:44,140
Now you have the information you need
from a professional rather than some moron

1368
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:48,970
comedian who almost got in a fight
outside of a pancake house. Um,

1369
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:54,070
I actually want another one this week.
All right?

1370
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:58,780
I ordered the NHL package to center
ice package and ask them, hey, now,

1371
01:24:58,781 --> 01:25:02,800
so I says to the guy, I just sound
like I was doing fucking Vaudeville.

1372
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:05,500
So I asked the guy, I says, hey buddy,

1373
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:11,770
what's with the chicken
soup? Um, I asked, I asked,

1374
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:16,030
I asked the lady when I ordered it,
does it come with the NHL Channel?

1375
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:21,310
And she says, hold on, let
me check. And she says, why?
Yes, yes it does. And I said,

1376
01:25:21,311 --> 01:25:23,350
Dan, you know what? You
got yourself a deal.

1377
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:28,210
I will take the center ice package with
the NHL channel. So she says, okay,

1378
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:32,500
all right. So the boot, the fucking thing
up. And the next day, Lo and behold,

1379
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:37,820
I don't have the NHL channel. So I call
up and what do they say to me? They say,

1380
01:25:37,821 --> 01:25:41,950
hey, hello sir, what can I do for you?
And I tell them I deal. And I said, oh,

1381
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:44,080
we actually, she in her notes, she left,

1382
01:25:44,081 --> 01:25:48,970
she said that you hung up before the call
was over. And I was like, no, I didn't.

1383
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:52,120
I immediately got pissed who are kind of
fucked his phone call up a little bit.

1384
01:25:52,121 --> 01:25:55,290
In the beginning I went the [inaudible]
route, but I didn't say it, but then I,

1385
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:59,110
I got it back on track. I was like,
no, I didn't. And you guys like, well,

1386
01:25:59,111 --> 01:26:03,950
according to her notes you did. And I
was like, well, according to my memory,

1387
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:08,510
uh, I was on the phone call and you
weren't okay, so now what? I'm like,

1388
01:26:08,511 --> 01:26:11,210
so now what?
She gets to just say something happened,

1389
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:16,430
she writes it down to cover her
ass, you know, and you know,

1390
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:17,570
so that's when I kinda got mad.

1391
01:26:17,571 --> 01:26:19,730
But then I was able to bring
it back and just say, look,

1392
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:24,740
the conversation ended with her going,
thank you very much.

1393
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:26,750
Is there anything else I can
help you with? What do you think?

1394
01:26:26,751 --> 01:26:30,350
I was halfway through ordering it and she
was gone. Hang on a second sir. Hang on.

1395
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:34,040
I was like, too late. Goodbye.
I didn't do that. All right.

1396
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:39,020
And the guy's like, well, I have to
charge you $5 a month for this channel.

1397
01:26:39,021 --> 01:26:42,350
This is, this is like the zero tolerance
I have. I am arguing $5 a month,

1398
01:26:42,351 --> 01:26:45,620
which is going to be 30 bucks over
the course of the six month season.

1399
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:49,940
And I'm like, no, I'm not paying that.
Okay. And the guy goes, why? I can't.

1400
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,340
I can't give it to you. I don't
know what to do. I go, all right,

1401
01:26:52,341 --> 01:26:56,420
well then cancel the center ice package.
And the guy goes, I can't do that. I go,

1402
01:26:56,421 --> 01:26:57,830
what do you mean you can't do that?
And he goes,

1403
01:26:57,831 --> 01:27:00,590
you can't cancel it once you order it.
I go,

1404
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:03,500
see you mean to tell me
that I ordered something?

1405
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:06,500
It's in what you told me it was,

1406
01:27:06,501 --> 01:27:10,340
it isn't and now I can't cancel it
and you can't rectify the situation.

1407
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:15,230
Is that any way to buy a business, run a
business? And the guy's like, whoa. I go,

1408
01:27:15,231 --> 01:27:16,011
that's unacceptable.

1409
01:27:16,011 --> 01:27:19,400
I want to talk to somebody else so
I get this next guy on the phone.

1410
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:22,940
At this point, I finally calmed down
and I was able to use that line, sir,

1411
01:27:22,941 --> 01:27:26,300
I understand you. You know you don't make
the rules. I know this wasn't your call,

1412
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:29,780
but this was the scenario. Okay,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1413
01:27:29,781 --> 01:27:32,390
If he can't give me the channel for free,
like I told him,

1414
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:36,140
you know that it came with the package,
I would like to cancel center rice.

1415
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:39,830
The guy goes, well, I can't do either
one of those, but this is what I can do.

1416
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:45,410
Your DVR costs you 10 bucks a month.
How about I give you three free months,

1417
01:27:45,411 --> 01:27:50,060
a DVR that'll be 30 bucks discount
and the whole thing will be a wash.

1418
01:27:50,061 --> 01:27:53,400
And I was like, you know what?
You got yourself a deal. Bam.

1419
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:56,040
Two one I'll turn it.
Yeah.

1420
01:27:56,100 --> 01:28:00,930
This franchise around a perennial losing
franchise and just like the fucking

1421
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:05,490
saints, I am now a factor.
I am now a fucking factor.

1422
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:06,870
So,

1423
01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:11,870
and the last two weeks I got 25 buck
dollars back and I got $30 back.

1424
01:28:12,121 --> 01:28:13,710
I am plus 55.

1425
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:19,190
I'm like a Dj that the mush and a a
Bronx tale and I'm finally winning.

1426
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:22,710
Um, plus fee. I say myself. 55 bucks.

1427
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:26,880
Do you know how many tube socks
you can buy with 55 bucks?

1428
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:29,010
It's a lot of fucking socks.

1429
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:32,280
How great do your feet feel when
you got a new pair of socks?

1430
01:28:32,281 --> 01:28:36,270
You know I never whistled.
The only time I ever whistle.

1431
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:38,790
Do you ever see me whistle and you know
I've got a brand new pair of fucking

1432
01:28:38,791 --> 01:28:43,590
dress socks at tube socks on your feet
take tingle in that right Cleo? Huh?

1433
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:44,453
They tingle.

1434
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:47,940
I was hoping she was
going to make the noise.

1435
01:28:47,941 --> 01:28:49,980
Let me see if I can get her mom this week.
You guys haven't heard in a while?

1436
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:51,933
Yeah,

1437
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:58,490
she too busy sniffing the
microphone. Um, anyways. All right,

1438
01:28:58,491 --> 01:29:01,380
so let's get on with the fucking questions
here because I got to start wrapping

1439
01:29:01,381 --> 01:29:04,860
this up. I'm almost done here. Um, say,
you know what? I feel great right now.

1440
01:29:04,861 --> 01:29:07,950
I feel great. I told that fucking
story about the guy at the diner.

1441
01:29:07,951 --> 01:29:10,050
I got to laugh at it.
I got to laugh at myself.

1442
01:29:10,051 --> 01:29:12,840
I got to be honest that chances are he
probably would have lost the fucking

1443
01:29:12,841 --> 01:29:16,980
fight. You know? That's why
I stand up is a great thing.

1444
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:22,320
It's a great fucking thing. You get to
make a complete ass out of yourself.

1445
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,710
Fill like a Douche, and then laugh about
it and then you feel better. All right.

1446
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:28,940
Somebody needs advice.
All right. Hey Bill. Ah,

1447
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:31,860
I've got a couple questions and comments
as stories above bar and went out with

1448
01:29:31,861 --> 01:29:35,910
this girl last year before I went to the
prom with her. It wasn't really a date,

1449
01:29:35,911 --> 01:29:38,700
but it was just a chance to go
out with her and get to know,

1450
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:40,950
to get to know her before we went to prom.

1451
01:29:41,070 --> 01:29:44,550
We ended up having a great time
that evening in it and at the prom.

1452
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:48,360
I proceeded to Facebook her a bottle a
week later and asked her if she wanted to

1453
01:29:48,361 --> 01:29:51,720
go out again. She basically, she
said she would like to go out again,

1454
01:29:51,721 --> 01:29:56,090
but not in a romantic
way. Bombbomb, Boehm boom.

1455
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:01,230
All right. Tonight he took that emotional
kick in the chest. After hearing this,

1456
01:30:01,231 --> 01:30:03,690
I backed off and didn't
pursue her for a month or so.

1457
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:07,070
In this time she got a boyfriend,
booboo Badu,

1458
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:13,110
which honestly pissed me the fuck
off as well. It should have. Uh,

1459
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:15,930
I had to talk to her.
Um,

1460
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:19,890
I had talked to her for about a week
before she went out with this guy and when

1461
01:30:19,891 --> 01:30:21,390
they finally were officially dating,

1462
01:30:21,391 --> 01:30:25,470
I told her I didn't want to cause
trouble and then I didn't want to bother.

1463
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,580
She replied by saying that she,

1464
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:31,500
she said she didn't want to go out again
with me is because she was confused

1465
01:30:31,501 --> 01:30:36,440
about how I felt and seen when we first
went out before prom that I wasn't

1466
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:40,740
interested. Isn't that funny? After she
said, let's just go out and be friends,

1467
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,310
right. Didn't she? Did I already
forget the first part of this?

1468
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:47,370
We saw each other maybe two or
three times again through birthdays,

1469
01:30:47,371 --> 01:30:51,180
graduation parties until I went off to
college and she went back to high school.

1470
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:54,990
I am now a freshman in college and have
and have made no friends on account of

1471
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:58,440
my horrific people skills. I feel
like I should go after college girls,

1472
01:30:58,441 --> 01:31:02,010
but I can't stop thinking about the high
school girl and feel like she is light

1473
01:31:02,011 --> 01:31:04,440
years ahead of these big
titted shallow college girls.

1474
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:07,650
I also feel like she's the first girl
that I ever felt comfortable hanging out

1475
01:31:07,651 --> 01:31:10,730
with, although she seems like
she would be a hard girl too,

1476
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,450
to woo as she is really intelligent and
I am still am unsure if she likes me at

1477
01:31:15,451 --> 01:31:16,284
all.

1478
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:19,680
I was wondering what you think and if you
have any tips on how to really impress

1479
01:31:19,681 --> 01:31:23,640
girls besides the cliche confidence
or expensive shit. All right, dude.

1480
01:31:23,641 --> 01:31:27,840
You said something back here that really
just rang a bell way saying we use two

1481
01:31:27,841 --> 01:31:31,650
or three, two. I am okay. This
sentence right here, dude.

1482
01:31:31,651 --> 01:31:34,770
I am now a freshman in college and
have made no friends on account of my

1483
01:31:34,771 --> 01:31:39,540
horrific people skills. All
right, dude, that's right there.

1484
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:42,750
That's the money right there. That's
what you need to work on. All right.

1485
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:45,780
Through this girl, still in fucking
high school. You're off at college.

1486
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:48,960
You know what I mean? You are
college. You are in college.

1487
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:50,040
You're living at college.

1488
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:55,140
That is the ultimate fucking
nightclub for the next four years.

1489
01:31:55,650 --> 01:32:00,430
It's the greatest nightclub of all
fucking time is living at college.

1490
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:04,000
There's just women everywhere.
That Ron, every fucking floor,

1491
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:06,370
they're in every goddamn class.
You don't even have to, you know,

1492
01:32:06,371 --> 01:32:09,400
you don't have to walk into a nightclub
like, hey baby, what's you signed?

1493
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:13,900
Did somebody steal the lights out of
this guy and put them in your eyes?

1494
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:18,010
Right? You don't have to come up with
stupid shit like that. You have a,

1495
01:32:18,011 --> 01:32:22,510
you know what I always find it's easy
to pick up women when you're both,

1496
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:25,870
there's a reason that both of
you are there. Like at the gym,

1497
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:30,700
you're both there to work out. You're on
a train. You're both going home. You know,

1498
01:32:30,701 --> 01:32:34,000
they don't have their guard up as much
as when they go into the fucking Texas

1499
01:32:34,001 --> 01:32:37,810
chainsaw massacre fucking meat locker.
That is a Goddamn

1500
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:42,760
nightclub. All right? So this is
what you need to do. All right.

1501
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:47,710
I think right now you're saying like
you just said that all basically all

1502
01:32:47,711 --> 01:32:50,470
college girls are big titted and shallow.

1503
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:54,640
And I think a lot of it has to
do with kind of your, your um,

1504
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:56,650
your,

1505
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:59,280
your hopeless feeling right now that
you don't know how to talk to people and

1506
01:32:59,281 --> 01:33:00,610
you don't know how to get things going.
Okay?

1507
01:33:00,611 --> 01:33:03,360
That's part of being a freshman
is supposed to seem like a,

1508
01:33:03,361 --> 01:33:05,350
a bigger universe than you can handle.

1509
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:09,250
But what you need to do is you need to
work on your horrific people skills,

1510
01:33:09,570 --> 01:33:13,540
all right? And it is a skill
that you can work on, all right?

1511
01:33:13,541 --> 01:33:14,800
Just like catching a football.

1512
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:17,260
I'm never going to be able to
catch a football like Jerry Rice,

1513
01:33:17,261 --> 01:33:20,500
but if I fucking do it enough times,
I can catch the fucking thing, right?

1514
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:24,610
Maybe imitate somebody who's
end zone dance, but you're
going to get in the game.

1515
01:33:24,611 --> 01:33:29,611
So what you need to do is understand that
you kind of putting that girl up on a

1516
01:33:29,651 --> 01:33:33,640
pedestal, you don't really
know her. And I think the, the,

1517
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:37,060
the comfort of kind of already
having your foot in the door,

1518
01:33:37,061 --> 01:33:38,500
I bet you are a lot more comfortable.

1519
01:33:38,501 --> 01:33:40,600
I bet you were real comfortable with
the fact that you just kind of being

1520
01:33:40,601 --> 01:33:42,340
friends and the pressure was,
was,

1521
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:46,750
was kind of taken off the whole prom
and that type of thing. You're, you're,

1522
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:50,440
you know, you're shy, so you take
like baby steps, you know what I mean?

1523
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:54,130
Instead of taking the big step and trying
to grab her titty on the first date.

1524
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:57,640
I'm joking, but you know what I mean?
So this is what I would do if I was you.

1525
01:33:57,641 --> 01:34:00,050
Seriously, I'm kind of fucking around
here, but I know this is like a,

1526
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:02,800
a serious subject for you.
So this is all seriousness.

1527
01:34:02,801 --> 01:34:07,801
Just what you gotta do is just you gotta
you gotta Force yourself out of your

1528
01:34:08,531 --> 01:34:12,520
shell, you know, I mean,
if you say hello to a girl,

1529
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:14,890
she's not going to punch
you in the face or whatever.

1530
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:18,250
Just really write down on a
piece of paper, what's, what the,

1531
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:22,570
the humiliation or whatever, the fear you
have, what you think's going to happen.

1532
01:34:22,571 --> 01:34:24,910
I'm telling you, a lot of times when
you do that and you actually read it,

1533
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:28,450
you realize how ridiculous it is and um,

1534
01:34:29,710 --> 01:34:30,710
I'm telling you,
you,

1535
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,340
they're never going to be better
looking than when they're in college.

1536
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:35,620
All you guys, you're at your, you fucking,

1537
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:41,260
you write off your right after the
assembly line in Detroit, dude,

1538
01:34:41,261 --> 01:34:44,680
fuck that college girl. I mean, whatever,
God bless, I'm sure she's a nice person,

1539
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:49,510
but you got to get in the game and you've
got to start a crushing ass as they

1540
01:34:49,511 --> 01:34:53,680
say in fucking old school. That's what you
should be doing there. And, uh, you know,

1541
01:34:53,681 --> 01:34:57,830
go out with as many girls as you can see
what you like and mentally becoming up

1542
01:34:57,831 --> 01:35:01,490
with the list as far as what's the kind
of girl you eventually want to stay with.

1543
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:05,840
And in the meantime, you bang a
couple of big titted shallow girls.

1544
01:35:05,841 --> 01:35:07,130
You always wear a condom.

1545
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:12,410
Unacceptable not to wear one dude
had a fucking worth it. And uh,

1546
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,470
you know,
then you got your stories,

1547
01:35:16,130 --> 01:35:19,340
then you got your fucking stories
and when you get married, you know,

1548
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:23,270
and he'd go down to the Dunkin donuts
and you want to bang the girl behind the

1549
01:35:23,271 --> 01:35:27,950
counter, you know, the temptation won't
be as great because you're fucked.

1550
01:35:27,951 --> 01:35:32,770
All those big titted whores at college.
All right, so psych yourself up, dude.

1551
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:35,420
Even tell even like, you know, if
you've got some friends there at school,

1552
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:39,710
just be open a bottle of God. And I got
it. I got no game with girls. Just say it,

1553
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:44,540
get it out there. I got no game with
girls. Come on, help me out. You know,

1554
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:48,830
be a wing man, do something. I got to
get fucking laid. Just get it out there.

1555
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:52,340
I'll tell you as much as cock
block and assholes as guys can be,

1556
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:54,440
when someone's open and
honest about like that.

1557
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:56,120
If I have some guy ever said that to me,

1558
01:35:56,121 --> 01:35:59,690
there's no fucking way I wouldn't try
to help him out. So you'll be all right.

1559
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:02,300
Plus it's your first
semester, so you're, you're,

1560
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:05,120
you're making everything bigger than
it is. All right, so there you go.

1561
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:08,810
Let's your missing get out of your
shell and forget about that girl. Okay.

1562
01:36:08,811 --> 01:36:10,610
And then, you know what,
after this, you know,

1563
01:36:10,611 --> 01:36:13,430
your first two semesters you're going to
come home with a little bit of swagger.

1564
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:15,830
You might be able to bang
that broad are back, uh,

1565
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:19,040
when she's done with her little
fucking pottery class. You never know.

1566
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:21,230
Might come all full circle.
All right,

1567
01:36:21,231 --> 01:36:24,290
I only got time for a couple
more questions then I got
to get going here. Um,

1568
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:28,580
Oh, before I get going,
why don't I just do this?

1569
01:36:28,581 --> 01:36:32,210
I'll save the questions till next week or
maybe I'll read a couple of quick ones.

1570
01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:36,830
Uh, just to let you know, these are
my upcoming gigs for November. Um,

1571
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:41,180
November 6th,
six [inaudible] 2009.

1572
01:36:41,181 --> 01:36:45,650
I'm going to be a town hall in New York
City. People tickets are going fast.

1573
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:50,240
All right. And if you act now, I will
throw in a bill. Burke can opener. No,

1574
01:36:50,241 --> 01:36:53,660
seriously.
It's 1300 seat theater.

1575
01:36:53,661 --> 01:36:58,661
And last I heard we already
sold a thousand and that
was a couple of weeks ago

1576
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:04,640
and um, I just had a flashback
to that Chappelle show. Shit,

1577
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:07,100
a sketch, uh, and word that was weeks ago.

1578
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:10,730
Remember that you slapped me in the face.
He said that was weeks ago.

1579
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:14,240
It's one of the greatest
lines of all time. Um,

1580
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:16,731
all right,

1581
01:37:16,731 --> 01:37:20,660
I'm going to be at the town hall in New
York City and the next day I don't have

1582
01:37:20,661 --> 01:37:22,940
it on my website. November 7th, 2009,

1583
01:37:22,941 --> 01:37:25,070
I'm going to be at Boston
at a guidance Serena,

1584
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:29,270
wherever the Bu terriers play doing the
Denis leary comics come home the 15th

1585
01:37:29,271 --> 01:37:31,040
anniversary.
It's going to be great.

1586
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:34,700
Going to get to see a bunch
of friends of mine. Um,

1587
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:40,580
what else do I got? The improv in
Tempe, Arizona. The 19th, 20th and 21st.

1588
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:44,930
And then what else? That's
it. That's all for November.

1589
01:37:44,931 --> 01:37:47,840
Then I'm in Cleveland and in Seattle.
And then I do my special.

1590
01:37:47,841 --> 01:37:51,260
So please come out. Please continue
to support me. I really appreciate it.

1591
01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:55,280
And I didn't have time to
talk about Rick flair videos.

1592
01:37:55,281 --> 01:37:59,820
Somebody brought up the ric flair chop
and I had not watched Rick flare in years.

1593
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:02,400
And Dude,
if you really want to laugh,

1594
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,980
please go on youtube and just
watch ric flair. Hypen is matches.

1595
01:38:07,981 --> 01:38:12,780
It's one he said to that, he said there's
one of him holding up these loafers.

1596
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:16,620
Did I talk about this last week? I
can't remember. Look up ric flair.

1597
01:38:16,650 --> 01:38:17,850
Golden Spoon.

1598
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:21,840
There's another one where he tells this
guy that this fucking dude that his

1599
01:38:21,841 --> 01:38:26,610
shoes are worth more than his house.
Um, and then there's a great interview,

1600
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:29,520
you know, where he talks
about the movie, the wrestler,

1601
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:32,850
and he just seems like the
greatest guy ever. Like, you know,

1602
01:38:32,851 --> 01:38:35,730
his wrestling career is over. He's
not bitter. He's really thankful.

1603
01:38:35,731 --> 01:38:38,520
It's just like I,
once again,

1604
01:38:38,521 --> 01:38:42,390
I became an even bigger
ric flair fan watching it.

1605
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:46,980
It's ric f a flair.
Ric, the ric flair flop.

1606
01:38:47,610 --> 01:38:50,310
Ric flair chops,
ric flair flips.

1607
01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:54,480
He's got some of the greatest fucking
videos out there and you just realize what

1608
01:38:54,481 --> 01:38:58,510
a true legend.
What a fucking show man.

1609
01:38:58,511 --> 01:39:02,790
What a what a just a fucking unbelievable
entertainer athlete and everything

1610
01:39:02,791 --> 01:39:06,810
that this guy was in, the fucking things
that he put his body through. Man,

1611
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:10,140
I would love at some point that
guy's ever doing a signing anywhere.

1612
01:39:10,141 --> 01:39:14,370
I'm fucking all over it,
you know? Um, that's it.

1613
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:17,460
And that's it for this week.
I hope you guys enjoyed the podcast.

1614
01:39:17,461 --> 01:39:20,220
Sorry it was a little bit short.
I'll get to the questions next week.

1615
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:25,230
Hope all you guys have
a, a a good week. Um,

1616
01:39:26,490 --> 01:39:27,990
oh man,
there was another great question.

1617
01:39:27,991 --> 01:39:31,710
This guy was asking why is tranny
porn on heterosexual websites?

1618
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:36,300
Fuck, I wanted to answer that one too.
I got to get to that one next week.

1619
01:39:36,330 --> 01:39:37,910
All right there.
I'm leaving you on a cliffhanger.

1620
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,850
I'll talk to you guys next week.
Uh,

1621
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:42,000
that's it.
And don't take any shit

1622
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:06,173
[inaudible]

1623
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:14,793
some

1624
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:54,743
[inaudible]

1625
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:10,960
[inaudible].
