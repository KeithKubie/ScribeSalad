1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.030
Let's get the same issue that counted here sir.
Hair transplant too.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.310
So he's got a scar back there.

3
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.430
It's getting so like probably didn't tell the world as fucking Rad.

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.500
He's talked about it before.
No,
he has.
I know.

5
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.900
I would never say it if you didn't know.
I'll tell you that.

6
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.920
You know that it's the best fucking here piece is a pivot.

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.050
That shit I had no idea.

8
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.620
Do you know he used to play George Costanza on Seinfeld because he had the same

9
00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:26.630
fucking birds nest thing?
Well,
he had a bunch of surgeries I think.
Oh No.

10
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.000
That thing is dead meat up there.

11
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.390
Fucking thing is sewn into a skull.
I had no idea.
How dare you.

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.930
This is live.
Oh,
why people are listening.
I'm just saying he has fucking,

13
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.520
it's got great.
Good.
Sam's good,
good fake here.
Yes.
There's no problems.
No issues.

14
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.140
I'll probably do the same shit.
You know it's not the eighties though,

15
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:52.440
because in the eighties man,
if you had long hair and you were losing your hair,

16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.420
it was basically a death sentence.

17
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.480
Like last year I had knew I had a senior.
No,

18
00:00:58.481 --> 00:00:59.580
I can have a shaved head.

19
00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:04.560
Back then [inaudible] was the only guy we allowed him to shave his head because

20
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:06.190
he could sing so great.
We just said,
okay,

21
00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.910
well he was also allowed dressing really weird.
You know what,

22
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:10.380
this fucking biker leather,

23
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:15.381
she'll run like he dressed like a people in the gay community dress came out

24
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:18.930
with the leather and the motorcycles and all that shit and I'll show the cords.

25
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.730
All the kids thought that was heavy metal.

26
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.480
So I wore all that shit and I always thought in the back of my head I thought it

27
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:27.700
was weird that gay people were the same shit and no dudes do.

28
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.960
It must be a coincidence.

29
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:34.410
We've talked about that on the podcast before that Rob Halford con to whole

30
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:37.860
group of people and addressing gay.
How bout how bout um,

31
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.130
Freddy mercury was telling everybody he was super gay,

32
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:44.700
was not trying to hide it from anybody,
but I thought,
oh,
he's just a rock star.

33
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.400
His style is dope.
The band's name was queen,

34
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.150
but no one thought he was gay who just got on Shorstein one thought he was

35
00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:55.000
getting probably can to some people,
but the masses,
not the magic a while.

36
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.320
You know,
watch the movie,
like the documentary.
Yeah.
Everyone was like,
whoa.

37
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.720
We looked back and I'm like,
you fucking joking.
And everybody,
Elton John,

38
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.360
but forget all of them have a rock.
She's the craziest one.
Liberace.

39
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.420
They were like Liberace.

40
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.300
When are you going to find a nice woman and settled on that?
I keep looking.

41
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.070
I can't find them.
I don't know.

42
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.550
I think Freddie Mercury's a little bit,
was a little crazier than,
no,

43
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:24.190
Liberace broken.
The name of his band was queen.
That's true.
That's true.

44
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.290
But he's a lot of star rock star.

45
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.430
Liberace played a piano and came out and no fucking gold royals Royce and had

46
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:34.830
fucking pigeons coming out of his asshole and we're like,
no,
you know our mall.

47
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.880
Did we talk about this with girls of why there's such a disproportionate amount

48
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:41.730
of gay singers?
No.
Why?
Because who's dude?

49
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.510
Who's running the music business?
A lot of gay dudes.
And who's going to raise.

50
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.740
Is that true?
I don't know anything about that.
It's true.
It's no big deal.

51
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.480
But I run the music business.
Did you know that?
I didn't know that.

52
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.350
I didn't know that.
I know.
Who's who's,
who's showing up?
Who's down in the south?

53
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.810
La Reid's goose down to suck Dick.
Oh,
is that what quicker than a gay singer?

54
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.690
Wait a minute.
So you think the reason why there's so many gay singers are,

55
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:06.490
they're the ones who stuck to the decks to make to the top.

56
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.120
Because there's guys who are possible.
Jerry,
hold on,
but let me offer you,

57
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.980
let me gay.
Let me offer you an alternative explanation.
Y'All are straight.

58
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.400
Here's the AUC.
Hold on.
Here's the alternative explanation.
Gay People,

59
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.170
uh,
feel maligned.
They feel like they're left out.

60
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.120
They are sad because of this.
They live hard lives.

61
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:34.930
They maintain all of this emotion inside of them and they want to express it

62
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:38.140
some way.
And so they figured out a way to sing and to entertain.

63
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.040
And God damn with Jamie that showed me a picture of [inaudible] behind the

64
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:45.430
Candelabra is the best movie ever.
That's what I think.
I think you know,

65
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:48.850
they're bullied and you know they're depressed and they're the people that are

66
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:53.550
the most like pushed out in society.
Those are the ones who become comedians.

67
00:03:53.551 --> 00:03:54.910
It was the ones that become singers.

68
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.260
Those are the ones they become actors even cause they already shifting shit.

69
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.000
Something to get out and outlet.

70
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:05.860
Gay comedians think that many gang of them was a gang of it.
There's a couple.
No,

71
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:09.700
there's a gang of them.
There's a lot.
I know.
I know quite a few.

72
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.960
I'd say there's more gay actors that are seniors.

73
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.080
No seniors names named some few singers,
four or five.

74
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.410
But we got our dad to through a rob Halford still kicking Liberace died of

75
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:27.760
everything.
He had the full coffee help running around inside of them.

76
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:31.120
Just everything that Dick and plan all the dudes,

77
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:34.150
Joey Diaz has used to have a fucking bit and we played a little bit of it one

78
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:36.130
time on the podcast,
but it's not the best version of it.

79
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.360
Of beyond the Candelabra,
the fucking HBO movie with Matt Damon.

80
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:43.250
I loved that book.
And Michael Douglas Dude,
that show.

81
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.750
Do you remember Joey Diaz is bit,
yeah.
I taught in San Jose,

82
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.240
one of the best sets I've ever seen them do.
Uh,
in San Jose,

83
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:56.220
he had that whole bit down San Jose Improv show.
It was a,

84
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.000
he got rushed in monster,
please.
Still at monster.
But I mean,

85
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.740
that bit was just so funny.
That's such a funny.
